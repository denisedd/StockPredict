{"Headline": "Facebook Back on the Defensive, Now Over Data Deals With Device Makers", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook endured a new wave of criticism from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe on Monday after disclosures that the social media giant had allowed dozens of hardware manufacturers access to its trove of personal user data.The European authorities who last month enacted the world\u2019s strictest data privacy law said Facebook\u2019s sharing of personal information with cellphone makers and other manufacturers deserved further investigation. Germany\u2019s top privacy regulator, Johannes Caspar, called Facebook\u2019s partnerships \u201can unprecedented violation of privacy laws and user trust.\u201dAnd New York\u2019s attorney general, Barbara Underwood, said her office would expand its investigation of Facebook\u2019s data practices to include Facebook\u2019s sharing with hardware manufacturers.Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have repeatedly cited the 2015 restrictions to assure policymakers that no outside company could again harvest swaths of personal information without the explicit consent of users, as a contractor for Cambridge Analytica did in 2014. But Facebook officials said this week that they did not consider hardware partners to be outside companies, under the terms of Facebook\u2019s privacy policies and a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cFriends\u2019 information, like photos, was only accessible on devices when people made a decision to share their information with those friends,\u201d said the executive, Ime Archibong. \u201cWe are not aware of any abuse by these companies.\u201dBut some American lawmakers criticized Facebook\u2019s rationale and urged the F.T.C. to review whether the partnerships violated Facebook\u2019s promises to the regulator.\u201cI think this explanation is completely inadequate and potentially disingenuous,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee charged with consumer protection. \u201cI think Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony raises very serious and severe questions about Facebook\u2019s credibility.\u201dDavid Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House antitrust subcommittee, responded even more harshly.Senior Republicans also said the partnerships merited further review.Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said in a statement that The Times\u2019s reporting \u201craises important questions about transparency and potential privacy risks for Facebook users.\u201d Mr. Thune said the Senate Commerce Committee, of which he is chairman, would seek more information from Facebook.The F.T.C. is already investigating whether the access to friends\u2019 data that Facebook allowed until 2015 violated the terms of its earlier consent decree with the regulator. Rohit Chopra, a current F.T.C. commissioner, declined to comment on any specific company or investigation, but said he believed that the commission would act to enforce any agreements it had with companies.\u201cToo often, sensitive consumer data gets shared and copied over and over again to a point of no return,\u201d Mr. Chopra said. \u201cF.T.C. orders are not suggestions. When companies violate them, there can be serious consequences.\u201dDuring the event\u2019s keynote address, Craig Federighi, an Apple senior vice president, unveiled a new feature that will let Apple users more easily control what sort of information is shared with Facebook and other social media companies.Mr. Federighi chose to demonstrate the new feature onstage by showing Apple\u2019s Safari browser open to a webpage. Above it, a pop-up graphic appeared.\u201cDo you want to allow \u2018facebook.com\u2019 to use cookies and website data while browsing \u2018blabbermouth.net\u2019?\u201d the pop-up read.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Halts Aquila, Its Internet Drone Project", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has made splashy announcements over the last four years about building a fleet of solar-powered drones, with wingspans bigger than a Boeing 737, beaming internet access to people around the world who can\u2019t otherwise get online. (When you have as many users as Facebook, finding new ones requires some ingenuity.)On Wednesday, the ambitious effort was halted.But the drone initiative, Project Aquila, suffered several setbacks. One test flight ended with a crash landing and a broken wing. The initiative fell under the company\u2019s Internet.org project to expand internet access in underdeveloped parts of the world, a controversial effort that critics called a ploy by Facebook to get new users.Facebook said on Wednesday that as more aviation companies took an interest in developing drones, it became unnecessary to build its own. \u201cGiven these developments, we\u2019ve decided not to design or build our own aircraft any longer,\u201d said Yael Maguire, director of engineering at Facebook.Facebook was not alone in its efforts to use aircraft to offer internet access. Google abandoned its own efforts to build an internet drone, and the company is now experimenting with using high-altitude balloons to send internet signals, a project it has called Loon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Things to Do in New York: Shakespeare (Drunk or in the Park)", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWelcome to Summer!Happy June! Time is already flying, and, like we do every summer, we\u2019re doing our best to slow it down.Turns out waiting in a four-hour ticket line is an excellent way. Try it yourselves; the end result is worth it, as are our other suggestions for your free time this week.What\u2019s the Plan?Shakespeare in the Park reminds you to be grateful for New York. All year long, world-class theater is happening all over the city, and here it\u2019s available to anyone \u2014 free, performed by all-star actors, at an outdoor amphitheater, in the most enchanting urban park.First up this season, on stage until June 24, is \u201cOthello,\u201d featuring Corey Stoll, Alison Wright, Heather Lind and Chukwudi Iwuji in the title role.The play\u2019s main themes, racism and jealousy, have unfortunately allowed it to stand the test of time. First performed in 1604, here\u2019s a 2018 synopsis: selfish white guy will stop at nothing to get the job he wants, invoking bigotry around him to ruin lives and get his way. Meanwhile, a woman could clear it all up, but no one bothers to ask her.Well worth your time. So this year is the year you should do it \u2014 get to Central Park for Shakespeare.How to do so? Learn from our experience last week:Yes, that wait will be four hours (guess where I wrote last week\u2019s newsletter), but before you commit, ask the people around you if you\u2019re far up enough in the line to get tickets \u2014 they might be regulars. (Hint: If you\u2019re standing before the boulder, you should be set. And if you do get tickets, you can collect up to two.)With doors at 7:30 p.m., you could hit the in-house bar or cafe before joining the line that corresponds to your assigned seat. It\u2019ll be confusing, but staff will point you in the right direction. Curtain is at 8, so spend that extra time people watching, or make a friend in the next seat over. Nothing brings New Yorkers together like a shared experience, and you\u2019ve had a day.Note: Rain cancellations will be announced at 8 p.m. At that point, just see a movie.Before and After: RestaurantsBefore and After: BarsAnd Nearby Required ReadingWhat\u2019s the Plan?Start by taking the stairs up in a nondescript building in Midtown West, entering a library with a rectangular stage in the middle, and taking a seat along the perimeter.Amid niche challenges (\u201cRecite all of Shakespeare\u2019s titles in alphabetical order in a minute \u2014 or take a shot!\u201d) and haphazardly inserted rules (\u201cSpeak with a different accent every time you come onstage\u201d), the cast, one of whom will have started the show with four whiskey shots, speeds through a highly silly rendition of \u201cMacbeth.\u201d Some of it is in the original Shakespearean English, but there\u2019s also no shortage of dirty puns or current event references, keeping the performance engaging whether or not you\u2019ve experienced a play since high school.Clever as the actors may be, don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re a part of this club too. Not only can you drink alongside (order from a slip underneath your seat), but you\u2019ll also contribute to the show with group chants, or onstage as a human prop, if you\u2019re lucky.You may even bid your way into the role of King or Queen, a position that buys you caviar and champagne, as well as the ability to bestow more shots on the main character.Yes, it\u2019s more expensive than free, but at least you know you have a seat.Before and After: RestaurantsBefore and After: BarsAnd NearbyRequired ReadingExtra ExtraFrom You\u201cWhat I\u2019d love to see in the column is perhaps some sort of \u2018hidden gems\u2019 ...

{"Headline": "These Movies Haunted Me at the Human Rights Watch Festival", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the defining features of a good movie is its ability to whisk us away from our everyday lives.The annual festival, which in New York will play the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the IFC Center, screens in more than 20 cities worldwide. It presents titles that humanize victims of rights abuses in hopes of cultivating empathy and action.This year\u2019s edition rides the #MeToo wave: Twelve of the 15 selections are directed or co-directed by women, and several of them focus on women\u2019s rights. The others tackle issues that are just as pressing.Ms. Murad, spearheading a campaign to bring justice to fellow Yazidi victims, travels the world sharing her story in an effort to enlist global leaders to to her cause. But the work takes a toll on her; she relives the trauma every time someone apologetically asks her to describe what she endured. Even though Ms. Murad says she just wants to return to her past life as a \u201cvillage girl,\u201d she persists because she sees nothing being done about the plight of her community.Khatera, the 23-year-old woman at the center of \u201cA Thousand Girls Like Me,\u201d shows the same resoluteness. Khatera\u2019s father physically and sexually abused her for more than 13 years. After several aborted pregnancies, she is raising a daughter and a son.Despite several attempts to file charges, Khatera is only taken seriously when she tells her harrowing story on national television. Her father lands in prison awaiting trial, but she and her mother are still threatened by his relatives for \u201ctarnishing their reputation.\u201d The raw, heartbreaking film, directed by the Afghan filmmaker Sahra Mani, shows the double threat of a broken judicial system and ingrained oppressive and sexist attitudes. But the uplifting ending (no spoilers here) offers a glimmer of hope.In \u201cNaila and the Uprising,\u201d hope ebbs and flows. As the Israeli army imprisoned thousands of Palestinian men during the First Intifada, or uprising, in the late 1980s, Palestinian women stepped in. In traditional oral history fashion, \u201cNaila and the Uprising\u201d chronicles the network of female activists, who, through their grass-roots opposition to Israel, gained independence as equals in a patriarchal Palestinian society.One of their leaders was Naila Ayesh. After two detentions, a miscarriage and the birth of her son, Ms. Ayesh carried on to organize nonviolent demonstrations and strikes. But her husband\u2019s deportation to Egypt forced her to choose between defending her homeland and reuniting her family.The director Matthieu Rytz portrays both struggles with respect and intimacy. The Kiribati islands, captured with awe-inspiring drone footage, are sacred to the residents. Leaving your country behind means losing part of your identity.The dark and unsettling film \u201cThe Cleaners\u201d spotlights an issue that merits more attention than it\u2019s been given. The title refers to employees of a company in the Philippines who moderate content for internet behemoths like Google and Twitter. Five anonymous \u201ccleaners\u201d describe the appalling aspects of their jobs \u2014 like sifting through 25,000 images a day that can include repellent content like child pornography \u2014 while researchers and former social media executives emphasize the serious consequences of virtual lawlessness.Another timely topic is dissected in the closing film, \u201cThe Unafraid.\u201d Set in Georgia, it follows three Dreamers, high school seniors brought to the country illegally as children, but shielded, for now, by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. They jump through multiple hoops to move on to college, but they\u2019re ineligible for in-state tuition and cannot afford the full cost. That motivates them to take up activism and demand a change, but mounting obstacles get in their way. Their tenacity is inspiring; their struggles disheartening. When the students occasionally break down, we\u2019re reminded that beneath their hard exterior, they\u2019re still so young.Clayton Guyton, the founder of a community center, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Alex Long, are especially admirable. Both men encourage dialogue and understanding, and they work tirelessly to keep their neighbors out of trouble. The film eloquently grasps the pain and frustration they feel whenever another death or shooting is reported.Yet the harsher reality gets, the more they\u2019re determined to change it. The same could be said for the subjects of all the films here. Regardless of what it takes, they just want to live free.The Human Rights Watch Film Festival runs through June 21; ff.hrw.org/new-york.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Fixes the Worst P.R. Crises Imaginable. Then Came Harvey Weinstein.", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "Michael Sitrick built his career on helping the rich and powerful deflect damaging headlines. There was no spinning this. Supported byMichael Sitrick couldn\u2019t comment on Harvey Weinstein.Until a few weeks earlier, Mr. Sitrick\u2019s crisis management firm, Sitrick and Company, had been managing Mr. Weinstein\u2019s unprecedented crisis.Mr. Sitrick had dropped Mr. Weinstein, but he couldn\u2019t say why. He couldn\u2019t confirm if it was because Mr. Weinstein had stopped paying his bills, though he could confirm it was true that Mr. Weinstein had stopped paying his bills, and that the two parties were in arbitration.He couldn\u2019t say if there were other factors. But he could say what were not factors. He could confirm, for instance, that he did not resign out of concern for his company\u2019s own reputation. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Sitrick said. \u201cYou cannot put your firm\u2019s interests ahead of the client\u2019s interests.\u201dAll this to say: Mr. Sitrick could not \u201ccomment,\u201d but he could do what he has made a fortune doing for the better part of three decades. He could spin.Even if you don\u2019t know his name, you know his work. Mr. Sitrick has been managing the narratives of besieged celebrities since the early 1990s.He represented Kelsey Grammer when the star was accused of having sex with his underage babysitter. He helped Christian Slater when the actor was arrested on charges of assaulting his girlfriend, biting a man who tried to stop him and then trying to grab a police officer\u2019s gun. When Erin Everly, about whom Axl Rose wrote \u201cSweet Child O\u2019 Mine,\u201d was suing Mr. Rose for assault and sexual battery, Mr. Sitrick got her story on the cover of People magazine.Mr. Sitrick was retained by Halle Berry when she was in a hit-and-run, Naomi Campbell when she was accused of assaulting her housekeeper, and Rush Limbaugh when he was arrested on prescription drug charges.\u201cParis absolutely did not smoke pot Tuesday night or Wednesday morning,\u201d Mr. Sitrick told a reporter shortly after Paris Hilton was released from jail in 2007. When The New York Daily News reported that Kobe Bryant may have been flirting with someone other than his wife at a Jay-Z concert, Mr. Sitrick was there to push back: \u201cThere was no touching of the face, and he did not dance with her.\u201dIt was Mr. Sitrick who released the first statement on behalf of Chris Brown after he was arrested on charges of assaulting Rihanna: \u201cWords cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired. I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God\u2019s help, to emerging a better person.\u201dMr. Sitrick has also deployed his strategies on behalf of Michael Vick (the dogfighting ring), Alex Rodriguez (the steroid scandal) and R. Kelly (where to begin).But although his celebrity clients attract a disproportionate amount of media coverage, they represent less than 10 percent of Mr. Sitrick\u2019s caseload, he said. Corporate crises are his specialty, including Exxon after the Valdez oil spill, Enron during its accounting-fraud implosion and Theranos, the company that claimed to have revolutionized blood testing but didn\u2019t. Mr. Sitrick helped Roy Disney oust Michael Eisner, and he helped American Apparel oust Dov Charney. He has represented the Daniel Pearl Foundation, on a pro bono basis, and the creator of \u201cGirls Gone Wild.\u201dOne of Mr. Sitrick\u2019s more notorious cases was for years taught at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, a kind of cautionary tale about the perils of going undercover.In the early 1990s, two producers for \u201cPrimetime Live,\u201d an ABC news program, got jobs in Food Lion supermarkets and secretly videotaped workers, raising questions about the company\u2019s meat handling practices. Food Lion then went to Mr. Sitrick, who obtained outtakes of the videos and raised questions about ABC\u2019s practices, effectively turning a story about bad meat into a story about bad journalism.Richard Wald, an emeritus professor at Columbia, was an executive at ABC at the time, and he has asked Mr. Sitrick to address his journalism students over the years. The point of the lesson, according to Mr. Wald, is that \u201cjust because a journalist is finished with a story does not mean the story is finished with the journalist.\u201d Of Mr. Sitrick\u2019s work for Food Lion, Mr. Wald said: \u201cHe did an absolutely brilliant job, but it annoyed the hell out of me at the time.\u201dMr. Sitrick, 70, was once a journalism student himself, at the University of Maryland. He moved into public relations after graduation, following a stint reporting for the Baltimore News-American. \u201cI love journalism,\u201d he remembers telling his wife, Nancy Sitrick, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather eat.\u201dWhen Mr. Sitrick moved to Los Angeles with his wife and three young daughters and founded his firm, in 1989, he made it something of a policy to hire onetime editors and reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to teach journalists P.R. than to teach publicists what news judgment is,\u201d he said.Sitrick and Company quickly acquired a reputation for pushing back against the press, using many of the same strategies as journalists. Mr. Sitrick represented the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles during its sex abuse scandal, the Kabbalah Center when journalists suspected it of being a cult, and the Church of Scientology during its investigation by The New Yorker.Other powerful lawyers turn to Mr. Sitrick, including Marc Kasowitz, part of President Trump\u2019s personal legal team, who said he has used Mr. Sitrick in a \u201cvariety of large, high-profile cases.\u201d When Mr. Kasowitz emailed a stranger with threats last July, warning him to \u201cWatch your back, bitch,\u201d Mr. Sitrick responded to the press inquiries that followed: \u201cWhile no excuse, the email came at the end of a very long day that at 10 p.m. was not yet over.\u201d One advantage to being retained by lawyers for a client rather than by the client himself is that Mr. Sitrick is technically a member of the legal team, and therefore protected by attorney-client privilege. And though he is not a lawyer, Mr. Sitrick views himself as a litigator in the court of public opinion. He also charges lawyerly rates \u2014 as much as $1,100 an hour.Mr. Weinstein had initially handled his own press, together with Lisa Bloom, the lawyer and daughter of Gloria Allred. It hadn\u2019t gone well. \u201cI came of age in the \u201960s and \u201970s,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said in an early statement, before announcing a $5 million foundation for female directors, to be named after his mother, and misquoting Jay-Z lyrics: \u201cI\u2019m not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children.\u201dMr. Sitrick, who said his memory of the initial contact is hazy, was called by Mr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers on Oct. 7, the day Mr. Sitrick\u2019s mother died. He was in Chicago making funeral arrangements. It was for this reason that he passed the Weinstein case to his colleague Sallie Hofmeister, Mr. Sitrick said, not because of the optics of having a woman run things, as reports suggested. Ms. Hofmeister is a former journalist who had worked at The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. She took over on Oct. 8, the day Mr. Weinstein was fired by the Weinstein Company. Mr. Sitrick described his firm\u2019s role in the Weinstein saga this way: \u201cOur job was to make sure nothing was issued to the media, no statements, without clearance from the lawyers. Our job was to find out what information the reporters had, what information they wanted, go to the lawyers, tell them, and talk to the lawyers about what they wanted to say.\u201d It went on: \u201cMr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.\u201dAs the #MeToo dam broke, the allegations against Mr. Weinstein multiplied. So did Sitrick and Company\u2019s rebuttals. An abridged timeline:Oct. 23: \u201cBrit Marling is a super talented actress and writer. Mr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events.\u201dDec. 14: \u201cAll of the sexual allegations as portrayed by Salma are not accurate and others who witnessed the events have a different account of what transpired.\u201dJan. 30: \u201cYour piece omitted that Rose says she faked an orgasm while Mr. Weinstein was performing oral sex on her. Why? It\u2019s misleading to leave out that part that she describes in detail in her book. Can you please update your story to include her full description of the encounter?\u201dMr. Weinstein was already under investigation by law enforcement in three cities. That same day, the Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy, and released all former employees from their nondisclosure agreements.In Chapter 3, \u201cInside the Reporter\u2019s Head,\u201d the authors explain that journalists are a peculiar species motivated not by money, but by an odd mix of cynicism and idealism and an egomaniacal drive to \u201cown\u201d a story. The authors also write: \u201cAs grubby as they may often seem, journalists are no less susceptible to the American dream than anyone else.\u201dIn Chapter 4, \u201cNews Media Abhor a Vacuum,\u201d Mr. Sitrick lays out one of his key tenets: that strategic press representatives must engage the media; \u201cno comment\u201d should never be a first resort. \u201cIf you won\u2019t talk to them, they\u2019ll simply find someone else who will,\u201d he and Mr. Mayer write, \u201cwhich is to say, if you don\u2019t tell your story, someone else will tell it for you.\u201dIn keeping with that rule, Mr. Sitrick quickly agreed to an interview for this article.Four days after that, as I read Chapter 7 \u2014 \u201cPreempt the Situation\u201d \u2014 a Google Alert appeared in my inbox, delivering what Deadline Hollywood billed as an exclusive: \u201cSitrick and Company Resigns Repping Disgraced Mogul Harvey Weinstein.\u201dThe Blast, a celebrity news site and TMZ spinoff, followed a few hours later with an anonymously sourced article stating that Sitrick and Company had filed for arbitration in February, after Mr. Weinstein\u2019s bill went unpaid. \u201cWe\u2019re told,\u201d the article said, in the most passive voice, \u201cthat even after legal documents were filed to collect from the disgraced producer, Weinstein and his reps \u2018begged\u2019 for the firm to continue working with him. We\u2019re told Sitrick refused.\u201dWas Mr. Sitrick already starting to write this story? The Brentwood offices of Sitrick and Company occupy the top floor of a black building on San Vicente. Airy and immaculate, they have the feel of a law firm, but with newsroom touches. Brown leather armchairs are arranged in the reception area, where a cable-news ticker rolls silently across a screen.Mr. Sitrick\u2019s private office is behind two security doors. There, he sat in yet another leather armchair, next to a large potted plant. Asked question after question about Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Sitrick dodged and dodged. He became a little more forthcoming when the approach took a more general tack. So, hypothetically speaking, what were reasons he might drop a client? Mr. Sitrick said he might take that step if the client treated his staff badly. He also said: \u201cI\u2019m not talking about any particular client, but one of the reasons we have resigned cases is people have lied to us or told us information that wasn\u2019t true and we believe they knew it.\u201dSo it went for close to three hours. A large painting hangs above Mr. Sitrick\u2019s desk, depicting a dozen or so people gathered behind a barricade outside the O.J. Simpson trial.The painting is not a memento. Mr. Simpson is one of few potential clients Mr. Sitrick has publicly acknowledged turning down. (Michael Jackson is another, although Mr. Sitrick has since represented his estate.)Whatever Mr. Sitrick\u2019s affection for the painting, it loomed on that day as a reminder of the fierce whims of American public opinion \u2014 of what we will and won\u2019t forgive, what we will and won\u2019t forget.In this vein, did Mr. Sitrick think the #MeToo phenomenon had caused a lasting shift in American culture?To give some historical context: Twenty years ago, for example, in a Los Angeles Times article, Mr. Sitrick was asked to weigh in on the sportscaster Marv Albert, from a crisis-management point of view. (Mr. Albert was not a client.) \u201cThe problem with Marv Albert was not his roughhousing women,\u201d Mr. Sitrick had said at the time. \u201cThe problem was the allegation that he was running around in women\u2019s undergarments.\u201d Today, I pointed out, it may very well be the other way around.Mr. Sitrick thought for a moment. \u201cI think people are going to realize that they are going to be held accountable for their actions in a way that they weren\u2019t before,\u201d he said.To be clear, Mr. Sitrick wasn\u2019t referring to Mr. Weinstein.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Year After Trump\u2019s Paris Pullout, U.S. Companies Are Driving a Renewables Boom", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne big question, however, is whether these corporate renewable deals will remain a relatively niche market, adding some wind and solar at the margins but not really making a sizable dent in overall emissions, or whether these companies can use their clout to transform America\u2019s grid and help usher in a new era of low-carbon power.That trend appears to be accelerating. Corporations have already announced deals for another 2.48 gigawatts of wind and solar in the first half of 2018, as companies like AT&T and Nestl\u00e9 join the search for cleaner power to fulfill their sustainability goals and take advantage of the rapidly declining cost of renewables.\u201cBut with how fast wind and solar prices have fallen, we see this as something that makes financial sense,\u201d he said.\u201cWe think this is a major trend,\u201d said Lisa Wood, vice president of customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute, a major utility trade group. \u201cCustomers are becoming the driver.\u201dThese agreements have gotten increasingly sophisticated: Companies can even arrange to pay for a new wind farm in a different state, such as Oklahoma, and obtain credits from the project even if the electricity is going to someone else. (Basically, the buyer is creating new wind power without using it directly.)\u201cIf we can show utilities that the demand is there, that could convince regulators to expand these programs and allow access for smaller companies,\u201d said Rob Threlkeld, global manager for renewable energy at G.M., which has set the goal to buy 100 percent renewable power by 2050.Mr. Janous of Microsoft, who is engaged in these discussions, says that this aggregation has so far proven to be incredibly challenging. \u201cBut if it\u2019s just Microsoft or just the Fortune 500 companies buying renewable power, that\u2019s not going to be transformative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go beyond that.\u201dA few companies, most notably Google, are now wrestling with an even harder question: What if simply buying up large quantities of wind and solar power isn\u2019t enough?But, as Google itself readily acknowledges, this doesn\u2019t mean that the company is truly powered by 100 percent renewable energy. In many cases, its wind and solar farms operate in different regions (or different countries) than the company\u2019s data centers do. What\u2019s more, the wind and solar farms it has procured don\u2019t provide steady power 24 hours a day, whereas Google\u2019s data centers run around the clock. That means the company is essentially still reliant on fossil fuels to keep the broader grid running.For its next phase, Google wants to locate all of its clean-energy projects in the same grid regions as its data centers, even though that will mean prodding policymakers in places like Taiwan to overhaul electricity markets and allow companies to make direct purchases. Google is also trying to figure out how to assemble a suite of zero-carbon energy sources that can run 24 hours a day, which may require additional technologies like battery storage, demand response programs or even nuclear power.But achieving that goal will take years, and is likely to be far more complicated than simply signing renewable energy contracts.\u201cReaching 100 percent renewable energy is an important milestone, but it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d said Michael Terrell, head of energy market strategy at Google. \u201cWe have to keep our eyes on the ultimate prize, which is to enable carbon free power in every hour of every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Claims to Have Changed. A London Judge Will Decide.", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s 10-month tenure as Uber\u2019s chief executive has been marked by a prolonged public relations campaign to apologize for the company\u2019s past misdeeds and portray the once proudly combative start-up as a reformed corporate citizen.Starting Monday, a judge in London will test the success of his strategy.The case before Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court has ramifications far beyond London, and, given changes the city has already wrung from Uber, it could embolden others grappling with how to regulate ride-sharing services. The ruling will offer a hint as to whether governments and regulators are becoming more receptive to Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s conciliatory efforts as he seeks to move past the brusque manner associated with his predecessor, Travis Kalanick.\u201cThe trial is one of the first big tests of Khosrowshahi\u2019s leadership of the company and new approach,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor at the Cass Business School at City, University of London, who has been tracking the case. \u201cThe judgment will show whether authorities are willing to accept Uber with some of the harder edges knocked off, or whether there are more fundamental questions about the Uber model.\u201dWith more than 3.6 million people using Uber at least once every three months, and 45,000 drivers transporting them, the British capital is Uber\u2019s largest European market. The company has so far been able to continue operating pending its appeal.But a ban would be Uber\u2019s biggest regulatory setback to date. It would bruise its business at a critical time as Mr. Khosrowshahi is scaling back the company\u2019s operations in money-losing markets in Asia and laying the groundwork for an initial public offering.Mr. Khosrowshahi, former chief executive of Expedia, was in the midst of contentious negotiations to settle a boardroom feud between Mr. Kalanick and Uber investors at the time. He flew to London to discuss a potential compromise, calling into board meetings in San Francisco during the brief dash to Britain.Uber has since tried to address many of the criticisms from the London authorities, and a deal of some sort is likely to be reached to keep the company\u2019s cars on the roads. It has introduced limits on how long a driver may continuously be behind the wheel, offered tools to report incidents to the police, and agreed to share traffic data with the city. A new management team was installed to run the company\u2019s London operations, while three independent executives were recruited to a board that oversees operations in Britain.The company is also seeking only an 18-month license, rather than the typical five years, as a concession that it says will allow regulators to ensure its reforms will last.The trial beginning on Monday is expected to last several days, with testimony from Uber representatives and officials from Transport for London, the city\u2019s regulator. Mr. Khosrowshahi is not expected to attend.The case could drag on for years. If Uber loses this appeal, it can still take the case to higher courts, and the company\u2019s cars would be allowed to remain on the road throughout the process.Uber and Transport for London declined to comment.London\u2019s actions are being closely watched as a potential model for regulators elsewhere who are seeking to extract concessions from Uber. Nine years after the company was founded, policymakers continue to struggle with fallout associated with the success of Uber and similar ride-hailing services, including more congested streets and devastated local taxi groups.\u201cThe wild-West era of platform companies skirting regulation seems to be coming to an end,\u201d said Mark Graham, a professor of internet geography at Oxford University who has studied how Uber and other companies that make up the so-called gig economy affect workers and traditional industries.A new license for Uber would be a blow to London\u2019s black-cab drivers.They argue that rivals working for Uber have an unfair advantage because they do not have to meet the same car specification requirements or pass an exhaustive exam, known as \u201cthe Knowledge,\u201d that tests a cabby\u2019s ability to navigate city streets without a map. That, they say, allows Uber to keep its prices lower than those of black cabs \u2014 Uber can be up to 30 percent cheaper than London taxis.Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, which represents about half the city\u2019s 23,000 cabbies, said he was unconvinced by Uber\u2019s efforts to project a friendlier corporate image.\u201cThey are only saying what they have to say to get a license,\u201d Mr. McNamara said.Yet many experts say that banning Uber entirely is unrealistic.Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics, said he expected Uber to win the appeal. In April, the judge presiding over the case asked Uber and Transport for London to negotiate terms of a new license in the event that she rules in the company\u2019s favor.\u201cUber has accepted it needed to make improvements,\u201d Professor Travers said. An outright ban, he said, \u201cis hard to imagine.\u201dHe added, however, that while the appeal would mark an important moment for Uber, the company would inevitably face more such challenges around the world.This fight, he said, \u201cwon\u2019t be the last.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump to Dictators: Have a Nice Day", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistWatching President Trump recently accuse Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of stabbing him in the back prompted me to Google a simple question: How many Canadians were killed or wounded since April 2002 fighting alongside Americans in Afghanistan? The answer: 158 were killed and 635 wounded.And yet, when their prime minister mildly pushed back against demands to lower Canada\u2019s tariffs on milk, cheese and yogurt from the U.S., Trump and his team \u2014 in a flash \u2014 accused Trudeau of \u201cbetrayal,\u201d back-stabbing and deserving of a \u201cspecial place in hell.\u201dBut it tells you all you need to know about how differently Trump looks at the world from any of his predecessors \u2014 Republican or Democrat. Everything is a transaction: What have you done for ME today? The notion of America as the upholder of last resort of global rules and human rights \u2014 which occasionally forgoes small economic advantages to strengthen democratic societies so we can enjoy the much larger benefits of a world of healthy, free-market democracies \u2014 is over.Mind you, I can support Trump verbally cozying up to North Korea\u2019s murderous dictator, Kim Jong-un, if it actually does reduce the prospects of war on the Korean Peninsula and lead to a process of denuclearization there. Nothing else has been effective \u2014 so trading Trump\u2019s phony praise of \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d for a real end to North Korean weapons and missile testing is a trade I\u2019ll endorse \u2014 if it works.As Trump told reporters about the North Korean dictator on Friday: \u201cHe speaks, and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.\u201dTrump later said this was a joke. Sorry, no U.S. president should make such a joke, which, alas, was consistent with everything Trump has said and done before: He prefers the company of strongmen and, as long as they praise him, does not care how leaders anywhere treat their own people \u2014 including how they treat people risking their lives to model their countries on ours (or at least on what they thought was ours).While this approach may buy us some time with North Korea, it is hurting us and our friends in many other places \u2014 because it\u2019s being taken as a free pass for dictators everywhere not just to crush their revolutionaries or terrorists but even their most mild dissenters. It leaves no space for even loyal opposition.\u201cThe state of oppression in Egypt has sunk so low that al-Sisi\u2019s forces are arresting well-recognized activists as they sleep, simply for speaking up,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe message is clear that criticism and even mild satire apparently earn Egyptians an immediate trip to prison.\u201dSisi should hang his head in shame for arbitrarily jailing good young people like this \u2014 and the U.S. Congress should be taking up their cause if our president and secretary of state are too cynical to do so.The same is true in Turkey today under the leadership of a real bum, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. I realized the other day that almost all my Turkish journalist friends had been either jailed, fired or exiled by the caliph-tyrant Erdogan.In U.S.-allied Bahrain, Abduljalil Alsingace, the blogger and human rights defender, who was sentenced in 2011 to life in prison for writing \u201ccritically about human rights violations, sectarian discrimination and repression of the political opposition,\u201d is rotting in jail, noted the Committee to Protect Journalists.In U.S.-allied Philippines, the outspoken senator and former human rights commissioner Leila de Lima, who has been critical of President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s antidrug war that has left more than 7,000 dead in the past three years in gun battles with the police and vigilantes, was thrown in jail in February 2017 on trumped-up drug charges and still languishes there.And in once pro-Western Poland, the country\u2019s most powerful politician, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is trying to replace the independent judiciary with judges selected purely for their loyalty to him and his party, snubbing his nose at the European Union\u2019s liberal, rule-of-law values.In the past, America would have been a reality principle, and at least some voice of restraint, forcing foreign leaders to say, \u201cThe Americans will never let us get away with that.\u201d No more. Trump doesn\u2019t even have ambassadors in Turkey and Saudi Arabia today to whisper.\u201cIn America, we\u2019re going to survive Trump,\u201d says Michael Posner, director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at N.Y.U. Stern. \u201cWe have strong institutions and plenty of people committed to maintaining our democratic processes. But places like Egypt, Turkey or the Philippines are fragile states where activists for decades relied on the U.S. to stand up and say, \u2018There are consequences for your relations with the U.S. \u2014 trade, aid, military, investment \u2014 if you crush peaceful dissent.\u2019 Today, we have a president who is not only not critical, he actually congratulates leaders on their fraudulent elections and seems to endorse their bad behavior.\u201dRemember: These leaders are not repressing violent radicals, Posner adds; they are literally \u201ccriminalizing dissent and debate.\u201d And their citizens now think that we\u2019re O.K. with that. If that stands, the world will eventually become a more dangerous place for all of us.Advertisement"}

They could also load spoof versions of an email site you use to steal your password and gain access to your communications.\u201cMost consumers don\u2019t know to patch these things,\u201d said Matt Watchinski, a senior director of Cisco Talos, who helped research the VPNFilter malware. \u201cThey don\u2019t treat it like they do their air-conditioner or refrigerator, where we all know we should change the filters.\u201dHere\u2019s a guide to some of the best practices you can embrace to ensure that your router \u2014 and, by extension, all your internet gadgets \u2014 is safe.Even though a router lacks moving parts, it needs to be maintained with the latest security updates. Easier said than done, right? Here is a basic step-by-step for how to do that:\u25a0 Consult the instruction manual for your router to get its IP address, a string of numbers that you will punch into a web browser for access to the router\u2019s web dashboard. Jot down the number and store it somewhere safe like your filing cabinet.\u25a0 After entering the router\u2019s IP address into a web browser, log in to the base station with your username and password. In the router\u2019s web dashboard, click on the firmware settings. Look for a button that lets you check for the latest firmware version.\u25a0 If an update is available, choose to install it and let the router restart. Repeat this process every three to six months.\u25a0 If you use a router provided by a broadband provider like Comcast or Verizon, call the customer service department and ask whether your equipment has been updated with the latest firmware.When you log in to your router, if your username and password are something like \u201cadmin\u201d and \u201cpassword,\u201d you have a problem. Many Wi-Fi stations come with weak, generic passwords by default that manufacturers intend for you to change.The problem with having a weak username and password is that anybody within range of your router could log in to it and change its settings, potentially opening it up to the outside world, said Dave Fraser, chief executive of Devicescape, a company that helps make public Wi-Fi networks more reliable for mobile phone service.So while you are checking for firmware updates in your router\u2019s web dashboard, make sure to also check your security settings and change the username and password to something strong and unique. Security experts recommend creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases and added numbers and special characters. (Examples: My fav0rite numb3r is Gr33n4782# or The cat ate the C0TT0n candy 224%.) Write down these credentials on the same piece of paper where you recorded your IP address.Even if your router still appears to work properly, the device has reached the end of its life when manufacturers stop supporting it with firmware updates, leaving it vulnerable to future cyberthreats. You can expect this to happen every three to five years. At that point, it is crucial to upgrade to a new piece of hardware.The best way to check is to look up your router on the manufacturer\u2019s website and read notes about its firmware releases. If there hasn\u2019t been a firmware update in the last year, the router has probably been discontinued.Among the routers affected by the VPNFilter malware, a significant portion of them were more than five years old, said Cisco\u2019s Mr. Watchinski.How did we get here in the first place? Historically, manufacturers have designed routers by cobbling together open-source software platforms with commodity components to produce base stations as cheaply as possible \u2014 with little care for long-term security, Mr. Fraser said.\u201cIt is a miserable situation, and it has been from day one,\u201d he said. But Mr. Fraser added that there were now \u201cnew world\u201d routers with operating systems, tougher security and thoughtful features to make network management easy.The caveat is that smarter Wi-Fi systems tend to cost more than cheap routers that people are accustomed to. Eero\u2019s base stations start at $199, and a Google Wifi station costs $119, compared with $50 for a cheap router. For both of these systems, you can also add base stations throughout the home to extend their wireless connections, creating a so-called mesh network.Another bonus? Mr. Fraser noted that more modern Wi-Fi systems should have longer life spans because the companies sometimes relied on different revenue streams, like selling subscriptions to network security services.Advertisement"}

Boylan, a distinguished lawyer and prosecutor who died in 2009.\u201cWhenever these things come up, it really gets me thinking about my father,\u201d Mr. Boylan said. \u201cEspecially around Father\u2019s Day. I miss him a lot \u2014 his advice, his perspective.\u201dIn the early 1960s, when the older Mr. Boylan was an assistant United States attorney in New Jersey working for the Department of Justice, which was run by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, he successfully prosecuted Mr. Provenzano in a high-profile federal racketeering case.The case was of keen interest to Mr. Kennedy, who had previously pursued both Mr. Hoffa and Mr. Provenzano. Mr. Boylan even listed Mr. Kennedy as a possible witness.For some, Father\u2019s Day might recall tender moments tossing a ball with dad or riding bikes or going for ice cream. But for the younger Mr. Boylan, the holiday prompts more hard-boiled reflections of the time his father, a young, strait-laced, Harvard-educated prosecutor, became involved in a harrowing extortion trial that was daunting for the entire family.For the younger Mr. Boylan, the trial played out when he was a small boy, and it remains a formative event in his life and career.On his desk at the library this week was a family prize: a signed photograph of Mr. Kennedy with a personal inscription to the older Mr. Boylan: \u201cWith appreciation and high regards.\u201d\u201cFor Kennedy at the time, this trial was Priority One \u2014 it was personal,\u201d Mr. Boylan said. \u201cHe would have my father call him, or fly to Washington, for updates throughout the trial. One of my earliest memories was seeing my father getting off a government plane at Newark Airport and having his hat blown straight down the runway.\u201dMr. Provenzano \u2014 known widely as Tony Pro \u2014 strong-armed his way to power in the crime-ridden Teamsters union, with a violent approach to campaigning and a knack for making enemies disappear.During the trial, the judge sequestered the jittery jury in a hotel, where two suspicious fires were set, though they caused no real damage. A rival of Mr. Provenzano was found shot to death in Hoboken, N.J., before he could testify against him.\u201cThe original choice for prosecutor was so frightened, he had a heart attack,\u201d Mr. Boylan said. \u201cThen Robert Kennedy called my father and warned him: \u2018You know they will try to kill you, Matt.\u2019\u201dMr. Kennedy\u2019s pursuit of Teamsters corruption began in the 1950s, when as chief counsel to the Senate Rackets Committee, he questioned Mr. Provenzano, who continually invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer.The younger Mr. Kennedy said his father\u2019s interest in the Provenzano trial unfolding in Newark would have been \u201cright in character\u201d with his habit of keeping a hand in local prosecutions of mob activity and union corruption around the country.\u201cHe was personally involved and hands-on, encouraging the local guys on the front lines of fighting the mob,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cHe wanted to encourage them and make sure they were operating strategically. He liked young, tough guys willing to stand up for what they believed in.\u201dThe older Mr. Boylan was 31 during the trial, a few years out of Harvard Law School, and did not back down to Tony Pro\u2019s intimidation tactics.The younger Mr. Boylan said that, as a young child, he found a handgun in his father\u2019s sock drawer that, in an unusual move, the F.B.I. issued to the prosecutor for protection.\u201cProvenzano sent goons to our house to bang on our door in the middle of the night, to put fear into us,\u201d Mr. Boylan recalled.Mr. Provenzano, a stocky former amateur boxer, was quoted in The New York Herald Tribune as saying of Mr. Boylan, \u201cHe\u2019s a good boy, but when two fighters get in the ring, one has to win and one has to lose. And they both have to fight as hard as they can.\u201dMr. Provenzano, a second-in-command ally of Mr. Hoffa in the Teamsters, was convicted in the 1963 extortion trial and sent to a federal prison where Mr. Hoffa was also taken after a jury tampering conviction.The two men became rivals there, which helped lead, years later, to Mr. Provenzano becoming a key figure in Mr. Hoffa\u2019s disappearance, which was never solved.Other news coverage of Mr. Provenzano\u2019s trial included columns by Jimmy Breslin for The New York Herald Tribune that described Mr. Provenzano taking his union-owned Cadillac to court and wearing a sharkskin suit, a diamond pinkie ring and a gold watch.\u201cHe does not talk too well but you do not need an elocution course to run a Teamsters union,\u201d Mr. Breslin wrote. \u201cYou need muscle, and Tony has plenty of that.\u201dShortly before Mr. Boylan died, he heard Mr. Breslin single him out by name, in citing the Tony Pro case as one of the best trials he covered in his long newspaper career.\u201cI\u2019m glad my father got to hear that,\u201d the younger Mr. Boylan said, adding that his father was heartbroken when Mr. Kennedy was assassinated and devoted himself throughout his career to public service.Like father, like son. The younger Mr. Boylan, who studied history at Columbia University and graduated from Duke University School of Law, left behind a law career to enjoy a wider realm of research for the public.\u201cThat case colored my father\u2019s career, and it never left me either,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve spent my career doing public-spirited research for other people, as a direct consequence of what arose out of my father\u2019s experience working for Robert Kennedy and putting away Tony Pro.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Athens, Rising", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "Cultured TravelerThe city has endured crisis and chaos, and yet is now emerging from the wreckage as one of Europe\u2019s most vibrant and significant cultural capitals.Supported byIt was Saturday night in Athens, and I was surrounded by dozens of young Greeks on the packed veranda of Six d.o.g.s., a cafe-bar and arts space that runs the length of an alleyway in the Monastiraki neighborhood. It was the 10-year anniversary party for Laternative, a local radio show launched in the wake of the country\u2019s debt crisis, and people spilled into the gallery space, gathered under light-strung trees in the back garden and in the club area where the first of several bands was about to play.Most of the partygoers looked to be in their early and mid 20s, just like I was the first time I came to this exact spot nearly 12 years ago, back when it was a tiny indie rock bar called Kinky. Standing here now, I could almost see myself as I was then: a 24-year-old backpacker sitting alone in the corner, smoking cheap Greek cigarettes and nursing a raki, unaware that my life had come to a crossroads.There are places we live and places we visit, and then there are the other places. Places we return to, where we put down roots, but not strong enough roots to hold us \u2014 places that change us, that we haunt and are haunted by. Nowhere embodies this for me more than Athens, a city I\u2019ve watched shift and evolve, endure crisis and chaos and economic collapse, and yet emerge from the wreckage as one of the continent\u2019s most vibrant and significant cultural capitals, more popular than ever as a tourist destination. (Last year Athens welcomed a record 5 million visitors, double the 2012 figure.)The first time I came here, I was more or less fleeing New York. I had saved up a chunk of money bartending after college at one of those high-volume, pre-crash Soho bars that catered to young Wall Street types. Being a Midwesterner with no connections or career prospects to speak of, I had done what countless other young Americans did before me: I bought a backpack and a one-way ticket to Europe.After a week or so bouncing around the Cyclades, I arrived in Athens, planning to stay only a few days before moving on. People had told me the city was ugly and congested, basically a stopover, yet I remember the first romance of its winding, cracked stone alleyways overgrown with jasmine creepers and bitter orange trees, the roving packs of stray dogs, cats sunning on ruins, the smell of leather, honeysuckle and dust.One night I wandered into Kinky Bar, where the D.J. was playing obscure postpunk records I happened to love. I drank until I was brave enough to approach him. He introduced me to his friends \u2014 Athenians, a bit older than I was \u2014 and at the end of the night, they did something I couldn\u2019t imagine happening back home: They invited me to move in with them.They all lived on or near a small, leafy street called Semitelou on a hill near the Athens Music Hall. Over the next weeks, I lived between their apartments, typical residential buildings with wraparound balconies and sun-bleached awnings that faced each other over the street. They were journalists, D.J.s and architects. Two were identical twin brothers, one gay and one straight. They lived with the straight twin\u2019s girlfriend, a biologist who traveled with a suitcase of human sperm samples.They showed me the city, its chaotic cafes and dusky tavernas. We packed into the car they all shared and drove around the gasworks of the Gazi district in search of after-hours bouzouki bars, saw concerts in Orthodox churches, prepared huge home-cooked dinners that we washed down with wine and vodka and other substances of varying toxicity and legality.\u201cIt\u2019s like the show \u2018Friends\u2019 but with sex, drugs and balconies,\u201d I wrote at the time in my journal. It was a period in my life when I kept one rigorously, documenting nearly every romantic and philosophical quandary, every insight, not least of which was my decision to stay abroad and try to write professionally.I loved Athens but wanted to see more of Europe, and it was my Athenian friends who directed me to Berlin, somewhere I\u2019d had no desire to visit, but where I would end up spending the next decade, settling down, becoming a writer, meeting my husband.How, then, to explain the Athens I find now, returning in the flush of spring with my old journals to reconnect with the city of my recollections? The commercial center, which I remember going dark at the end of the work day, was overflowing with visitors and locals, patronizing stylish, next-generation bars, cafes and restaurants that have largely deposed the cheap souvlaki joints and outdated tavernas I remember.In so many ways, Athens feels more alive, more culturally prolific, than ever, and it\u2019s hard to understand how this could have happened in the midst of the worst economic catastrophe in the history of the European Union.\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting and hellish,\u201d said Theodosis Michos, raising his voice over the music at the Six d.o.g.s. party. With his thick black-rimmed glasses and tattoos, his rake-thin build and wild, Richard Hell-esque hair, he looked exactly as I remembered him when I was staying at his place on Semitelou, give or take a decade of worry lines. Back in 2006, he was a staff writer for Esquire Greece, but like almost all the Greeks I know, the crisis left Theodosis out of work.The day after the party, I headed to Exarcheia, the graffiti-covered anarchist and student district that was the site of a scene I described in my 2006 journal, which now feels to me like an omen: \u201cSaw a shop with a 10-foot hole bashed through the window, riot cops everywhere, employees crying.\u201dBut it remains to be seen whether Documenta\u2019s bolstering of the art scene will last. And despite recent talk of Athens being \u201cthe new Berlin,\u201d the city still struggles with poverty, riots and drug crime, not to mention continued reverberations of the refugee crisis \u2014 something perhaps most visible in Exarchia, where many migrants from war-torn countries in Africa and the Middle East live in squats run by anarchists and activists.\u201cYou\u2019re living in uncertainty all the time,\u201d said Meropi Kokkini, another writer friend I stayed with back in 2006. I had come to meet her and George \u2014 her longtime partner who was the D.J. that first night at Kinky Bar \u2014 at a new pok\u00e9 bowl stand in the city center. I often stayed with George and Meropi when I visited Athens in the years after my first stay, sitting up all night talking and drinking until I had almost missed my flight \u2014 and on at least one occasion, actually had.As we spoke, people streamed by us in the cooling evening air, some dragging suitcases or holding phones open to Google Maps. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling now that things are getting better,\u201d she added, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real.\u201dIn the past year or two, Greece has shown signs of recovery. Unemployment, which peaked near 30 percent in 2013, is below 20 percent and falling, and the economy is growing faster than the European average. Much of this growth comes from the tourism sector as visitor numbers have surged, increasing for the past decade at around 11 percent per year, in part due to fears about turmoil in Turkey and the Middle East, as well as increased tourism from the newly wealthy Asian middle classes. The country expects a new all-time high of 32 million visitors in 2018, three times its population.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, the tourists in recent years. It\u2019s like the whole world is coming on vacation to Greece.\u201d said Fotis Vallatos, the travel editor of Blue Magazine, the in-flight publication of Greece\u2019s largest airline, Aegean Airlines, and a co-founder of Popaganda, as well as the person who first invited me to move in to Semitelou.As tourism has increased, Aegean Airlines expanded from 18 mostly Greek destinations in 2001 to 145 all over the world today. Fotis is now often on the road, exploring those destinations and the many inventive restaurants and visitor attractions that have emerged in Greece since the crisis, from a wave of young chefs using Nordic, French and East Asian cooking techniques on local ingredients, to a multitude of \u201csecond-act producers,\u201d people left unemployed or underemployed who returned to the villages where they grew up and began to sell homemade, organic, artisanal Greek products \u2014 to phenomenal results.\u201cI think everybody became more creative after the crisis, more cooperative,\u201d he said.We talked about the Semitelou days, how much fun it was to be so young and dumb. Back then, he said, \u201cit was still a big party. We earned good money. We worked a lot, but it was a period when everybody was happy. We thought this party would last forever, and because of this, we lived that way. We never thought this might be over in a few years.\u201dListening to Fotis, I realized that for my friends, even more than for me, those years must feel foreign \u2014 like a distant dream.As often happens when I\u2019m in Athens, I was introduced to friends of friends and wound up in the hours just before I had to head to the airport at a party I didn\u2019t want to leave. This one, though, was fancier than I was used to. It was thrown by Afroditi Panagiotakou, the director of culture for the Onassis Foundation. Formidable and eccentric in the way of Mediterranean aristocrats, she is the guiding force behind the foundation\u2019s rebirth as an important engine of the city\u2019s cultural scene.\u201cI have to say, I\u2019ve never felt closer to this city,\u201d said Afroditi, as we sat on the roof terrace of the villa she shares with her partner, Anthony S. Papadimitriou, president of the business and public benefit wing of the Onassis Foundation. We looked out over the Mets district, a palimpsest of red tile and concrete housing blocks behind which the Acropolis rises like a revelation.\u201cI think that Athens lies beyond good and evil, beyond beauty and ugliness,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that cities are supposed to be beautiful anyway. I think they\u2019re supposed to be interesting. They\u2019re supposed to be alive. Athens is definitely alive. It doesn\u2019t have this constipated, sclerotic thing that cities like New York, London, Paris have, where whatever you do, nobody will notice.\u201d She added, \u201cAthens is a city that is changing all the time.\u201dAs we spoke, guests began to arrive \u2014 gallerists and producers, artists and writers on Onassis grants, mostly Greek but some Lebanese, part of the foundation\u2019s effort to build more cultural exchange with the Middle East. Wine flowed and the music got louder, jumping from Bossa Nova to Italo-disco to Greek rebetiko as the sun began to set over Athens. By the time I left for the airport, nearly everyone was dancing.Charly Wilder is a frequent contributor to the Travel section.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hey Boss, You Don\u2019t Want Your Employees to Meditate", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterDr. Vohs and Dr. Hafenbrack are behavioral scientists.Mindfulness meditation, a Buddhism-inspired practice in which you focus your mind entirely on the current moment, has been widely embraced for its instrumental benefits \u2014 especially in the business world. Companies like Apple, Google and Nike provide meditation rooms that encourage brief sessions during the workday. Chief executives publicly extol its benefits. And no wonder: The practical payoff of mindfulness is backed by dozens of studies linking it to job satisfaction, rational thinking and emotional resilience.But on the face of it, mindfulness might seem counterproductive in a workplace setting. A central technique of mindfulness meditation, after all, is to accept things as they are. Yet companies want their employees to be motivated. And the very notion of motivation \u2014 striving to obtain a more desirable future \u2014 implies some degree of discontentment with the present, which seems at odds with a psychological exercise that instills equanimity and a sense of calm.Some of the participants in our studies were trained in a few of the most common mindfulness meditation techniques. They were instructed by a professional meditation coach to focus on their breathing or mentally scan their bodies for physical sensations, being gently reminded throughout that there was no right or wrong way to do the exercise.Other participants were led through a different exercise. Some were encouraged to let their thoughts wander; some were instructed to read the news or write about recent activities they had done.Then we gave everyone a task to do. The tasks were similar to everyday workplace jobs: editing business memos, entering text into a computer and so on. Before embarking on the tasks, the participants were asked about their motivation: How much effort and time would they put into the assignment? Did they feel like doing it?Among those who had meditated, motivation levels were lower on average. Those people didn\u2019t feel as much like working on the assignments, nor did they want to spend as much time or effort to complete them. Meditation was correlated with reduced thoughts about the future and greater feelings of calm and serenity \u2014 states seemingly not conducive to wanting to tackle a work project.Mindfulness is perhaps akin to a mental nap. Napping, too, is associated with feeling calm, refreshed and less harried. Then again, who wakes up from a nap eager to organize some files?By some accounts, motivation is just as important as intelligence and personality when it comes to an individual\u2019s success, and has the advantage of being largely under an individual\u2019s control. Companies benefit, too, when workers are motivated: A 2013 worldwide survey by Gallup found that companies with more engaged employees outperform other companies in growth and productivity.Management theorists and organizational leaders often think about motivation in terms of financial incentives. So as part of our research, we studied whether offering a financial bonus for outstanding performance would overcome the demotivating effect of mindfulness: It did not. While the promise of material rewards will always be a useful tool for motivating employees, it is no substitute for internal motivation.Mindfulness might be unhelpful for dealing with difficult assignments at work, but it may be exactly what is called for in other contexts. There is no denying that mindfulness can be beneficial, bringing about calm and acceptance. Once you\u2019ve reached a peak level of acceptance, however, you\u2019re not going to be motivated to work harder.Kathleen D.

{"Headline": "Writing About Earthquakes, and Feeling One", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was around 7:30 p.m. on a Monday in May and I was sitting in my 12th-floor office in San Francisco, writing an article about how some high-rise buildings are more vulnerable to earthquakes than others. Then the building jolted and rattled like a train lurching out of a station.It was a mini earthquake, a 3.7 magnitude centered across the San Francisco Bay. And it had uncanny timing, because the article I was writing had already crossed from the professional into the personal.A list of potentially vulnerable buildings published in the appendix of a report put out in April by the U.S. Geological Survey had a familiar address on it: the San Francisco bureau of The New York Times.As I was looking up the magnitude of the earthquake on the U.S.G.S. site, my 6-year-old daughter called from our home across the Bay. \u201cDad! We had an earthquake! We had an earthquake!\u201d she yelled excitedly over the phone. \u201cIt was like a giant stepped on the house!\u201dA recent study co-authored by Gregory Deierlein, a Stanford University earthquake engineering expert who is a seismic advisor to the city of San Francisco, found that a typical building with the flaw had roughly a 50 percent chance of collapse with ground shaking similar to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. (The buildings are not thought to be vulnerable to lower intensity earthquakes.)The probabilities of collapse are calculated by using complex computer models that engineers agree are far from perfect. Engineers often say we won\u2019t know how accurate those models are until the buildings actually go through an earthquake.But because the flaw affected my own building, I had a greater insight into the question of earthquake probabilities. Seismologists say they cannot predict when, where or how strong the next earthquake will be. But they are certain that California will experience large ones in the future.Earthquakes are a weighty subject, and one of the ways Californians deflect concern about them is through attempts at humor. When small earthquakes strike, there seems no escaping jokes about whose fault it was.I had spoken to only a handful of my San Francisco bureau colleagues about our building\u2019s seismic vulnerabilities. So on the day before the article was published last week, I sent a note to 20 or so reporters and editors in the bureau to alert them both to the issue and the story about it.What came back from them was an escalating series of bad puns.\u201cI\u2019m shaken. I hope it doesn\u2019t fracture our community,\u201d said Sheera Frenkel, who covers cybersecurity.\u201cWhat a jolt \u2014 I\u2019m sure this story will create quite a stir,\u201d wrote Dai Wakabayashi, who covers Google.David Streitfeld, another technology correspondent, replied to my email with a note to his editors.\u201cI\u2019ll be working at home for the next, oh, seven years,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Summit at the New York Public Library, led by Jeff Sonnenfeld. What did America\u2019s top business executives think of the day\u2019s news?That event was strictly off the record, but DealBook has the results of a survey from it:\u2022 About 69 percent of the 107 attendees surveyed thought that the Kim-Trump meeting was overrated, because of a lack of clear targets and outcomes.\u2022 The summit meeting\u2019s biggest winner? 59 percent said Mr. Kim. The biggest loser? 28 percent thought Mr. Trump; 27 percent thought leaders of the Group of 7.\u2022 About 80 percent of survey participants thought the AT&T decision was correct.\u2022 And 60 percent thought that the Justice Department had tried to block it for political, rather than legal, reasons.But by one measure \u2014 stock markets \u2014 the trade fight isn\u2019t having much impact. Peter Eavis explains:Rising profits might explain why investors are putting more money in the United States stock market while getting out of other countries. In the past six weeks, a net $29 billion has poured into funds that invest in United States stocks, while $13 billion flowed out of those focused on European stocks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.A caveat: The U.S. economy could start to slow down (though the Fed doesn\u2019t expect it to). If it does, businesses could end up hurting more from tariffs than they expect.Traditionally the Cannes Lions festival has been the advertising world\u2019s swanky trade conference. Attendees sip ros\u00e9 and pat themselves on the back. But this year, they need to discuss how their business has been upended by Europe\u2019s new privacy laws, clients demanding lower fees and greater transparency, and the continued successes of Google and Facebook.I think we can all feel the disruption in the industry. There are generational shifts in the way we consume and create communication, and it\u2019s also been a milestone year for data privacy, gender equality, global trade, and the retail landscape.Investors large and small from around the world are attracted to Silicon Valley by its track record, its talent, and its promise. They are also attracted by the fact that behind the innovation and entrepreneurship are rules of law that require honesty, fair play, and transparency.The road to last week\u2019s meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore was laid by secret meetings between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his counterparts in Pyongyang.

{"Headline": "An Oil Giant Is Taking Big Steps. Saudi Arabia Can\u2019t Afford for It to Slip.", "Date": "2018-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAS TANURA, Saudi Arabia \u2014 This port, on the calm blue waters of the Persian Gulf, operates with militarylike precision. Black- and red-hulled super oil tankers must ask for permission to load months in advance. Detailed records go back 30 years to trace any vessels that have broken the rules by dumping oil or using substandard equipment. High-tech radars constantly scan for potential troublemakers, like boats sent from Iran.At the top of the hexagonal control tower, staff dressed in neat white uniforms with officers\u2019 epaulets keep watch, looking over the sweep of countless storage tanks and ships. \u201cIf a target tries to hide behind a ship, we can see him,\u201d said Salah al-Ghamdi, the chief pilot at the facility.Thousands of ships depart these waters annually, transporting the wealth of crude beneath the Saudi Arabian desert to gas-guzzling nations. The kingdom accounts for almost one-sixth of world oil exports, and even a minor disruption here could send shudders through global markets.The state-run oil giant that operates the port, Saudi Aramco, is the economic force behind Saudi Arabia\u2019s transformation into a regional powerhouse. The deep oil reserves, which the company extracts, transports and sells, have made the country an important part of a geopolitical equation that includes the United States, China and Russia. Leveraging its engineering expertise, Saudi Aramco has built schools, roads, hospitals and much of the other infrastructure that girds Saudi society.As the kingdom now prepares for its next evolution, Saudi Aramco is again central \u2014 in a role that leaves the company and the country at risk.With global prices north of $70 a barrel, Saudi Arabia and its oil giant are under pressure to increase production. It could put them at odds with some other nations in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meet this coming week.\u201cSaudi Aramco has always carried the kingdom on its back,\u201d said Jim Krane, an energy and geopolitics fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. \u201cBut to support the kingdom in the coming decades, it needs to transform itself.\u201dIn essence, the crown prince wants the kingdom and Saudi Aramco to plan for the day far in the future when the oil age draws to a close. The present is already making the crude business look less attractive. Countries around the world are shifting to renewable power, while technological advances like electric cars are eroding demand for oil.To diversify, Aramco is building vast new facilities that will turn crude into more profitable petrochemicals, and it is increasingly drilling for gas. It is also working with Google to establish data centers in the kingdom to develop data-analytics and cloud-computing capacity.But the initial public offering will draw scrutiny to a company whose inner workings have long been kept out of sight. Pressure from investors, combined with a prince in a hurry to transform his country, could jeopardize the long-term approach that has made Aramco a dominant force.For two years, a special team has been working with an array of Western bankers and advisers, preparing for how to handle quarterly reporting of results and coordinate trading between stock exchanges. A local Saudi listing seems certain, but London, New York and bourses in Asia are still in the running for a piece.Amin H. Nasser, Aramco\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview that the company was preparing to list in all those locations. Speaking with a picture of the crown prince in the background, he added, \u201cIt makes us ready for any market the government decides.\u201dOthman al-Khowaiter was born in 1933, the same year that Standard Oil of California secured a sweeping oil concession from the founder of Saudi Arabia. The Khowaiter family was made up of poor farmers, and as a child, he worked as a houseboy. He would follow the same path as the country\u2019s nascent energy business.The founder, King Abdulaziz ibn Saud, needed cash to run his country, created from a patchwork of tribes. The American company, the predecessor to what is now Chevron, paid him 50,000 British pounds\u2019 worth of gold for the contract. The company sent teams of American geologists to explore Saudi Arabia\u2019s deserts, accompanied by Bedouin guides and soldiers from the king to ward off raiders.Lacking today\u2019s sophisticated tools to find oil and gas underground, they interpreted clues on the surface \u2014 fossils, domes and folds in the rock \u2014 that hinted oil may be trapped underneath. One geologist, Ernie Berg, noticed that a wadi, or ancient riverbed, took a mysterious turn. He surmised that the bend had been caused by a large uplift, indicating an underlying oil field.It led to the 170-mile-long Ghawar field, which remains by far the world\u2019s largest oil discovery. Such finds altered Saudi Arabia\u2019s prospects. After a pause during World War II, money started coming in, and jobs were suddenly on offer for the new company, the Arabian American Oil Company, or Aramco.Aramco soon became a magnet for men like Mr. Khowaiter. In a society that had long been defined by tribal connections, the company modeled itself as a meritocracy offering young hopefuls the chance for advancement. Mr. Khowaiter spent several days in 1949 crossing the country, hitching rides with passing trucks from his home in central Saudi Arabia, to Dhahran on the eastern coast, where Aramco was ramping up its operations.\u201cI heard about people working for Aramco, that the door was open to getting an education,\u201d Mr. Khowaiter said, over tea and pecan pie.Back then, Al Khobar \u2014 now a major port near Dhahran \u2014 was a medieval-looking walled town that lacked the facilities, roads or people needed for an international oil hub. Saudi employees there lived in palm-thatched huts and were plagued by diseases like malaria.Mr. Khowaiter, who was sent by the Saudi government to study petroleum engineering at the University of Texas, eventually spent 35 years at the company, rising to become vice president of drilling before retiring in 1996. He still lives in Dhahran, now Aramco\u2019s headquarters, in a gated community dotted with date palm trees known as the \u201cgolden ghetto,\u201d a wealthy enclave with a Mexican theme restaurant and a golf course, among other entertainment.Stories like Mr. Khowaiter\u2019s are common, the most famous being Ali al-Naimi\u2019s. Mr. Naimi, the son of a pearl diver and his Bedouin wife, began studying at an Aramco-sponsored school, and was first hired by the company as an office boy at 12 years old. He embraced American culture, even learning to play shortstop in baseball, and pestered the company to send him abroad \u2014 first to Beirut, Lebanon, and then to the United States, where he earned his undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees.In 1988, Mr. Naimi became Aramco\u2019s chief executive, the first Saudi in the position. In 1995, he was named Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister.\u201cWithout Aramco, I don\u2019t know what life would be,\u201d Mr. Khowaiter said. \u201cWe would not be at the level we are now.\u201dAramco\u2019s path has long been driven by politics. Riyadh\u2019s relationship with the United States frayed during the Arab-Israeli war in 1973. Washington supported Israel. In retaliation, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states imposed an oil embargo on the United States. That same year, the Saudis took a 25 percent stake in Aramco, eventually gaining full control by 1980.The American influence is still apparent. Many expatriates stayed, and American companies kept buying and selling Saudi oil. Unlike the rest of Saudi Arabia, where recreation and entertainment are largely forbidden, Aramco compounds have baseball diamonds and movie theaters. Men and women work together and mingle in public. English is widely spoken.Saudi Aramco\u2019s success, in many ways, is tied to its roots. It is run more like a private company than a state-run fief, with top executives typically chosen for competence rather than connections. Its employees are efficient, skilled and highly educated, making the company an outlier in a kingdom where state control has stifled innovation and limited the kinds of opportunities that should be available in such a wealthy country.The company is widely praised for embracing technology and, unlike many government-controlled energy companies, finishing projects on time and on budget. While Aramco does not disclose its financial results, analysts say its large, long-running fields most likely mean that the costs of bringing the oil out of the ground are among the lowest in the industry. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian market research company, estimates Saudi Aramco\u2019s operating costs to be $4.88 for each barrel of oil. Last year, Exxon Mobil reported worldwide production costs of $10.12 a barrel.Its Saudi parentage gives the company an advantage over the likes of Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell. Aramco doesn\u2019t face the relentless quarter-to-quarter pressure to produce profit. It can take a really, really long-term view, and over the years has persistently opted for the most advanced \u2014 and expensive \u2014 technology to ensure it will be able to pump vast quantities of oil for decades.\u201cSaudi Aramco has a much better business model than the international majors,\u201d said J. Robinson West, chairman of the BCG Center for Energy Impact, a consultancy.When Aramco first drilled at the Shaybah oil field in the 1990s, it picked a then unusual and costly process known as horizontal drilling. Rather than exploring straight down into the ground, Aramco\u2019s wells lace through Shaybah. One has so many branches it is known as the \u201cfish bone.\u201dThey more than compensate for the cost, though. During the process, the wells have more contact with oil-bearing rocks to produce more crude, while expending less energy on pumping.This approach is one reason giant fields like Ghawar continue to produce despite having been tapped for decades. Fields in areas like the North Sea in Europe, or in the Gulf of Mexico, have declined sharply.\u201cSaudi Aramco has the longest time horizon in the industry,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian.With oil reserves pegged at about 260 billion barrels \u2014 far more than any publicly listed competitor \u2014 Aramco has around 70 years\u2019 worth of resources at present production levels. It has the two largest oil fields ever discovered. And more are coming, with the recently developed Manifa capable of producing 900,000 barrels of oil a day. Western oil majors only rarely get access to such giant deposits.\u201cWe are in a unique position where we have exclusive access to all of Saudi Arabia\u2019s fields,\u201d said Suha Kayum, an Aramco research scientist. \u201cWe basically develop our fields to last for centuries.\u201dAbout an hour\u2019s drive from Dhahran, a gargantuan industrial complex dominates the desert landscape. Two square miles, it looks like a small city, except people are eerily absent and the streets are lined with pipes, storage tanks and smokestacks. Sadara, as this complex is called, represents what could be the new Aramco.The ambitious project, which began operating last year, is the result of a $20 billion investment by the company and its partner, Dow Chemical. In all, 26 separate plants brew an array of petrochemicals from oil and gas for foam, insulation and plastics, as well as chemicals that will go into adhesives, coatings and cosmetics.The idea is not only to feed expanding world markets for these products, but to sow the seeds of a diversified Saudi economy. Officials hope Sadara will drive growth in industries like furniture and car parts, providing jobs to the country\u2019s young and fast-growing labor force.\u201cWe see the world changing,\u201d said Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, Aramco\u2019s senior vice president for chemicals and refining. \u201cIt is very much for us to read the future, and engineer our future in a way that we keep our market share.\u201dBut whether politics and profits can peacefully coexist in this blend is a big uncertainty for Saudi Aramco.Investors in a public Saudi Aramco may want to know why the company has research centers across the globe when others have been cutting back.They might question why the company needs to lend executives and engineers to the government to carry out pet projects for the kingdom, like building a new university on the Red Sea.Or they might wonder why Saudi Aramco maintains as much as two million barrels a day of spare pumping capacity for the country to intervene in world markets, an amount that is equal to the total oil production of Nigeria.\u201cThey have a gold-plating mentality,\u201d Floris Ansingh, a former head of Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s operations in Saudi Arabia, said of Aramco. \u201cThey are very demanding on the technical side. They act like a rich company.\u201dAfter a public listing, he said, \u201cthis mentality has to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Will Not Renew Pentagon Contract That Upset Employees", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google, hoping to head off a rebellion by employees upset that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes, will not renew a contract with the Pentagon for artificial intelligence work when a current deal expires next year.Diane Greene, who is the head of the Google Cloud business that won a contract with the Pentagon\u2019s Project Maven, said during a weekly meeting with employees on Friday that the company was backing away from its A.I. work with the military, according to a person familiar with the discussion but not permitted to speak publicly about it.But it is not unusual for Silicon Valley\u2019s big companies to have deep military ties. And the internal dissent over Maven stands in contrast to Google\u2019s biggest competitors for selling cloud-computing services \u2014 Amazon.com and Microsoft \u2014 which have aggressively pursued Pentagon contracts without pushback from their employees.Google\u2019s self-image is different \u2014 it once had a motto of \u201cdon\u2019t be evil.\u201d A number of its top technical talent said the internet company was betraying its idealistic principles, even as its business-minded officials worried that the protests would damage its chances to secure more business from the Defense Department.About 4,000 Google employees signed a petition demanding \u201ca clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.\u201d A handful of employees also resigned in protest, while some were openly advocating the company to cancel the Maven contract.Months before it became public, senior Google officials were worried about how the Maven contract would be perceived inside and outside the company, The New York Times reported this week. By courting business with the Pentagon, they risked angering a number of the company\u2019s highly regarded A.I. researchers, who had vowed that their work would not become militarized.But if Google drops out of some or all of the competition to sell the software that will guide future weaponry, the Pentagon is likely to find plenty of other companies happy to take the lucrative business. A Defense Department spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Friday.The money for Google in the Project Maven contract was never large by the standards of a company with revenue of $110 billion last year \u2014 $9 million, one official told employees, or a possible $15 million over 18 months, according to an internal email.But some company officials saw it as an opening to much greater revenue down the road. In an email last September, a Google official in Washington told colleagues she expected Maven to grow into a $250 million-a-year project, and eventually it could have helped open the door to contracts worth far more; notably a multiyear, multibillion-dollar cloud computing project called JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure.Whether Google\u2019s Maven decision is a short-term reaction to employee protests and adverse news coverage or reflects a more sweeping strategy not to pursue military work is unclear. The question of whether a particular contract contributes to warfare does not always have a simple answer.When the Maven work came under fire inside Google, company officials asserted that it was not \u201coffensive\u201d in nature. But Maven is using the company\u2019s artificial intelligence software to improve the sorting and analysis of imagery from drones, and some drones rely on such analysis to identify human targets for lethal missile shots.Google management had told employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the use of artificial intelligence for defense and intelligence contracting. At Friday\u2019s meeting, Ms. Greene said the company was expected to announce those guidelines next week.Google has already said that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice and whether it would affect Google\u2019s pursuit of the JEDI contract.Defense Department officials are themselves wrestling with the complexity of their move into cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Critics have questioned the proposal to give the entire JEDI contract, which could extend for 10 years, to a single vendor. This week, officials announced they were slowing the contracting process down.Dana White, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said this week that the JEDI contract had drawn \u201cincredible interest\u201d and more than 1,000 responses to a draft request for proposals. But she said officials wanted to take their time.\u201dSo, we are working on it, but it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t rush toward failure,\u201d Ms. White said. \u201cThis is different for us. We have a lot more players in it. This is something different from some of our other acquisition programs because we do have a great deal of commercial interest.\u201dMs. Greene said the company probably would not have sought the Maven work if company officials had anticipated the criticism, according to notes on Ms. Greene\u2019s remarks taken by a Google employee and shared with The Times.Another person who watched the meeting added that Ms. Greene said Maven had been \u201cterrible for Google\u201d and that the decision to pursue the contract was done when Google was more aggressively going after military work.Google does other, more innocuous business with the Pentagon, including military advertising on Google properties and Google\u2019s ad platform, as well as providing web apps like email.Even though the internal protest has carried on for months, there was no indication that employee criticism of the deal was dying down.Earlier this week, one Google engineer \u2014 on the company\u2019s internal message boards \u2014 proposed the idea of employees protesting Google Cloud\u2019s conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco in July with a campaign called \u201cOccupy Moscone Center,\u201d fashioned after the Occupy Wall Street protests.That engineer resigned from the company this week in protest of Maven and planned for Friday to be his last day. But he said he was told on Friday morning to leave immediately, according to an email viewed by The Times.Peter W. Singer, who studies war and technology at New America, a Washington research group, said many of the tools the Pentagon was seeking were \u201cneither inherently military nor inherently civilian.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is not cannons and ballistic missiles.\u201d The same software that speeds through video shot with armed drones can be used to study customers in fast-food restaurants or movements on a factory floor.Mr. Singer also said he thought Google employees who denounced Maven were somewhat na\u00efve, because Google\u2019s search engine and the video platform of its YouTube division have been used for years by warriors of many countries, as well as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.\u201cThey may want to act like they\u2019re not in the business of war, but the business of war long ago came to them,\u201d said Mr. Singer, author of a book examining such issues called \u201cLikeWar,\u201d scheduled for publication in the fall.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco and Scott Shane reported from Baltimore.

It is a super fast way to have a timeline of all your primary source documents, and makes it easy to find them instantly in chronological order. Try it out. It is pretty cool.Away from the office, what tech product do you and your family love?What could be better with some of the tech tools you use?Trint is a tremendous technology. But it is still not perfect, particularly if the recording is not really sharp.Similarly, Logikcull is a super cool tool. But I think it needs to be tweaked before it can fully address my needs, such as being able to upload and optically recognize that 4,366-page FOIA response I got this month. I tried that and was told to break it up into 100-page chunks. (Not worth the effort, although the company told me that it would soon be able to handle bigger documents.)Most annoying: the fan on my ThinkPad laptop. It never seems to turn off.

Every day this week, we\u2019re bringing you the story of the life and death of Lavar Montray Douglas, known as Nook. He was 18 years old when he was killed by a police officer in Baltimore in 2016, a year after Freddie Gray died in police custody.In Part 4, we go to the heart of the problem with the Baltimore Police Department, beginning with the trial of officers from the Gun Trace Task Force \u2014 a plainclothes unit created during the peak of zero-tolerance policing \u2014 accused of stealing from residents for years. We talk to Leo Wise and Derek Hines, federal prosecutors nicknamed \u201cthe Twin Towers of Justice,\u201d because they are both very tall and thin. Their case started with a pair of heroin overdose deaths. As the case grew, it revealed a sprawling network of criminal activity, in which police officers used brass knuckles and baseball bats and went after drug dealers, because they kept cash.

{"Headline": "What Is ZTE? A Chinese Geopolitical Pawn That Trump Wants to Rescue.", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what you need to know.Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment, known as ZTE, makes cheap smartphones that are mostly sold in developing countries, though it also sells them in the United States.But ZTE is one of two Chinese companies \u2014 Huawei is the other \u2014 that sell equipment for cellular networks. It has about 75,000 employees and says it does business in more than 160 countries.That makes it an important geopolitical pawn for Beijing, both as an innovator and as a builder of state-funded projects overseas. If China wants to improve ties with a government in the developing world, it often offers loans that can be used to set a ZTE-powered cellular network.Longer term, China hopes that companies like ZTE will become powerhouses that can help the country wean itself from a reliance on American tech firms, which Beijing views as security threats because of the possibility that they could help Washington spy.Tech supply chains are so intertwined these days that just about every product that ZTE makes has some American components or software in it \u2014 think microchips, modems and Google\u2019s Android operating system. So if ZTE sells a smartphone to North Korea, it might also be selling a Qualcomm chip inside that phone. That\u2019s illegal under American sanctions that prohibit the sale of United States tech to embargoed countries.The Commerce Department wasn\u2019t done with that hefty penalty.That means no Qualcomm chips or Android software for its phones, and no American chips or other components for its cellular gear. Analysts estimate that four-fifths of ZTE\u2019s products have American components. ZTE went into a tailspin, saying last month that it had shut down major operations.The American president hasn\u2019t explained his decision to try to help the company, other than to cite the potential for lots of Chinese workers to lose their jobs. But ZTE\u2019s troubles come at a complicated moment.In normal times, the company\u2019s fate would be a legal matter for the Commerce Department. But the Trump administration is pressuring China to make trade concessions. It may also need Beijing\u2019s help to strike a deal with North Korea as Washington and Pyongyang plan a high-profile meeting on June 12 in Singapore.Mr. Trump appears to be using ZTE\u2019s punishment as a bargaining chip in negotiations with China, rather than a matter of law enforcement. It isn\u2019t clear what he will get in return for allowing ZTE to remain in business.\u25a0 ZTE must pay a $1 billion fine plus $400 million in escrow to cover \u201cany future violations.\u201d\u25a0 ZTE must allow a compliance team, chosen by the United States, to monitor the company.\u25a0 ZTE must also change its board of directors and executive team within 30 days.Some members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, say that absolving ZTE of its misdeeds runs counter to national security interests. It is unclear, however, whether their efforts to block Mr. Trump\u2019s moves regarding ZTE will be successful.\u201cTheir technology is a national security threat, according to our defense and law enforcement authorities,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said on Wednesday. \u201cWhy on earth is the Trump administration considering relaxing penalties on such a bad actor?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Is a Win for Consumers", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moore is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation.The Justice Department must now decide whether to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling, a move that would be sheer folly and a waste of taxpayer money, given the firm rejection of every argument the government\u2019s lawyers made. Hopefully, this decision will also clear the path for other planned cost-cutting mergers in the media and telecommunications industries.The government\u2019s antitrust challenge to this $85 billion deal was one of the flimsiest assaults against a corporate merger in recent memory. These two companies don\u2019t even directly compete with each other. Normally, antitrust cases are brought to block so-called \u201chorizontal\u201d mergers, in which companies in the same line of business \u2014 two airlines, for example \u2014 want to combine forces. Even in such instances, the antitrust laws are antiquated, given that globalized competition and the speed of technological change continually knock down industry leaders.The core argument brought by the Justice Department, in an antitrust action championed by President Trump, was that AT&T could use its new market power to raise prices exorbitantly on cable and satellite operators that want to run Time Warner TV programs \u2014 such as CNN broadcasts or HBO shows. The government\u2019s lawyers argued that consumers\u2019 cable bills would go up if the merger went through.The absurdity of this argument is that the Justice lawyers seemed to be stuck in the 1980s. In 2018, the number of American households getting their television or video entertainment from traditional cable providers is declining. The very notion of \u201cwatching TV\u201d is becoming as obsolete as listening to music on a turntable. My teenage kids and their friends don\u2019t even own TVs. They watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on their computers or smartphones, and one of their favorite \u201cchannels\u201d is YouTube. They can choose from thousands of programs at a very low cost. Today, any hotshot with a camera and a Facebook page can be a media company. Is that enough competition for the Justice Department?In short, there is probably no area in today\u2019s economy where there is less threat of monopolistic power than in media and entertainment. The proliferation of video content and ways to get it means that these companies must stay innovative and affordable, or they are gone as fast as you can say Blockbuster Video.In this cutthroat environment, the AT&T and Time Warner merger is better described as a survival strategy, not a market domination plot. The companies hope to lower costs by merging AT&T\u2019s transmission of video content with the entertainment products that Time Warner offers.This merger could bring welcome competition to Google and Facebook, which have captured about two-thirds of the online advertising market, a point that the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers ignored. Combining AT&T\u2019s mobile, broadband, and DirecTV platforms with Time Warner\u2019s movies, TV shows, music and sporting events could turn them into a serious rival to the tech behemoths.Businesses and families may also benefit from the merger if it accelerates the development of 5G wireless networks. The merged company could use its vast spectrum of resources to jump-start the delivery of Time Warner content through AT&T\u2019s wireless network. This will mean new competition for residential broadband from cable companies such as Comcast.The days when companies like U.S. Steel or General Motors or Microsoft could accumulate the market power to dominate an industry and gouge consumers with higher prices are long gone. Some of the most powerful companies in the world \u2014 Amazon and Walmart, for example \u2014 do just the opposite: they are constantly lowering, not raising their prices.It is too early to know whether this mega-deal will turn out well for shareholders and consumers. But the Justice Department should not be standing in the way. Its goal, instead, should be to allow made-in-America companies like AT&T and Time Warner to do what it takes to become global competitors, not global dinosaurs.The Trump administration should be thankful that, in this merger, it isn\u2019t China buying up America\u2019s strategic companies or assets. These are two American companies merging to gain profitability and global market share. In this way, the merger helps put America first. Someone, please tell the lawyers.Stephen Moore is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project for Economic Growth.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t. \u201cThere\u2019s something I have to tell you\u201d has never, in the history of man, been followed by \u201cWe won the lottery\u201d or \u201cI have discovered a cure for blindness.\u201d This is especially true when the person uttering that sentence is your husband, and he is about to die.I\u2019m not a big believer in deathbed confessions. I intend to keep it all to myself, unless my own \u201cThere\u2019s something I have to tell you\u201d is \u201cYou were always my favorite,\u201d to whoever walks in the room.Everybody should be at my deathbed. You won\u2019t regret it.John and I were lying in the cramped hospital bed that I had installed in my bedroom because I had decided to go full pioneer woman and tend to him myself. I\u2019m still not sure why. Normally I am the queen of outsourcing. Also, I am a terrible nurse.But my decision to care for him at home was made in an instant. He wanted to be here. Our 16-year-old twin boys desperately wanted him here. And so did I, despite the fact that this was the first time we had lived together in 25 years of marriage. We had always kept separate homes.A week earlier we had learned that John had three separate forms of cancer: pancreatic, liver and prostate. A \u201ccancer overachiever,\u201d as I told him. I can\u2019t remember the Yiddish phrase his doctor used to describe the usefulness of chemo or radiation, but it roughly translated to \u201cpissing in the wind.\u201d Solid, barrel-chested, bearded and floppy-haired, John had always looked like a Bugs Bunny cartoon version of the opera singer he was. I adored his looks. Now he was a skeleton.John spoke with difficulty as he held my hand. \u201cSo, there\u2019s something I have to tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a certain promise to Amy.\u201dAmy was his former wife. She had died of breast cancer about 30 years ago, before John and I met.\u201cI promised her,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we would be buried together.\u201dOh.It turns out that when John said he had kept Amy close, he hadn\u2019t been speaking metaphorically; she was in his closet at his studio apartment. Could I fetch her? Also, could I find her passport and death certificate? I would need them to carry out his plan.There was a field in Northern England where John had played as a child. He wanted to be buried there. With Amy. But not scattered. The field still existed, but the area was no longer so rural, and John didn\u2019t want to end up blanketing a local parking lot.So I was to take his box of ashes and Amy\u2019s, get a shovel and probably a flashlight, because this was illegal so we\u2019d need to do it at night, the funereal equivalent of a dine-and-dash. Joining me would be John\u2019s 90-year-old sister and his nephew, along with our sons, Henry and Gus, who were currently far more focused on the adventure of the illicit burial than on what it all meant.\u201cI\u2019d always been sure you\u2019d go first,\u201d John added, sadly.The fact that I am 30 years younger had in no way deterred him from this thought. John seemed the grumpiest of men, but in key ways he was an optimist.\u201cAnd of course I would have followed your instructions for your own burial,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have cremated you and placed you in the mausoleum with your parents. I know you wanted nothing more.\u201dThis didn\u2019t seem the time to point out that for at least 10 years I had been telling him that I loathed the mausoleum, that I had arranged for my body to be donated to a medical school, and that I had put aside money for a big party afterward.John never listened. That, combined with his almost comical frugality (I already had been warned I would need to find the cheapest cremation place in New York) had often threatened to sink our marriage. But I guess I could save that conversation to have with myself, late at night. Plenty of time for that. Not much time for anything else.We talked and talked. \u201cI was a good husband, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d he said. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t chase after girls.\u201d (No, I thought a little churlishly. Because then you would have had to pay for them.) \u201cYou were wonderful,\u201d I said. Both thoughts were true.He wanted to make sure I understood his plan. But about 30 minutes into this conversation, he suddenly looked sheepish, as if it had just occurred to him that his wife of 25 years may not actually be on board to carry out this promise he had made to his former wife more than three decades earlier.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this right away,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, you could wait until you go, and then have the boys take all three of us. That would be fine too.\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d I said.Amy was Midwestern, blond, aristocratic and gracious, an accomplished equestrian and mezzo-soprano 17 years older than John. Before she got sick, they had worked their way across Europe, singing at all the big opera houses. She was everything I am not.John and I used to joke that the only thing he and I had in common was a mutual antipathy for fish. Amy and John shared everything. He loved us both, and he made a family with me. But I never kid myself.I explained the situation to my friend Hilary over lunch, including the part where I could hold off on the burial until my own demise. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to be their ashy third wheel,\u201d I groused.\u201cHere\u2019s what you do,\u201d Hilary said. \u201cYou put Amy in some sort of suspicious container \u2014 something metal that the T.S.A. people can\u2019t see through in the screening. Amy looks like a bomb. Oops! The T.S.A. will just have to keep her. Oh well! You tried.\u201dI could have explained instead of laughing, I suppose. But it\u2019s hard, without sounding saccharine. One of the things I loved about my husband was that he kept his promises \u2014 even stupid ones that made no difference to anyone but himself. You wanted a light bulb changed? It was going to be changed, exactly at the time he said, and it would be with the 60-watt bulb, not the 100, because \u2026 who the hell knows, he had his reasons.This punctiliousness and attention to detail meant he didn\u2019t make promises freely, and he said \u201cNo\u201d to life far more often than he said \u201cYes.\u201d But also, this reliability was at the center of his John-ness. He lived small. But he loved deep.John couldn\u2019t quite remember where Amy\u2019s papers were, but he knew they were in his apartment, and I did too, since he threw out nothing. During the search I found other things I wanted to ask him about. Why did my peace-loving husband have a police summons for disorderly conduct in 2002 that he never mentioned to me? Why were there photos of him happily rowing a woman I had never heard about in a pond in Central Park, and why was she dressed as a mime?By the time I decided to ask, he could no longer speak. He had the most beautiful voice, a basso profundo, and I am glad our last conversations did not involve the police or mysterious mimes.I found the papers in about 30 seconds. He didn\u2019t even need to tell me where he put them. I knew my husband.John died three days later, on his 86th birthday, which, since he was a fan of order and symmetry, seemed purposeful. My son Henry\u2019s response, when I broke the news: \u201cWell, the good news is, now you get to be the favorite parent.\u201dIn August, Henry, Gus and I will be headed to England. The cremation was super-cheap, and the container is plastic. I have gotten four Newcastle United stickers so that Henry can decorate it with his favorite team. Amy and her papers are with us, too. I will let my sons carry John, and I will carry Amy. I want her to get there safely.She has been waiting to join John for a long time, though I doubt he ever said to her, \u201cHey, do you want to be secretly buried in an English field in the middle of nowhere?\u201dIn my life, I have been so lucky. Though I do wonder: Is this my love story? Is it theirs?Maybe it\u2019s ours.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China Trade War, Apple Worries It Will Be Collateral Damage", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, may be the leader of the world\u2019s most valuable public company, but lately he has had to act a lot like the tech industry\u2019s top diplomat.Last month he visited the Oval Office to warn President Trump that tough talk on China could threaten Apple\u2019s position in the country. In March, at a major summit meeting in Beijing, he called for \u201ccalmer heads\u201d to prevail between the world\u2019s two most powerful countries.Since he took over Apple from its co-founder Steve Jobs, in 2011, questions about whether Mr. Cook, 57, could recreate the magic that led to the iPod and iPhone have persisted. For Mr. Cook, the analogous breakthrough \u2014 and potentially his legacy as the heir to Mr. Jobs \u2014 has come not from a gadget, but from a geography: China.Under Mr. Cook\u2019s leadership, Apple\u2019s business in China grew from a fledgling success to an empire with annual revenues of around $50 billion \u2014 just a bit under a quarter of what the company takes in worldwide. He did this while China was tightening internet controls and shutting out other American tech giants.The Trump administration has told Mr. Cook that it would not place tariffs on iPhones, which are assembled in China, according to a person familiar with the talks who declined to speak on the record for fear of upsetting negotiations. But Apple is worried China will retaliate in ways that hamstring its business, according to three people close to Apple who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.There is also concern that Apple could face reprisals for legal and regulatory efforts in Washington that have made it difficult for the Chinese tech giant Huawei to sell its phones and telecom equipment in the United States.Apple executives and lobbyists in Beijing and Washington, led by Mr. Cook, have been trying to work both sides. They have fostered close ties to the administration of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, an effort called Red Apple by employees at Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, after the official color of the Chinese Communist Party.At the same time, Mr. Cook has been pleading with the Trump White House to understand that a trade war is bad for the economy \u2014 and bad for Apple.Mr. Cook, who knows a bit of Mandarin, has attended China\u2019s most important political events in a critical year for Mr. Xi. Days after a Chinese Communist Party congress wrote Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas and name into the constitution, elevating him to the same status as Mao Zedong, Mr. Cook joined a small group of American and Chinese executives for a meeting where Mr. Xi lectured about innovation and reform.Later, Mr. Cook attended China\u2019s World Internet Conference, an effort by Beijing to create a Davos-like conference for technology. There he met Wang Huning, a new member of China\u2019s standing committee \u2014 the party\u2019s top leadership group \u2014 and an ideological force behind China\u2019s deepening authoritarianism.In March, just after an annual meeting of China\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament formally abolished presidential term limits, Mr. Cook attended a major summit meeting that brings together Chinese policymakers and corporate leaders.Then Mr. Cook switched to explaining why he thought a trade war would reverse the new tax law\u2019s progress, the people said. Mr. Cook told the president that tariffs were effectively a tax on consumers and that the trade deficit with China is inflated because of flaws in how it is calculated, one of the people said.\u201cHe was very helpful in making some suggestions, and I might also add he loves the tax cut and tax reform,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC shortly after the meeting. \u201cHe says Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.\u201dMr. Trump has also told crowds this year that Apple planned to build multiple factories in the United States. Apple has no plans to do so and has not publicly corrected him.He has met with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, but they tend to disagree on trade issues, this person said, and he has avoided engaging with perhaps the administration\u2019s most hawkish member on trade, Peter Navarro, a top adviser to the president.Mr. Cook still sees an opening to engage on the trade issue because of disagreement inside the White House, and he doubts that a trade war \u2014 or Chinese retaliation against Apple \u2014 ultimately will happen, this person said.\u201cHe\u2019s willing to put a brave face on and work with the Trump administration because they probably have more at stake than any other tech company when it comes to China and the tariffs,\u201d said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and partner at the investment firm Loup Ventures.The specter of Chinese retaliation against Apple has increased since the administration targeted the Chinese tech company ZTE for breaking American sanctions against Iran and North Korea. But the administration backed away from stiffer penalties this month and said it would fine ZTE $1 billion and install a compliance team picked by the United States.Apple, meanwhile, has a deal with China\u2019s biggest telecom company, China Mobile, giving it a direct channel to nearly 900 million subscribers in China. The competition to sell smartphones in the country has become increasingly intense, with a number of other Chinese companies also offering high-end \u2014 but usually lower-priced \u2014 phones.Mr. Cook\u2019s frequent visits to China are part of Apple\u2019s increased efforts to court China\u2019s leadership, started in 2016 after the country suddenly removed Apple\u2019s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store there.The company has reason to fear retaliation. In 2014, the Obama administration indicted five Chinese military hackers, stoking tensions already high from leaks about American surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.Apple\u2019s primary leverage with the Chinese government is Chinese consumers\u2019 love for Apple products, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents Apple and other tech companies.However, Mr. Garfield added, Chinese consumers would also love Facebook and Google, two products blocked in China. \u201cThere are limits,\u201d he said. \u201cXi and the national party will do what\u2019s in their interest.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco and Washington, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Case Was So Closely Watched", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision was no less momentous for President Trump\u2019s Justice Department which, in suing to block the deal, was advocating a new approach to antitrust regulation.Here\u2019s a primer on what happened:The Justice Department said it would consider its options.CVS and Aetna also rose, while Express Scripts, which is being acquired by insurer Cigna, added about 5 percent. Cigna also rose.In the past, regulators have instead focused on keeping one company, or a small group of companies, from owning too much of any one specific industry. It comes up when companies buy their competitors \u2014 what\u2019s known as horizontal integration.What makes the AT&T decision noteworthy is that the deal was challenged even though it doesn\u2019t share all the characteristics of horizontal integration.\u201cVertical mergers do not fit the traditional horizontal-merger analytical framework used by the U.S. regulatory authorities,\u201d R. Mark McCareins, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, wrote in an online discussion about vertical mergers. It means the trade commission and the Department of Justice \u201care faced with pounding a square peg into a round hole.\u201dDoing so might have encouraged the Justice Department to act more aggressively when looking at deals in the future, and also could have prompted a rethink by companies with similar deals in the works.He could have approved it but attached conditions. The aim of the conditions could broadly have been to keep AT&T from using its control of providers like HBO or CNN as a weapon to increase costs for its rivals. The Justice Department argued that AT&T could charge rivals a high price for, say, HBO to make AT&T\u2019s own product more competitive.One way to address this could have been to appoint a third party to oversee disagreements between AT&T and the cable companies that want to license Time Warner content. The government didn\u2019t like that approach.Another option was to demand that AT&T and Time Warner sell off some plum assets. AT&T and Time Warner didn\u2019t like this approach, so was expected to appeal any such decision.Yup. Time Warner owns CNN, which President Trump has publicly and repeatedly attacked as fake news.An earlier version of this article misstated the structure of a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint. T-Mobile will acquire its rival mobile-service provider Sprint, not the other way around.Advertisement"}

As founding partner Alex Josephson explains, for Partisans, \u201cmisbehavior\u201d leads to true innovation \u2014 the kind that marries technology and craftsmanship to invent new processes and produce works of artistry.\n\u201cWe love the big vision, but then there are people in our studio who use craft to develop human-scale design,\u201d Josephson says. \u201cThey get down to the detail of a finger interacting with an object, or designing a garbage bin that is safe for security.\u201d\nAs the firm\u2019s mantra has led them from work on bars and private residences to train stations and master plans for entire neighborhoods, the world has begun to take notice: In 2017, their audacious design concept for a ferry terminal in Seoul was awarded the American Architecture Prize Design of the Year for Transportation.\nTheir work, on the surface, may seem to be about wondrous moments and rule-bending forms, but it\u2019s what leads to those moments that drives the firm \u2014 discovering new tools, working with engineers and fabricators, and using technical limitations to generate unconventional works of intricate beauty.\nThe curves, however, are not just for awe. With nine kilometers of grooves precisely milled by computer-numerical controlled machinery, they also become functional, as small indentations become bowls and waves become armrests. For this, Partisans worked with engineers to write software that would allow the fabricators to use the CNC as a sculpting tool.\nThough the milling process is not unusual, achieving this level and scale of craftsmanship was entirely new. When the American Institute of Architects gave the project an R+D award in 2015, the juror Marc Fornes called it \u201can exquisite application of the technology.\u201d\nOver at the newly built restaurant Quetzal, a 65-seat space with a high-end regional Mexican concept, all cooking will be done with wood fire on a huge indoor grill \u2014 an idea van Gameren had without fully thinking through the monstrous ventilation system all that smoke would require.\nPartisans\u2019 solution? Hide the system\u2019s guts behind a low, undulating ceiling. This simple detail turned what could have been a disastrous limitation into an intimate \u201cmoment,\u201d\u00a0achieving what Josephson describes as the feeling of being \u201cinside a soft market tent.\u201d\nA \u201cconstant relay race\u201d is how Josephson describes the team dynamic. \u201cYou need to be able to hand the baton off at certain points and let responsibilities ebb and flow,\u201d he says. The union that has evolved is one largely of equals, though it\u2019s not without its tensions. Adds Baktash: \u201cIf you\u2019re not passionate, you don\u2019t fight for what matters.\u201d\nPartisans\u2019 role in the experiment is to design shelter structures that promote \u201coutdoor comfort\u201d in collaboration with the engineering firm RWDI. Together, they are devising a deployable system that will adapt year-round to the harsh demands of the Lake Ontario waterfront. \u201cWe are using microclimate data to dictate and automate the design so that it responds to the environment,\u201d says Baktash. \u201cThe goal is to create comfortable moments for humans, at a human scale.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s innovation at the forefront of urban planning or adapting the complex, hand-sculpted lighting installations they\u2019ve designed  for retail by the Barcelona lighting house Parachilna, Josephson remains obsessed with creating ideas and ways of working that haven\u2019t been seen before.\n\u201cI feel like as long as we are genuinely inventing tools,\u201d he says, \u201cthe resultant forms, spaces and experiences that those tools generate will always be unexpected.\u201d\nPhotography: Ian PattersonThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "The Trump Trade Slump May Yet Happen: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump broke with protocol by tweeting about jobs report\u2022 Investors have compared Facebook\u2019s actions to human rights violations\u2022 Deutsche Bank can\u2019t catch a break\u2022 Goldman\u2019s consumer finance plans are bigger than you thoughtBefore Donald Trump became president, many feared that the combative trade policies he was proposing would sock the U.S. economy and send unemployment higher.Is this unexpected state of affairs sustainable?If anything, the strength of the economy might persuade Mr. Trump that he can pursue his trade agenda without causing too much collateral damage at home. That could mean following through on his threats to impose tariffs on Chinese products totaling as much as $150 billion.Whether Mr. Trump does so should become clear soon. On June 15, the administration is scheduled to release a final list of $50 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs, which would then be imposed shortly thereafter.Some in the administration have warned that a protectionist trade policy could drag the economy and the stock market. But the longer the economy keeps churning out jobs, and the longer the stock market remains resilient, the harder it will be for those advisers to make their case. Indeed, the U.S. may be less sensitive to trade frictions than economists and investors previously believed.But that is a very optimistic scenario, and much could still go wrong.The metals tariffs, alone, are unlikely to crater the markets or hammer the economy. But a full-blown trade war with China, involving $150 billion of tariffs and everything China has promised in retaliation, would almost certainly shake the confidence of investors and businesses. Tomasz Wieladek, an economist at Barclays, in a report on Friday said the metals tariffs and those against China, along with retaliatory actions, could knock nearly a full percentage point off global growth.The fact that the stock market hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since mid-February,when the trade rhetoric heated up, suggests investors never really shrugged off the prospect of trade wars. Now, as a confrontation with China approaches, markets may become volatile as investors prepare for the fallout.It\u2019s also important to remember that the strength of the economy is not an unalloyed positive. If the buoyant conditions, and the impact of new tariffs, produce higher inflation, the Federal Reserve will have less leeway to relax monetary policy in response to a big trade shock or a stock market plunge. In other words, investors would have no protection from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.One way to view the current situation is that Mr. Trump is an opportunist who has astutely ridden an economic expansion that had long been underway \u2013 and is now hoping it will carry him through a drawn-out trade battle.It\u2019s a bold, far from certain, bet.\u2014Peter EavisThe Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month. The night before, under longstanding tradition, the president and several senior administration officials \u2014 including the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 are briefed on the numbers, which they are not supposed to disclose until the report is made public at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning.But Mr. Trump, who was briefed on the numbers Thursday evening, appeared to foreshadow the strength of the latest report on Friday morning on Twitter.Market watchers saw evidence that the tweet was moving markets.Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, pushed back on whether Mr. Trump broke with protocol.President Trump tweeted earlier this morning that he was looking forward to the jobs report. We now know why.Drew Armstrong, a reporter at Bloomberg, tweeted the strong reaction of the dollar after the report\u2019s release:SoftBank\u2019s investment in G.M.\u2019s driverless car division and Waymo\u2019s move to create a huge fleet of robot-taxis suggest maybe not.G.M. CruiseWaymoThose numbers don\u2019t bode well for Uber\u2019s autonomous car technology. SoftBank\u2019s investment only serves to reinforce that ill feeling.What\u2019s next for Uber\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWall Street profit forecasts follow a typical trajectory: Start high and steadily decline until the company reports and usually beats that lowered bar.Through the first two months of the second quarter, that\u2019s not happening. Analysts have raised second-quarter earnings estimates for S.&P. 500 companies 0.2 percent during April and May, according to FactSet.That might not seem like much, but over the past 10 years, quarterly earnings estimates have declined, on average, 3.7 percent during the first two months of that quarter.The gain so far this quarter falls well short of the record set during the first two months of the first quarter of this year. As analysts factored in tax cuts signed into law in late 2017, they raised profit expectations 5.7 percent in January and February.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the centrist Democrat from North Dakota who is fighting a pitched battle to save her seat, has gotten a lift from an unlikely source: the conservative billionaire Koch brothers.The ad is the latest evidence that the brothers, often at odds with President Trump, may be moving away from strictly partisan work on behalf of Republicans in favor of initiatives that will advance their libertarian-leaning legislative priorities, including free trade, immigration legislation and access to medicines, regardless of party affiliation.Ms. Heitkamp is one of 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump in 2016, but unlike other Democrats, she has drawn a top-flight challenger in Kevin Cramer, North Dakota\u2019s lone House member and a close ally of the president\u2019s. Her seat is one of the keys to Republican efforts to hold on to or expand the party\u2019s one-seat Senate majority.The former Treasury secretary has joined the board of the Financial Services Volunteer Corps, an organization that helps build up the banking systems in developing countries, the group announced on Friday.Founded in 1990 at the behest of President George H. W. Bush to help Eastern European countries following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Corps now provides technical assistance to emerging economies worldwide. Its board includes Paul Volcker, Henry Kissinger, the former Goldman Sachs co-president John Thornton and the former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.Mr. Lew, who served a number of advisory roles in the Obama administration before becoming Treasury secretary in 2013, is taking the board seat that had been held by Randy Quarles, who is now the Fed\u2019s vice chair for supervision.From Mr. Lew\u2019s statement:And from a statement by Bill Donaldson, the former banker and S.E.C. chairman, who serves as the Corps\u2019s chairman:\u201cJack is an outstanding addition to our Board. His vast experience working at the most senior levels of government will be invaluable to FSVC as we look to position the organization optimally in the coming years.\u201dThe news appears to align European officials with President Trump over the issue.It will be interesting to see whether pressure from the U.S. and the E.U. on this front can actually affect any change, given China\u2019s burning desire to become a technology powerhouse.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u201cWe are not going to enter into any negotiations.\u201dMs. Malmstrom also said that Europe was \u201cnot in a trade war,\u201d butconceded that it was \u201cin a very difficult situation caused by the U.S.\u201d\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe Brazilian oil giant\u2019s stock fell dramatically on Friday amid word that the company\u2019s president, Pedro Parente, had tendered his resignation and met with government officials to discuss his exit.Petrobras announces the resignation of President Pedro Parente on the morning of Friday, 1st. The executive is in a meeting with the President of the Republic Michel Temer at the moment, in the Palace of the Planalto. The meeting comes after the government launches measures costing $ 13.5 billion to lower the price of diesel and help close the truckers\u2019 strike.\u201cA lot has happened since last year when we were here,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg said yesterday as he opened his social network\u2019s annual investor meeting. Attendees agreed \u2014 and didn\u2019t hold back in telling him so.One investor compared the social network\u2019s poor stewardship of user data to a human rights violation. Another warned that scandal is not good for Facebook\u2019s bottom line. And one advised chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg to emulate George Washington, not Vladimir Putin, and avoid turning Facebook into a \u201ccorporate dictatorship.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg told investors that the company was spending heavily to solve its problems. But he added that shareholder proposals for fixing them had been shot down \u2014 partly by his supervoting stock.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be one of the big leading consumer banks \u2014 we can have a narrow slice of share and have a very big, very profitable, very differentiated business over a period of time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His family has been searching for answers ever since. Part 5 is the conclusion of our series. We talk to Nook\u2019s mother, Toby Douglas, about how grief has changed her. She tried joining a support group for mothers, many of whom now fight to stop gun violence. But her son had a gun, and he was shooting it. Toby and her mother, Davetta Parker, think they know the name of the police officer who killed Nook. They\u2019ve heard it around the streets. We visit him at his home in the suburbs, and he\u2019s not at all who we expected. Nook would have turned 20 in late May. We drive with Toby to tie balloons at his grave and to a stop sign at the corner of Windsor Avenue and North Warwick Avenue, where he was killed. She often goes there to feel close to Nook, sometimes sleeping in her car at the intersection.One day, Toby gets a phone call. It\u2019s the police.

{"Headline": "Stock Markets Slip on Trade Policy Fears", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors have stopped not caring about a trade war.For months, financial markets shrugged off the escalating language and the imposition of tit-for-tat tariffs between the Trump administration and the United States\u2019 most important trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union and China.But in the past several trading sessions, that apathy has been replaced by what looks like mounting alarm about the prospect of a global race to erect trade barriers.On Monday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell sharply, ending the day down 1.4 percent, apparently spooked by signs that the growing trade war could have a negative impact on American companies. That decline, and similar ones in other benchmark indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average, came after the S.& P. slumped 0.9 percent last week.\u201cI think we\u2019re slowly slipping into a more serious stage in the trade war,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cPeople are beginning to realize there\u2019s no sign of de-escalation in sight.\u201dThe sell-off is increasingly broad. Tech shares joined industrials in a sharp fall as American markets opened Monday, after reports that President Trump was considering restrictions on Chinese investments in American technology companies.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index and the tech sector of the S.&P. 500 both fell more than 2 percent.Semiconductor companies were especially hard hit.The chip makers Micron Technology and AMD fell 6.9 percent and 4.4 percent. Intel dropped 3.4 percent. Concerns about the impact of a trade war seemed to be spreading to some giant tech companies, including Apple, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, and Microsoft. Because of those companies\u2019 large sizes, moves in their stock prices have big impacts on stock market indexes.Industrials also continued to respond poorly to the trade rancor. The S.&P. 500\u2019s industrial sector fell more than 1 percent, led by drops in American manufacturers like the aircraft maker Boeing and the machinery manufacturer Caterpillar, both of which have large and important markets in China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Ups Its Bid for 21st Century Fox to $71.3 Billion", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Walt Disney Company sharply increased its offer for 21st Century Fox on Wednesday, as it looks to win a bidding war with Comcast for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s entertainment conglomerate.The Comcast chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, is equally motivated to reach an agreement with Mr. Murdoch, who has spent a lifetime forging a media empire that spans three continents, including Hollywood studios, cable networks and streaming businesses.But Disney has the pole position for now. \u201cWe remain convinced that the combination of 21CF\u2019s iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney\u2019s will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world,\u201d Mr. Murdoch said in the statement.Comcast declined to comment.At stake in this bidding war is the 20th Century Fox film studio, the FX and National Geographic cable channels, almost two dozen regional sports networks, and a large stake in a pair of sought-after international media businesses: the European pay-TV operator Sky and Star India. Not included in the sale are Fox News, the Fox broadcast network, a chain of local television stations and the FS1 sports network.Separately, Comcast is bidding against Fox for the 61 percent of Sky not already owned by Fox.Fox\u2019s robust foreign assets are a central reason Comcast and Disney are pursuing a deal as they, like other media companies, grapple with a challenge to their cornerstone business: the loss of cable and satellite customers.Gaining Fox\u2019s assets would also give the winner control over the streaming service Hulu, which added three million subscribers in the first four months of this year, for a total of 20 million. Selling TV shows directly to viewers is the latest strategy for media businesses under threat from Silicon Valley, where cash-rich behemoths like Netflix, Google and Amazon are competing for ad dollars and audiences.\u201cAt a time of dynamic change in the entertainment industry, the combination of Disney\u2019s and Fox\u2019s unparalleled collection of businesses and franchises will allow us to create more appealing high-quality content,\u201d Mr. Iger said in a statement.Disney\u2019s increased offer comprises an equal mix of cash and stock: $35.7 billion in cash and 343 million shares in Disney. Fox shareholders can elect to receive either $38 in cash for every Fox share or Disney stock at an equivalent value. Disney plans to offer a ratio of its shares for every Fox share to make sure investors receive a value of $38 per share, what is known as a collar.Fox has postponed its scheduled July 10 shareholder vote so that investors will have time to consider the new bid. A new date has not been set.Mr. Iger disagreed with the notion that the AT&T ruling had paved the way for other big mergers. \u201cIt\u2019s just simply an apples-to-oranges comparison,\u201d he said on a call with analysts Wednesday, citing Judge Richard J. Leon\u2019s warning that any attempt to apply his decision to future deals should be avoided.And Comcast apparently does not have the fondest feelings for Disney: The Jurassic Park rides at the company\u2019s Universal theme parks include Disney\u2019s famous mouse-ears hat floating in the water next to a raft that a dinosaur has destroyed.\u201cHe essentially didn\u2019t want to be known as the guy who destroyed Disney,\u201d Mr. Wieser added. \u201cThere\u2019s something to the idea that you don\u2019t leave it in a bad place.\u201dMr. Iger\u2019s latest maneuver puts Mr. Roberts on his back foot. The leader of Comcast has big ambitions to seal his family's legacy. His father started the company in 1963 and transformed it from a small cable service in Tupelo, Miss., into the nation\u2019s largest cable provider, with nearly 30 million subscribers.Mr. Roberts has handed operational duties to his executives \u2014 Stephen B. Burke leads NBCUniversal group and David N. Watson runs the cable business \u2014 as he spends most of his time analyzing acquisitions, several people familiar with him have said. In other words, mergers are his specialty.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised by another potentially compelling response from Comcast,\u201d said Tuna Amobi, a research analyst with CFRA, raising concerns of a \u201cprotracted bidding war.\u201dA revised bid would mean more borrowing for Comcast. Both the Fox and separate Sky deals would mean assuming the debt of each company in addition to the extra borrowing, a sum that would total $170 billion, according to credit ratings firm Moody\u2019s.Disney also counts a steep debt load at about $25 billion, which does not include its latest offer of $35.7 billion in cash and an assumption of nearly $14 billion of Fox\u2019s debt.Analysts have bruited about the notion that Comcast and Disney might team up and divide Fox\u2019s assets to prevent a drawn-out bidding war \u2014 a turn of events that Mr. Iger has dismissed. \u201cWe have an agreement in place with 21st Century Fox that precludes that from occurring,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Way to Pay Songwriters and Musicians in the Streaming Age Advances", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a decade, the music industry has promoted a motley series of copyright bills to Congress, only to watch them fail.In an effort to update music copyright law for the digital age, the various players involved \u2014 tech companies, music publishers, songwriters, musicians and radio broadcasters \u2014 assembled an ambitious bill that addressed their concerns.\u201cThis is going to revolutionize the way songwriters get paid in America,\u201d said Dina LaPolt, a lawyer who has been one of the music industry\u2019s most aggressive supporters of the bill.For years, songwriters and music publishers have argued that streaming services have routinely failed to properly acquire mechanical licenses \u2014 the permission to reproduce a piece of music for sale or consumption, a term that goes back to the days of player pianos. At the same time, Spotify and other companies said that there was no authoritative database identifying who owned what.David Israelite, the president of the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association and one of the main drivers behind the bill, said that the prospect of continuing litigation brought the tech companies to the table.\u201cI have no doubt that we could have sued them out of existence,\u201d Mr. Israelite said of streaming services. \u201cBut we took a different approach. We decided that we wanted to settle this and try to fix the problem, because we want them to be our business partners.\u201dLobbyists said they were confident the bill would be passed by the full Senate, and eventually become law, despite concerns raised by a few senators at the hearing. A version of the bill passed the House unanimously in April.The legislation would establish a licensing collective, to be overseen by songwriters and publishers, and paid for by the digital services, with rights information maintained by the copyright owners. Digital services, which now must track down rights holders or file notices in bulk with the Copyright Office, will be able to receive blanket licenses from the collective. In exchange, the services will gain protections against lawsuits.Some Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, including the Texas senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, expressed reservations on Thursday about a collective established by the government rather than the free market, but still voted in favor of the bill.Christopher Harrison, the chief executive of the Digital Media Association, a group that includes Google, Apple and Amazon, said that the new process would remove the bad faith that has existed between music publishers and streaming services.\u201cI describe those conversations as like the end of a Tarantino movie, where everybody is pointing guns at each other and claiming it\u2019s the other person\u2019s fault,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cWe had a number of really frank conversations with publishers, saying, \u2018Let\u2019s get past who is to blame and figure out how to solve the problem.\u2019\u201dA critical element of the bill would allow musicians to be paid for digital plays of recordings made before 1972, which are not covered by federal copyright. At a Senate hearing last month, Smokey Robinson called that rule unfair. \u201cAn arbitrary date on the calendar,\u201d he said, \u201cshould not be the arbiter of value.\u201dThe bill also includes two provisions favored by Ascap and BMI, the industry\u2019s two biggest royalty clearinghouses, over the complex procedures used to set royalty rates in federal courts.Both groups, which are governed by federal regulations, would be able to introduce new kinds of evidence in court. Those trials are now overseen by a pair of federal judges whose decisions are endlessly scrutinized for clues about future cases; under the Music Modernization Act, the cases would be randomly assigned to a pool of judges in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the bill\u2019s backers argue would make the process more fair.The Music Modernization Act combines parts of several proposals made over the last year. But some parts of the legislation have been proposed before in separate bills, most of which collapsed from disputes among warring factions of the music industry.\u201cCongress was getting tired of us coming to them with narrow fixes,\u201d said Daryl Friedman, the chief advocacy officer of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammy Awards.Although lobbyists agreed on a compromise bill that has broad support, one long-sought change to copyright law \u2014 the ability for performers and record companies to be paid when songs are played on terrestrial radio, in addition to songwriters \u2014 was sacrificed to gain support from broadcasters, who for decades have bitterly opposed such a change.The bill does have its detractors, including publishers that did not want to relinquish the right to sue digital services. Christian Castle, a lawyer and blogger who is often critical of Silicon Valley, said the bill also does not adequately provide for the costs of setting up a comprehensive rights database.\u201cIt is a phenomenally huge undertaking which has befuddled everybody,\u201d Mr. Castle said, \u201cand there is no process for it.\u201dIf it goes through, the bill is likely to bring about the most sweeping changes to music copyright law since the passage of the Copyright Act of 1976.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Passes Sweeping Law to Protect Online Privacy", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California has passed a digital privacy law granting consumers more control over and insight into the spread of their personal information online, creating one of the most significant regulations overseeing the data-collection practices of technology companies in the United States.The bill raced through the State Legislature without opposition on Thursday and was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, just hours before a deadline to pull from the November ballot an initiative seeking even tougher oversight over technology companies.The new law grants consumers the right to know what information companies are collecting about them, why they are collecting that data and with whom they are sharing it. It gives consumers the right to tell companies to delete their information as well as to not sell or share their data. Businesses must still give consumers who opt out the same quality of service.It also makes it more difficult to share or sell data on children younger than 16.The legislation, which goes into effect in January 2020, makes it easier for consumers to sue companies after a data breach. And it gives the state\u2019s attorney general more authority to fine companies that don\u2019t adhere to the new regulations.But Aleecia M. McDonald, an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in privacy policy, said California\u2019s privacy measure was one of the most comprehensive in the United States, since most existing laws \u2014 and there are not many \u2014 do little to limit what companies can do with consumer information.\u201cIt\u2019s a step forward, and it should be appreciated as a step forward when it\u2019s been a long time since there were any steps,\u201d Ms. McDonald said.If the bill had failed to pass before the deadline, the proponents of the ballot initiative would have taken their case straight to voters in November, they said.The state\u2019s technology and business lobbies were opposed to the measure that was passed on Thursday, but they didn\u2019t try to derail it because they thought the ballot initiative was worse.Even legislators who voted for the bill complained that they had little choice because a ballot measure would provide less flexibility to make changes in the future. And some privacy advocates said the bill did not go as far as the ballot initiative in allowing individuals to sue for not complying.Mr. Mactaggart said he wanted a sensible privacy law, whether through a ballot measure or the legislative process. He said that the Legislature was the right place to debate such a policy, but that it had been hard to get legislators to address privacy.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the initiative process in California, we wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart said in an interview.One of the authors of the new law, Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat, tried last year to pass a bill that would have required internet service providers to seek permission from customers before accessing, selling or sharing their browser activity. The bill never made it out of committee \u2014 an example of the influence of telecommunications and technology companies in California.\u201cThis is a huge step forward to people all across the country dealing with this very challenging issue,\u201d State Senator Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat and a co-author of the bill, said at a news conference after it was signed.The ballot initiative, which would have made it easier for private individuals to sue companies for not adhering to its privacy requirements, had drawn vocal opposition from industry groups that worried about the potential liability risk.The measure included a provision that would have required a 70 percent majority in both houses of the Legislature to approve any changes after it became law.Google, Facebook, Verizon, Comcast and AT&T each contributed $200,000 to a committee opposing the proposed ballot measure, and lobbyists had estimated that businesses would spend $100 million to campaign against it before the November election.Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association, an industry group that includes Google, Facebook and Amazon, said in a statement that the new law contained many \u201cproblematic provisions.\u201d But the group did not try to obstruct it, he added, because \u201cit prevents the even worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201dMr. Callahan said the group would \u201cwork to correct the inevitable, negative policy and compliance ramifications this last-minute deal will create.\u201dLegislators said they expected to pass \u201ccleanup bills\u201d to make any fixes to the law in the 18 months before it takes effect. Some privacy advocates are worried that lobbyists for business and technology groups will use that time to water it down.Mr. Mactaggart said those concerns are \u201coverblown.\u201d\u201cHaving gotten this right, it\u2019ll be very hard to take it away,\u201d he said, noting that the ballot measure had been polling at around 80 percent approval. \u201cThey can\u2019t rewrite the law.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Demystifying the Blockchain", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThis is bonkers.A new so-called blockchain company is selling virtual real estate online with prices as high as $120,000 for a 10-meter by 10-meter piece of virtual land.You can buy a plot of virtual land in a virtual city, with certain neighborhoods costing more than others, like in a real city.Except that it isn\u2019t a real city. It is all virtual.Follow? Me neither.Welcome to the world of blockchain, the latest technological revolution to those in-the-know \u2014 and what seems like the latest get-rich-quick gibberish to the average person.When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.If you\u2019re like most people, that\u2019s when you stopped understanding \u2014 or even trying to understand \u2014 what this whole blockchain thing is all about. (Stick with me for a moment and I promise you\u2019ll understand it very soon.)It all feels a bit like 1999, circa the dot-com bubble. In Cannes, France, just last week, at an annual gathering of advertisers, there was a \u201cblockchain yacht\u201d and a \u201cblockchain villa.\u201d In Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year, there was a \u201cblockchain lounge.\u201dMeanwhile, Fortune 500 companies are investing billions in the blockchain. IBM has a whole division focused on blockchain, as do the consultancies Accenture and PwC. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, has dismissed Bitcoin, but says \u201cthe blockchain is real.\u201dSilicon Valley venture capitalists have already sunk more than $1.3 billion into blockchain technology just this year. And just this week, Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent technology firms founded, in part, by Marc Andreessen \u2014 who is credited with inventing the modern Web browser \u2014 announced a $300 million \u201ccrypto\u201d fund to exclusively invest in blockchain technologies.And what was arguably considered wild overspending in the late 1990s on internet infrastructure and an assortment of experimental companies, ultimately set the foundation for the modern era we live in today.\u201cNew models of computing have tended to emerge every 10 to 15 years: mainframes in the 60s, PCs in the late 70s, the internet in the early 90s, and smartphones in the late 2000s,\u201d Mr. Andreessen said. And now blockchain.The easiest and most basic way to think about the underlying technology is to think about a technology that keeps a master list of everyone who has ever interacted with it. It\u2019s a bit of an oversimplification, but if you\u2019ve ever used Google Docs and allowed others to share the document so they can make changes, the programs keep a list of all the changes that are made to the document and by whom. Blockchain does that but in an even more secure way so that every person who ever touches the document is trusted and everyone gets a copy of all the changes made so there is never a question about what happened along the way. There aren\u2019t multiple copies of a document and different versions \u2014 there is only one trusted document and you can keep track of everything that\u2019s ever happened to it.The blockchain is, of course, being used to create all sorts of cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum.But more important, it is touching all different industries.The advertising industry plans to use it to track its ads all over the internet; the music industry is planning to use it to track songs; banks and mortgage companies want to use it to track the deeds of homes and the complicated process of tracking all the documentation; shipping companies are investing in blockchain technology to track bills of lading, the pharmaceutical industry wants to use the technology to verify the drug supply chain.If it is successful, blockchain technology will bring a new level of enhanced trust to business and will also cut out the middlemen that have historically tracked \u2014 and profited \u2014 from the complexity of so many different systems trying to communicate with each other. That could lower prices for goods and services.At the same time, for all the promise of blockchain, there are real questions about whether it may be applied to solve problems that don\u2019t exist. Databases already exist and, in certain cases, a centralized database might actually be preferable to the blockchain.The blockchain is ultimately about solving society\u2019s ultimate challenge: trust. Or rather, lack of trust. Blockchain is about using technology to create a shared sense of trust by a group of disparate participants.The biggest question is whether the hundreds of projects like Decentraland, where individuals are using real money to buy virtual property, will end well or badly \u2014 and whether that experience will ultimately instill or undermine trust in this emerging technology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018Desus & Mero\u2019 Conquered Late Night", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "FeatureThe comedic duo has made it big by offering what few other shows can: a decidedly black perspective.Supported byEveryone, it seemed, felt the need to weigh in. Twitter erupted in the parlor game #IfSlaveryWasAChoice, with memes and GIFs with pedestrian occupational gripes (one person posted \u201cMassa: I\u2019m sorry but you don\u2019t meet the full requirements for this position,\u201d with a photo of Rachel Dolezal looking miffed; another tweeted a GIF of an exasperated Viola Davis grabbing her bag and leaving with the caption \u201cWhen the plantation meeting could\u2019ve been an email\u201d); John Legend lit up West\u2019s phone trying to change his mind via text (which West rejected, took screen shots of and tweeted out); Ta-Nehisi Coates meditated on West after Michael Jackson and in the age of Trump. Van Lathan, the black TMZ employee who repudiated West\u2019s comments on camera, was quickly championed as a hero.And then the sun set, and it came time for the late-night hosts \u2014 a legion of mostly white men who, in the post-Trump media landscape, have been heralded as model liberal beacons \u2014 to respond. West\u2019s comments were a dicey topic: They were offensive but inescapable. All the shows had to say something, but it appeared no one quite knew how. On \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d Kimmel delivered a cursory monologue where he said he couldn\u2019t handle both problem children \u2014 West and Trump \u2014 in the news, and barely discussed the specific slavery comments. On \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers,\u201d the host said, to his credit, that commenting on a black man\u2019s opinions on slavery wasn\u2019t something he was comfortable doing and outsourced a response to Amber Ruffin, a black female comedian. On \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Trevor Noah showed a ham-handed edit of what he called \u201c12 Years a Voluntary Slave,\u201d where the correspondent Roy Wood Jr. extolled slavery between cuts of the actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong\u2019o looking miserable.Unlike their late-night peers, the pair don\u2019t have an impeccably plotted approach to the show: They just talk, a geyser of whip-smart running commentary, seamlessly building off each other\u2019s jokes, able to anticipate and carry each other like dancers or jazz musicians. That night, they did a seven-minute segment on West\u2019s appearance on TMZ, offering very little setup \u2014 if you knew, you knew. Instead, they just reacted to what they saw, talking in between snippets of footage, saying the same sort of thing we were all thinking, but funnier.Desus, or Daniel Baker, and Mero, Joel (pronounced Joe-\u00e9l) Martinez, sat in the shiny leather armchairs in which they conduct the show, with votive candles bearing their likenesses standing between them. Baker, who has a full beard and an air of felinity, lazed on his side for the duration of the show, subdued and dressed in a Carhartt T-shirt and ripped jeans; the cherubic and excitable Martinez, in a sweatshirt and a fitted cap, sipped from a mug filled, most likely, with the contents of the bottle of Brugal rum at his feet.As the TMZ footage ran, Martinez did a genuine spit-take when West asserted that Trump was \u201chis boy.\u201d \u201cThe Kardashians,\u201d Martinez said, \u201cgot the reverse Erykah Badu effect: You become unwoke once you [expletive] a Kardashian.\u201d (\u201cTheir vaginas are the actual sunken place,\u201d Baker ruled.) Baker began impersonating slaves refusing to pick cotton, disputing work conditions: \u201cI was told I was supposed to be in the house, and I\u2019m in the field, so is there an H.R. rep?\u201d Mero reached to the floor, pretending to pick up an object: \u201cLet me get this paper bag.\u201d He held it up to Baker\u2019s face. \u201cNo, you\u2019re in the field.\u201dAnd their assembled audience \u2014 drawn from their respectable Twitter following (about one million people, combined), a good portion of black and Latino people in the New York City area under 35, and anyone who didn\u2019t want to see a white man in a suit pontificate about what might be going through West\u2019s head \u2014 rejoiced! Here were two down-to-earth guys assessing the situation for what it was, with the cultural awareness that necessitated the conversation but none of the corniness that typically comes with having a show that comes on after 10:30 p.m. Finally! Someone who knew what they were talking about.On most late-night shows, when the host, whether it\u2019s Meyers or John Oliver or Samantha Bee, introduces a segment, it can be tonally similar to the actual news, with detailed context to a story and graphics over their right shoulders. Even the purely comedic bits on these shows are traditional: setup, punch line, audience applause.Baker and Martinez, on the other hand, rely on a conversational comedy that comes naturally to them. They balance each other: Baker tends to lay down the foundation of a joke, and Martinez heightens it with sound effects, physical humor or a string of expletives. Their show is built partly on the ebb and flow of black Twitter, which is less a tangible space and more an educated curation; Baker gave me the most lucid description of it I\u2019ve heard: \u201cThe other day somebody was like, \u2018There\u2019s no such thing as gay sex because gay sex to gay people is just sex.\u2019 Black Twitter is just Twitter for black people.\u201d Even if you\u2019re not following black Twitter, you\u2019re likely consuming the media it produces without realizing it: Everything from viral memes to hashtag movements that can bleed quickly into the mainstream, often without attribution. \u201cWhat black Twitter says is often ignored,\u201d Victor Lopez, the pair\u2019s manager, told me. But because both men are immersed in it, they can, he explained, \u201crepresent that on TV.\u201dBaker and Martinez once told me the story of the rise of Tyrone Hankerson Jr., who was accused of stealing $429,000 from Howard University\u2019s financial-aid office. The morning the story broke, students from Howard were tweeting excitedly at Baker and Martinez, anxiously awaiting their take. The pair held off at first, but by the time they started taping that afternoon, the story was all over Twitter, inspiring a day of memes and jokes. That night\u2019s episode opened with Hankerson. Whatever black Twitter is talking about, Baker told me, \u201cthat\u2019s what the show is talking about.\u201dChris Hayes, the host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll in With Chris Hayes,\u201d appeared on \u201cDesus and Mero\u201d during its first year; he and Baker attended Pablo Casals Middle School together in the Bronx and still keep in touch. He told me that he appreciates the show\u2019s specificity of a world that\u2019s so rarely represented on TV. \u201cAs a person who exists in the world of making a TV show and often feels like the power of convention can be really overwhelming, there\u2019s something extremely refreshing about how different that show feels in its entirety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just feels like a new thing, and that\u2019s really hard to pull off on TV.\u201d\u201cDesus and Mero\u201d clocks in as the late-night show with both the most diverse audience and the youngest: 35, on average. And though their viewership is dwarfed by behemoths like \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d or even Andy Cohen\u2019s minor-league \u201cWatch What Happens Live,\u201d their audience has grown each quarter in the past year, most likely because of their appearing as regular guests on those other late-night shows. They\u2019re a late-night host\u2019s late-night host: brash and goofy and relaxed, stars for being able to pull a show off with a tiny team. Meyers, who has hosted the men twice, considers himself a superfan. \u201cIf you were at a party, and they weren\u2019t your friends, you would still try to be within earshot,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou\u2019d find a corner and try to keep one ear open, because there\u2019s a real magnetism to the way they express things and the fact that they really are talking about a wide breadth of things, from politics to pop culture to sports, in a way that fans out.\u201d\u201cDesus and Mero\u201d will move to Showtime this fall. Martinez told me that their vision for the new show is a \u201cmash-up of \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 and the Chappelle show,\u201d a comedy show that covers the culture while remaining unabashedly black. (They\u2019re considering a weekly format.) Unlike on Viceland, where their comedy was purely verbal, the move will give Baker and Martinez the ability to blow their jokes out visually, potentially write their own sketches and hire correspondents. The new show might look a little more polished \u2014 \u201cbecause if they\u2019re offering more money,\u201d Baker said, \u201cwe\u2019ll probably just wanna spend more of it\u201d \u2014 but the conceit and execution will more or less remain the same.But the jewel of the afternoon was Morgan, who arrived in a royal blue sweater, a blindingly white durag and a dookie chain. Once the cameras were on, Morgan spoke nearly without interruption for upward of 26 minutes, giving an inspirational, rambling sermon that touched on helping the needy, losing his close friend in his 2014 traumatic car accident, Obi-Wan Kenobi, creating a legacy for his great-grandchildren, school shootings, the importance of forming spiritual connections with your partner, what he had for dinner the previous night, Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lady in My Life,\u201d the exhaustion of having an affair, being a runaway and, in detail, his sexual proclivities. (\u201cYou ain\u2019t never had an interview like this on this show,\u201d he boasted at one point.) Midway through the interview, Baker looked worn out, suffering from intellectual whiplash; Martinez, on the other hand, glowed with glee, nearly incapacitated by his own happiness. There were interview prompts for Baker and Martinez on a computer screen \u2014 Morgan was there to promote his new show, which he would ostensibly want to talk about \u2014 but they let Morgan go on, not only because they knew that they could run the full version online, but also because that\u2019s just how a conversation can go: When you make a plan, Tracy Morgan laughs.Over time, they have become known for their relaxed interview style: It\u2019s a conversation among three people on equal footing. Once they get past the introduction, questions are asked in the style of a curious friend: \u201cHow much money do you spend at the club?\u201d \u201cWhat video games are you playing right now?\u201d \u201cHow many cars do you have?\u201d Their first year, booking guests for a talk show that no one had ever heard of proved challenging, so most of the interviews were conducted with friends or friends of friends, many of whom were names in New York media circles: the actress Awkwafina; Charlmagne tha God, a host of Power 105.1\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d; the Instagram celebrity the Fat Jew. Those interviews were a little clunky, but with time, their interviewing skills and guest pull improved. (They\u2019re still not great at reading that computer screen, though.) Now, in Season 2, guests have included Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael B. Jordan, Melissa McCarthy, Spike Lee and Chadwick Boseman, as well as interviews that provide an esoteric insight into black culture, with people like J. Prince, the man who cooled off the recent feud between Drake and Pusha T.After wrapping up that day, Morgan commended Baker and Martinez, likening his experience to being on Howard Stern, who, he said, used to let Morgan just let loose, with interviews often lasting more than an hour. \u201cIn my last life,\u201d he said, returning to his contemplative mode, \u201cyou were probably my favorite [expletive] cousins.\u201dAfter high school, he worked his way from the mailroom at Lehman Brothers to the I.T. department. Eventually, he started working as a paraprofessional in a special-education class at I.S. 117, his alma mater, in the Bronx. He was satisfied with going through the motions until, one day, he handed a student an assignment, and the kid popped off, refusing to do it. Martinez got his class yearbook and took it to the students: \u201cI\u2019m not one of those Teach for America [expletive] from New Hampshire,\u201d he told them. \u201cI\u2019m from the hood, just like you.\u201d The moment created a bond with his students. Even now, Martinez speaks about the experience with reverence; he even toyed with the idea of becoming a guidance counselor, because he so admired their work. \u201cBut then I was like, \u2018[Expletive] it, I\u2019m trying to make money.\u2019\u2009\u201dWhen he wasn\u2019t working, Martinez was blogging; a friend suggested that he sign up for Twitter, believing that his bon mots were well attuned to the platform, and he quickly amassed a considerable following. One day he got an email from an editor at the pop-culture website Complex, asking him if he had any free time to chat about job opportunities. He responded: \u201cI work at a public school, and it\u2019s Rosh Hashana, my guy. I\u2019m in the crib eating challah bread French toast, watching \u2018The Sopranos\u2019 with a fraudulent HBO Go login. Holla at me.\u201d The editor mentioned that he\u2019d also invited another Twitter favorite to the meeting: Desus Nice.Baker grew up in the Bronx neighborhood of Wakefield, the son of Jamaican immigrants. He has joked that all they had when they came to America was \u201ca goat and one Bitcoin.\u201d He got into computers as a teenager, hanging out in chat rooms, cracking unsecured servers and often fixing his family\u2019s computer, prompting them to call him Jesus, which he personalized with a D. As a student at the College of Mount Saint Vincent, in Riverdale, he found himself too advanced for the college\u2019s course offerings in computer programming, so he switched to English. After graduating, he worked a number of jobs \u2014 mechanic, construction worker, domain-name salesperson, club manager, bartender, D.J., coat checker, programmer, web designer \u2014 eventually landing as a small-business reporter at a trade publication that he found so absurd that he couldn\u2019t help live-tweeting his day-to-day: the Christmas party where the only offerings were fried chicken and coleslaw, the boss who regularly fell asleep in meetings, a co-worker who refused to wear shoes, arguments over whether more people in the world eat goat or pasta.He used Twitter largely to vent about his job, but he also tweeted about the Bronx, catching the attention of Martinez, who was doing the same. They had attended the same summer school, so they were already familiar with each other, but their online chemistry came naturally, with the two retweeting and piggybacking off each other\u2019s jokes. That Complex meeting resulted in a podcast called \u201cDesus vs. Mero,\u201d a more caustic, coarser version of the show they have now. Before long, Complex relaunched their podcast as a web show; in 2014, the pair departed for a bigger contract at MTV2 but struggled to find their footing, mostly appearing intermittently on other talking-head shows. (Around this time, they started a new podcast, \u201cBodega Boys,\u201d that is still running.) The two balked at using teleprompters and having to write scripts that executives needed to approve. Only two years into a three-year contract, they were filming what would be their last show when the teleprompter failed. They did the show off the tops of their heads, and the audience loved it.When Viceland approached them, they demanded the autonomy for a loosely structured show that basically amounted to them \u201ctalking [expletive],\u201d Martinez said. They wanted to stay true to themselves, to their interests and not bending to corporate input. They gave the same speech to Showtime. Whether they will bring in writers is still undetermined \u2014 if anything, Lopez said, they would bring in more producers to cull content \u2014 but they want the show to remain their own. \u201cYou want to keep your vision what it was when you made the joke in the first place,\u201d Martinez said.He told me that Diddy, after filming his interview on the show last year, commended them for exhibiting black excellence. \u201c\u2009\u2018Y\u2019all are the voice of the culture,\u2019\u2009\u201d Martinez said, in his best Diddy voice. \u201c\u2009\u2018You guys are bringing something to the table that is not out there on any platform \u2014 and you\u2019re doing it on television!\u2019\u2009\u201d Lena Waithe, the actress and writer on \u201cMaster of None,\u201d was a guest on the show earlier this year. She told me that going on \u201cDesus and Mero\u201d feels like how it must have felt for black performers to go on \u201cThe Arsenio Hall Show\u201d in the early \u201990s. \u201cYou could tell there was a level of comfort when they went on \u2018Arsenio,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. \u201cThey would talk about things they wouldn\u2019t talk about if they were on \u2018The Tonight Show,\u2019 with Johnny Carson. I have fun on Jimmy Kimmel and James Corden, but I feel like, with [Desus and Mero], it felt like going to your favorite cousin\u2019s crib and talking about the events of the day and what\u2019s going on. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a talk show.\u201dAround 8 p.m., the ushers began letting people into the theater. The atmosphere was more like a house party than a ticketed event, as if the audience were getting pumped up for a show that we would all be performing in. A D.J. played the stage, and people swag-surfed in the aisles.Backstage, Baker and Martinez were huddled in a small dressing room, drinking a beer and some Brugal, respectively. Two days earlier, at their show on Staten Island, they were uncertain about how they would go over; because the Bodega Hive is smaller there, they had booked a venue so intimate they could see most people\u2019s faces from the stage. They had tailored the show for their audience by adding straight aggression: If they told a joke and someone didn\u2019t laugh, it was easy to ask them, directly, why not. Now they weren\u2019t so much nervous about the Apollo show as they were unsure of what to expect. \u201cAnything is possible!\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe might go out there and everybody starts booing, and we got to pull out a white person playing the violin.\u201dThey didn\u2019t need to worry. Around 8:15, the D.J. announced that they were due to take the stage, and suddenly, I found myself wondering if I could seek workers\u2019 compensation for a perforated eardrum. The two entered with their respective country\u2019s flags \u2014 Jamaica for Desus, the Dominican Republic for Mero \u2014 draped around their necks, each in sunglasses. Martinez asked, \u201cIs the Bodega Hive in the building?\u201d and the response was deafening.Toward the end of the show, they took audience questions and comments, all of which had an intimate feel: A woman who had helped care for Baker\u2019s recently deceased dog introduced herself at the mic; a middle-aged man who had traveled from the West Coast to see the show proclaimed his love for the guys, then apologized for being white; a squealing woman enthusiastically flashed Baker.At the very end of the night, the duo announced that they wanted to take a group photo with the entire audience, as many people as they could fit into the frame. The next day, Baker posted the photo to his Instagram: Martinez was double-fisting drinks, Baker had a wide grin, and the crowd was on its feet, going wild.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Buys GitHub for $7.5 Billion, Moving to Grow in Coding\u2019s New Era", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicrosoft, fully embracing a model it once saw as a threat, said on Monday that it was buying GitHub, an open software platform used by 28 million programmers, for $7.5 billion.The deal is a bid by Microsoft to gain ground in the internet era of software development, where applications increasingly run on remote data centers \u2014 on so-called cloud computing.Amazon is the leader in the cloud market so far, but Microsoft has transformed itself in recent years to become a strong No. 2 as a supplier of cloud computing services. Its vital Office productivity applications and database software are available in cloud versions.Microsoft also competes with Google, IBM, Salesforce and others in the cloud marketplace. All of them are trying to lure software engineers to use their cloud tools and services. The more programmers on a company\u2019s platform, the more software applications are created, attracting customers and still more developers \u2014 a flywheel of growth and profit.\u201cThe strategic battle in the tech world is for developers,\u201d said Frank Gens, chief analyst for IDC, a research firm. \u201cFor Microsoft, the GitHub deal is about strengthening and widening its relationships with developers.\u201dSatya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said the deal would advance Microsoft\u2019s ambitions in cloud computing and bring smarter software to every industry, on any digital device.GitHub, founded in 2008 and based in San Francisco, was created largely as a community for software developers to share programming tools and code. It has been a champion of the open-source software movement, with its ethos of freely sharing code in public.Today, GitHub is used by a wide range in the tech community, from lone programmers to the nation\u2019s largest companies. Developers can share code, make comments and buy software tools. They work in digital storage spaces, called repositories. Some are open to all users; others are closed to members of a team. GitHub now has more than 85 million code repositories.Individuals can use GitHub for free. But there are monthly subscription charges for extra storage, development tools and private repositories. The company does not disclose its revenue, but analysts estimate it is running at $200 million a year.The open-source model was once anathema to Microsoft, the largest commercial software company, which had favored keeping its code proprietary. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft\u2019s former chief executive, once called Linux, the popular open-source operating system, a \u201ccancer\u201d in the body of the technology business.But Microsoft has come to embrace open-source tools. Today, Microsoft is the most active corporation on GitHub, with more than two million contributions of code to GitHub projects.GitHub, seeking to establish a profitable business, has increasingly hosted corporate projects on its platform for a fee. Those ventures have typically used open-source software development techniques while keeping some code proprietary.Executives from both companies insisted that GitHub would remain technologically neutral, welcoming developers using any code or any cloud service, rather than a Microsoft walled garden. The proof, analysts say, will be in how GitHub operates under Microsoft ownership.\u201cDevelopers by their nature are often suspicious of corporate ambitions,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cMicrosoft will have to demonstrate its willingness to put the interests of developers ahead of any Microsoft-specific agenda.\u201dThe $7.5 billion purchase, an all-stock deal, is the second-largest acquisition Microsoft has made since Mr. Nadella became chief executive in early 2014. The bigger deal came in 2016, when Microsoft bought LinkedIn, the social network for professional workers, for $26.2 billion. (GitHub ranks third in Microsoft\u2019s history, also behind the $8.5 billion purchase of Skype in 2011.)If GitHub will remain a neutral home for developers, as Microsoft insists, why did the company pay so handsomely to own it?In an interview, Nat Friedman, corporate vice president for developer services at Microsoft, explained that ownership would give the company the confidence to make a greater commitment to GitHub \u2014 \u201cto confidently go all-in on GitHub.\u201dMicrosoft, Mr. Friedman said, will make nearly all its software-building tools available on GitHub. Over time, as Microsoft shows itself to be a reliable corporate steward of GitHub and is willing to invest in its growth, he said, Microsoft should benefit as more developers adopt its software.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of building trust with developers,\u201d said Mr. Friedman, who will become chief executive of GitHub when the deal closes, which is expected to be this year. \u201cYou earn the right to be considered for other things.\u201dWith GitHub, Microsoft is making a move similar to its LinkedIn acquisition \u2014 buying the leading marketplace in its field. \u201cMicrosoft is rolling up another platform,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management.GitHub has become far more than a platform for software development. It is where developers demonstrate their skills. Software engineers routinely include links to their GitHub projects on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and companies scout for job candidates on GitHub.\u201cIt\u2019s the de facto tool for recruiting technical talent,\u201d Julio Avalos, GitHub\u2019s chief strategy officer, said in an interview this year.The $7.5 billion transaction promises a lucrative payday for GitHub\u2019s venture backers. The start-up had raised a total of $350 million \u2014 a $100 million round in 2012, led by Andreessen Horowitz, and a $250 million round in 2015, led by Sequoia Capital.\u201cGit was a powerful but niche tool, clouds were just things in the sky,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand Microsoft was a very different company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gov. Gavin Newsom and Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles \u2014 are engaged in border-to-border bus trips.Mr. Newsom\u2019s tour took him to a labor hall in Burbank on Wednesday. For those of you who couldn\u2019t make it, here are some excerpts from his 16-minute speech, condensed and edited for clarity.\u201cI am of the humble opinion that in an economy as large, with a population as diverse and extraordinary as ours, with the natural instincts to lead, with the ability to redirect existing resources in a more resourceful way, that we could cover every single citizen and every single resident in this state, regardless of income, and provide universal health care. Regardless of pre-existing conditions, your ability to pay, or your immigration status. We can lead the nation in that conversation.\u201cIn so many ways, the world is looking to us. This is California. I wouldn\u2019t want to be anyplace else. Eat your heart out, Texas. California is a special place: a majority-minority state; 27 percent of this state foreign born. The state has brought in 112,000 refugees in the last 15 years: 1,454 Syrian refugees. No other state has taken more Syrian refugees, Mr. Trump. It\u2019s a point of pride.\u201cThere was a guy running for re-election as governor by the name of Pete Wilson. Not too many years ago \u2014 1994. He was out there promoting Prop. 187: Xenophobia, nativism was front and center in our political debate. He was not only promoting his own candidacy for governor, he was on his way to announce his bid to be president of the United States. Pete Wilson wins his re-election walking way. Prop. 187 wins, overwhelmingly.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)As a travel destination, Sacramento gets no respect.But the state\u2019s oldest incorporated city \u2014 founded in 1849, the year before California joined the union \u2014 remains a lush oasis of bougainvillea and palms, prolific fruit trees and mighty oaks.It also has a thriving cultural scene and architectural character all its own, including neighborhoods of midcentury modern homes, Craftsman Bungalows and ornate Victorians.Unlike California\u2019s glittering, glamorous coastal cities, Sacramento, located in the Central Valley, has an earnest, small-town affect and a welcome lack of pretension.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Pity the Tech B-List", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsI spent most of the week at the Code Conference, where the tech world\u2019s elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry. It was a fascinating event, less in the sense of newsy product announcements (which there weren\u2019t many of) and more in the general finger-in-the-wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself.Notable at this year\u2019s Code was that there seems to be a growing rift between the largest tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 and the rest of the industry.The shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference, even if their presence was minimal. No executives from Apple, Amazon or Google spoke at Code, and when executives from Microsoft and Facebook did take the stage, they mostly talked about the past. (Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, offered some historical perspective on the company\u2019s antitrust woes from the late 1990s; Sheryl Sandberg and Mike Schroepfer from Facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company\u2019s post-Cambridge Analytica \u201cwe\u2019ll do better\u201d script.)Instead, much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech A-list \u2014 large, popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories, but that have spent years locked in a fight for survival against their bigger, more entrenched rivals.From the perspective of the tech B-list, there are two huge fights to be won. First, you need to establish a foothold in a market, either by out-innovating old-line incumbents \u2014 taxis, hotels, music labels \u2014 or by creating a new market altogether. Then, once you\u2019re established and growing, a bigger worry emerges: What if one of the Big Five squashes you?A good example of a tech B-lister is Spotify, which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers \u2014 the three labels that provide the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s music \u2014 but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by a tech giant. Onstage at Code, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek, fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which have their own music streaming services and, more important, control the hardware platforms (iOS, Android, Alexa) on which people consume music.Mr. Ek mostly deflected, saying that there are \u201cvery, very few opportunities that a billion-plus people around the world care about,\u201d and that the giants\u2019 interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category.Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, sounded a similar note at the conference when asked about Facebook\u2019s habit of blatantly copying Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive product features. (Mr. Spiegel\u2019s sassy comeback \u2014 \u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also\u201d \u2014 was the best line there.)\u201cWell, I believe if you don\u2019t create a pure, vertical, integrated capability, vertically integrated capability \u2014 from distribution all the way through content creation and advertising models \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a hard time competing with these guys. And the statistic we throw out, and since we announced this deal in November of 2016, the FANG market caps have gone up over $1 trillion. You better figure out how to vertically integrate here if you want to compete with those players.\u201dIt\u2019s not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets. It\u2019s more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of a $200 billion telecom giant. And it shows just how dominant the tech A-list has become, and how difficult overcoming its concentration of market power is proving to be.Here are a few other tech stories of note this past week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Was Supposed to Get Political. It\u2019s Hanging Back in This Election.", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the last decade, this has become the tech industry\u2019s hometown.But as voters go to the polls Tuesday to choose a mayor in one of San Francisco\u2019s most disputed elections in recent memory, the industry that set off a high-rise construction boom and has been blamed for a housing crisis in the city is fading into the background.What is happening \u2014 or rather not happening \u2014 in San Francisco is part of a broader urge in the tech community to stay behind the scenes in state and national politics. The overwhelmingly Democratic-leaning Silicon Valley was shocked by the 2016 election of Donald J. Trump and aghast at his anti-immigration ban, which cut to the heart of their existence as a multinational industry whose companies have often been founded by immigrants.But predictions that, for better or worse, tech and politics were henceforth going to be inseparable did not hold up.Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, drew national attention in 2015 when he said he would move his employees out of Indiana if a new state law that would have legalized discrimination was not changed. (It was.)Mr. Benioff, a native of San Francisco and the most prominent tech executive in the city, was a financial backer of Mr. Lee. But he said in an interview Friday that the mayoral election was too important, too closely fought and too contentious for him to support any of the top four candidates: Jane Kim, Mark Leno, Angela Alioto or London Breed.\u201cThis is the hottest election San Francisco has ever had for mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cI care so deeply, I cannot support one of the candidates. I don\u2019t want to disenfranchise my ability to work with whoever is elected.\u201dSam Altman, the president of the influential start-up accelerator Y Combinator, has not tweeted about politics all year \u2014 surprising reticence for someone who flirted with the idea of running for California governor last year.Hunter Walk, formerly with Google\u2019s YouTube and now a venture capitalist, appeared in the 2011 video supporting Mr. Lee. \u201cThat was the beginning \u2014 and end \u2014 of my viral video career,\u201d he said. Others in the video were Marissa Mayer, then chief executive of Yahoo, and Biz Stone, a co-founder of Twitter.Mr. Walk said he was supporting Ms. Breed, the mayoral candidate who seems to have the most backing from tech. Mr. Stone said he was \u201cusually not public about politics\u201d but had been helping Ms. Breed \u201cwith social media strategy and expertise,\u201d introducing her to knowledgeable people. Ms. Mayer, who could not be reached for comment, gave $500, the legal maximum, to Ms. Breed.If tech is determined to be low key about San Francisco politics, there is an eminently practical reason: fears of a backlash.Mr. Conway championed Ms. Breed, a president of the board of supervisors who became interim mayor after Mr. Lee\u2019s death, as the next mayor. At Mr. Lee\u2019s funeral, he told Mr. Benioff, \u201cWe have to focus on getting London elected.\u201d (Mr. Conway disputed that, writing, \u201cAt most, I acknowledged the historic significance of an African-American woman succeeding the city\u2019s first Chinese-American mayor.\u201d)The venture capitalist moved too aggressively, however. The progressive wing of the board of supervisors removed Ms. Breed from the interim position after a few weeks, saying they did not want her to have an undue advantage in the election.Mr. Benioff called Mr. Conway \u201cthe Koch brothers of San Francisco,\u201d a reference to the siblings who are heavy backers of conservative causes. He added: \u201cThat is his prerogative as a citizen of the United States. He feels he\u2019s doing the right thing. He\u2019s a good person. But he doesn\u2019t speak for me or tech.\u201dMr. Conway now says he has more important places to spend his time and resources than the mayor\u2019s race.\u201cThe future of our country and our progressive values are threatened by this president and this Congress, and candidly stopping them is ultimately far more important to me than who is elected Mayor of San Francisco on June 5th,\u201d he wrote in an email.Mr. Conway emphasized that he is still backing Ms. Breed, citing his belief that \u201cshe\u2019s the only candidate who will truly tackle our city\u2019s housing and homeless crises.\u201dDomestic abuse, Mr. Conway said, is an issue he and his wife \u201chave long been passionate about.\u201d But the battle over the sheriff\u2019s reinstatement was really about the mayor\u2019s power to fire someone duly elected by the voters. A spokeswoman for Ms. Kim, Julie Edwards, said, \u201cRon Conway has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attacking Jane Kim because she believes City Hall belongs to the people, not the billionaires. It\u2019s that simple.\u201dMr. Conway declined to specify his contributions for national organizations, but said that \u201cthis year alone, we are directly supporting and raising more than $5 million\u201d for groups \u201cchallenging this terrible president and fighting for change to our gun and immigration laws.\u201dMs. Breed is the clear tech favorite, but none of the leading mayoral candidates are decidedly anti-tech. It is too big and powerful an industry here for anyone who opposes it to get elected.\u201cSan Francisco, despite its reputation, isn\u2019t especially left wing,\u201d said Ben Tarnoff, a San Francisco historian and editor of Logic, a new magazine focused on deepening the discourse around tech. \u201cIts political leadership is reliably socially liberal, but it has largely governed within the policy parameters set by the real estate and tech industries.\u201dChange arises from below. But that\u2019s where things get tricky. On Thursday morning, a group of housing activists renewed their protests against Google and the other tech companies by blocking a dozen commuter buses that carry employees from San Francisco to the campuses in Silicon Valley. One of their signs: \u201cCandidates won\u2019t save us.\u201d\u201cMany of the people who form the most natural constituency for left-wing politics are being forced out of the city,\u201d said Mr. Tarnoff. \u201cThe balance may tilt even further against them in the coming years.\u201dTo put it another way, whoever wins on Tuesday, tech will not lose.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the spokeswoman for Jane Kim, a San Francisco mayoral candidate. It is Julie Edwards, not Johnson.Advertisement"}

He elaborated:Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers \u2026 Under certain circumstances, the same asset can be offered and sold in a way that causes investors to have a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.That is the lowest number since 2011 and half the level of three years ago ...

For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201dUnder Mr. Schultz\u2019s three decades managing the company, Starbucks grew from a tiny local chain into a global coffee giant, operating 28,000 stores in 75 countries. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Microsoft\u2019s planned acquisition of GitHub, a software development company, is not close to the company\u2019s largest, and it will not have a big, immediate impact on profits.But the deal is a milestone because it reveals the degree to which the rise in Microsoft\u2019s stock has bolstered its heft as an acquirer.Microsoft\u2019s stock has gone up more than 200 percent since Microsoft agreed in 2013 to pay $7.2 billion in cash for Nokia\u2019s handset and services operations. That price tag amounted to 2.6 percent of Microsoft\u2019s total market value back then. The $7.5 billion Microsoft is paying for GitHub is just under 1 percent of Microsoft\u2019s current market capitalization. This lessens the financial hit if the acquisition falls short of expectations, but increases the upside if it outperforms.In recent years, Microsoft\u2019s valuation has also increased, making its stock even more potent as an acquisition currency. Microsoft\u2019s shares currently trade at around 24 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to data from CapitalIQ. That\u2019s far higher than the 15 times it traded at in mid-2013.But it would be a mistake to conclude that Microsoft has not advanced in the market for acquisitions. Its soaring stock has made sure the company has remained a player in the deals game. The jump in its price-to-earnings ratio makes it more likely that a large deal would bolster earnings per share (after factoring in the extra shares issued to do the deal.) With its operations notching up strong organic growth, Microsoft probably does not need to do a big deal anytime soon. But if one were to crop up, shareholders may not balk.- Peter Eavis Satya Nadella happened, for one. (He succeeded Steve Ballmer as C.E.O. of Microsoft in 2014.) And the cloud, for another.Mr. Ballmer tried to target the flashier end of the consumer hardware market, with things like Windows Phone and the Zune music player. It didn\u2019t work. In contrast, Mr. Nadella has focused on enterprise applications \u2014 and in particular, found huge success in cloud computing.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.The company lags only Amazon Web Services as a cloud provider.Preparing for the futureMr. Nadella is also gearing up for the next big thing to be put into the cloud: artificial intelligence.Because such software is computationally demanding, it makes sense to pay for someone else to run programs on huge servers rather than buying one\u2019s own hardware. But it\u2019s also complex, which means that there is going to be a huge market for user-friendly software that can be taken up by regular developers and not just people with A.I. Ph.D.s.That\u2019s why there\u2019s a big race right now \u2014 between the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others \u2014 to offer up tools in the cloud that can process huge data sets and provide useful insights about them.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWhat Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., said of the transaction:\u201cMicrosoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, a senior Microsoft executive, Nat Friedman, will become GitHub\u2019s C.E.O., while the coding hub\u2019s current chief, Chris Wanstrath, will become a Microsoft technical fellow.

Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia:Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing.Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, has been adamant that his company stringently protects its customers\u2019 data privacy. Two news stories raise some questions about that categorical claim.The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Not too incriminating. But it\u2019s a reminder that Apple has made use of the data that passes across Facebook\u2019s platform.Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest\u2019s app for \u201cdrapes\u201d might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for \u201cNFL\u201d might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said.None of this is to say that Apple doesn\u2019t act by its word. But it is an important reminder to continue asking whether it really does.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe latest installment in the movie franchise, \u201cSolo,\u201d had its second disappointing weekend, pulling in just $29.3 million in the U.S. (We use \u201cjust\u201d advisedly.) But perhaps more important, it raises questions about the future of what is supposed to be one of Walt Disney\u2019s biggest moneymakers.The trend hasn\u2019t been reassuring, though. Disney likely took about $1 billion from \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d after accounting for production and marketing costs. But \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d the next movie in the main series, showed a marked drop. (To be fair, \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was the first new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie in more than a decade.)But \u201cSolo\u201d may highlight the pitfalls. Disney has said that it plans to release a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie every year, raising the real risk that moviegoers could end up suffering from Force fatigue. Just five months separated \u201cSolo\u201d from \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d Forcing through more movies \u2014 and video content for Disney\u2019s forthcoming streaming service \u2014 could erode the uniqueness that once defined the franchise\u2019s installments.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe automaker will face tough questions and tricky votes Tuesday at its annual shareholder meeting tomorrow.The company doesn\u2019t publish a sustainability report, which investors say makes it hard to keep tabs on workforce issues such as safety. And they are concerned that Tesla can\u2019t manage infrastructure changes ahead involving electric-vehicles and autonomous-driving cars.G.E. could sell assets to raise the cash, but that will be no easy feat. The conglomerate could sell Baker Hughes, but such a deal may only raise $20 billion, Mr. Tusa writes.\u201cThe bottom line is that we see the need to de-risk substantially, which includes the need for cash and a cut to the dividend to help with operational de-levering.\u201dWhile at Kirkland, Mr. Fraidin worked on transactions like 3G Capital\u2019s takeover of H.J. Heinz and Pershing Square and Valeant Pharmaceuticals\u2019 bid for the drug maker Allergan.From a statement by Pat Quinn, Cadwalader\u2019s managing partner:\u201cSteve brings great energy to our team and we look forward to rolling up our sleeves together in the service of our clients.

Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.If that\u2019s accurate, Apple must tread carefully to avoid comparisons to Facebook.One advantage to being retained by lawyers for a client rather than by the client himself is that Mr. Sitrick is technically a member of the legal team, and therefore protected by attorney-client privilege.

Latinos and black people are underrepresented in Google\u2019s work force. Facebook has a similar dynamic. By comparison, General Motors is more representative of the makeup of the United States.The percentage of Asian workers at Google has increased over the past four years \u2014 from 30 percent in 2014 to 36.3 percent this year. The proportion of white workers fell by 8 percentage points over the same period.Over the past four years, the percentage of black and Latino employees is up 0.7 and 0.6 percentage point. Over the past year, they are both up 0.1 percentage point, to 2.5 percent and 3.6 percent.The problem isn\u2019t just in hiring. For the first time, Google has released attrition rates for it work force. Attrition is highest among black and Latino staff and lowest among Asian employees. To that point, Google said in a statement that \u201cto improve work force representation we must focus not only on hiring, but also on developing, progressing, and retaining members of underrepresented employees, and creating an inclusive culture.\u201dCompared with the entire United States population, which skews slightly female, Google is much more male: Over two-thirds of its staff in 2018 are men.The percentage of women on Google\u2019s staff rose to 30.9 percent this year from 30.6 in 2014 \u2014 suggesting that the company is still finding it hard to reach gender parity.The percentage of technical roles at Google held by women has risen to 21.4 percent in 2018 from 16.6 percent in 2014, but, again, it still has a long way to achieve gender parity.\u201cDespite significant effort, and some pockets of success, we need to do more to achieve our desired diversity and inclusion outcomes,\u201d wrote Danielle Brown, Google\u2019s chief diversity and inclusion officer, in a statement issued along with the report. \u201cIf we want a better outcome, we need to evolve our approach.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Miss the fairway by enough to get into the knee-high rough, and you will atone for your sins.You wouldn\u2019t be alone. Even the pros lose their balls in this stuff.We thought you would have trouble in here, so Kyle Jorden, an assistant pro at Shinnecock, has offered to give you a tip.The tall, thick grass will grab your club, slowing it down and twisting its face.Set up so the ball is aligned near your back foot, take a lofted club and use a steep swing.This way, your club won\u2019t have to travel through so much rough before hitting the ball.You\u2019ll be tempted to hit this ball far to make up the distance you lost. Don\u2019t. Hit it short and high and move on.\u00a0The ocean breezes that lure many to the Hamptons will have you cursing them before long.\u00a0While you\u2019re spending your morning looking for your ball in the rough, the June sun is baking eastern Long Island.Before long the air above Shinnecock heats up and begins to rise. You find your ball yet?The rising hot air lowers the pressure over the land and the cooler air above the sea rushes in from three directions to take its place.The unpredictable wind direction is coupled with a course where the holes also seem to go in every direction. The combination is dizzying.The scorecard says it\u2019s a par 3. It\u2019s only 159 yards. You grab an iron. You\u2019ve got this.Your caddy shakes his head. It\u2019s an elevated green, so you\u2019ll need more distance. He hands you that shiny, new hybrid you saw on TV.Depending on the wind, the pros will be hitting anything from a wedge to a 6-iron, trying to land it softly on a very small green.\u00a0The green is so small that our good friend Kyle, the assistant pro, says it\u2019s like trying to hit into a baby pool at the end of a football field.Don\u2019t hit short \u2014 or left \u2014 or right. You\u2019ll land in a sand bunker so deep you will disappear from view.And don\u2019t hit long either.

He said an announcement will come within two weeks.There\u2019s still opportunity for banks to find new customers and encourage existing ones to be more active.But that\u2019s not quite the whole picture. The percentage of active accounts around the world has risen from 52 percent to just 53 percent over the same period. That means that even if people are opening accounts, they\u2019re still not using them. And in some countries, the use of bank accounts is actually falling.But the World Bank offers some approaches that could be used to encourage further adoption, and use of, accounts:Some historyThe problemValuations of sports teams have skyrocketed in recent years. Probably the biggest culprit is the ever-increasing price for media rights, particularly as digital players like Facebook and Twitter bid against traditional TV networks.As that money flows down to sports teams, their own valuations are going up. And that means, as the sports investment banker John Moag told Institutional Investor, having even $1 billion won\u2019t be enough to afford a franchise:\u201cOne person may be willing to put in $300 million to $500 million, but where will the remainder of the money come from? He will dial for dollars, but that\u2019s still a huge amount of money.\u201dWhat remains to be seenWe can think of two issues that need to be addressed:Whether sports leagues \u2014 which are governed by their individual owners \u2014 will drop their longstanding aversion to having Wall Street investment firms joining their ranks. Whether private equity firms would be willing to hold onto sports teams long enough to recoup their investments and make big profits, while avoiding the kinds of financial meddling that could destroy even championship franchises.\u2014 Michael de la MercedHow do you raise a fund that\u2019s as large as your two previous biggest combined? Reputation certainly counts for a lot.Mr. Trott certainly has a long list of accomplishments to cite in pitches to investors. He has become one of the premiere bankers for wealthy families like the Pritzkers, the scions of the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the Reimanns, the secretive German clan behind the consumer conglomerate JAB Holding.More from Eric Platt and Mark Vandevelde of the FT:The so-called family offices where Mr. Trott wields clout and raises much of his capital are garnering increasing power on Wall Street, as they hire investment teams to buy midsized companies outright instead of ploughing money into funds run by outside fund managers.\u2014 Michael de la MercedAchleitner has discussed a combination of the two lenders with investors and key German government officials in recent months, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations. While there are currently no formal discussions between the two banks and any such move is not imminent, the chairman is talking now with stakeholders about a possible deal down the road, they said. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment.A key obstacle is Deutsche Bank\u2019s depressed share price, with investors telling Achleitner that they don\u2019t want a merger with Commerzbank at the moment because it would be highly dilutive and potentially trigger a capital increase and hefty write-downs, the people said. In other Deutsch bank news:The bigger pictureReports about potential new features for the image-sharing social platform highlight how its service appears to be increasingly pulled in multiple directions.The feature, which could allow videos of up to an hour in length, will focus on vertical video, or video that is taller than it is wide, one of the people said. The feature, if it launches, will do so within the Instagram app, another person said.Instagram will offer a dedicated space featuring scripted shows, music videos and more in vertically oriented, full-screen, high-def 4K resolution. Instagram has been meeting with popular social media stars and content publishers to find out how their video channels elsewhere would work within its app.Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, points out that in layering on new features, the photo-sharing service could turn itself into two distinct products:It\u2019s plausible that Instagram could break itself up into two apps. One could be focused more on messaging and peer-to-peer image and video sharing. The other might emphasize discovery and a greater tie-in to e-commerce, with judicious use of artificial intelligence to provide users with focused product recommendations.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWith Jonathan Bush, a co-founder, out at the health technology company, its board looks likely to move toward a sale.The president asked Mr. Corker not to file the bill, which would be the most drastic move yet by Congress to check the White House\u2019s protectionist policies. Whether Mr. Corker can get it passed with a veto-proof majority is up in the air.Elsewhere in tradeCompanies frequently hold back on technology spending, hiring, and research and development to meet quarterly earnings forecasts that may be affected by factors outside the company\u2019s control, such as commodity-price fluctuations, stock-market volatility and even the weather. The pressure to meet short-term earnings estimates has contributed to the decline in the number of public companies in America over the past two decades.Roger Entner, a founder of Recon Analytics and co-author of the CTIA report, concedes that it might not matter much if the US introduces 5G a few months later than China. Europe was quicker to roll out 2G, and Japan was the first with 3G, but that hardly deterred Apple and Google from dominating the smartphone market. But Entner argues that if China beats the US by a year or two, it could damage the US\u2019s ability to compete in the global technology market.It\u2019s become clear that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us didn\u2019t only have an improvident amount of debt \u2014 it also had a debt structure as complex and precarious as a Jenga tower, which obscured the company\u2019s tenuous finances.Advertisement"}

But he has announced the paper will vacate its Art Deco headquarters in downtown Los Angeles and move to new offices in El Segundo, near the airport \u2014 a move that was greeted with a groan among staff because for many it will mean longer commutes in the city\u2019s notorious traffic.Dr. Soon-Shiong takes ownership at a time of deep peril for the news industry and when its national competitors have moved far ahead in adapting to the digital age, advancing new story formats and gaining digital subscribers.\u201cI believe that fake news is the cancer of our times and social media the vehicles for metastasis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstitutions like The Times and The Union-Tribune are more vital than ever. They must be bastions of editorial integrity and independence if they are to protect our democracy and provide an antidote to disinformation.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u201cWhen I start a company, I will integrate culture with service.\u201dThat\u2019s what Marc Benioff told himself after a trip to India. Then, in March 1999, he started Salesforce, the cloud computing service that is now the biggest tech company in San Francisco.\u201cA company like ours can\u2019t be successful in an unsuccessful economy or in an unsuccessful environment or where the school system doesn\u2019t work. We have to take responsibility for all of those things,\u201d Mr. Benioff told our columnist. \u201cAre we not all connected? Are we not all one?

{"Headline": "Playboi Carti Conquers the Paris Runway", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 21-year-old Atlanta rapper walks in Virgil Abloh\u2019s first men\u2019s wear collection for Louis Vuitton.\u201cThis is black history,\u201d Playboi Carti said. \u201cIt\u2019s monumental. This is Louis. This is the top dog. No disrespect to Vetements, but my mom, my dad, my auntie, my great-grandmother know what Louis is.\u201dHe pulled up to the park around 11 a.m. with his manager, bodyguard and a buddy who wore a red Balenciaga fanny pack. Mr. Abloh greeted him, and they strolled to the foot of the runway, a gradient rainbow path that went the entire length of the 17th-century courtyard. A camera crane arched overhead, as if threatening to pluck a human trinket from a bowling alley game. While Playboi Carti has modeled for Off-White and Yeezy, these stakes were higher. With several hours to go before showtime, an event producer led him on a dry run down the runway flanked with lime trees. \u201cStrong walk,\u201d she said, sidling along as he reached the end. \u201cStay focused, you\u2019re still visible. There\u2019s like 20 cameras on you and drones everywhere.\u201dHe would be closing the show, making him last to walk, but also first for the finale, when all the models march together. It was an enviable slot, and it made sense. He is a 6-foot-2 spray of limbs and braids, blending the cool stoniness of early 1990s Snoop Dogg with the wide-eyed twitchiness of youth incarnate.\u201cHe has an intangible quality,\u201d Mr. Abloh said. \u201cHis quiet presence and command of energy makes him a perfect model in my mind. He oozes potential.\u201dTaking a smoke break under one of the ornate archways, he recalled searching Google for \u201cCartier\u201d in his early teens. \u201cYou just see jets, gold, fancy watches, a lifestyle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt caught my eye when I was a young boy. I didn\u2019t have Cartier. I didn\u2019t have Gucci, Louis, none of that. I most definitely have great expectations for myself, but I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be here.\u201d With the 2:30 p.m. show approaching, the white staging tent erected along the southern Galerie du Jardin became a hive of activity. Young men awaiting haircuts and makeup were draped across couches in stages of repose. Playboi Carti, who was still in his street clothes (a yellow-and-black ensemble by Vlone), had his facial hair groomed by a heavily tattooed barber and his braids oiled. A manicurist struggled to remove the gel coating on his nails, which were decorated with yellow smiley faces.In the three-hour interim between the rehearsal and the show, he mostly hung out with ASAP Nast, sampling postage-stamp-size canap\u00e9s and a tiny bagel. Unimpressed, he wondered aloud, \u201cCan I get some McDonald\u2019s or something?\u201d A production assistant darted out of the tent. Soon, two heaping bags of McDonald\u2019s chicken nuggets arrived with a greasy waft.At last, it was time. Playboi Carti donned his Vuitton look: a reflective silver poncho, jeans emblazoned with characters from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d on the yellow brick road, black sneakers and a turquoise necklace. \u201cIt\u2019s fire,\u201d he said of the poncho. About five minutes later, Playboi Carti emerged from the tent and gleamed in the afternoon sun. He strode purposefully past thousands of camera-wielding spectators, brand fanatics swinging Vuitton purses, fashion editors and celebrities, including Mr. West, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian West, Bella Hadid, Naomi Campbell and Russell Westbrook. A drone buzzed above, as he approached the Galerie de Beaujolais, veered left and vanished. As the crowd applauded and frantically Instagrammed, he reappeared to lead a single-file army of models back down the runway. Still hard-eyed and expressionless, he hit all his marks. Moments later, he was back in the tent, whooping and hugging other models. The meniscus of tension had burst. Instead of brooding human wire hangers, they were rappers and skaters and rawboned teenagers again. He changed back into his street clothes and grabbed his look card, perhaps as a souvenir. What did he think of his moment under the Paris sun? \u201cI was just trying not to laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cStraight face. That\u2019s the only thing you can do. You can\u2019t fall.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Most of the early action consists of tapping glowing objects, dragging a finger in wand formations or answering multiple-choice questions, but the plot is timed so that your character gets into trouble and runs out of energy relatively early into the game. To move on, you either have to wait until your energy level returns or spend real money for digital coins or gems to power yourself back up.When \u201cHogwarts Mystery\u201d was first released, prices ranged from 99 cents for a \u201chandful of gems\u201d to $99.99 for a \u201cvault of gems\u201d \u2014 a cost that may feel like out-of-state tuition to parents footing the app bills.

{"Headline": "The Strange Case of the Missing Joyce Scholar", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "FeatureTwo decades ago, a renowned professor promised to produce a flawless version of one of the 20th century\u2019s most celebrated novels: \u201cUlysses.\u201d Then he disappeared.Supported byKidd had been the director of the James Joyce Research Center, a suite of offices on the campus of Boston University dedicated to the study of \u201cUlysses,\u201d arguably the greatest and definitely the most-obsessed-over novel of the 20th century. Armed with generous endowments and cutting-edge technology, he led a team dedicated to a single goal: producing a perfect edition of the text. I saved the Boston Globe story on my computer and would occasionally open it and just stare. Long ago, I contacted Kidd about working on an article together, because I was fascinated by one of his other projects \u2014 he had produced a digital edition, one that used embedded hyperlinks to make the novel\u2019s vast thicket of references and allusions, patterns and connections all available to the reader at a click.This is why \u201cUlysses,\u201d through most of the 20th century and into this one, still catches up all kinds of nonacademic readers who form clubs or stage readings on June 16. I remember wandering into an all-night read-a-thon on the Upper West Side, at Shakespeare & Co. on 81st Street, when I moved to New York in the 1980s. I arrived at the beginning, in the late afternoon, with good intentions, but staggered home and then returned the next day for the final chapter and suddenly realized that, read aloud, the 24 hours of the book\u2019s action take 24 hours to read. The running time in your head is the same as the running time in the book. For a few minutes, I thought I was onto something brilliant, until another yawning fan in the bookstore mentioned a set of connections she had found and I realized, Oh, right, we\u2019re all doing this.So was Kidd one of Joyce\u2019s prophesied professors, made so busy by the puzzles and enigmas that he was driven to literal madness? It seemed impossible to say, because not long after that newspaper article was published, Kidd simply vanished. Over the last 10 years, I would occasionally pick up the telephone, trying to scratch out some other ending to the story. I harbored this idea, a fantasy really, that John Kidd had abandoned the perfect \u201cUlysses\u201d to become the perfect Joycean \u2014 so consumed by the infinite interpretations of the book that he departed this grid of understanding.I started by contacting all the homeless shelters in Brookline. Then I wrote all of Kidd\u2019s old colleagues on the faculty at Boston University, working my way through the directory. \u201cI\u2019d heard that he died,\u201d wrote John Matthews, a Faulkner scholar, \u201cand I suspect that actually is true. ... Kidd was a public eccentric in town \u2014 the whole \u2018talking to the squirrels\u2019 deal. A sad ending.\u201d James Winn, a Dryden man, now retired, wrote that he had \u201cheard rumor of his death, but nothing substantive.\u201d And, if you scour the very bottom of the internet, the last tiny mentions in stray comment sections all speak of a miserable death.Not long ago, I came upon a Romanian scholar, Mircea Mihaies, who confirmed it. In fact, Mihaies wrote about the calamity in his history of \u201cUlysses.\u201d In an interview for the release of the book, Mihaies explained: John Kidd \u201cdied under sordid circumstances in 2010, buried in debt, detested, insulted, alone, abandoned by everyone, communicating only with pigeons on a Boston campus.\u201dThat sounded like a complete story, except for one thing. I couldn\u2019t find an obituary.As a young scholar, Kidd gained notice from professors, won prizes and quickly ascended the graduate-studies ladder. His love, though, was the big book, the grand epic \u2014 thinking through the theories and details of wide-ranging and all-encompassing narratives. He was drawn to Jungian theory, the one school of 20th-century psychoanalysis that theorized about the spiritual quest for completedness. The self, Jung wrote, \u201cexpresses the unity of the personality as a whole.\u201d Then, in graduate school, Kidd proposed a project on Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses,\u201d which he had read in three days as a teenager.But Kidd didn\u2019t just study the novel; he went to Joyce\u2019s tomb in Zurich and started to buy and collect every possible known, and many not-so-known, editions of the book. He compared every draft and every page. He became, in short, a kind of uber-Joycean. But he didn\u2019t take the normal graduate route, luring someone famous to be his mentor (like the critic Hugh Kenner or the biographer Richard Ellmann). Instead, he became a self-directed scholar, holed up in his garret with scores of different versions of \u201cUlysses.\u201dKidd had his work cut out for him. Joyce wrote \u201cUlysses\u201d over a period of seven years, amid world war and personal chaos. Not long after it appeared, poverty and disease quickly wasted Joyce. The walking stick \u201cthat he used for swagger as a young bachelor,\u201d Kevin Birmingham writes in \u201cThe Most Dangerous Book,\u201d \u201cbecame a blind man\u2019s cane in Paris.\u201d If you harbor in your mind, somewhere, the stereotype of a writer as a perfectionist in exile (usually in Paris), working in cold-water poverty on his masterpiece, that clich\u00e9 owes much to the lived reality of James Joyce as a young man.By nature, he was a scattershot writer, scribbling on scraps of paper, composing in notebooks and revising excerpts after they appeared in magazines \u2014 and in 1922, when \u201cUlysses\u201d first appeared, all that chaos was botched into print by French typesetters, most of whom spoke no English. That flawed version was banned in America, so a notorious pornographer, Sam Roth, rushed into print a pirated and even more corrupt edition. What had riled the censors (and attracted the vanguard readers) were a few scenes in \u201cUlysses\u201d where women indulge sexual fantasies. What we nowadays like to call \u201cfemale agency\u201d was \u2014 back then \u2014 elevated to a matter of national security. Customs agents scoured incoming ships to ensure that no American ever saw these pages. It\u2019s not a coincidence that so many women of that time championed the book, including the two famously gay editors of Little Review in Greenwich Village, Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap. In England, Harriet Weaver, and in Paris, Sylvia Beach. Finally, in 1933, a federal judge in the United States ruled in favor of publishing the novel, and Random House accidentally relied on the wildly corrupt Roth text to produce the official \u201cUlysses,\u201d which would go on to occupy American bookshelves for much of the 20th century.Among scholars and Joyce freaks, everyone knew \u201cUlysses\u201d was an odyssey of errors. Over the decades, there were rumors that some great textual fanatic was about to take on the brute task of cleaning it up. In the 1960s, excitement centered on Jack Dalton\u2019s work, but the task seemed to overwhelm him, and he died in 1981 without producing his edition. By the mid-1980s, European scholars took up the charge, culminating in the announcement of a coming version \u2014 \u201cUlysses: The Corrected Text\u201d \u2014 that would set straight 5,000 mistakes and give the world \u201c\u2009\u2018Ulysses\u2019 as Joyce wrote it.\u201dHarry Thrift, it turns out, was a real person who did enter a race back then. But now, Gabler had mistakenly corrected him to \u201cH. Shrift.\u201d For any devotee of the novel, this was mildly concerning. Of all the sets of references and allusions in a book built out of them, Joyce seemed particularly obsessed with his detailed invocation of 1904 Dublin. Or, as Joyce himself said (and every Joyce freak can quote), if Dublin \u201cone day disappeared from the earth, it could be reconstructed out of my book.\u201dKidd wrote: \u201cHarry Thrift\u2019s good works, sturdy frame, and jolly demeanor may fade to a misremembered blur, because he is deposed in Ulysses: The Corrected Text.\u201d And he added: \u201cDid it occur to anyone to check whether Thrift was a real person before changing him to Shrift? Apparently not.\u201dI remember getting up from my desk where I worked, pouring a fresh cup of coffee and then closing my office door so I wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. This was going to be good.Not a few paragraphs later, Kidd called out a slew of new mistakes and then guffawed, \u201cIs no one awake at the wheel?\u201d The piece carried on like this, as the tone gathered more of this vernacular force. After another volley of attacks about a misspelling here, a single dropped letter there, it read: \u201cThe Corrected Text is marbled with the fat of such pseudo-restorations from shoulder to shank.\u201dWho wrote like this in the literary world? Seducing us into textual minutiae with the prim tone of the academic before pieing us with vulgar prose? A vicious snap of proto-snark seemed to end every paragraph as Kidd resumed his formal stance, all textual scholar, only to be preparing for the next parry.Responding in a subsequent issue, Gabler maintained a stiff, dismissive stance. \u201cThe scanty array of examples,\u201d he wrote, \u201cprovides not even the flimsiest of foundations for a critique, let alone a condemnation.\u201d Kidd was permitted to reply in the same issue, and his rebuttal preened with unforgiving attitude. After challenging Gabler on substance, he slipped into mischievous singsong: \u201cIrony abounds. What redounds to Dr. Kidd rebounds. On several grounds, it sounds, he\u2019s out of bounds.\u201dEven though all the contested changes Kidd and others found might appear inconsequential, a few fundamentally affected the novel. In the book, Stephen Dedalus muses several times about the \u201cword known to all men.\u201d Was it death? Love? Some obscure Greek term (a Joyce specialty)? It\u2019s another tiny enigma that readers and professors have argued over for almost a century. Gabler found a passage in a manuscript where Joyce did reveal it, but it disappeared in the next version. Gabler deduced that to be a typist\u2019s error. And so, in a novel most famous for its elliptical style, the reader now comes across a passage containing this thunder of nuance: \u201cLove, yes. Word known to all men.\u201dTo get a sense of just how huffy Joyce readers might react to this, imagine an editor saying he found new parts of \u201cHamlet,\u201d and you picked up the new edition to read the words \u201cTo be or not to be, that is the question\u201d now followed by \u201cand the answer is definitely \u2018be.\u2019\u2009\u201dJust as egregious to many was the sacrilege concerning a single dot of ink. At the end of the last chapter featuring the protagonist Leopold Bloom, you find literature\u2019s largest period \u2014 a giant black dot on the page \u2014 the size of which Joyce worried over, instructing his French printers to make the first edition\u2019s big dot even \u201cmore visible.\u201dThe big dot ends a long, hilarious chapter that parodies the kind of crisp, cold tone associated with scientific discourse. The Q. and A. format is precise to the point of exasperation. By the end of the chapter and hundreds of questions \u2014 \u201cIn what directions did listener and narrator lie?\u201d \u201cIn what posture?\u201d \u2014 the pesky interrogator finally asks, \u201cWhere?\u201d To which Joyce drops his big fat dot, as if to say: Just shut up.But of course, that\u2019s just one interpretation. Some see the big dot as Earth, viewed from the heavenly throne of God, who is often understood to be the annoyingly precise narrator of this chapter. Some think it\u2019s a black hole or maybe Bloom\u2019s open mouth, finally collapsing into sleep at the interrogator\u2019s moronic questions. (Anthony Burgess thought that when reading the chapter aloud, the dot should be pronounced as a big snore.) Others think it\u2019s a portal, or an egg, or Molly Bloom\u2019s anus. There are lots of lively interpretations. In the most common Random House edition, it\u2019s there, it\u2019s final and it\u2019s huge \u2014 an inky one-eighth of an inch in diameter, the head of a twopenny nail stabbed into the book. But for some reason, Gabler\u2019s dot is barely larger than the period at the end of this sentence. When I reached him in his office in Germany, Gabler assured me that even though \u201cit is not a large one, it is a very black one.\u201dAs Kidd\u2019s challenge gained a wider audience, another academic named Charles Rossman wrote in with some big news. He had discovered that the Joyce Estate, run by Stephen Joyce, the author\u2019s notoriously prickly grandson, had authorized the Gabler edition for the reason of creating enough \u201cnew\u201d content to extend the copyright, which in Europe was expiring in 1992. This was not an inconsequential claim. At the time, \u201cUlysses\u201d sold an estimated 100,000 copies a year. A renewal of the copyright would protect revenues for decades to come, for both the publisher and Stephen Joyce, who had to legally authorize this new edition.Once Rossman\u2019s piece went public, the entire Gabler enterprise was cast into the sordid shadow of greed. Outrage mounted, and in the end, Random House announced it would bring back its old edition, however corrupt it might be. The smoke cleared to reveal that a vagabond scholar had waged a transoceanic battle and won.In those days, a superstar ethos was emerging among elite universities, and Boston University jumped at the chance to snatch up Kidd, giving him an entire institute. Its mission was epic \u2014 not merely a perfect text, \u201cas Joyce wrote it,\u201d but also a marriage of modern technology and literary genius. The manifold connections and allusions would now be instantly visible via hyperlinks, and the common reader would be able to appreciate the infinite recesses of Joyce\u2019s brilliance. W.W. Norton promised the kind of advance for the book that, back then, went only to best-selling writers \u2014 $350,000.The world waited for it. And then forgot.It was not easy to make contact with Botsford. I tried to get a hold of some of his relatives, but while I was doing that, a strange clue turned up. Sifting through some obscure Joyce-related hits on Google, I came upon an internet figure in Central America named Miguel, who burned off a lot of blog space expressing his love of naturism. Miguel liked to spend a lot of time naked. One of those posts noted that during a brief sojourn, back among the attired, Miguel attended a fiesta with a famous Joyce scholar.Miguel was based in Rio de Janeiro, a fact that suddenly reminded me of a brief exchange I had with a scholar in Bucharest named Lidia Vianu. When she herself tried to find Kidd a few years ago \u2014 she and a colleague were dedicating a book to him, a 31,802-page tome called \u201cThe Manual for the Advanced Study of James Joyce\u2019s \u2018Finnegans Wake\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 someone had given her an email address in Brazil. But, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get very far.\u201d The email address was dead.Still, on a Sunday afternoon, I typed out a simple note to the address she passed on to me. I wrote about when we first corresponded, back in the days of textual triumphalism, and I casually mentioned a possible trip to Rio. I hit send.First thing, Monday morning: \u201cI remember you very well. ... When do you plan to be in Rio?\u201d Carnival was coming soon, so I jumped on a plane.John Kidd, who is 65, is well above 6 feet tall and comfortably carries the emerging evidence of many a fine dinner. He no longer has the tidy short blond hair of 30 years ago. It\u2019s now grown out snowy white and halfway down his back, deep into Gandalf territory. He\u2019s a devoted fan of loosefitting Hawaiian shirts, flip-flops and shorts. He has a high-water booty and takes rapid tiny steps, making every excursion feel as if we\u2019re running late.Right off, he wants to talk about that Boston Globe article with the pigeons. His outrage is still raw. He\u2019s particularly miffed that he was called \u201cbroke.\u201d He wants me to know he\u2019s flush and always has been. He has, at the ready, a notarized letter from Fleet Bank in Brookline dated 14 years ago, stating: \u201csix months avg balance in this checking account has been $15,618.00.\u201dI want to talk about how he left Boston University, but when the bitter memories of departmental fights at B.U. or old quarrels with students over grades come up, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s bitten a lemon and his entire face focuses darkly on a point just beyond his nose. Kidd told me he quit. And he did, but only after there were stories in The Boston Globe noting his temper, his treatment of students and his clashes with campus security over birds. He lingered on campus for a while, haunting Marsh Plaza, and then he disappeared.He told me he set off to Beijing. He had read \u201cDream of the Red Chamber,\u201d China\u2019s great epic novel, and become a \u201credologist,\u201d an actual term for those who submerge themselves in the study of this one book. He later moved to Brazil and became fluent in Portuguese before plunging, as seemed inevitable, into that language\u2019s own works of heroic fiction. He is obsessed now with a 19th-century book about a helpless young girl, \u201cThe Slave Isaura,\u201d a popular work that in its early days helped end slavery (essentially, Brazil\u2019s \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d). Kidd\u2019s compulsion to understand any culture\u2019s big book is still what gets him out of bed in the morning.As we settle down to breakfast at a swanky hotel, it\u2019s clear that the controversies of 1988 are all still very much alive for him. Of the 5,000 or so corrections Gabler claimed to have made to \u201cUlysses,\u201d there is not one of them Kidd cannot discuss, in rich detail, 30 years later. In particular, he is still steamed up about the Penelope chapter. He flipped open the book and stabbed his finger at the dead center of the famous 42-page interior monologue of Molly Bloom. Joyce originally punctuated the chapter with two periods, one at the end and one at the center, appropriately after Molly muses over the word \u201cashpit.\u201dGabler\u2019s edition eliminated the ashpit period \u2014 then replaced it not long after Kidd made a ruckus. But when asked by a journalist once about how he came to correct this mistake, Gabler said he heard about it from a stranger who showed him a newspaper article. (More recently, Gabler assured me that he\u2019d heard it from a \u201cnumber\u201d of sources.)\u201cOf course, the article was Remnick\u2019s Washington Post piece,\u201d Kidd said, highly agitated. \u201cThere were three different portraits of me in that one article,\u201d he went on, \u201chuge pictures of John Kidd, one of which is like seven inches tall or something, a picture of me!\u201d Kidd didn\u2019t merely remember every textual change in the Gabler edition, but every minor grudge match attending each change. The old fight, it seemed, had moldered into a snit about credit.And indeed, it\u2019s possible to dismiss Kidd as a man who found a handful of serious errors and then used his fussy mastery of minutiae to inflate a few hundred other flecks into a raging scandal. But it\u2019s also true \u201cUlysses\u201d is a book whose every detail matters. Joyce himself was consumed by his own compulsion for details, his love of coincidence and his obsession for superstition \u2014 he built the novel out of them. He once wrote to Harriet Weaver worrying about the year 1921, whose digits total 13. One outlying theory connects this arithmetic fear to Joyce\u2019s decision to publish Ulysses on his birthday the following year, which had a sublime smoothness when written down on paper: 2/2/22.\u201cYou really have to read Fernando Pessoa,\u201d he said, handing me a collection of poems, in Portuguese, by this early-20th-century Lisbon writer, titled \u201cA Little Larger Than the Entire Universe.\u201d I cracked open Kidd\u2019s copy to find a swarm of marginal notes on nearly every page, cataloging textual alternatives in the many other Portuguese editions he owns. This is how John Kidd reads everything \u2014 as a search for the perfected text.It\u2019s not just an aesthetic choice for Kidd but a kind of compulsion toward completedness, suffusing not just how he reads literature but also how he talks about it. We discussed \u201cGargantua and Pantagruel\u201d and \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and \u201cTristram Shandy.\u201d He considers them all to be \u201cantic\u201d works, his coinage for books that are marked by a \u201ccomic take on the encyclopedic narrative just as the \u2018Iliad\u2019 is a tragic take on an encyclopedic narrative.\u201d Those novels are playful, like \u201cUlysses,\u201d but they mean to embrace and comprehend a sense of everything, and it\u2019s this sense of totality and the longing for it that drives Kidd, too.When critics talk about Joyce\u2019s mind, they typically resort to comparable terms, referring to Joyce\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge of history, myth and language. \u201cUlysses,\u201d as every beginning reader quickly picks up, contains a schematic view of downtown Dublin, and \u201cFinnegans Wake\u201d can be understood as all of history and literature written in a mash-up of every language.Joyce was well aware of his compendious cast of mind and proud to find it manifest among his children. When it became clear that his daughter Lucia was suffering a profound kind of schizophrenia, he came to see her difference as an improvement on himself. He cared for her, sometimes shelving his own ambitions to convince the world that the true genius in the family was his incoherent, troubled daughter. \u201cFoolish fond like Lear\u201d is how his biographer would later describe Joyce\u2019s paternal affection.Inside the refuge of the academy, Kidd keeps a permanent cubicle occupied by a big old PC and a few books. For years he has been working on the first English edition of the novel \u201cThe Slave Isaura.\u201d Kidd is translating the 19th-century book with a few rules he felt compelled to devise. The work will be in two parts, and every word in Part 1 will have its lexicographic partner in Part 2. If \u201ccat feet\u201d appears in Part 1, expect \u201ccattail\u201d in Part 2. His sense of what pairs up can get quite intricate, but that\u2019s part of the fun, he told me. So he maintains lists of all the possible pairings and where and whether he has used one: six foot, six foot under, footing, foothills, footloose, footprint. There is a logic to the work, and the part I read resounded with the baroque tone you might expect of a translation that will obey his other rule: It will use every word exactly once.Already, the work is nearly twice as plump as Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d Kidd was particularly excited to show me his key apparatus \u2014 the homemade thesaurus where he keeps a running crosscheck on the entirety of the English language. So far, it runs to some 3,000 pages.\u201cAs much as humanly possible, the 19th-century dictionary of English is in here,\u201d he told me. His translation is titled \u201cIsaura Unbound,\u201d and he wanted me to understand its ambition: When the book is finished, it will be a complete reordering of one entire English dictionary into a single work of art. Take that, void.I asked him that afternoon, one more time, about the perfect \u201cUlysses.\u201d It always seems so close. Back in the 1960s, again in 1980s. What happened to his work in Boston? Why can\u2019t we just publish the thing? A few errors \u2014 how hard can it be?When I pressed him on real-world specifics, the manuscripts, the work that must have been on disks somewhere, he recalled that, yes, he had assembled a draft of an edition with a complete introduction. One of Kidd\u2019s editors at Norton, Julia Reidhead, confirmed that both existed but said that one delay after another \u2014 \u201can infinite loop of revision\u201d \u2014 ran into the legal wall of new copyright extensions, and so Norton \u201cstopped the project.\u201d One Joyce scholar remembers reading the introduction but no longer has a copy, and Kidd doesn\u2019t have one either. Instead, we are left with bizarre relics of what could have been. Early on in the Joyce wars, in fact, Arion Press issued a new edition of \u201cUlysses\u201d that included some of the preliminary Kidd edits. The book was luxurious, with prints by Robert Motherwell, and only 175 of them were printed. I found one for sale on Amazon. The seller wanted $25,678.75.In the years after Kidd\u2019s disappearance, an uncanny thing happened. The very book Kidd had tried to shame into disrepute was embraced by the world of scholarship. In 1993, the \u201cGabler Edition\u201d of \u201cUlysses,\u201d a bright red tome, appeared on the bookshelves. There are various printings of this book now, and many have no dot at all at the end of the Bloom chapter. No period of any size, which Gabler has said is a printing error \u2014 making this nondot an error miscorrected so many times that it is now perfectly invisible.Gabler\u2019s book thrives because it now has its own captive audience: academics. \u201cScholars have quietly gone back to Gabler,\u201d said Robert Spoo, a former editor of The James Joyce Quarterly. \u201cBy not publishing his own edition, Kidd never completed the argument against Gabler,\u201d he said, adding that the Gabler edition \u201chas one great advantage, you can cite it by line numbers; that is very handy for scholars.\u201d That whole \u201c\u2009\u201980s and \u201990s thing,\u201d as Spoo called it, receded long ago. \u201cScholars have made peace with the Gabler.\u201dIn that stretch when the original edition fell out of copyright in the mid-1990s, a lot of editors rushed to publish their own editions. Some have dots, some don\u2019t. Some with \u201clove,\u201d some not. Some editors reversed a selection of Gabler\u2019s changes, some didn\u2019t. Other editions have gone off the rails, as the Joyce scholar Sam Slote told me: One \u201cUlysses,\u201d currently available online, has a long, weird riff inserted on Page 160, announcing that you will now be reading \u201cThe Secret Confessions of a Conservative,\u201d where the anonymous writer explains that his pro-life, pro-death-penalty positions are so consistent that \u201cif an embryo or fetus commits murder, then he should be aborted.\u201dOut in the distant pampas, meanwhile, the perfect edition remains always close at hand and just out of reach. \u201cI am almosting it,\u201d Stephen Dedalus muttered early on in the novel. The thing is, on Amazon alone, there are nearly a dozen slightly different versions of the novel \u201cas James Joyce wrote it.\u201d None of them are absolutely perfect, but each of them, nevertheless, is \u201cUlysses.\u201d It\u2019s almost too pat an ending for an author who was asked about all those errors nearly a century ago. \u201cThese are not misprints,\u201d he said, \u201cbut beauties of my style hitherto undreamt of.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Net Neutrality Actually Ended Long Before This Week", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIt seemed obvious that the internet\u2019s great promise was that it operated outside the purview of existing communications monopolies. Because phone and cable companies couldn\u2019t easily dictate what happened online, the internet was exploding in dozens of genuinely new ideas. Among those back then were blogs, Skype, file-sharing, YouTube, Friendster, Netflix \u2014 ideas that scrambled our sense of what was possible in media and communication, and, in the process, posed existential threats to the established giants.Other than the phone and cable companies themselves, I couldn\u2019t see why anyone might oppose the simple premise of protecting the environment that had made all these things possible. Did they hate clean water, too?Net neutrality was too good for us. And even if rules are restored, the notion that the internet should afford at least a minimally competitive landscape for new entrants now seems as antiquated as Friendster.Today, the internet is run by giants. A handful of American tech behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 control the most important digital infrastructure, while a handful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon \u2014 control most of the internet connections in the United States.So, what now?It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201cHistory shows us that companies that have the technical capacity to do things, the business incentive to do them and the legal right \u2014 they will take advantage of what is made available to them,\u201d said Jessica Rosenworcel, an F.C.C. commissioner and a Democrat, who voted against the repeal of net neutrality last year.By repealing neutrality rules, the government has just given our online overlords that legal right, she cautioned.\u201cNow they can block websites and censor online content,\u201d Ms. Rosenworcel said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel good \u2014 and if you rely on the internet to consume or create, it shouldn\u2019t make you feel good, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Understand What Ails the Modern Internet? Look at eBay", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThere was a time when eBay was practically synonymous with buying and selling things online. Now it\u2019s surprisingly easy to forget that it exists, until you need to buy something you can\u2019t find anywhere else or clear some space in the attic. Or until someone like Elon Musk, made fabulously wealthy when PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, muscles his way back into your consciousness by, for example, launching rockets into space or burrowing tunnels under major American cities. Where did he come from, exactly? As with a surprising number of tech heavyweights, the answer is complicated, but it runs through eBay.None of this is to say that eBay has gone away \u2014 in 2017, more merchandise changed hands over the platform than in any earlier year. It\u2019s just ancient in tech terms. It went public in 1998. But perhaps more than any other tech giant of its era \u2014 excluding Amazon \u2014 eBay has shaped the tech industry of 2018. Depending on how you look at it, this is an assignation of credit or blame. EBay\u2019s influence can be felt in both trivial and fundamental ways in companies like Facebook, Google and Uber.EBay is a platform that connects buyers and sellers. It does not itself sell goods; it lists and sorts and processes, providing shelves for its users\u2019 inventory and aisles for their prospective customers. It mediates as little as possible, and it takes a cut. Its problems, in the early days, felt new, at least at eBay\u2019s scale: managing disputes among significant numbers of users, dealing with bad actors of various sorts, addressing scams and fakes, establishing not just a framework for mass human interaction but systems through which to codify trust and resolve conflict.To its credit, eBay has ameliorated many of its problems, through public trial and error, over the course of nearly two decades. \u201cAll the linchpins on which modern platforms rely, at least at a very high level, eBay pioneered,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and a longtime researcher of online platforms. \u201cWe use it in almost every paper we do.\u201d EBay, in obvious and subtle ways, has served as a model well beyond the world of commerce, inspiring the systems that play host to discourse, media, culture and communication online. It was among the first true megaplatforms \u2014 the sort that establishes itself as something like online infrastructure. And it may be, to date, the last one we truly understand.This basic approach to seller vetting has been adopted, and adapted, for much wider use, often with far less remove. In 2001, an eBay user might have given an eBay seller a low rating for an unsatisfactory packaging job; in 2018, an Uber driver might be dinged if a rider doesn\u2019t like his personality or choice of music. Facebook recently began ranking publishers by trustworthiness, based on feedback from users. Upon discovering a problem, a platform company\u2019s first instinct is to find a way to expose it to the wisdom of a market, or at least the will of a crowd.EBay users\u2019 participation in the site\u2019s governance is best understood as large-scale offloading of labor, and is basically limited to snitching on one another; users have some recourse against one another and somewhat less against the site itself. That imbalance doesn\u2019t bother us because eBay is eBay. \u201cIt\u2019s a transactional platform; the transaction is very clear to both sides,\u201d Hagiu says. \u201cBy and large, buyers and sellers are aligned on eBay.\u201d A seller banned for counterfeit sunglasses hasn\u2019t lost any rights, just his ability to use eBay. Crucially, to most ears, a scammer\u2019s claims to the contrary would sound ridiculous.But quite often it\u2019s managed like one, because in many ways, that\u2019s exactly what it is: a giant, multisided marketplace for buying and selling, in which the largest party \u2014 the users \u2014 doesn\u2019t do the buying or the selling. A social network\u2019s profitable transactions involve everyone but the users. Ad rates are even determined, in many cases, by auction. If eBay is a machine for finding the right price for a pair of shoes, Facebook \u2014 behind the veneer of enabling human connection \u2014 is a machine for discovering the right price for a pair of eyeballs. Your eyeballs.When the biggest platforms seem to be flailing or punting on problems, it\u2019s often because they\u2019re trying to address broad social issues with market solutions. They\u2019re rediscovering, at scale and at great expense to their users, the ways in which a society is more than a bazaar, and the pitfalls of allowing human attention to be sold and resold as a commodity. If a platform is addressing a collective problem in a maddeningly strange way, consider that it might see itself, or only know to govern itself, like an eBay. If it can\u2019t keep bad actors from using the service to exploit other users, that\u2019s because it\u2019s modeled after a system in which finding the highest bidder \u2014 or the biggest sucker \u2014 is gamely understood to be the point.There are more lessons for the new internet to learn from the old, and eBay\u2019s more recent trajectory might likewise give us clues about where its successors will go next. EBay was once a world-beating company, destined to totally remake commerce. While its legacy is powerful, it has, over the years, discovered its limits. Amazon, not eBay, is now most synonymous with online shopping. The site has also undergone some more fundamental changes. Auctions, for example, have become less popular over time, as sellers and buyers have favored the site\u2019s other buying styles, with fixed or suggested prices. And in many categories, large sellers have become entrenched, functioning more like stores themselves than desperate participants in a giant open-air market. EBay\u2019s final lesson to the next generation of platforms is that nothing is inevitable. Or lasts forever.Even still, eBay and PayPal\u2019s alumni are now immensely wealthy and unusually influential, and are using that power to reshape the world around them: Musk, with his electric cars and rockets and flamethrowers; Pierre Omidyar, with his investments and media ventures; Peter Thiel \u2014 an early Facebook investor and board member \u2014 with his funding of lawsuits against media companies and his eclectic and severe right-wing politics. It is worth considering what sort of initiatives might be spawned by the beneficiaries of today\u2019s much larger platform companies. EBay invited us onto an auction floor and dared us to compete with one another; millions did. Social-media companies found a more lucrative approach, with an even bigger payoff, by building the auction floor right under our feet.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Bikini Contest Is Over, but We Are Living Inside the Beauty Pageant", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Weiss\u00a0is a staff editor and writer for the Opinion section.On Tuesday morning came the news that the oldest beauty pageant in America is no longer a beauty pageant.Ms. Carlson is the perfect person to lead Miss America through this transformation. She won the crown herself in 1988 and went on to a career at Fox News, where she laid the groundwork for the #MeToo movement, blowing the whistle on Roger Ailes long before there were headlines about Harvey Weinstein.Miss America 2.0, as the event has been branded, will be \u201ca competition\u201d \u2014 not a pageant, Ms. Carlson said on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing a cultural revolution in our country, with women finding the courage to stand up and have their voices heard on many issues,\u201d she added.Getting rid of the bikini contest won\u2019t stop judges \u2014 and the rest of the world \u2014 from critiquing contestants\u2019 outer beauty. As all women know, that happens even if we are shuffling down the block in old sweats.The real reason the bikini contest was done away with is that it\u2019s simply too explicit for our euphemistic era, where \u201cstrong\u201d is the code word for skinny, and \u201chealthy\u201d for beautiful. Our culture hasn\u2019t stopped objectifying women. We \u2014 men and women both \u2014 are just getting better at pretending it\u2019s not happening. Ours is the age of Pilates and athleisure, of detoxifying and \u201cwellness,\u201d of organic and biodynamic, of game-ifying weight loss by calling calories points.Standing up on a stage in stilettos and tiny squares of nylon held up by string is just too gauche for 2018.Of course, President Trump is the crude outlier here, as he is for so many civilized norms. But far too often when I hear a man describe a woman as \u201csuper fit,\u201d my brain substitutes some variation of Mr. Trump\u2019s locker-room talk.The game is now all about discretion \u2014 of insisting you aren\u2019t working hard while you are absolutely gritting your teeth, of telling your date that you just don\u2019t like bread. While men pretend not to judge women for the way they look, we go to great lengths to pretend we don\u2019t care, either.And so we blend leaves together and call it \u201cdelicious\u201d and \u201cjuice\u201d instead of a mealy sludge.We wear stilts to hike around concrete jungles and lie about how they are anything other than medieval torture devices.We get the tiny horns on the tips of our fingers and toes painted in shades so subtle that heterosexual men don\u2019t even realize we got them painted at all.We shell out hundreds of dollars for magic elixirs and oils the size of Theranos Nanotainers that don\u2019t even promise youth but boast that they are \u201cclean.\u201dWe lie under fluorescent lights and hold our thighs open for strips of burning hot wax while we chat about the new season of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201dWe read about the beauty routines and morning routines and nighttime routines and midday routines of women infinitely more wealthy than we are and then study their social media accounts to see how we might approximate their lives.We spend hundreds of dollars on makeup that makes it look as if we aren\u2019t wearing any makeup at all.We muss our hair and pout our lips and Google \u201cbest angles\u201d and hold our cameras ever so slightly above our faces.We practice for future careers in STEM: If I burn 450 calories at Soul Cycle I can totally get away with a little sushi at lunch. Or maybe better go for the sashimi and hold out for a second glass of ros\u00e9 at dinner?We give ourselves shots in the stomach that make us want to murder everyone at the office so that one day we can become the boss of that office and have a kid alone at 50 with our frozen eggs.In the meantime, we brutally assess the facial symmetry of potential mates on dating apps without enough vowels and post pictures of ourselves that our friends have approved via group chat.We are so much more than this. But we can\u2019t help but get distracted by the whole charade. And we are the women who have the luxury of even thinking about having it all! This is what having it all looks like.I won\u2019t miss the bikini contest a lick. I haven\u2019t watched Miss America since I was in middle school, and I was incredulous even then. The thought of growing up to be like the women on the screen never crossed my mind. It\u2019s not because I wasn\u2019t ambitious: It\u2019s that I looked at them and felt confident I was a different species. I\u2019m sure the bikinis had something to do with it.But there was also something strangely honest about it. We are being watched and scrutinized and judged. We are watching and scrutinizing and judging. It is, as Ms. Carlson said, a competition.Advertisement"}

But as these companies take on lucrative contracts to furnish state and federal agencies with these technologies, they\u2019re facing increasing pushback from their staffs.We refuse to contribute to tools that violate human rights.

Matt Wood, general manager of artificial intelligence at Amazon Web Services, wrote:We believe it is the wrong approach to impose a ban on promising new technologies because they might be used by bad actors for nefarious purposes in the future. The world would be a very different place if we had restricted people from buying computers because it was possible to use that computer to do harm.

{"Headline": "What Data Has Done to Capitalism", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I\u2019m regularly frustrated by the process of searching for hotel accommodations for my family of five. We know what we want: a basic suite, like at a Residence Inn, with four beds, two bedrooms and a bathroom off the common area. But we struggle to find it, because hotel search engines make it surprisingly difficult to figure out the specifications of rooms.Lacking that information, I sometimes end up calling a hotel reservations agent, who typically can\u2019t tell me much more than I can read online. Then I go back to the search engine, make a decision based on price and hope for the best. If someone \u2014 either a hotel chain or an aggregator \u2014 built a better search engine, I would happily use it. I would also be willing to pay a bit more for the kind of room my family wants, rather than shopping almost exclusively by price.After reading this new book by Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Thomas Ramge, \u201cReinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data,\u201d I now have a name for what I\u2019m looking for: a data-rich market. And I\u2019m optimistic that it will one day come to the hotel business. Data-rich markets are sweeping across the global economy. \u201cUntil recently, communicating such rich information in markets was difficult and costly. So we used a workaround and condensed all of this information into a single metric: price,\u201d they write. \u201cIn data-rich markets, we no longer have to condense our preferences into price and can abandon the oversimplification that was necessary because of communicative and cognitive limits.\u201dAmazon, with its many product specifications and customer reviews, is often a data-rich market. So are Spotify, Netflix, Lyft, StubHub, Rent the Runway, Tinder and Airbnb (which provides a much better search for lodging than hotels do). These markets aren\u2019t just about first-world convenience, either. In the Indian state of Kerala, among other places, a data-rich market has transformed the fishing business. Fishermen no longer have to guess which seaside market needs their catch. They can use their mobile phones to tell them which markets have a gap between supply and demand.All in all, the move to data-rich markets is for the good. It is of a piece with the ideals of Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Immanuel Kant. Knowledge spreads, and people are able to act on it. Fishermen sell more fish. Fish eaters have more choice. In one realm after another, people are able to find products and services they want, rather than having to settle for something less useful.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the University of Oxford, and Ramge, a writer for The Economist, explain all of these advantages. To their credit, though, they spend more time in their book on the downsides of data-rich markets. These include the potential to put people out of work and to concentrate corporate power among a small number of firms that control the most valuable data. The book echoes some of the themes of Tim Wu\u2019s 2010 history, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d which documented the tendency of information technology to produce cartels and monopolies. The only way to avoid this fate, all of these authors agree, is a smart, activist government dedicated to protecting its citizens\u2019 interests.This new book starts its story with the ancient idea of human coordination. \u201cIf there is a single crucial thread that has persisted through human history,\u201d the authors write, \u201cit is the importance of coordination.\u201d Coordination allows communities to accomplish tasks that individuals working alone cannot. People can build on one another\u2019s strengths and make up for one another\u2019s weaknesses. Coordination made possible the library of Alexandria, the Great Wall of China, the Suez Canal and the moon landing. Coordination, in turn, depends on communication \u2014 the exchange of information that allows people to work together.In modern times, the most effective way to coordinate behavior, other than through government, has been through a company, also known as a firm. Firms tend to follow a top-down approach to coordination. A canonical example is Henry Ford\u2019s automobile firm. There, workers were divided into specialized groups. Information flowed up from these groups through a tightly controlled management structure that culminated with an imperial chief executive. Decisions came down from the top.But the firm is not the only way for the private sector to coordinate. The market offers a different model for doing so, one that both complements and competes with the firm\u2019s hierarchical approach. The market is decentralized. It has no top-down authority. Participants come and go with ease.In the market, the dominant mechanism for coordination and communication has long been price. It\u2019s simple to understand, often too simple. It is one-dimensional. That\u2019s why firms have long provided a more efficient way for people to coordinate, because they could better synthesize a rich stream of information and then act on it. Today, however, the explosion of computing power has enabled many more people to gather information and analyze it quickly, which has allowed the lingua franca of the market to become more sophisticated. In response, many firms are reorganizing themselves to mimic markets. They have become less strictly hierarchical and spread decision-making power to a larger number of people.For all their differences, the firm and the market do share a central flaw. They often are not self-correcting. Early winners can use their strength to beat back competition, amassing yet more strength \u2014 and ultimately hurting the public interest. It happened with the railroad trusts, Standard Oil and AT&T, and it is beginning to happen with the big winners in today\u2019s data-rich, market-oriented economy. Superstar companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google earn enormous profits, while employing a surprisingly small work force relative to their scale. They are adept at avoiding taxes. And they continue to amass data about human behavior that will help them grow even stronger.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Ramge offer several intriguing ideas for limiting the excesses of data-rich capitalism. One idea is a \u201crobo tax\u201d as a partial replacement for the payroll tax \u2014 machines would be taxed more and human employment less. Another idea is mandated data sharing \u2014 an echo of the patent system, which also depends on disclosure, the authors note \u2014 to allow new entrants a fair chance to compete.These ideas won\u2019t get much of a hearing in today\u2019s Washington. But the shift toward an information-based economy will outlast the current administration. Eventually, this country will have a government interested in encouraging the best parts of modern capitalism while restraining the worst.David Leonhardt is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Shuns the Tech Industry\u2019s Apology Tour", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Sorry, Apple\u2019s not sorry.Though Apple acknowledged the darker side of society\u2019s obsession with the digital world, it didn\u2019t go anywhere near the idea that its own technology might bear any of the blame.Apple did announce several new ways of letting adults and children limit how much time they spend on their phones. A tool called Screen Time, for example, is meant to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps. And parents will be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones.Apple\u2019s software chief, Craig Federighi, said the company felt it was time to address smartphones\u2019 oversize impact on everyday life. \u201cFor some of us, it\u2019s become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we\u2019ve become,\u201d he said.These features looked quite handy \u2014 we will know for sure once they\u2019re released to users this year. If they do push users to quit wasting so much time on Facebook and YouTube (where getting people to waste time is a big part of the business plan), they are sure to roil Apple\u2019s relationship with others in tech.But that is not Apple\u2019s problem; it is more concerned about selling you a new phone.Apple is also putting considerable resources into making its Watch stand apart from its phone, a direction that in the long run will create more opportunities to go without a phone. Are you wearing an Apple Watch instead of carrying an iPhone? In time, Apple may not care.But at its event here, Apple\u2019s support for what\u2019s being called \u201cdigital well-being\u201d often awkwardly butted up against Apple\u2019s larger goal: to make the digital world so awesome, you can\u2019t resist it.The next iPhone will let you turn your face into an emoji, and now it can even do \u201ctongue detection\u201d \u2014 an animated version of your face can stick out its tongue when you do. With Apple\u2019s new augmented reality system, the iPhone can turn Legos into a video game. But if you can\u2019t even play with some Legos without reaching for your phone, isn\u2019t that kind of a problem?Apple wants to stand apart from the techlash with its emphasis on privacy and its oft-stated distaste for the excesses of the internet ad industry. On Monday, the company said its Safari web browser would disable tracking software, or cookies, that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users\u2019 activity across the internet.The new Safari feature is a direct swipe at the data-collection practices of big internet companies that Apple has tried hard to separate itself from.Apple argues that it has always been one of the more high-minded of the big tech companies, so it shouldn\u2019t be lumped in with outfits like Facebook.But that argument has always been a little complicated. Apple benefits from our obsession with social software; people buy its powerful phones to use Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year for the privilege of being the iPhone\u2019s default search engine.\u201cWe aim to put the customer at the center of everything we do,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said several times Monday.That seemed like a promise as well as a backhanded defense. Apple will give you the world. What you do with it is your own problem.Jack Nicas contributing reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Have Reached Peak Screen. Now Revolution Is in the Air.", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut now that smartphones have achieved dominance, revolution is again in the air.There\u2019s a reason tech companies are feeling this tension between making phones better and worrying they are already too addictive. We\u2019ve hit what I call Peak Screen.For much of the last decade, a technology industry ruled by smartphones has pursued a singular goal of completely conquering our eyes. It has given us phones with ever-bigger screens and phones with unbelievable cameras, not to mention virtual reality goggles and several attempts at camera-glasses.So tech giants are building the beginning of something new: a less insistently visual tech world, a digital landscape that relies on voice assistants, headphones, watches and other wearables to take some pressure off our eyes.This could be a nightmare; we may simply add these new devices to our screen-addled lives. But depending on how these technologies develop, a digital ecosystem that demands less of our eyes could be better for everyone \u2014 less immersive, less addictive, more conducive to multitasking, less socially awkward, and perhaps even a salve for our politics and social relations.Who will bring us this future? Amazon and Google are clearly big players, but don\u2019t discount the company that got us to Peak Screen in the first place. With advances to the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, Apple is slowly and almost quietly creating an alternative to its phones.If it works, it could change everything again. As I argue below, there are many ways that screens have become too dominant in our lives. The sooner we find something else, the better.When you do give in, you lose your mind.\u201cWhat you get sucked into is not the one thing that caught your attention \u2014 your text message or tweet or whatever,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at the technology research firm Creative Strategies. Instead, you unlock your phone and instantly, almost unconsciously, descend into the irresistible splendors of the digital world \u2014 emerging 30 minutes later, stupefied and dazed.\u201cYou open this irresistible box, and you can\u2019t fight it,\u201d she said.Tech companies understand this power, of course; our inability to resist screens explains why phone screens keep getting bigger.He was wrong. Rivals, led by Samsung, found that big-screen phones sold very well. The eyes won out over the hands. Eventually Apple joined the party, making iPhones with bigger and then still bigger displays. The largest-screen iPhones now account for half of Apple\u2019s sales and the majority of its profits.But screens have now become a crutch for technologists, a lazy, catchall way to add digital experiences to every product.Or look at augmented reality, the technology that allows you to see digital imagery superimposed on the real world. In a few specific uses \u2014 turning your face into a dog\u2019s on Snapchat \u2014 this can be fun. But too often, A.R. feels gimmicky. Rather than commingling the digital and the real, it simply uses a screen to usurp the world around you.At Apple\u2019s developer conference this month, Martin Sanders, a Lego executive, showed off a new A.R. Lego set. When he pointed his iPad at a Lego structure, his screen filled with digital fireworks, superheros, sports cars \u2014 a whole bustling Lego town that he didn\u2019t have to build with his hands or imagine with his head.\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do here!\u201d Mr. Sanders exclaimed as he and an assistant stood completely still, staring at animated Legos through a piece of digital glass. It was bizarre. The whole point of Lego is physical interaction, but thanks to A.R., he had turned Lego into just another video game.There are two ways we may break our fevered addiction to screens.First, we will need to try to use our phones more mindfully, which requires a combination of willpower and technology.Help is on the way. For the last week, I\u2019ve been using Screen Time, one of the new features in Apple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system. The software gives you valuable information about how much you are using your phone, and it can even block you from using apps that you deem unhealthy. I found Screen Time very well designed, and I suspect it will profoundly change how we use our phones.But in addition to helping us resist phones, the tech industry will need to come up with other, less immersive ways to interact with digital world. Three technologies may help with this: voice assistants, of which Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Assistant are the best, and Apple\u2019s two innovations, AirPods and the Apple Watch.All of these technologies share a common idea. Without big screens, they are far less immersive than a phone, allowing for quick digital hits: You can buy a movie ticket, add a task to a to-do list, glance at a text message or ask about the weather without going anywhere near your Irresistible Screen of Splendors.These are all works in progress. Voice assistants still cannot do everything for you, though Google and Amazon have thousands of engineers working to improve them. AirPods are fantastic \u2014 they have fewer connection issues than any other wireless headphones \u2014 and after years of refinement, the Apple Watch shows you just enough stuff from your phone to make it useful without becoming overbearing.If Apple could only improve Siri, its own voice assistant, the Watch and AirPods could combine to make something new: a mobile computer that is not tied to a huge screen, that lets you get stuff done on the go without the danger of being sucked in. Imagine if, instead of tapping endlessly on apps, you could just tell your AirPods, \u201cMake me dinner reservations at 7\u201d or \u201cCheck with my wife\u2019s calendar to see when we can have a date night this week.\u201dApple has never been scared of disrupting its own best inventions. By rethinking screens, it may have a chance to do that once more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Twitch, Amazon Tightens Grip on Live Streams of Video Games", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate on a recent night, more than 600,000 people watched one of the most popular video game players, Tyler Blevins, engage in Fortnite Battle Royale with a celebrity guest: Drake.Drake was deferential to Mr. Blevins as they teamed up before an audience that peaked at roughly 667,000 viewers, a ratings record (since broken) for a nontournament live stream. As the game progressed, the world-famous rapper played a supporting role, collecting supplies for Ninja, seemingly content to lend a hand to a master at work.Like others who make significant money on Twitch, Mr. Blevins is a born talker, and he bantered with the fans as he and Drake played. Drake joined the conversation, too. He told the commenters that he liked pineapple on his pizza and explained that he was a Ninja fan before Twitch, back when Mr. Blevins, 27, first found fame among gamers on YouTube and Instagram.Streamlabs \u2014 a San Francisco tech company whose software allows viewers to tip streamers, giving the company insight into an opaque ecosystem \u2014 suggests that Amazon\u2019s lead may be all but insurmountable. Its data shows that, in the last quarter, the average number of people watching Twitch\u2019s streams at any given moment increased to 953,000, up from 788,000. Twitch\u2019s archrival, YouTube Gaming, averaged 272,000 concurrent viewers, down from 308,000 in the previous quarter, Streamlabs reported.YouTube pushed back against the data, but declined to provide numbers of its own. \u201cWe have truly gotten bigger every single month in live gaming, and live gaming viewership is up over two times, year over year,\u201d said Ryan Wyatt, a YouTube vice president in charge of gaming content. (Ali Moiz, the Streamlabs chief executive, stood by his company\u2019s report. \u201cThey should publish their data, if they think this is wrong,\u201d he said of YouTube.)Twitch began in 2011 as an offshoot of Justin.tv, a lifecasting site founded by two Yale graduates, Emmett Shear and Justin Kan. They started the platform after they found that viewers were more interested in watching their lifecasters play video games than eat or sleep. Big tech companies came courting, and Amazon beat out Google.In the four years since the sale, video gaming as a spectator sport has gone mainstream, and Twitch has captured the majority of those who want to watch it live.For the dedicated fans, the live, freewheeling sessions on Twitch have the appeal of a major sporting event crossed with a talk show. The interaction between the host and viewers is one key to the site\u2019s success, making for an involved viewing experience that is markedly different from the prerecorded and edited videos of game sessions that have long been popular on YouTube.On Twitch, the player\u2019s face, when visible, typically inhabits a small part of the screen, and the world of the video game takes center position. On the right side of the screen, endless comments from the viewers \u2014 mostly male, mostly young \u2014 appear in a continuous scroll.Craig Riches, who plays under the name PythonGB, has posted his Minecraft videos on YouTube proper since 2010. Despite his affiliation, he said the Amazon-owned site remained well ahead of Google\u2019s foray into live game-streaming.\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that YouTube Gaming is still playing catch-up to Twitch\u2019s platform,\u201d said Mr. Riches, 23.The hosts on Twitch, some of whom sign up exclusively with the platform in order to gain access to its moneymaking tools, are rewarded for their ability to make a connection with viewers as much as they are for their gaming prowess. Viewers who pay $4.99 a month for a basic subscription \u2014 the money is split evenly between the streamers and Twitch \u2014 are looking for immediacy and intimacy. While some hosts at YouTube Gaming offer a similar experience, they have struggled to build audiences as large, and as dedicated, as those on Twitch.\u201cYou have this really unique live interaction you don\u2019t get with YouTube videos,\u201d said Meg Kaylee, a streamer and host on GameStop TV who built her career playing various games on Twitch after starting on YouTube. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different experience.\u201dCiting Twitch\u2019s fervent audiences and the \u201cbetter job\u201d it does in communicating with talent, Ms. Kaylee, 20, added that she had never really considered signing up with YouTube Gaming.Facebook Live, Periscope and Mixer all grew quickly in the last quarter, according to Streamlabs, but none have approached the scale of Twitch. The number of those watching game streams on Facebook\u2019s platform, for instance, increased to 56,000 from 27,500, according to the firm\u2019s estimates.Even with the rise of live streaming, gamers have continued to do big business posting recorded videos on YouTube\u2019s main site, which reports 1.8 billion \u201clogged in\u201d users a month, across all types of content. That makes it much larger than Twitch, which claims around 100 million monthly viewers. Mr. Wyatt, the YouTube executive, noted the full scope of YouTube\u2019s gaming content, which includes the videos posted on the main site and the live streams on YouTube Gaming, in comparing it with the Amazon-owned platform.\u201cThe size and scale and businesses is not comparable from YouTube to Twitch,\u201d Mr. Wyatt said. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve seen indicates that video-on-demand will be the biggest part of gaming content consumption.\u201dHe also pointed out that YouTube Gaming offered a different kind of programming: its live sessions last \u201ca couple hours at a time\u201d \u2014 a sharp contrast with the typical Twitch marathons.Still, YouTube created YouTube Gaming in direct response to Twitch. During its first few months, in 2015, the platform\u2019s hosts complained about the lack of ways to make money and asked for better tools for managing chat streams, which can easily descend into toxicity.\u201cIt took them a really long time to bring out basic features you would have on Twitch,\u201d said Cole Riness, a professional YouTuber who specializes in family-friendly gaming videos.YouTube has taken steps to address complaints. Most notably, as of April, its subscription systems \u2014 for live and recorded content \u2014 have been unified. As for support, Mr. Wyatt said, \u201cI would argue that we certainly have equivalent moderation tools to any other service on the market.\u201dOther challenges have proved more difficult for YouTube Gaming to solve. The site\u2019s copyright policing has frustrated some hosts, who have found themselves penalized, or even barred, because music was playing in the background of their sessions. Twitch has a reputation for being less punitive \u2014 or perhaps just less aware \u2014 where copyright issues are concerned.While YouTube has made millionaires out of the creators of popular videos through its advertising program, Twitch\u2019s hosts make money primarily from subscribers and one-off donations or tips. YouTube Gaming has made it possible for viewers to support hosts this way, but paying audiences haven\u2019t materialized at the scale they have on Twitch.Now that it seems well on its way to becoming synonymous with long-form live video gaming, Twitch\u2019s competitors may be running out of time to take their shot.Brandon Freytag, a former Twitch employee who is chief executive of Loaded, a talent agency that represents Mr. Blevins, said the most credible challenge to Twitch may come not from another tech company but from within. The most popular hosts, he noted, could be enticed to leave it for another platform, or create their own. They could also make demands of Twitch itself.The popularity of its stars is a force Twitch has yet to reckon with. For now, Mr. Freytag said, the calculus for hosts like Mr. Blevins is pretty simple: \u201cEveryone is on Twitch.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the screen name of Craig Riches. Mr. Riches goes by PythonGB, not PythonDB.A photo with an earlier version of this article was published in error.

{"Headline": "IBM Unveils System That \u2018Debates\u2019 With Humans", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A match between an Israeli college debate champion and a loquacious IBM computer program demonstrated on Monday new gains in the quest for computers that can hold conversations with humans. It also led to an unlikely question for the tech industry\u2019s deep thinkers: Can a machine talk too much?At an IBM office in downtown San Francisco, Noa Ovadia, a college senior who won an Israeli championship in 2016, squared off with IBM\u2019s program, called the IBM Debater.She argued against government subsidies for space exploration. The machine argued in favor, delivering three brief speeches in a digitally created monotone and \u2014 at least in small ways \u2014 responding to Ms. Ovadia\u2019s human opinions.\u201cAnother point that I believe my opponent made is that there are more important things than space exploration to spend money on,\u201d the machine said during its lengthy rebuttal. \u201cIt is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this. No one is claiming that this is the only item on our expense list.\u201dUnder development for six years, this artificial intelligence system is part of a broader effort to build technology that can interact with people the way we interact with one another.Companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have for several years offered coffee table gadgets and smartphone apps that answer simple questions or perform simple tasks. (\u201cHey, Siri. Set my alarm for 7 a.m. tomorrow.\u201d)Projects like IBM Debater and Google Duplex show that this kind of system is starting to stretch beyond simple commands. But they also demonstrate the limitations of current technology.IBM\u2019s system was designed to debate about 100 topics, but these interactions are tightly constrained: a four-minute opening statement followed by a rebuttal to its opponent\u2019s argument \u2014 and then a statement summing up its own viewpoint. It was not exactly Lincoln v. Douglas.Subsidized space exploration, the machine said during its opening statement, \u201cinspires our children to pursue education and careers in science and technology and mathematics.\u201d\u201cIt is more important than good roads or improved schools or better health care,\u201d it added.Noam Slonim, an IBM researcher who helped oversee the project, estimated that the technology could have a \u201cmeaningful\u201d debate on those 100 topics 40 percent of the time. IBM chose the topic for the live debate before it began. In some cases, the machine\u2019s lengthy speeches hinted at how it was stitching together its arguments \u2014 identifying relevant sentences and clauses and then combining them into a reasonably coherent, computerized thought.In 2011, IBM demonstrated a system that could beat the leading players at the trivia game show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d The company used this system, called Watson, as a way of promoting a wide range of products and consulting services for hospitals and other businesses.After Watson won, Mr. Slonim, a researcher at an IBM lab in Haifa, Israel, pitched the Debater project as IBM\u2019s next \u201cgrand challenge.\u201dBut the project reflects the recent acceleration of research related to \u201cnatural language understanding,\u201d the effort to build machines that can understand the natural way we humans talk and respond in kind. As this research progresses, it can provide new ways for computers to digest and process information or even lead to machines that can hold a completely convincing conversation.This sort of technology would have a wide range of uses. It could help businesses filter hot-button issues on social media. Or it could provide governments with a more effective way of censoring information.Understanding natural language is such a complex and difficult task, systems like IBM Debater lean on a wide range of systems, each handling a different part of the problem. One system will identify information that helps fuel an argument on one side of the debate. Another will generate the text of the argument. And so on.In recent years, researchers have significantly improved systems that recognize people and objects, identify spoken words and translate between languages.But understanding language is far more complex. That means systems that perform fairly simple language tasks \u2014 like writing a Wikipedia article, let alone engaging in a serious debate on a random topic \u2014 may still be years away.\u201cIt is now very obvious this change is happening,\u201d said Jeremy Howard, an independent researcher working in this area. \u201cBut these things take time.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted the IBM Debater, a computer program that participated in a debate with an Israeli college senior on June 18. During an exchange, the program said, \u201cIt is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this,\u201d not \u201cI dispute this.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco, and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}

Alongside the rarefied dignity of being portrayed as real, complex humans, these leading ladies of New York also face routine dismissal on screen: of their professional ability, their sexual autonomy and, in some cases, of their sanity. These are familiar tropes to us all, especially considering the environment we\u2019re in right now, and the timely poetry of these united voices comes through loud and clear.While it\u2019s sweet enough to catch vintage flicks on the big screen, it\u2019s even sweeter to do it in a place of cinematic history.

{"Headline": "My Wife Said You May Want to Marry Me", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveShe encouraged her husband to find new love after she was gone. A year later, he reflects on what her generosity has meant to him.Amy couldn\u2019t have known that her essay would afford me an opportunity to fill this same column with words of my own for Father\u2019s Day, telling you what has happened since. I don\u2019t pretend to have Amy\u2019s extraordinary gift with words and wordplay, but here goes.During our life together, Amy was a prolific writer, publishing children\u2019s books, memoirs and articles. Knowing she had only a short time to live, she wanted to finish one last project. We were engaged then in home hospice, a seemingly beautiful way to deal with the end of life, where you care for your loved one in familiar surroundings, away from the hospital with its beeping machines and frequent disruptions.I was posted up at the dining room table overlooking our living room, where Amy had established her workstation. From her spot on the couch, she worked away between micro-naps. These brief moments of peace were induced by the morphine needed to control her symptoms. A tumor had created a complete bowel obstruction, making it impossible for her to eat solid food. She would flutter away on the keyboard, doze for a bit, then awake and repeat.When Amy finished her essay, she gave it to me to read, as she had done with all of her writing. But this time was different. In her memoirs she had written about the children and me, but not like this. How was she able to combine such feelings of unbearable sadness, ironic humor and total honesty?When the essay was published, Amy was too sick to appreciate it. As the international reaction became overwhelming, I was torn up thinking how she was missing the profound impact her words were having. The reach of Amy\u2019s article \u2014 and of her greater body of work \u2014 was so much deeper and richer than I knew.Letters poured in from around the world. They included notes of admiration, medical advice, commiseration and offers from women to meet me. I was too consumed with grief during Amy\u2019s final days to engage with the responses. It was strange having any attention directed at me right then, but the outpouring did make me appreciate the significance of her work. When people ask me to describe myself, I always start with \u201cdad,\u201d yet I spent a great deal of my adult life being known as \u201cAmy\u2019s husband.\u201d People knew of Amy and her writing, while I had lived in relative anonymity. I had no social media presence and my profession, a lawyer, did not cast me into public view.After Amy died, I faced countless decisions in my new role as a single father. As in any marriage or union of two people with children, we had a natural division of labor. Not anymore. People often assumed Amy was disorganized because she had list upon list: scattered Post-it notes, scraps of paper and even messages scrawled on her hand. But she was one of the most organized people I have ever met.There are aspects of everyday life I have taken on that I never gave much consideration to in the past. How did Amy hold everything together so seamlessly? I am capable of doing many things on my own, but two people can accomplish so much more together and also support each other through life\u2019s ups and downs.While I do not know much about reality TV, there was also this touching letter submitted by the child of a single mother, who wrote: \u201cI\u2019d like to submit an application for my mom, like friends and family can do for participants on \u2018The Bachelor.\u2019\u201dAnd I appreciated the sentiment and style of the woman who wrote this: \u201cI have this image of queues of hopeful women at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. Single mothers, elegant divorc\u00e9es, spinster aunts, bored housewives, daughters, wilting violets \u2026 all in anxious anticipation as to whether the shoe will fit, fit them alone, that the prince from the fairy tale is meant for them. That they are the right person.\u201dI couldn\u2019t digest any of these messages at the time, but I have since found solace and even laughter in many of them. One thing I have come to understand, though, is what a gift Amy gave me by emphasizing that I had a long life to fill with joy, happiness and love. Her edict to fill my own empty space with a new story has given me permission to make the most out of my remaining time on this planet.If I can convey a message I have learned from this bestowal, it would be this: Talk with your mate, your children and other loved ones about what you want for them when you are gone. By doing this, you give them liberty to live a full life and eventually find meaning again. There will be so much pain, and they will think of you daily. But they will carry on and make a new future, knowing you gave them permission and even encouragement to do so.I want more time with Amy. I want more time picnicking and listening to music at Millennium Park. I want more Shabbat dinners with the five of us Rosies (as we Rosenthals are referred to by our family). I would even gladly put up with Amy taking as much time as she wants to say goodbye to everyone at our family gatherings, as she always used to do, even after we had been there for hours, had a long drive home ahead of us and likely would see them again in a few days.I wish I had more of all of those things, just as Amy had wished for more. But more wasn\u2019t going to happen for her or us. Instead, as she described, we followed Plan \u201cBe,\u201d which was about being present in our lives because time was running short. So we did our best to live in the moment until we had no more moments left.The cruelest irony of my life is that it took me losing my best friend, my wife of 26 years and the mother of my three children, to truly appreciate each and every day. I know that sounds like a clich\u00e9, and it is, but it\u2019s true.I am now aware, in a way I wish I never had to learn, that loss is loss is loss, whether it\u2019s a divorce, losing a job, having a beloved pet die or enduring the death of a family member. In that respect, I am no different. But my wife gave me a gift at the end of her column when she left me that empty space, one I would like to offer you. A blank space to fill. The freedom and permission to write your own story. Humbly, Jason Jason B. Rosenthal, who lives in Chicago, is the co-author of the forthcoming picture book \u201cDear Boy,\u201d written with his daughter Paris.Advertisement"}

A walking tour and photo essay reveal its many treasures.Broadway is arguably the most famous thoroughfare in the world (by one measure, 250 million hits on Google versus 6 million for the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es). But in the city that never stops recycling itself, it takes a discerning fl\u00e2neur to find the few original landmarks like this one that have survived along Broadway\u2019s 13-mile route from one end of Manhattan to the other.Our tour of the two northernmost miles included what was once a Gilded Age enclave in Inwood, where Broadway is flanked by idiosyncratic historical sites that are not only neglected by most visitors\u2019 guides, but eclipsed by the street\u2019s commercial bustle.The first anomaly is the Dyckman Farmhouse and Museum, open for public tours. The Flemish colonial house faces two buildings across the street. One, incongruously, is a gas station. In the other, a relative newcomer to the gentrifying neighborhood, the Dyckmans might have felt right at home. It\u2019s a beer garden.A little farther north, now the site of a ministorage warehouse, is where the Benedetto family operated the last working farm in Manhattan until the mid-1950s (and where rhubarb jam now sells for $6.90 a jar in a French grocery).If you look closely, in the driveway of an auto repair shop between 215th and 218th Streets, you can see a crumbling marble replica of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.The graffiti-scarred relic, dating from 1855, was the gateway to a grand 25-acre hilltop summer estate (now the site of the Park Terrace Gardens apartments) belonging to John F. Seaman and his heiress wife, an eccentric descendant of Sir Francis Drake.The park, on a schist ridge 200 feet above the Hudson, is home to Manhattan\u2019s largest remaining forest and where caves attest to the most ancient habitation in New York from pre-Colombian times to seasonal camps occupied by the Lenape people as late as the 17th century.Not surprisingly, many of Broadway\u2019s more familiar, and oldest, landmarks are concentrated in the miles that begin at the southern tip of Manhattan, Professor Leadon\u2019s Mile 1, where the Dutch settled New Amsterdam four centuries ago.Broadway (originally Heere Straat, or High Street, then Brede Wegh, or Broad Way) got its name because it began at the expansive 17th-century ramparts of Fort Amsterdam, which commanded a hill that sloped down to Bowling Green, Manhattan\u2019s oldest park (another rumored site of Peter Minuit\u2019s $24 deal).The tiny greensward was surrounded by a cast-iron fence \u2014 it still stands \u2014 to prevent vandals from desecrating the equestrian statue of King George III, which was toppled in 1776.\u201cCertainly, the first half of Broadway, as it developed, was without question the economic engine of the city,\u201d Professor Leadon said. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s the city\u2019s spine, the thing that unites and divides\u201d \u2014 downtown, the snootier \u201cdollar side\u201d to the west versus the cheaper \u201cshilling side\u201d in the early 19th century; and in Washington Heights, the Jews to the west and Dominicans to the east more recently).Professor Leadon, who grew up in Gainesville, Fla., and lives in Brooklyn with his family, first saw Broadway from the air while flying to Boston on a field trip from the University of Florida, then visited Times Square while studying architecture at Yale.As it meanders north, Broadway is studded with architectural gems like the antique apartment buildings, many of them spared by the Landmarks Preservation Commission from New York\u2019s merciless cycle of demolition and redevelopment.These majestic structures arrived with the first wave of development driven by the subway, rising on what had been vacant plots.\u201cA lot of the Broadway buildings are the only buildings that have ever been there,\u201d Professor Leadon said.But that would mean Broadway terminates ignominiously in the checkout line of a C-Town supermarket. And anyone who has ever walked the street, in whole or part, knows that Broadway really never ends, surely not like that.The street has always been more a state of mind than a mere physical space, one that has defied the unbending Manhattan grid for two centuries as it snaked uptown and that even now, defying its name, is being narrowed to accommodate pedestrian plazas.\u201cBroadway is New York intensified \u2014 the reflex of the Republic, \u2014 hustling, feverish, crowded, ever changing,\u201d the journalist Junius Henry Browne wrote in 1868. \u201cBroadway is always being built, but it is never finished.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Ice Age Shaped New York", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "Long ago, the region lay under an ice sheet thousands of feet thick. It terminated abruptly in what are now the boroughs, leaving the city with a unique landscape.Supported byAt its southern edge, the vast body deposited tons of rocky debris \u2014 from sand and pebbles to boulders the size of school buses. Then, some 18,000 years ago, the planet began to warm and the gargantuan sheet of ice began to melt and retreat.Today, the southernmost edge of that frozen expanse is marked by a line of rubble that extends across the northern United States for thousands of miles. The largest deposits form what geologists call a terminal moraine. The intermittent ridge runs from Puget Sound to the Missouri River to Montauk Point on Long Island, forming the prominence that supports its old lighthouse. The ancient sheet of ice also left its mark on a very modern phenomenon: New York City. The ice over Manhattan would have buried even the tallest skyscraper and was so heavy that it depressed the underlying bedrock. As it melted, giant boulders embedded deep within its flanks landed throughout what became the city. Many are still visible in Central Park, unlikely obelisks scored by time. But the island was the last hurrah, and the mammoth sheet of ice ended immediately to the south, in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. The terminal moraine, the mounds of rubble left behind, form much of their high ground. While the line of glacial debris across the northern United States is often poorly delineated, the hilly ridge around New York City tends to be quite prominent. Its maximum height is roughly 200 feet, about that of a tall apartment building.Eventually, the neglected parcels became strings of parks, cemeteries, golf courses and, in time, some of the region\u2019s most attractive neighborhoods, often heavily landscaped and densely wooded.Many city neighborhoods take their names from the ridge\u2019s elevations, as well as its leafy embellishments: Glen Oaks, Hollis Hills, Jamaica Hills, Briarwood, Forest Hills, Ridgewood, Cypress Hills, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, Greenwood, Bay Ridge, Lighthouse Hill and Arden Heights.Why should remnants of the last ice age be so prominent in New York City, of all places? It started long ago as the continental ice sheet developed one of its thickest regions over what is now eastern Canada. Vast fields of ice are incredibly weighty. Gravity pushes down hard. Any tilt or slant of the underlying terrain sends the ice moving slowly downslope.For ages, the Canadian ice kept flowing into a long valley to the south that ran from the Lake Champlain area down through the Hudson River gorge. It was a reliable conduit. The river of ice and rock kept moving relentlessly southward until it hit a region warm enough to halt its slow advance.In recent times, the resulting moraine got much scrutiny from scientists because of its proximity to one of the nation\u2019s first big cities. Just as early maps of the United States often focused on New York, so did geologic inquiries \u2014 starting nearly two centuries ago.Despite the ridge\u2019s prominence and early allure for scientists, it turned out to be no rival for skyscrapers and urban distractions. The moraine that shaped the city was all but forgotten. \u201cIt makes it much easier to see,\u201d he said recently, while gazing at the ridge from the Staten Island Ferry.Mr. Horenstein, 81, sought to deepen the re-examination by sharing with The Times a vast trove he had assembled of scientific studies, official reports, news clippings, magazine articles and old books that mention or profile the city\u2019s glacial relic.His collection also sheds light on how moraine study in general helped geologists in New York and elsewhere discover that the planet had experienced a series of ice ages. That breakthrough came in the mid 1800s.Ridges, mountains and even flatlands are typically rooted in rocky strata, such as the bedrock that underlies Manhattan and makes it ideal for erecting skyscrapers. But early investigators found the hilly ridges to be composed of clay, silt, sand, pebbles, cobbles and boulders, all jumbled up together.A related clue was that nearby rocks often looked quite smooth, even polished. At times, their faces also displayed parallel lines of groves and striations.By the 1860s, a growing body of evidence had convinced most scientists that the Earth had endured ages in which rivers of ice transported rocks and coarse sediments over long distances \u2014 at times, it turned out, for hundreds of miles. The accompanying report said the rise exhibited strings of \u201chillocks and hollows, or interrupted ridges and troughs.\u201d It noted that some depressions held ponds, marshes and small lakes. The report put the feature\u2019s overall width at up to two miles.At Umpire Rock in Central Park, overlooking baseball fields, the geologist noted places where glacial ice and rubble had carved massive grooves, wider than a human body.Yet the rock\u2019s overall surface was quite smooth. The reason, Mr. Horenstein said, was that ages of glacial abrasion had acted like sandpaper. \u201cKids can slide down the rocks,\u201d he said of many Central Park outcroppings.\u201cThey\u2019re rounded,\u201d Mr. Horenstein said, because rivers of ice kept \u201cdragging them around.\u201d Later, on a visit to Staten Island, he pointed to the much-celebrated skyline of Lower Manhattan. Current estimates put the ice\u2019s thickness there at roughly twice the early calculations \u2014 not 1,000 feet, but closer to 2,000 feet, and possibly more.\u201cIt was taller than any building,\u201d Mr. Horenstein remarked, \u201ceven the Freedom Tower.\u201d The skyscraper at the very top of its spire measures 1,776 feet high, after the nation\u2019s birthday. The forward edges of glaciers can be inclined or sheer, like a cliff. Mr. Horenstein said geologists believe the local face was sheer. Its precipitous edge shed not only tons of rocky debris but gargantuan blocks of ice.At Fort Wadsworth, a historic battlement next to the Verrazano Bridge, we stood atop the moraine and looked across the Narrows, the strait between Staten Island and Brooklyn. The land that would become the two boroughs had originally been connected by the glacial ridge.What fraction came from the glacial ridge?\u201cAll of them,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was the local building material.\u201dIn all of New York City, \u201cthis is the only place you can see the moraine clearly,\u201d Mr. Horenstein said, leaning into the wind. \u201cThis is it, the southernmost end.\u201dMr. Horenstein held up a rounded stone. Somehow, it ended up in reporter\u2019s backpack as a souvenir of the day.Remarkably, millions of people live on or near the glacial ridge.In all, it runs for roughly 30 miles beneath New York City. Invisibly, it links three boroughs, offering mute testimony to the power of vanished ice.If the ridge is lost history to most of the city\u2019s inhabitants, at least one knows something about the art of bringing it back to life.\u201cIt keeps me young,\u201d Mr. Horenstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something to see, something you missed, something new.\u201d Advertisement"}

It makes important arguments, but Lanier has pressed many of them several times before. While Lanier has shown a capacity for wit, this book is hokey.

There\u2019s a laziness to his polemic: a lack of examples, arguments that unfold much too quickly to gather their full powers of persuasion, writing that chokes on excessive metaphor. Over the course of three pages, he uses lead paint, climate change and crude oil to describe the workings of the BUMMER machine.Many of his criticisms of social media will feel familiar to distant observers of American politics. Twitter and Facebook have made us cruder, less empathetic, more tribal. Only at the very end does Lanier venture into new territory. His argument, however, is a profound one. He worries that our reliance on big tech companies is ruining our capacity for spirituality, by turning us into robotic extensions of their machines. The companies, he argues, have no appreciation for the \u201cmystical spark inside you.\u201d They don\u2019t understand the magic of human consciousness and, therefore, will recklessly destroy it.Whatever the flaws of this short manifesto, Lanier shows the tactical value of appealing to the conscience of the individual.

{"Headline": "The Magic of a Cardboard Box", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs.\u00a0Lange is the architecture critic for Curbed.These 21st-century storytellers turned to cardboard for the same reasons that children have long preferred the box to the toy that came in it: cardboard is light and strong, easy to put up, quick to come down and, perhaps most important, inexpensive enough for experiment. Cardboard constructions can be crushed, painted, recycled and stuck back together. Cardboard furniture can be adjusted as children grow, and cardboard creations become more sophisticated as children gain skills: It is as malleable as the body and the mind.Technology companies\u2019 embrace of cardboard\u2019s cool suggests something parents and teachers never forgot: The box is an avatar of inspiration, no charging required. Cardboard is the ideal material for creativity, and has been since the big purchase, and the big box, became a fixture of American postwar homes.Cardboard was considered such a wonder material during this era that Manhattan\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Craft (now the Museum of Arts and Design) devoted a 1967-1968 exhibition, \u201cMade with Paper,\u201d to the medium. With funding from the Container Corporation of America, the curator Paul J. Smith turned the museum galleries into a three-dimensional paper wonderland. The CCA also funded a cardboard playground created by students at the Parsons School of Design that included pleated trees, an enveloping sombrero and a movable maze for children to explore.James Hennessey and Victor Papanek\u2019s \u201cNomadic Furniture,\u201d published in 1973, was part of a renaissance in DIY instruction, one that emphasized the cardboard\u2019s open-source bona fides, as online instructions for making your own Google Cardboard did. The \u201cNomadic\u201d authors demonstrated how to create an entire cardboard lifestyle, one that could be tailored to different sizes, ages and abilities.Cardboard\u2019s central role in childhood has not gone unnoticed: in 2005, the cardboard box was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame. \u201cWe were particularly motivated by the exceptional qualities that cardboard boxes hold for inspiring creative, open-ended play,\u201d says Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester. Nirvan Mullick, the filmmaker who made \u201cCaine\u2019s Arcade,\u201d went on to found a nonprofit group, Imagination.org, that organizes an annual \u201cglobal cardboard challenge\u201d \u2014 one taken up by over a million kids in 80 countries.At a time when toys have become ever more complex and expensive, it is worth returning to the box, seeing it not as trash but as a renewable resource for play.For my daughter\u2019s seventh birthday, she requested a cardboard-themed party. (I swear, I had nothing to do with it.) \u201cCardboard creations\u201d is a highlight of \u201cchoice time\u201d at her school, where kindergartners and first-graders have an end-of-day craft session with shoeboxes and paper towel rolls.We gave up recycling for several weeks before the party and accumulated an embarrassingly large pile in the center of the living room.

And the switch in the \u201970s from the \u201cbrought to you by\u201d sponsorship model of radio to the magazine-style, multiple-ad format of TV transformed advertisers from benign patrons into interruptive annoyances. Besides, other industries became shinier objects in the public\u2019s eye, particularly Wall Street and Silicon Valley.One could make the case that technology has assumed the place in the zeitgeist that advertising once occupied \u2014 and then some. The most recent TV series set in an ad agency, \u201cThe Crazy Ones,\u201d lasted a season; \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has been renewed for a sixth season. (Yes, there was \u201cMad Men,\u201d from 2007 to 2015, but one of its main accomplishments was to remind us that Madison Avenue meant more then than now.) There have been other efforts to rekindle the American appetite for all things advertising, but none has truly broken through.Now comes another attempt, from Ken Auletta, the prolific media reporter, critic and best-selling author, with \u201cFrenemies: The Epic Disruption of the Ad Business (and Everything Else).\u201d The title comes from a word popularized by Martin Sorrell, formerly the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising and marketing holding company; he started referring to Google as a \u201cfrenemy\u201d of WPP\u2019s in that they do business together (friend) at the same time they compete against each other (enemy). For those who wince at the characterization of the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon as \u201cfrenemies\u201d of the ad industry, be thankful; according to hbr.org, Sorrell also used the word \u201cfroes\u201d to describe that love-hate relationship.Sorrell is a principal figure in \u201cFrenemies,\u201d which seeks to rebuild interest in Madison Avenue by borrowing interest from Silicon Valley. It\u2019s not unlike how advertisers themselves borrow interest, hiring celebrities to endorse products or devoting ads to buzzed-about subjects like a royal wedding. Auletta posits that few industries have been \u201cconvulsed by change\u201d as much as advertising, which, as a result, is \u201cfacing fundamental challenges to its existence.\u201dIt may be a mug\u2019s game to figure out which industry has suffered the deepest damage at the hands of Silicon Valley; if you\u2019re reading this in print, you\u2019re holding another example of a business under siege. But Auletta works hard to get us to care about the fate of ad folks, despite our diminished interest in them or our distaste for what they do, because of their essential role as suppliers of the dollars that fuel the media ecosystem. If you \u201cfollow the money,\u201d he writes, you\u2019ll understand the importance of advertising and the significance of the threats against it, and maybe value it more, or at least disdain it less.Auletta surveys the tumultuous, treacherous ad landscape through the framework of frenemies. Not only are Madison Avenue and Silicon Valley frenemies, but so, too, he declares, are ad agencies and their marketer clients; agencies and media companies; traditional and digital media companies; agencies and consultancies like Accenture and McKinsey; agencies and software firms like Adobe and Salesforce.com; and, perhaps most telling, advertising and consumers. The easier it becomes for the public to zip, zap through and avoid interruptive ads \u2014 through innovative technology like ad blockers and streaming video \u2014 the madder, and more anxious, the mad men (and women) grow.Yet as dire as their fate looks, some flowers bloom amid the gloom, taking the edge off the book\u2019s pessimism. A respected industry strategist, Rishad Tobaccowala, tells Auletta: \u201cPeople say we are dinosaurs. We are not dinosaurs. We are cockroaches. Everybody hates us. Nobody likes to see us. But cockroaches have outlived everyone. We scurry out of corners. We soldier on and hire people with different skill sets.\u201dAuletta details the adaptive behavior \u2014 new types of agencies; reviving the sponsorship model; embracing data-driven, two-way marketing based on individualized relationships \u2014 while suggesting that, at the biggest ad conglomerates like WPP, the money for such substantive changes exists thanks to still-respectable margins (\u201ca relatively robust 15 or so percent\u201d). And he weaves into his narrative evidence of the wealth the business can still produce.For instance, one conglomerate\u2019s chief executive \u201cspends much of the year at his home in Palm Beach.\u201d The leader of a large agency has a \u201cglassed weekend home perched on 200 acres overlooking the Hudson River\u201d along with an \u201c8,000-square-foot Chelsea loft.\u201d And a well-known industry consultant sells his company for potentially as much as $207 million, hosts a $400,000 dinner at Cannes, buys a Tesla, gets rock-star treatment at his favorite restaurants and arrives at a meeting \u201csporting his Christmas tan from Turks and Caicos.\u201d There are martinis aplenty scattered among the pages of \u201cFrenemies,\u201d lending a nostalgic touch to the forward-facing proceedings.Alas, \u201cFrenemies\u201d can\u2019t avoid a pitfall common to such topical books, in that some of what\u2019s chronicled has been overtaken by events between writing and publication. The most notable example: In the book, Sorrell is \u201csecure\u201d in his top role at WPP and \u201cunlikely to step down anytime soon\u201d \u2014 but he did, suddenly, in mid-April, after an internal investigation into alleged misconduct. It\u2019s disconcerting, given how much Sorrell figures in \u201cFrenemies,\u201d to read of him telling Auletta, \u201cI will stay here until they shoot me!\u201d It\u2019s ameliorated, though, by a newsy tidbit: Several years ago he negotiated \u201cto sell WPP to Warren Buffett, but they did not see eye to eye and the discussions amicably collapsed.\u201dThat\u2019s a shame, if only because it\u2019s fun to imagine how Buffett \u2014 whose holdings at Berkshire Hathaway include Geico \u2014 might have approached the ad business: \u201cMarketers, save 15 percent on your campaigns with Geico WPP.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Silicon Valley Gets Even More Political", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsThis week it would feel inappropriate to sum up the week\u2019s news without addressing the controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s recently halted policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border. The story dominated the news, seeping into nearly every area of coverage \u2014 including, of course, tech.So why are businesses getting political? For one, we live in a highly politicized time with a deeply polarizing president, and platforms like Twitter have made it easier for brands to weigh in directly.In the case of tech executives, their increased activism might also in part reflect their growing power and importance. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have such large global businesses that they have become almost stateless entities themselves.In other news:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Market Value Should Cross $1 Trillion and Keep On Trucking", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIt has been a long time coming, but Apple could soon be worth $1 trillion \u2014 and counting. At about $940 billion, the tech giant is close to being the first company to pass that threshold in market capitalization, as Breakingviews predicted seven years ago. Growth has slowed since then, but customers remain loyal and today\u2019s valuation is far from stretched. Apple\u2019s timely focus on data privacy may help it get there.The rather mundane improvements rolling out at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference this week demonstrate how the smartphone market is largely mature. Shipments worldwide declined slightly for the first time last year, the research firm IDC believes, and should grow less than 3 percent annually over the next five years.That said, there\u2019s no obvious replacement for smartphones on the horizon. Apple earned $48 billion last year, mostly from iPhone sales, so this looks like the base camp for the company. Phones are prone to being dropped, dunked in water or lost. Throw in small improvements, and the company can reap more per device. The average iPhone sales price actually rose last year.Apple can wring more dollars out of users in other ways, as well. Service revenue from selling apps, online storage and streaming music is rising at a 31 percent annual clip and now accounts for 15 percent of sales. Add in revenue from ancillary hardware, and analysts think the company can increase operating profit 13 percent this year. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a healthy rate of growth continuing. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is also milking the discomfort of Facebook, Google and others whose businesses rely heavily on sharing data, sometimes controversially, by contrasting them with Apple\u2019s privacy-friendly approach.Yet Wall Street has remained oddly skeptical over the years. Apple is valued at 15 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, which is slightly less than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over all. And peers trade at a substantial premium, with Facebook at 22 times forward earnings and Microsoft and the Google parent Alphabet on a multiple of 25.That\u2019s too large a gap. Microsoft is projected to grow roughly as fast as Apple this year. Facebook and Google are growing faster, but they are in the line of fire from consumers and regulators over data gathering and privacy worries. Apple\u2019s conference this week may be short on pizazz, but the nearly trillion-dollar company can tweak its business without the distraction of defending it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In an open letter posted to Microsoft\u2019s internal message board on Tuesday, more than 100 employees protested the software maker\u2019s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and asked the company to stop working with the agency, which has been separating migrant parents and their children at the border with Mexico.Calling the separation of families \u201cinhumane,\u201d the employees added: \u201cAs the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit. We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.\u201dAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington. And some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., publicly promoted its work with ICE in January in a blog post, citing it as an example of the success of its technology.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d Mr. Nadella said at Microsoft\u2019s developer conference last month.Yet criticism of Microsoft\u2019s work with ICE began to grow. One Microsoft engineer, Larry Osterman, tweeted on Monday to ask how working with ICE matched with the company\u2019s \u201cethical stances.\u201dBut for many Microsoft employees, that was not satisfactory. A group of about a dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter, in which they said the company\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not go far enough.\u201dThe employees continued, \u201cWe are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy.\u201dThe letter added that Microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ICE but be open to a review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally, and that it should create a policy stating it would not work with those \u201cwho violate international human rights law.\u201dMicrosoft declined to comment on the employee letter, which was posted internally on Tuesday afternoon. Within hours, it had received more than 100 signatures.It was only later that the messages from Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith decrying the immigration policy were released. \u201cWe will always stand for immigration policies that preserve every person\u2019s dignity and human rights,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Where did it come from? It has indistinct antecedents in the adventure novel, the spy novel and the hybrid midcentury experimentations of Elmore Leonard, but realistically, the answer isn\u2019t pretty: Its pure form was the invention of Robert Ludlum and Frederick Forsyth, who set their lone heroes loose against immense forces in the 1970s and haven\u2019t come back for them yet. The genre spread fast and hard \u2014 America had all that unmelting, isolate, stoic toughness, and, with the west at last wholly settled, nowhere to put it, fictionally. Eventually an Englishman came up with Jack Reacher. Now a non-trivial percentage of us is convinced that biology teachers should carry guns.by Sam Kassby Nadine Horn and J\u00f6rg Mayerby Jenn\u00e9 Claiborneby Lauren Toyotaby Chloe Coscarelliby Meera Sodhaby Tamar Adlerby Ilene Rosenby Diana Henryby Anissa Helouby Maira Kalman and Barbara Scott-Goodmanby Brittany BennettThis season\u2019s food writers serve up both recipes and stories, from Sam Kass\u2019s tales of cooking at the White House to Maira Kalman\u2019s memories of cakes.If you\u2019re a certain kind of cook, the ecstasy of a spring farmer\u2019s market, with its sweet sugar snap peas, bright peppery lettuces and juicy strawberries that are red all the way through, can easily give way to a sense of unease: the fear that you\u2019re not making the most of all that\u2019s on offer. (Perhaps you\u2019re still agonizing over missing those three minutes when ramps were available?) One way to fend off this very fortunate brand of anxiety is to check out some new cookbooks. Thankfully, just in time, there\u2019s the expected flood of vegetable-reverent titles, as well as books that will take you to all corners of the world and personal, nostalgic journeys inspiring the rediscovery of classics that feel just right for the season of rebirth.by Michelle McNamaraby Harold Schecterby Simon Baatzby Pamela Everettby Cutter Woodby Sarah KrasnosteinMarilyn Stasio considers six new true-crime books, including one about the Golden State Killer and one about a woman whose company cleans up \u201chomicide, suicide and death scenes.\u201dThe killing didn\u2019t start right away. In the beginning, this night stalker restricted himself to raping single women in their bedrooms and limited his activities to the Sacramento area of Northern California. Back then, he wore a homemade mask and was known as the East Area Rapist. After committing as many as 50 sexual assaults, he worked his way down to Santa Barbara and attacked couples. That\u2019s when he escalated to murder.by David Lynchby David Peisnerby Matthew Pollyby Jonathan Abramsby Joseph McBrideby Michael BensonA new batch of summer reading tells the back story of some of the greatest movies and television.Not that Lynch need unduly worry about his talents becoming obsolete. As \u201cRoom to Dream,\u201d written with the Los Angeles\u2013based critic and journalist Kristine McKenna, makes clear, his artistic Midas touch lately extends from film and television to painting and music; like Patti Smith (and possibly nobody else), Lynch apparently gets up in the morning and makes art in one medium and another right up until bedtime. \u201cRoom to Dream\u201d is, as the introduction observes, \u201cbasically a person having a conversation with his own biography.\u201d McKenna turns in an impressively industrious and comprehensive account of Lynch\u2019s career, larded with insightful quotes from dozens of people whose lives have intersected with his \u2014 after each chapter of which Lynch offers, at similar length, his own impressionistic and free-associative commentary.by Tiffany Reiszby Sarah MacLeanby Eloisa Jamesby Lynn Turnerby Helen Hoangby Kate Claybornby Joanna Shupeby Cat SebastianEscape to Regency England, Gilded Age New York or a French sex-commune chateau.Some people say that summer reading \u2014 whether poolside or briskly air-conditioned \u2014 means big, unwieldy books, too heavy to lug farther than from the shelf to the lounge chair, a single volume to last the season. These people baffle me. The best summer reading is absorbing, delightful and, in the sun or shade, will make you break a sweat. That\u2019s romance, and here are eight new releases for the summer. They\u2019ll take you from Regency England to Gilded Age New York to present day, from summer camp to a Broadway stage to, yes, a sex-commune chateau in rural France.by Patricia Hamplby Stephanie Rosenbloomby Levison Woodby Mark Adamsby Alastair Bonnettby Stephan Orthby Jamal Mahjoubby Kushanava Choudhuryby Shoba Narayanby Rick Bassby Darryl SleathWhy do we travel? New books consider that question, in venues as varied as a Central American jungle, a glacier in Alaska and a Midwestern parlor.by Elizabeth Barlow Rogersby Jane Garmeyby Penelope Livelyby Giovanni Pietro Olinaby Jane Hurwitzby Seabrooke Leckie and David Beadleby Tony Dove and Ginger Woolridgeby Jason Deweesby Caren Yglesiasby Paul Smithby David Michener and Carol Adelmanby Martha Stewart and Kevin SharkeyA roundup of outdoor books takes you from Central Park to the desert gardens of the Southwest, with time out for insect, botanical and avian lore.Soon after I moved to Manhattan in the late 1970s, an old friend taught me to roller-skate. It feels like a lifetime ago now. We would go dancing at clubs \u2014 those disco nights \u2014 and then, as a new day dawned, lace up our boots and roll into Central Park. We had the place to ourselves, though getting any speed was tricky since the roads were pocked and potted. On all sides, the lawns were filthy and tattered. But as I looped through it, I fell in love with Central Park.by Keith Hernandezby Susan Jacobyby John Branchby Howard Bryantby Amy Essingtonby Laurent DuboisThis season\u2019s batch features a rakish first baseman, Albert Camus the brooding goalkeeper and a bucking bronc named Lunatic From Hell.Keith Hernandez doesn\u2019t like baseball memoirs. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019ve become a paint-by-numbers exercise,\u201d the former first baseman laments at the outset of his own entry in the genre.

{"Headline": "In the Race for Governor, How Far Left Is Colorado Willing to Go?", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 Jared Polis, a leading Democratic candidate for Colorado governor, walked into the home of a prominent marijuana entrepreneur for a campaign event recently, wearing a suit and bright blue sneakers. He circled a room of voters, wound his way past the margarita machine and then fired off his vision for Colorado.Single-payer health care. An all-renewable electric grid. State-funded full-day preschool.The crowd showered him with applause. \u201cSupport the man,\u201d said a host, Scott Durrah, 53, \u201cbecause we really need him.\u201dThese changes have helped foster a parallel political shift, and in the last five years Colorado has legalized marijuana, passed major gun restrictions and put a single-payer health care system on the ballot. Just this month, Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, ordered the state to pursue California-style emissions standards, making Colorado the first interior state to do so.By many measures, Colorado is shifting blue. Now, with Mr. Hickenlooper term-limited and eight candidates from two parties angling to replace him, the question is just how far left this frontier state wants to go.Mr. Polis, a wealthy congressman from Boulder who made his millions in e-commerce, is one of four Democrats seeking to replace Mr. Hickenlooper, whose trademark has been political moderation. (Mr. Hickenlooper is weighing a bid for president.)If Mr. Polis is successful, he would be the country\u2019s first openly gay man to serve as governor, and he could bring his husband and their two children to this city\u2019s hilltop Executive Mansion \u2014 an idea that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.But Mr. Polis, 43, is attempting a win in a state whose east and west flanks run deep red, home to influential conservative organizations like Focus on the Family; a powerful fossil fuel industry; and a faction so fervently pro-Trump that in the last election it splintered from the Republican establishment to form a group called the Mesa County Deplorables.Portions of the state are famously tax averse, and in 2016, even as the majority of voters favored Hillary Clinton, the proposal for single-payer health care failed miserably at the ballot. Four of the last five governors have been Democrats, but moderates have long charted the state\u2019s course.As it stands, Colorado has one million registered Democrats, one million registered Republicans and 1.2 million unaffiliated voters, making for a nail-biter of an election year. For the first time in state history, those undeclared voters can participate in the June 26 primary, and the number of votes returned this month will be an early sign of the state\u2019s political direction.\u201cHickenlooper would never have campaigned on that kind of overt: \u2018Let\u2019s raid the revenue box,\u2019\u201d said Alan Salazar, a former chief strategy officer to the governor, noting that Mr. Polis could be a tough sell. \u201cJared is perceived, I think, as a lot more liberal.\u201dBut Mr. Hickenlooper was elected in 2010. That was before the state\u2019s galloping economic growth, before Donald J. Trump awoke a liberal resistance.When the governor took office, the state was in recession, with unemployment near double digits, jitters about exiting businesses and thousands of families tossed out of their homes by foreclosure.These days, the question is not how to grow, but how to pay for all these new people. Roads are crumbling, schools are starved for funds, and rural communities say all this metro-area expansion is sucking them of water and money.\u201cYou rest on your laurels at your own peril,\u201d said Mr. Hickenlooper in an interview at the state\u2019s gold-domed Capitol. His fear, he added, is that \u201cwe will strangle on our success.\u201dOf course, not everyone is interested in solutions put forth by Democrats like Mr. Polis, which include a change to a longstanding state law that limits the amount of tax revenue the state can collect. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than moving blue,\u201d said Jon Caldara, who leads the Independence Institute, a Denver-based libertarian think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re turning into California.\u201dThe best-known Republican candidate, Walker Stapleton, 44, the state treasurer, is promoting himself as a supporter of the president\u2019s tax plan while promising to yank funds from sanctuary cities. Apparently hoping to avoid scrutiny ahead of the primary \u2014 he has three lesser-known challengers \u2014 he has skipped some debates and repeatedly dodged reporters.When he does appear, he often saves his fire for Mr. Polis: \u201cThe issues that matter are: What is Jared Polis going to do to the economic future of Colorado?\u201d he said.But a Polis primary victory is far from certain, despite the $11 million the congressman has poured into his own campaign.His Democratic challengers include Cary Kennedy, 50, a former state treasurer who would be the state\u2019s first female governor if elected; and Mike Johnston, 43, a Spanish-speaking former state senator and principal who once ran a school in a juvenile prison.Ms. Kennedy has made education the center of her campaign, promoting her role in writing a constitutional amendment that sought to raise funds for Colorado schools. She has the backing of the state\u2019s energized teachers\u2019 unions, and educators have come out in droves to stump for her. \u201cWe\u2019re crazy for Cary!\u201d yelled one at a recent event at her campaign headquarters.A handwritten sign on the wall warned her male challengers. \u201cSpoiler alert: Women don\u2019t give up.\u201dBoth Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Johnston are pushing progressive plans for renewable energy and school funding, while supporting bans on assault weapons. But they have stopped short of measures put forth by Mr. Polis, like the creation of a state single-payer health care system.Mr. Johnston in particular has tried to pitch himself as the only Democrat who can win statewide, traveling rural roads in cowboy boots and delivering Obamaesque speeches about the nation\u2019s imperiled \u201cpromise of equality.\u201dOn a recent afternoon at his campaign office, he leapt over a fence like a rodeo star before delivering a speech to a sea of voters.\u201cIn the moment when people are lost, we are going to light a lantern out here on the Continental Divide,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the rest of the country can\u2019t lead us there right now, Colorado can lead first.\u201dAcross the street, Barry Castile, 56, was playing in the yard with his granddaughters Heaven and Harmony. \u201cThat\u2019s my No. 1 man,\u201d he said, motioning toward the campaign office.Mr. Castile, who owned a car detail business before a back injury, said the region\u2019s sharply rising rent had just about convinced him to leave.But before doing that, he was going to vote for Mr. Johnston. \u201cThis city has changed a lot. A whole lot. And it\u2019s just gotten outrageous for us.\u201dAll of the candidates are trying to address this central anxiety: How does Colorado, long fertile ground for the everyman\u2019s Western dreams, remain a place for the average American?\u201cI love the mountains. It feels safe \u2014 it was a good place to raise a family,\u201d said Jami Fries, 30, an undecided voter. \u201cThat appeal has started to fade.\u201dMr. Polis, sitting on the front porch after his campaign event, said he believes he is the one to take on that challenge.Blue Mountain sold for $780 million. Another online business, ProFlowers, went for $470 million.Mr. Polis has since bankrolled his way from the state board of education to Congress, and during five terms in Washington he has been an advocate for undocumented immigrants, has supported the Affordable Care Act, and has waged a battle against Colorado\u2019s $32 billion oil and gas industry.Mr. Polis said he would prefer not to be boxed in.\u201cI never view it as \u2018liberal versus conservative,\u2019\u201d he said, as voters wound their way up to a smoking room that had become the campaign event\u2019s unofficial after-party. \u201cI view it as a forward versus backward.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a host of a Jared Polis campaign event. He is Scott Durrah, not Duran.Advertisement"}

He said that he still intended to use the new feature.\u201cEveryone spends time on Instagram,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single person is always on Instagram. When you go to YouTube, you\u2019re actively looking for something. Instagram, you\u2019re waiting in line and it\u2019s like, let me just go waste some time.\u201d\u201cFor a lot of our fan base, the simplest things in a sense can be kind of difficult for them,\u201d he said. \u201cJust trying to turn your screen to look at another platform, some people might see that as kind of difficult. It\u2019s easier to have something made specifically for a phone.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what kind of brands are hopping on board, what the monetization policies are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cool thing, all of that has to be established for the first time just like it was with YouTube.\u201dShe expected IGTV to alleviate the difficulty of coaxing fans to follow her from the app to YouTube, where her subscriber base is much smaller than the 141,000 strong who follow her on Instagram.

He expects many faithful users of that platform to gravitate to IGTV, where highly produced, glossy videos have already sprung into rotation.Creators said that the key difference between IGTV and YouTube was that, on the Google-owned video platform, users sought out videos directly. Instagram, on the other hand, allowed for their videos to be discovered spontaneously, and the seamless autoplay will make it even more difficult. The vertical video format, which Instagram has emphasized as a selling point, was popularized by Snapchat, which IGTV seeks to supplant.Advertisement"}

The commission is empowered to impose fines of up to $11bn \u2014 which is 10 percent of the global turnover of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet \u2014 but typically decisions are at the lower end of the range.The decision will mark an escalation of the commission\u2019s battle with Google, which began eight years ago with an investigation into comparison shopping, then only a narrow part of online commerce. Though that case concluded with a \u20ac2.4bn fine, it has not led to significant changes to Google\u2019s business.The issue with AndroidAs the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android.The bigger picture\u2014 Michael de la MercedAthenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday:To ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership.The context Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealth\u2019s co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home.In an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit:\u201cI believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country \u2013 these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, it\u2019s easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.\u201dWhat happens nowAthenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale.Elliott\u2019s response to the newsFrom a spokesman:\u201cElliott welcomes the Board\u2019s decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth\u2019s shareholders, employees and customers. We have long believed that athenahealth is a great company, and we look forward to participating as a bidder in the company\u2019s strategic exploration process.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedMembers of the British government\u2019s digital, culture, media, and sports committee tried to catch him out with questions about a series of media reports on Cambridge Analytica, but they didn\u2019t seem to unsettle the ex-C.E.O.Things didn\u2019t start well for Mr. Nix. He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide \u201cfew clarifications\u201d about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasn\u2019t.Here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing:\u201cThe allegation is false, the facts are not correct.\u201d\u201cThose boxes were not ours. As far as I\u2019m aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t represent the company properly, I didn\u2019t represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.\u201dDid Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users.\u201cIt was my firm impression that Mr. Collins\u2019 questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data\u2026 so I answered no.\u201d\u201cWhen I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.\u201d\u201cI also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebook\u2019s request.\u201dHow useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the company\u2019s work in the U.S.?\u201cThat data was less useful than simply using Facebook\u2019s own advertising algorithms.\u201d\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMore from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance:Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends \u2014 including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.According to Facebook, the user data stayed on phones and never reached those companies\u2019 servers. Lawmakers are irate anyway: Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that he will \u201clook forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that.\u201dMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced that he was dismissing the bureau\u2019s consumer advisory board, which provides feedback on its rules and policies.By law, the bureau must convene the advisory board and hold an in-person meeting with its members at least twice a year. The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week.Anthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group.The consumer advisory board\u2019s members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard.The White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly.\u201cAnything that we can do to unlock government data, we\u2019re committed to. We\u2019d love to hear from any academic that has any insights.\u201dSo far, a big part of the administration\u2019s approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly. It also says that it\u2019s increased investment in R.&D. for \u201cA.I. and related technologies\u201d by more than 40 percent since 2015 \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear what those \u201crelated technologies\u201d are.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeElsewhere in tradeBut something bigger is at work. Comcast is also challenging Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for most of Fox, which includes 39 percent of Sky. (Got all that?) If Comcast could buy the 61 percent of Sky that Fox doesn\u2019t already own, it would be a considerable blow to the Disney deal. Oh, and Comcast is expected to fight hard for the other Fox assets that Disney wants, too.In a survey, America\u2019s CEOs expressed concern over the Trump administration\u2019s approach to trade, with 95 percent of respondents seeing a moderate or serious risk of \u201cforeign trade retaliation leading to lower U.S. exports.\u201d\u201cAs you may have read, Uber is now run by your dad \u2014 so, no, that interpretation was lost on him, but he appreciates Business Insider pointing it out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Made My Puzzle?: Kameron Austin Collins", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bywordplayThis month\u2019s constructor spotlight shines on a Vanity Fair culture writer who has a top-notch crossword constructing side hustle.Where do you currently reside?Brooklyn, N.Y.Where and when was your first puzzle published? My mom is really into crosswords, so they were always sort of around. Whenever we went on long car trips (which was often), my mom would bring her puzzle books. I always found them a little stuffy, to be honest. My first solving memory is of completing an Elizabeth Gorski Sunday puzzle in The New York Times \u2014 I forget which one. But it was very exciting for teenage me, to feel like a puzzle was speaking my language, and also to learn that I could finish one \u2014 a Sunday, no less. As for how I got into constructing \u2026 Honestly, it was a mix of being sleepless, coming across the right puzzles by people whose taste and style I found motivating (Brendan Emmett Quigley, Liz Gorski, Natan Last, Ian Livengood, Pete Wentz, Paula Gamache, Joe Krozel, many others), and being in the market for a new hobby. It wasn\u2019t really something I ever set out to do, to be honest, but I have just enough of an obsessive, perfectionist streak to be an easy mark. What always impressed me most were the puzzles whose vocabulary was wide-ranging, learned, witty, modern and resourceful, and that\u2019s still what I prioritize most as a constructor.Ha! I complain about constructing a lot \u2014 it\u2019s an activity that can be full of disappointment, as plenty of puzzles just don\u2019t work out, and that\u2019s a genuine pain \u2014 but in truth, I mostly find it relaxing. I go into a zone when I construct. Unless I\u2019m on a deadline, it\u2019s truly my comedown activity when I\u2019m not busy with work and feel like creating something. Do you use a computer software constructing program and, if so, which one? What do you like about it?I\u2019m a huge advocate of software. I use Crossfire. I guess I can see the nobility in constructing by hand; that\u2019s where a lot of us (including myself) started, and it\u2019s an excellent way to learn the fundamentals of grid design, strategic letter patterns and so on. But I\u2019m primarily a themeless constructor, and at the end of the day, those puzzles are impossible to sell unless they\u2019re very clean and very juicy. That\u2019s hard to do without a constantly updated word list at your disposal, to say nothing of software that helps you to be realistic about whether the puzzle will actually work.How many hours a week, on average, do you spend on refining your tools, like your word list?Adding to my word list is such a constant activity that I can\u2019t really even calculate it in terms of hours. On my phone, I have a Google Doc with a list that I add words to multiple times a day. I add that list en masse to my proper word list about once a month. For the month of January, for example, my Google list currently has about 500 new entries, all things I came across while reading the news, watching movies, talking to people or even just sitting around and minding my business. Five hundred seems like a lot, but not really when you consider the multiple verb tenses of some entries (GIVE A BACKRUB, GIVES A BACKRUB, GAVE A BACKRUB) and the fact that some proper names are worth two to three entries (MARCELLA HAZAN, as opposed to MARCELLA and HAZAN). I also add words all the time while constructing. This is probably the most important part of constructing. Relatedly, I keep a separate list of \u201cseed entries\u201d \u2014 words I\u2019m eager to build an entire puzzle around \u2014 that\u2019s organized by word length, and alphabetized therein. I also keep a list called \u201c[Expletive, rhymes with \u2018Witty\u2019] Word List,\u201d which is for entries that I am personally disinclined to use in a themeless (partials, prefixes, suffixes, most abbreviations) but which come in handy for themed puzzles, where the rules on these things are a little looser. I upload that word list to Crossfire whenever my slimmed-down word list is making it impossible to fill a themed puzzle adequately.One important point: I subtract words all the time, and while some that get removed from my main word list end up in the \u201c[Witty] Word List\u201d because they\u2019re technically fair game and may come in handy, most simply get deleted. This happens while I\u2019m constructing, and it\u2019s another constant process. If I know I\u2019ll never use a word, I\u2019m quick to dismiss it; it makes the constructing process easier, because I don\u2019t keep getting bombarded with options that I\u2019d never accept (or that editors would never accept). Crossfire and other software only know the words you feed them, so rather than giving these undesirable words a low word score (which tells the program to emphasize them less), I remove them entirely. I would say that I delete 50-60 words from my word list per three-hour constructing session, all with an eye toward being able to focus on the options that appeal to me more. Well, I\u2019ve already told you how I feel about the -ASE\u2019s and WHAT A\u2019s and long or ugly abbreviations (a four-letter abbreviation would have to be as common as HTTP for me to feel comfortable using it, and plural abbreviations are generally extremely inelegant to me unless they\u2019re three letters at most and extremely common). But there\u2019s also cultural stuff. I\u2019ve removed most gun references from my word list \u2014 I don\u2019t know that I care so much about other people using them, as they\u2019re a part of everyday life (and for reasons that aren\u2019t strictly fatal). But I\u2019m not that into them and didn\u2019t feel like debating with myself over them every time they came up. Most urgently, the thought of inadvertently publishing a gun reference in the midst of national mourning over a fresh tragedy is pretty mortifying to me. You can\u2019t control that kind of thing.I\u2019m careful about things like casual misogyny in puzzles and always have been \u2014 those entries tend to be dated in a bad way, as bloggers remind us every time one rears its head. I\u2019ve also, relatedly, been thinking a lot about #MeToo and the public figures I\u2019m now disinclined to put in my puzzles \u2014 this is the sort of thing a constructor thinks about, or should, as the premise of the breakfast test is to avoid unnecessary unpleasantness, and a smart constructor constantly wrestles with what that means.As for pushing boundaries, I prefer surprising people in other ways: realms of culture they didn\u2019t expect to see, or very modern slang. Testing the limits of the \u201cbreakfast test\u201d often just means spicing things up with sex or drug references, or being mildly profane in some way, but I actually find that stuff pretty boring, like cursing on the playground for the first time. It\u2019s just not that shocking \u2014 it\u2019s harder to be creative in other ways.The funniest part of all this is that no matter how careful you think you\u2019re being about your word list, someone solving (or reviewing!) your puzzle might still disagree with what constitutes good vs. bad fill. I love these disagreements over language, even as the complaints can be frustrating. I recently published a puzzle with the word ACTE in it, and it was listed by a blogger as one of the bad entries, which would never occur to me. It\u2019s a basic French word, has a healthy life in crosswords, and \u2014 most important, in my book \u2014 is a cognate, which makes it super gettable. But I can\u2019t begrudge people not loving that particular word; it\u2019s completely a matter of taste. When people complain about the all the nonwhite people I put in my puzzles, on the other hand, my feathers get ruffled.Anything else we should know?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tech You Need to Travel Better", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile no product can guarantee a seat upgrade or make your delayed flight arrive on time, a few smart investments can make your next trip more comfortable, more relaxing and less stressful.\u201cWhen we first looked into smart luggage, we concluded that buying a suitcase that had a USB-battery pack, scale, and Bluetooth tracker embedded wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d said Christine Ryan, an editor at Wirecutter. \u201cWe thought it smarter (sorry!) to buy those things separately and use them with the bag you already have, and hopefully love. Two years later, we stand by that decision, especially now that two of the major \u2018smart bag\u2019 companies have folded.\u201dSpeaking of batteries, you shouldn\u2019t travel without an external battery pack (to keep all the other electronics in this list charged) and a portable surge protector to turn the only outlet in reach in your hotel room into two or three. Ria Misra, another Wirecutter editor, called out the hotel/airport outlet problem: \u201cOutlets aren\u2019t always readily available or convenient when you\u2019re traveling, particularly on international trips where you may also need an additional adapter to get the plug to work. I take a charged USB battery pack with me when I head out on the road, especially if I know I\u2019m going to be using my phone\u2019s GPS to navigate unfamiliar terrain, which can drain a battery fast. It\u2019s also great to bring along when I plan to take public transport at my destination, so that I can charge up while in transit on a bus, train, or even on a long walk.\u201dIf you have trouble sleeping, especially when you travel, a white noise machine may make a world of difference. At home I keep a fan on while I sleep, and I find the sound (and breeze) soothing. But when I\u2019m on the road, I don\u2019t have that luxury.It\u2019s affordable, only about $50, and easy to use, even in the dark. If that sounds like $50 too much, I\u2019ve had some luck recording the sound of my fan at home and then playing it back on my phone while I sleep, but Wirecutter also suggests a few apps for your smartphone that can create their own white noise. Not every hotel has HDTVs where you can access the ports, but many do, specifically for this purpose. With a Chromecast or Roku Stick in your bag, you get to choose what you watch on the hotel TV, and it\u2019s great to log into your own Netflix account and continue the series you\u2019ve been binge watching. Even better, if you\u2019re traveling with children, you can pull up shows you know they enjoy, rather than try to find something from the TV\u2019s on-demand or cable choices.Frequent airline travelers know that a good pair of noise canceling headphones makes all the difference between a relaxing, pleasant flight, and one punctuated with engine noise, inconsolable children or overly chatty seatmates. At the very least, they dull the noise of the engines so you can get some sleep, or play your favorite tunes so you can enjoy that instead of the sounds of the people around you. \u201cPacking cubes make it easy to neatly compress your clothes to save space in your suitcase,\u201d Ms. Misra said, \u201cbut, I\u2019ve also found them especially useful in keeping my things organized throughout my travels. Even after I\u2019ve dug to the very bottom of my suitcase in search of a lost item or two, my clothes are still tidily folded and zipped away.\u201dThese last few things may not be apps, or gadgets you can plug in, but they\u2019ll make sure your next trip is that much more manageable \u2014 and most importantly, less stressful.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Wins Approval for $85.4 Billion Time Warner Deal in Defeat for Justice Dept.", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday approved the blockbuster merger between AT&T and Time Warner, rebuffing the government\u2019s effort to stop the $85.4 billion deal, in a decision that is expected to unleash a wave of corporate takeovers.The judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, said the Justice Department had not proved that the telecom company\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would lead to fewer choices for consumers and higher prices for television and internet services.The merger would create a media and telecommunications powerhouse, reshaping the landscape of those industries. The combined company would have a library that includes HBO\u2019s hit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and channels like CNN, along with vast distribution reach through wireless and satellite television services across the country.Media executives increasingly say content creation and distribution must be married to survive against technology companies like Amazon and Netflix. Those companies started producing their own shows in just the last several years. But they now spend billions of dollars a year on original programming, and users can stream the video on apps in homes and on mobile devices, putting pressure on traditional media businesses.Executives and investors of other companies had watched the six-week trial closely for signs about how it might affect their ambitions. Comcast, for example, would like to beat out the Walt Disney Company for some of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, but has held off from making a formal bid until the trial ended.The ruling is a major setback for the Justice Department and its antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, whose decision to sue to block the merger broke with convention. Deals such as this one, in which the two companies are in related industries but do not produce competing products, are usually approved by federal regulators.Mr. Delrahim had insisted that the two companies sell some major parts before getting government approval, a demand that the executives rejected. That led the Justice Department to file its lawsuit in November. Judge Leon\u2019s decision essentially confirmed the conventional thinking about antitrust law.Mr. Delrahim appeared somber after the decision. He said he was disappointed and would review the 172-page opinion before deciding whether the government would ask a higher court to issue a stay of the ruling. The Justice Department could appeal the decision even if it did not get an injunction.\u201cI\u2019ve taken an oath to uphold competition,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. \u201cWe are going to take the next steps as necessary.\u201dJudge Leon took the unusual step of warning the government not to try to seek a stay, saying it would hurt the defendants, which had already gone through an 18-month regulatory and legal battle for their review. The companies face a June 21 deadline to close their deal.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that it took 18 months to get here,\u201d Daniel Petrocelli, the lead litigator for AT&T and Time Warner, said outside the courthouse after the opinion. \u201cBut we are relieved it is finally behind us and we look forward to closing the transaction in the upcoming days.\u201dShares in AT&T fell 5.5 percent in morning trading on Wednesday, while shares in Time Warner rose 2.7 percent.The deal was hatched in August 2016 when Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, called Jeff Bewkes, his counterpart at Time Warner. Mr. Bewkes\u2019s company, with its popular HBO shows, live N.B.A. and N.C.A.A. sports broadcasting rights, and CNN, has been a takeover target for years.The two then had a long lunch in the Time Warner dining room in New York and agreed that their industries were under siege. The purchase of Time Warner would give AT&T the premium television content it needed to make its bundle of wireless, television and broadband services more attractive to customers.The deal would put AT&T in charge of Time Warner\u2019s vast portfolio, which includes HBO and CNN, rights to major sports leagues, and valuable film franchises such as Harry Potter. John Stankey, an AT&T executive, would oversee the integration of these units into AT&T and eventually lead the Time Warner business.\u201cWe want people engaged with their mobile devices all day watching movies and video,\u201d Mr. Stephenson testified at the trial.Presidential politics clouded the merger from almost the moment it was announced. President Trump, while still a candidate, said he would block the deal \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dThose comments and his repeated criticism of CNN, which is owned by Time Warner\u2019s Turner Broadcasting unit, raised speculation that Mr. Trump had pushed Mr. Delrahim and the Justice Department to block the deal.But Mr. Delrahim swore to the court that he was not influenced by the White House, and Judge Leon stopped the companies from introducing evidence about possible political interference.\u201cWe always believed that the motivations for bringing this case were questionable at best,\u201d Gary Ginsberg, an executive vice president for Time Warner, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe court\u2019s verdict resoundingly supported that view.\u201dMr. Delrahim had argued that the only way antitrust concerns could be resolved was through the sale of major businesses. Last fall, he presented AT&T and Time Warner with two options: Sell the majority stake in either DirecTV, which is AT&T\u2019s satellite television company, or Turner Broadcasting. The companies rejected both options.Mr. Delrahim\u2019s position, which the White House said it supported, also had the backing of some left-leaning politicians and antitrust experts. They have been increasingly calling for the government to break up Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon and to prevent greater consolidation in health care, media, transportation and agriculture.Judge Leon, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, tried to limit the reach of his opinion, writing that \u201cthe temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than a resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\u201dBut many antitrust experts and analysts believe the decision will embolden companies to pursue deals.The decision \u201cwill give AT&T market power to raise the price of Time Warner content, and, secondly, it will lead to further vertical mergers in this industry that will harm consumers,\u201d said Steven Salop, an economics and law professor at Georgetown University who has pushed for stronger government regulation.The trial drew large crowds that included executives, hedge fund managers and financial analysts. Mr. Delrahim attended occasionally, and so did Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes. The two executives each took the witness stand to defend the merger.Judge Leon asked few questions during the trial and gave little indication of where he was leaning before his opinion on Tuesday. But many experts felt that the government had struggled to make its case.After Judge Leon delivered his decision to a packed courtroom, representatives from AT&T and Time Warner lined the small hallway just outside. The men and women embraced and clapped one another on the back, beaming as they whispered congratulations.\u201cIt\u2019s a receiving line,\u201d one woman joked, her hands outstretched for the next hug.Cecilia Kang and Emily Cochrane reported from Washington, and Edmund Lee from New York.Advertisement"}

Or something more serious. I\u2019ve always found that to be a very interesting and universal human desire worthy of explanation. So when I heard about this research going on using psilocybin, the chemical in magic mushrooms, to treat people and to induce so-called mystical experiences, I thought, Well it\u2019s really time to get back and to get a harder look at that whole subject.\u201dAmong other things, Pollan discusses the ways that psychedelics dissolve our sense of self, and the potential mental health benefits they bestow as a result. \u201cPsilocybin gives you such a powerful psychological experience that it kind of reboots your brain, your mind,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of depression is a sort of self-punishment, as even Freud understood.

{"Headline": "The Californization of America", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Kettmann is a columnist for The Santa Cruz Sentinel.SOQUEL, Calif. \u2014 Across the country, Democrats are winning primaries by promoting policies like universal health insurance and guaranteed income \u2014 ideas once laughed off as things that work only on the \u201cLeft Coast.\u201dAt the same time, national politicians from both sides are finally putting front and center issues that California has been grappling with for years: immigration, clean energy, police reform, suburban sprawl. And the state is home to a crop of politicians to watch, from Kevin McCarthy on the right to Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris on the left, part of a wave that is likely to dominate American politics for the next generation.California, which holds its primaries on Tuesday, has long set the national agenda on the economy, culture and technology. So maybe it was just a matter of time before it got back to driving the political agenda, as it did when Ronald Reagan launched his political career in the 1960s. But other things are happening as well. The state is a hub for immigrants, a testing site for solutions to environmental crises and a front line in America\u2019s competition with China. On all sorts of big issues that matter now and will in the future, California is already in the game.In a way, California even gave us Donald Trump. So much of his \u201ctraining\u201d to be president came while he was an entertainment celebrity, on a show that, for a stretch of its existence, was produced in Los Angeles. And of course the means of his ascent \u2014 the smartphone, social media \u2014 came out of Silicon Valley. That\u2019s a lot to have on a state\u2019s conscience.For decades, California, even as it grew in size and wealth, was seen as an outlier, unintimidating, superficial and flaky. We were no threat. We were surfer dudes and California girls who got high and turned on, tuned in and dropped out. We spawned Apple and Google, but we also spawned hippies and Hollywood. For a time, our governor was nicknamed Moonbeam.As recently as the 2000s, with California at the center of the subprime-mortgage crisis, it was fair to wonder whether we had a future; a popular parlor game was to imagine how the state might be divided up into more manageable statelets.That was the old California.California\u2019s raw economic power is old news. What\u2019s different, just in the past few years, is the combination of its money, population and politics. In the Trump era, the state is reinventing itself as the moral and cultural center of a new America.California is hardly monolithic. The region around Bakersfield provides the power base for Mr. McCarthy, the House majority leader and an indefatigable defender of President Trump, who calls him \u201cmy Kevin.\u201d Other sizable pockets of Trump supporters live along the inland spine of the state, especially in the north near the Oregon border.Still, there\u2019s no doubt California runs blue \u2014 so blue, people say, that its anti-Trump stance is inevitable. But that\u2019s not right; in fact, California defies Mr. Trump \u2014 and is turning even more Democratic \u2014 not for partisan reasons but because his rhetoric and actions are at odds with contemporary American values on issue after issue, as people here see it, and because he seems intent on ignoring the nation\u2019s present and future in favor of pushing back the clock.California doesn\u2019t just oppose Mr. Trump; it offers a better alternative to the America he promises. While Mr. Trump makes hollow promises to states ravaged by the decline of the coal industry, California has been a leader in creating new jobs through renewable energy.While Mr. Trump plays the racism card, California pulls in immigrants from all over the world. For California, immigration is not an issue to be exploited to inflame hate and assuage the economic insecurities of those who feel displaced by the 21st-century economy, it\u2019s what keeps the state economy churning.For us, immigration is not a \u201cLatino\u201d issue. The state\u2019s white population arrived so recently that all of us retain a sense of our immigrant status. My great-great-grandfather Gerhard Kettmann left Germany in 1849 and made his way to California during the Gold Rush. That\u2019s why everyone is able to unite, even in our diversity.It seems as if every other idealistic young person who worked in the Obama White House or on the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign later moved to California. All these new arrivals create major problems, from housing shortages to insane Los Angeles-style traffic in Silicon Valley. They also create a critical mass of innovation.Many Californians see the next decade as a pivot point, when decisions about the environment and the economy will shape America\u2019s future for generations to come. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Mad Max\u2019 or \u2018Star Trek,\u2019\u201d said Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and leading candidate to succeed Governor Brown. It\u2019s no mystery which movie he thinks Mr. Trump is directing.Nationally, Mr. Newsom is known mostly as a cultural pioneer, having allowed same-sex marriage as the mayor of San Francisco in 2004 \u2014 among the first big-city mayors to do so. But he sees himself in more pragmatic terms, more like a latter-day Robert Kennedy, a believer in the idea that government can do more for the people if it\u2019s smarter about trying new ideas and updating old assumptions.California for years was divided between its main population centers. Northern California, birthplace of Berkeley\u2019s Free Speech Movement in 1964 and the Summer of Love in San Francisco later that decade, was often at odds with large sections of Southern California, particularly Orange County, a bastion of suburban Republicans.The key, many of the state\u2019s politicians say, is to promote the former without falling into the trap of the latter \u2014 no easy task at a time when many Californians see their state as the base of the anti-Trump resistance.It would be easy for him to run far to the left, mixing anti-Trump rhetoric with unrealistic policy promises. Instead, he wants America to see a different California \u2014 a state that mixes pragmatism and progressivism.\u201cI\u2019m one of those people that think the threats that we face from Washington are very real, and not just to the resources we need, but the values that make us who we are,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia is really a model for what the country can be if we make the right choices.\u201d\u201cThe momentum is definitely on our side,\u201d Mr. Janz told me. \u201cMy opponent is more concerned about blaming Democrats than getting the job done. The people here honestly want Nunes to focus less on creating these fake controversies and more on doing the work that\u2019s required to move us along into the 21st century here in the Central Valley.\u201dAgain and again, this is the message coming from the state\u2019s rising politicians \u2014 anger with the president and his allies not out of an ideological commitment, but because the president seems more interested in personal gain than national progress.The more visionary among California\u2019s leaders, including Mr. Newsom, recognize that their state has the highest poverty rate in the country, by some measures, and that addressing the problem \u2014 through affordable housing, job programs and early education \u2014 has to be a priority. To the extent these are national problems, too, other states may soon be looking to Sacramento, not Washington, for leadership.It\u2019s also a given that one or more Californians could figure prominently in the 2020 presidential race, including Ms. Harris, a first-term senator who has gained a reputation for her withering examinations of the president\u2019s cabinet nominees. Mr. Newsom, particularly if he wins the governor\u2019s race this year by a convincing margin, could also make the jump to the national stage, following Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown.To see how different the stereotype of California is from the reality, consider another of the state\u2019s rising political figures, the billionaire Tom Steyer.To most people in Washington or New York, Mr. Steyer is the \u201cImpeachment Guy\u201d who has spent millions of dollars on television ads in which he speaks to the camera directly and makes a case for the urgent need to impeach President Trump. Impeachment is a widely popular idea among Democrats, but political realists say it\u2019s unlikely to happen absent a Democratic surge in the midterm elections \u2014 in other words, that\u2019s California for you.\u201cI think California has this great advantage, which is we have a functioning democracy,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in a recent interview. \u201cWith all our problems \u2014 and we have a lot of them, the biggest one being economic inequality \u2014 we have a spirit in business and in politics that says, sure, there are big problems, but we can address them. That spirit is a great advantage and it\u2019s not true in Washington, D.C., right now.\u201dHis bet \u2014 and that of millions of others in my state \u2014 is that soon, California will pick up the slack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Advertisers Sip Ros\u00e9 and Ponder Ethics in South of France", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingCANNES, France \u2014 A who\u2019s who of marketing and media convened on yachts and in the gardens of luxurious chateaus here last week as musicians like Jon Bon Jovi and the Killers performed at hotels and sandy beaches temporarily renamed after companies like Google and Spotify. There was a \u201cblockchain yacht\u201d and a \u201cblockchain villa\u201d and more ros\u00e9 than any group of people could, or perhaps should, want to drink.Mr. Harris, who joined the festival at the behest of the agency Hearts & Science, and Scott Hagedorn, the agency\u2019s chief executive, appeared on a panel for clients where they discussed smartphone addiction, the feelings of depression and anxiety that social media can produce in teenagers, and the methods that popular apps like Facebook use to harness human attention so they can serve more ads to people.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be scorching the playing field when we\u2019re extracting attention,\u201d Mr. Harris said in an interview. \u201cIt would just suck the air out of democracy and there\u2019s no shared truth and then it\u2019s like, great, we can advertise to people, but they\u2019re lonely, depressed and they don\u2019t believe in facts. No one wants that world.\u201dMr. Hagedorn, who acknowledged that some might look askance at advertisers taking up the cause of ethical persuasion, said he heard Mr. Harris on a podcast last year when his agency was manually reviewing tens of thousands of YouTube videos to figure out what kind of content its clients\u2019 ads were appearing with.\u201cI ended up basically giving myself PTSD because I saw so many horrible things,\u201d Mr. Hagedorn said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been, as an industry, blindly telling clients that being \u2018video neutral\u2019 is fine \u2014 you can follow the eyeballs from platform to platform \u2014 and I think we\u2019ve been unaware, or not paying attention potentially, to what we\u2019re monetizing and funding.\u201d\u201cDigital advertising as an industry has grown really, really rapidly and the unintended consequences of that sort of rapid growth means there are things happening that no one had anticipated,\u201d Mr. Weed said in an interview. He said he expected to work directly with platforms like Instagram on such issues, adding that social media sites are grappling with a decline in trust.Jon Kaplan, the global head of sales at Pinterest, said that he had observed \u201ca growing backlash\u201d against automated, data-driven advertising. In an interview on a pier that the company rented for the week, which welcomed \u201cfriends of the Pin,\u201d he recalled the disenchantment of major advertisers at an industry gathering last year.\u201cEvery story was like, we thought this was the panacea, and while it has its place, we may have over-rotated into that kind of data-driven marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s kind of no soul and no creativity and no real brand love associated with that.\u201dThe big tech companies also had an unexpected neighbor on the beach \u2014 Big Tobacco. Philip Morris International hosted a concert by the band St. Lucia and served drinks by robot bartenders. As the week closed, the company issued \u201ca bold call to action for the creative, media and communications communities\u201d to support its efforts in advertising tobacco products.Wendy Clark, the chief executive of DDB Worldwide, said that in the 1990s the beachfront space now ruled by tech had been dominated by ad agencies. She was optimistic, however, about technology forcing advertisers to come up with increasingly creative ways to reach people.\u201cThe best ads don\u2019t feel like ads,\u201d she said. Terms like \u201cadvertising\u201d and \u201cmarketing\u201d have come to mean less, she said, recounting a meeting she had during the week with a young YouTube influencer. \u201cShe would never describe herself as a marketer, but she\u2019s a modern-day marketer,\u201d Ms. Clark said.Still, Shane Smith, Vice\u2019s co-founder, appeared to remain popular with the ad industry, judging by the long line to enter the company\u2019s annual party.As more reports have emerged about misconduct of varying levels at advertising or media companies, it has posed a challenge for brands.Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble, the world\u2019s biggest advertiser, said in an interview that, generally, such situations are \u201cfew and far between,\u201d but that when they do arise, the company has to examine whether they are \u201cisolated incidents or is there a pervasive pattern that you need to do something about.\u201dMr. Pritchard added that the company has been working to build up its own databases to make its digital ads more precise and pointed to new partnerships it announced last week with Katie Couric and Queen Latifah.\u201cThe bigger thing we\u2019re pushing on,\u201d he said, \u201cis we\u2019re just trying to take more control over things.\u201dEmily Steel and David Gelles contributed reporting.Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or follow her on Twitter: @sapna.Advertisement"}

Where did it come from? It has indistinct antecedents in the adventure novel, the spy novel and the hybrid midcentury experimentations of Elmore Leonard, but realistically, the answer isn\u2019t pretty: Its pure form was the invention of Robert Ludlum and Frederick Forsyth, who set their lone heroes loose against immense forces in the 1970s and haven\u2019t come back for them yet. The genre spread fast and hard \u2014 America had all that unmelting, isolate, stoic toughness, and, with the west at last wholly settled, nowhere to put it, fictionally.

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and the Feud Over Killer Robots", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "As the tech moguls disagree over the risks presented by something that doesn\u2019t exist yet, all of Silicon Valley is learning about unintended consequences of A.I.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg thought his fellow Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk was behaving like an alarmist.So, on Nov. 19, 2014, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, invited Mr. Musk to dinner at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. Two top researchers from Facebook\u2019s new artificial intelligence lab and two other Facebook executives joined them.As they ate, the Facebook contingent tried to convince Mr. Musk that he was wrong. But he wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cI genuinely believe this is dangerous,\u201d Mr. Musk told the table, according to one of the dinner\u2019s attendees, Yann LeCun, the researcher who led Facebook\u2019s A.I. lab.Mr. Musk\u2019s fears of A.I., distilled to their essence, were simple: If we create machines that are smarter than humans, they could turn against us. (See: \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d) Let\u2019s for once, he was saying to the rest of the tech industry, consider the unintended consequences of what we are creating before we unleash it on the world.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Zuckerberg would talk in detail about the dinner, which has not been reported before, or their long-running A.I. debate.The creation of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 the name for the supersmart technological breakthrough that takes A.I. to the next level and creates machines that not only perform narrow tasks that typically require human intelligence (like self-driving cars) but can actually outthink humans \u2014 still feels like science fiction. But the fight over the future of A.I. has spread across the tech industry.Artificial intelligence research has enormous potential and enormous implications, both as an economic engine and a source of military superiority. The Chinese government has said it is willing to spend billions in the coming years to make the country the world\u2019s leader in A.I., while the Pentagon is aggressively courting the tech industry for help. A new breed of autonomous weapons can\u2019t be far away.\u201cYou can now talk about the risks of A.I. without seeming like you are lost in science fiction,\u201d said Allan Dafoe, a director of the governance of A.I. program at the Future of Humanity Institute, a research center at the University of Oxford that explores the risks and opportunities of advanced technology.In April, Mr. Zuckerberg spent two days answering questions from members of Congress about data privacy and Facebook\u2019s role in the spread of misinformation before the 2016 election. He faced a similar grilling in Europe last month.Facebook\u2019s recognition that it was slow to understand what was going on has led to a rare moment of self-reflection in an industry that has long believed it is making the world a better place, whether the world likes it or not.Even such influential figures as the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the late Stephen Hawking have expressed concern about creating machines that are more intelligent than we are. Even though superintelligence seems decades away, they and others have said, shouldn\u2019t we consider the consequences before it\u2019s too late?\u201cThe kind of systems we are creating are very powerful,\u201d said Bart Selman, a Cornell University computer science professor and former Bell Labs researcher. \u201cAnd we cannot understand their impact.\u201dPacific Grove is a tiny town on the central coast of California. A group of geneticists gathered there, in the winter of 1975 to discuss whether their work \u2014 gene editing \u2014 would end up harming the world. In January 2017, the A.I. community held a similar discussion in the beachside grove.The heavy hitters of A.I. were in the room \u2014 among them Mr. LeCun, the Facebook A.I. lab boss who was at the dinner in Palo Alto, and who had helped develop a neural network, one of the most important tools in artificial intelligence today. Also in attendance was Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book, \u201cSuperintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\u201d had an outsized \u2014 some would argue fear-mongering \u2014 effect on the A.I. discussion; Oren Etzioni, a former computer science professor at the University of Washington who had taken over the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle; and Demis Hassabis, who heads DeepMind, an influential Google-owned A.I. research lab in London.And so was Mr. Musk, who in 2015 had donated $10 million to the Cambridge, Mass., institute. That same year, he also helped create an independent artificial intelligence lab, OpenAI, with an explicit goal: create superintelligence with safeguards meant to ensure it won\u2019t get out of control. It was a message that clearly aligned him with Mr. Bostrom.On the second day of the retreat, Mr. Musk took part in a nine-person panel dedicated to the superintelligence question. Each panelist was asked if superintelligence was possible. As they passed the microphone down the line, each said \u201cYes,\u201d until the microphone reached Mr. Musk. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. The small auditorium rippled with knowing laughter. Everyone understood that Mr. Musk thought superintelligence was not only possible, but very dangerous.Mr. Musk later added: \u201cWe are headed toward either superintelligence or civilization ending.\u201dWarnings about the risks of artificial intelligence have been around for years, of course. But few of those Cassandras have the tech cred of Mr. Musk. Few, if any, have spent as much time and money on it. And perhaps none has had as complicated a history with the technology.Just a few weeks after Mr. Musk talked about his A.I. concerns at the dinner in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s house, Mr. Musk phoned Mr. LeCun, asking for the names of top A.I. researchers who could work on his self-driving car project at Tesla. (That autonomous technology was in use at the time of two fatal Tesla car crashes, one in Florida in May 2016 and the other in March of this year.)During a recent Tesla earnings call, Mr. Musk, who has struggled with questions about his company\u2019s financial losses and concerns about the quality of its vehicles, chastised the news media for not focusing on the deaths that autonomous technology could prevent \u2014 a remarkable stance from someone who has repeatedly warned the world that A.I. is a danger to humanity.There is a saying in Silicon Valley: We overestimate what can be done in three years and underestimate what can be done in 10.On Jan. 27, 2016, Google\u2019s DeepMind lab unveiled a machine that could beat a professional player at the ancient board game Go. In a match played a few months earlier, the machine, called AlphaGo, had defeated the European champion Fan Hui \u2014 five games to none.Even top A.I. researchers had assumed it would be another decade before a machine could solve the game. Go is complex \u2014 there are more possible board positions than atoms in the universe \u2014 and the best players win not with sheer calculation, but through intuition. Two weeks before AlphaGo was revealed, Mr. LeCun said the existence of such a machine was unlikely.A few months later, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, the best Go player of the last decade. The machine made moves that baffled human experts but ultimately led to victory.Many researchers, including the leaders of DeepMind and OpenAI, believe the kind of self-learning technology that underpins AlphaGo provided a path to \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d And they believe progress in this area will significantly accelerate in the coming years.It\u2019s the kind of unpredictability that raise grave concerns about the rise of A.I., including superintelligence.But the deep opposition to these concerns was on display in March at an exclusive conference organized by Amazon and Mr. Bezos in Palm Springs.One evening, Rodney Brooks, a roboticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, debated the potential dangers of A.I. with the neuroscientist, philosopher and podcaster Sam Harris, a prominent voice of caution on the issue. The debate got personal, according to a recording obtained by The Times.Mr. Harris warned that because the world was in an arms race toward A.I., researchers may not have the time needed to ensure superintelligence is built in a safe way.\u201cThis is something you have made up,\u201d Mr. Brooks responded. He implied that Mr. Harris\u2019s argument was based on unscientific reasoning. It couldn\u2019t be proven right or wrong \u2014 a real insult among scientists.\u201cI would take this personally, if it actually made sense.\u201d Mr. Harris said.A moderator finally ended the tussle and asked for questions from the audience. Mr. Etzioni, the head of the Allen Institute, took the microphone. \u201cI am not going to grandstand,\u201d he said. But urged on by Mr. Brooks, he walked onto the stage and laid into Mr. Harris for three minutes, saying that today\u2019s A.I. systems are so limited, spending so much time worrying about superintelligence just doesn\u2019t make sense.The people who take Mr. Musk\u2019s side are philosophers, social scientists, writers \u2014 not the researchers who are working on A.I., he said. Among A.I. scientists, the notion that we should start worrying about superintelligence is \u201cvery much a fringe argument.\u201dPanicking about A.I. now, so early in its development, could threaten the many benefits that come from things like self-driving cars and A.I. health care, he said.\u201cWith A.I. especially, I\u2019m really optimistic,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cPeople who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios \u2014 I just, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201dIn other words: You\u2019re getting ahead of reality, Elon. Relax.\u201cThis is going to be a very central question for how we think about A.I. systems over the next decade and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, a lot of our A.I. systems make decisions in ways that people don\u2019t really understand.\u201dMr. Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind, still thinks Mr. Musk\u2019s views are extreme. But he said the same about the views of Mr. Zuckerberg. The threat is not here, he said. Not yet. But Facebook\u2019s problems are a warning.\u201cWe need to use the downtime, when things are calm, to prepare for when things get serious in the decades to come,\u201d said Mr. Hassabis. \u201cThe time we have now is valuable, and we need to make use of it.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s New Political Algorithms Increase Tension With Publishers", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews publishers have long had a fraught relationship with Facebook. But tensions have become more public in recent weeks, with news organizations openly criticizing the tech giant for new policies that they say are harmful to journalism.The most recent salvo came on Thursday, when Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, accused Facebook of unintentionally \u201csupporting the enemies of quality journalism\u201d by using algorithms that can mischaracterize news as partisan political content.Ms. Brown cited the importance of safeguarding elections and said the problems with political ads were \u201csomething we are deeply concerned about. We hear you.\u201dIn criticizing Facebook, Mr. Thompson showed two advertisements that The Times had recently purchased on the platform. Both had been flagged as political.Executives like Robert Thomson, the News Corp. chief and lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch, and Jonah Peretti of BuzzFeed have consistently called for increased payments from Facebook \u2014 which, along with Google, has been gobbling up more of the online advertising revenue that publishers need to survive.But the latest fight has more to do with the treatment of content than the economics of the media industry. Last month, with public and political pressure growing over Facebook\u2019s role in the 2016 election, the company unveiled a policy that created a publicly searchable archive for ads that its algorithms deemed to be political. In addition, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said the company would start ranking publishers by their perceived \u201ctrustworthiness.\u201dFacebook has agreed to create a distinction between publishers\u2019 content and political ads, but it has not yet built a separate archive.Moves like those have only inflamed tensions with publishers, said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The Times, and who signed the publishers\u2019 letter last month.\u201cFacebook communicated poorly,\u201d Mr. Kint said. \u201cThey have not built trust with publishers.\u201dAlthough Facebook remains a vital outlet for publishers, its power has diminished. According to data from Chartbeat, an online analytics company, publishers\u2019 traffic from Facebook has declined about 15 percent in the last year. At the same time, traffic from Google is up 20 percent since last August.During the discussion on Thursday, Mr. Thompson sparred with Ms. Brown, who was an NBC News correspondent and a CNN anchor before joining Facebook.In response to his complaints about the ad policy, Ms. Brown said there was a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d of the policy, adding that \u201cThe New York Times does not want to be transparent about the money they spend\u201d on ads.Mr. Thompson also called Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments on trust \u201cterrifyingly na\u00efve,\u201d echoing a speech he gave on Tuesday at the Open Markets Initiative in Washington.In that speech, Mr. Thompson accused Facebook of trying to \u201cset itself up as the digital world\u2019s editor in chief, prioritizing and presumably downgrading and rejecting content on a survey- and data-driven assessment of whether the provider is \u2018broadly trusted\u2019 or not.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does American \u2018Tribalism\u2019 End in a Compromise, or a Fight?", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsEarly in June, the valedictorian at Bell County High School in southeastern Kentucky delivered a graduation speech filled with inspirational quotations that, he said with a twinkle in his eye, he\u2019d found on Google. One line, in particular, drew wild applause from the crowd in this conservative part of the country: \u201c\u2009\u2018Don\u2019t just get involved. Fight for your seat at the table. Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table.\u2019 \u2014 Donald J. Trump.\u201d As people cheered, though, the valedictorian issued a correction: \u201cJust kidding, that was Barack Obama.\u201d Right away, the applause died down, and a boo could be heard. The identity of the messenger, it was painfully evident, mattered more than the content of the message.In its first sense, tribalism refers to the organization of people along lines of common ancestry or joint identity for the purpose of exercising political power \u2014 as the indigenous people of many parts of the world, including the Americas, have long done. But over time, as new forms of governance appeared \u2014 city-states, kingdoms and especially empires, which controlled vast colonies with different races, cultures and languages \u2014 tribalism came to be seen as crude and antiquated, a political structure that could never hope to address the challenges of large states. And now, in the modern era, the word is used almost exclusively in its second, derogatory sense, to suggest an irrational loyalty to your people.The impulse to belong to a clan is deeply human, however, and new tribes continue to form, organized not around ancestry but along fuzzier lines of ideology or demography. Modern tribes, like ancient ones, have idiosyncratic languages; one faction might speak of \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d \u201ctraditional families\u201d and \u201cthe life of the unborn,\u201d while the other talks of \u201cundocumented workers,\u201d \u201cmarriage equality\u201d and \u201cmy body, my choice.\u201d They rule over separate territories, listen to different oracles, uphold distinct values and dismiss contradictory information as unreliable propaganda or \u201cfake news.\u201dAbove all, tribe members protect one another from perceived attacks by outsiders. Last April, when the MSNBC host Joy Reid was found to have posted homophobic content on a now-defunct blog (and claimed, dubiously, to have been hacked), many liberals rallied to her side anyway, pointing out that the posts were more than 10 years old and urging others to accept her profuse apologies. Had such posts been attributed to a Fox News personality, however, it\u2019s almost certain those same liberals would have offered no opportunity for forgiveness. The gift of absolution is given within a tribe, and rarely outside it.Political tribes can organize along stark lines: the working class versus the 1 percent, baby boomers versus millennials, city dwellers versus rural people. But they can also be more nebulous, forming around subtleties of education, lifestyle or cultural taste. Some years ago, when Howard Dean was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the presidency, the conservative PAC Club for Growth ran a TV ad in Iowa featuring an elderly white couple being asked about Dean\u2019s tax proposal. \u201cWhat do I think?\u201d the husband says. \u201cI think Howard Dean should take his tax-hiking, government-expanding, latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New York Times-reading \u2014\u201d Then his wife interrupts: \u201cbody-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freak show back to Vermont, where it belongs.\u201dThe question was at least putatively about Dean\u2019s plan to repeal George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts, but instead of eliciting a coherent opinion on how much tax should reasonably be withheld, from whom and for what services, it provoked a rant against a particular group of people, who were characterized almost entirely through their lifestyle and consumer choices. There was no need to talk policy, because the policy was reframed as an embrace of one tribe and a rejection of the other.It is not a coincidence, then, that use of the word \u201ctribalism\u201d in print increased significantly during the civil rights struggles, anti-war protests and cultural clashes of the 1960s, reaching a peak in 1972, when Richard Nixon campaigned for and won a second term. That era was characterized by turmoil, both abroad and here in the United States, where tribes rebelled against one another in nearly every public arena, from draft offices to college campuses to lunch counters. After Nixon\u2019s resignation and the end of the Vietnam War, complaints about tribalism declined steadily, only to rise again in the 1990s.Why the 1990s? Over the course of his presidency, Bill Clinton moved the Democratic Party to the right: He deregulated banks, cut welfare programs, signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law, built a border wall between San Diego and Tijuana and expanded mass incarceration. These are not progressive ideas, which left Republicans with few concrete policies that could distinguish them from Democrats. Republicans did, however, have culture \u2014 and, eventually, character. When Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky surfaced in 1998, conservatives attacked him as the symbol of a lost and immoral society, while liberals minimized his offenses and portrayed the young intern as a harlot. Twenty years later, the two tribes would switch sides, with liberals denouncing Donald Trump for sexual predation while conservatives, including white evangelicals, rallied around him.Some people think that dialogue and debate can help the United States defeat its current tribalism. If only we could calmly talk about our differences, the argument goes, we would reach some compromise. But not all disagreements are bridgeable. The Union and the Confederacy did not resolve their differences through dialogue; it was a civil war that put an end to slavery. Jim Crow laws were defeated through mass protests and civil disobedience. Schools were desegregated though a Supreme Court decision, which had to be implemented with the help of the National Guard. The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed as a political necessity during World War II. Some fights are not talked away; they are, in the end, either won or lost.This is not to say that tribal impasses of the moment can\u2019t be broken. But it is generally not a good idea to expect people on the receiving end of brutal policies \u2014 like families broken apart by police violence, immigration raids, travel bans or anti-L.G.B.T. discrimination \u2014 to hash out a compromise over sweet tea. \u201cMaybe we pushed too far,\u201d Barack Obama is quoted as saying in a new memoir by Benjamin Rhodes, one of his closest aides. \u201cMaybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.\u201d What the ever-compromising Obama doesn\u2019t consider is that resolution sometimes requires pushing even further.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Turkey Overcome Its Bitter Factionalism?", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. White is a social anthropologist studying\u00a0Turkey.\u201cFETOist\u201d has become a blanket accusation in the media, courts and public discourse, sometimes implausibly applied to known atheists and leftists and other dissenters. Anyone can be accused of treason.The roots of these troubles lie in Turkey\u2019s nation-building project. Since its founding in 1923, Turkey has been unable to develop a unifying national identity that represents all of its citizens. The country experienced coups or other severe political crises on average every 10 years, along with long periods of extraordinary rule. The state of emergency enacted after the 2016 coup attempt remains in force.At various times, Turkey has splintered along religious, ideological and ethnic lines and seen further divisions within those religious, ideological and ethnic formations as well. Relations between groups are often marked by deeply felt hatred and demonization.When I was a student in Ankara in the 1970s, street violence between leftists and rightists killed more than 5,000 people. Turkey today is a different place from the insular, closed society of the 1970s, yet it remains intensely polarized.Why is there so much antagonistic factionalism? Turkey\u2019s institutions primarily protect the interests of the state, not the citizen. So people seek protection and provision of their everyday needs through their families and communities or an association, religious brotherhood, political party or other group that will absorb them into its networks. Groups also provide a social identity often founded on rivalry with other groups, producing the unstable ground that breeds factionalism.Turkish political life tends to be brittle because the glue that holds parties together is not allegiance to the party, the government or the state, or a shared ideology. Rather, followers are bound by their loyalty and obedience to a single leader. Disagreement with the leader becomes a personal betrayal that requires the traitor to leave the group, taking his networks with him, often reforming around new leaders in a continual process of fracturing into mutually hostile groups.The M.H.P. is allied with the A.K.P. in the coming elections. Ms. Aksener created a new party, the Good Party, and is contesting the presidential elections against Mr. Erdogan.The opposition parties have vowed to instruct their followers to support any candidate facing Mr. Erdogan if he doesn\u2019t win in the first round. Along with electing a new kind of president, the voters will also elect members of the Turkish Parliament. The opposition plans to combine their votes to thwart Mr. Erdogan\u2019s executive presidency.The mind of the opposition is unusually focused because the implications for Turkish democracy are vast. Many expect that Mr. Erdogan will win his presidency but that the opposition will gain a majority in Parliament. How long can a unified opposition survive under these untried conditions?The Turkish media mostly covers Mr. Erdogan and his party\u2019s campaign. The opposition is responding by creatively using the internet and social media. The Good Party used Google AdWords to send political messages in response to Google inquiries. If you Google the term \u201cfreedom,\u201d you will be followed around by an ad that says, \u201cSearch result not found; Try again on June 25.\u201dMuharrem Ince, the new presidential candidate for Turkey\u2019s largest opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, has reinvigorated his supporters. Mr. Ince, a former physics teacher and a lawmaker, has pleased the crowds with his oratory, sense of humor and charisma.Selahattin Demirtas of the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party is campaigning as a presidential candidate from prison. He has been in prison for more than a year on vague charges of \u201csupporting terrorism.\u201d He held his first campaign meeting by telephone and sent handwritten notes as responses to questions he was asked on Twitter. The Saadet Party, a tiny Islamist party, has also joined the united opposition.Half of the Turkish population is under 30; the voting age is 18. In 2013, during the Gezi Park protests, a wide spectrum of young people, both secular and pious, demonstrated peacefully against the government. They were a 21st-century generation facing off against 20th-century autocrats. The youth might turn out to be another unifying force.The electoral season has seen Turkish political parties and their followers cross a Rubicon. Traditional parties have put aside their differences to unite against a common enemy, following in a path already forged by Turkey\u2019s youth. The question is whether this unity will survive the election and bring stability or whether the new political environment, which vastly increases the power of a single leader, will simply redefine the enemy.Jenny White is the author, most recently, of \u201cMuslim Nationalism and the New Turks\u201d and a professor at the Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deep Inside the Obama White House", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The same mistake was made in Libya. The dictator Muammar Qaddafi threatened to massacre his opponents in Benghazi. Susan Rice compared the situation to Rwanda, where Bill Clinton was said to have \u201callowed\u201d a genocide. Samantha Power passed Rhodes a note stating \u201cthis was going to be the first mass atrocity that took place on our watch.\u201d Rhodes agreed. \u201cWe\u2019d have to consider,\u201d he advised in his new role as a deputy national security adviser, \u201cwhat we would say if we choose not to do something.\u201d A good point, especially with the Europeans and the Arab League (very briefly) urging action. But military intervention \u2014 and the eventual removal of Qaddafi \u2014 led to chaos. The impulse to prevent a massacre was noble, but it was speculative; the chaos was real. And the more general disorder in the region led to revolts and atrocities in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. There were, Rhodes slowly realized, events in the world beyond America\u2019s influence.By the time Bashar Assad dropped poison gas on his populace, both Obama and Rhodes were having second thoughts. Obama had established the use of chemical weapons as a \u201cred line\u201d and then chose not to respond militarily when Assad crossed it. Rhodes\u2019s description of these deliberations \u2014 and most of the other real-time crises \u2014 is particularly illuminating, given Donald Trump\u2019s subsequent missile strikes. Obama calculated that any military action that would have an actual impact on Assad\u2019s behavior might lead to a wider war. He may well have been right, but he seemed weak at the time. Trump, by contrast, seemed strong, but the effect of his strikes appears to have been negligible. In a remarkable moment, in the midst of the deliberations over what to do about Syria, Obama completes his transition to realism by telling Rhodes: \u201cMaybe we would never have done Rwanda. \u2026 You can\u2019t stop people from killing each other like that.\u201d This is the reality of \u201cThe World as It Is.\u201d Sometimes there are no good choices.Ben Rhodes is a charming and humble guide through an unprecedented presidency. He writes well, even though he has a master\u2019s degree in creative writing, and he has a good eye. He observes that the national security adviser Jim Jones \u201chad a strange habit\u201d of giving advice to Obama \u201cwhile looking at someone else in the room.\u201d He describes furniture in Cuba \u201cthat went out of style so long ago that it\u2019d be trendy in Brooklyn.\u201d And that\u2019s about as ferocious as he gets. There is no retributive backbiting of internal opponents like Hillary Clinton or Stanley McChrystal. In fact, Rhodes is far more candid about his own foibles. He drinks hard liquor, to the point of an occasional hangover. He smokes, furtively. He eats Chinese takeout, to excess. And he grows. He never quite loses his idealism; in a crass political era, he impressively avoids becoming a cynic. As a result, his achievement is rare for a political memoir: He has written a humane and honorable book.Joe Klein\u2019s books include \u201cPrimary Colors,\u201d \u201cWoody Guthrie\u201d and, most recently, \u201cCharlie Mike: A True Story of Heroes Who Brought Their Mission Home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There, an exhibition of 80 prints and other artwork by the publicity-averse street artist and prankster was being readied for a coming show.Corey Ross, the president of Starvox Entertainment in Toronto and a producer of the exhibition, \u201cThe Art of Banksy,\u201d said staff members became aware of the theft when they came in that morning.\u201cI don\u2019t know who did it or why,\u201d he said. He denied that it was a publicity stunt ahead of the exhibition\u2019s opening. All of the works are on loan from collectors who either bought them online or at a Banksy show.\u201cI\u2019ve heard the rumors it was even Banksy who did it,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cWe want the work back.

{"Headline": "When Neither Male Nor Female Seems to Fit", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWhat happens when a transgender person, who fantasizes about having an androgynous body, falls for a straight man who loves female curves?But really, I wasn\u2019t like other girls. Not even a little. When I met Charlie, things started to feel more complicated.I was assigned female at birth, but as I got older I felt less and less feminine. I am not someone who always knew I was transgender. I knew it only when the body I loved \u2014 my androgynous child\u2019s body \u2014 turned into something unmistakably female.I got breasts. And suddenly I didn\u2019t recognize myself anymore.I thought my discomfort was because of the \u201clady tax\u201d female-bodied people pay for existing in a male-dominated culture. Who would want to be a girl when girls are treated so badly? After enough discrimination or ogling or groping or degradation, anyone may get sick of looking like a woman.Nothing fit me. Clothes for women are flimsy. The shoes are uncomfortable. Women are supposed to be clean, sweet and pretty. I had all of their problems along with the weird guilt of feeling like an interloper in female spaces \u2014 fitting rooms and locker rooms. But because I had breasts, I passed.Still, I did fine with the body I had. I modeled with it, played with it, learned with it, danced with it, worked with it, had sex with it, made a baby with it and even had a brief, unhappy marriage in it.I sweated in my skin when people called me \u201cshe\u201d or complimented my feminine features. But I also learned to camouflage my body in a way that honored my identity, wearing sports bras, men\u2019s jeans, Doc Martens and my boyfriends\u2019 clothes. I made the most of being six feet tall and strong looking. It worked: If I wore men\u2019s clothes, I noticed women crossing the street to avoid me at night.I did not correct people\u2019s assumptions about my identity because it was easier for them and for me. Walking around in a female body was hard enough.I didn\u2019t even have a word for why I felt different until a few years ago when I found someone I connected with in a way that made it impossible to deny that I was just like them. They were a they (claiming \u201cthey\u201d as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun) and proud of it. They had found a solution that made sense to me. Why should I stuff myself into binary gender terms when neither male nor female seemed to fit?As I became more accepting of my trans-ness, I nudged my body in that direction too. I never wanted to be a man, and I didn\u2019t want male parts. The word \u201ctrans\u201d doesn\u2019t stand for transition or even transformation. I simply wanted my outsides to match my insides.One morning I stood in front of the mirror and pushed my breasts down, apart, flat. I imagined what I would look like with double mastectomy scars. I didn\u2019t want my breasts anymore. I had fed my son with them, supported them with countless underwire bras and used them to get attention. But I didn\u2019t like them. It seemed like they didn\u2019t even belong to me.I fantasized about top surgery. Or maybe I would get some kind of cancer that wouldn\u2019t kill me but would require removing my breasts. I clicked through galleries of post-op women who decorated their surgery scars with henna and floral tattoos. I thought, \u201cIf I get cancer, I\u2019m not saving either one.\u201dIt was the perfect solution: no breasts and no need to explain my gender expression.I had already come out to my family as bisexual, queer, maybe gay, and a person in recovery from addiction. Every couple of years, I made the phone call or sent the card informing my parents of my newly discovered identity.Their response was always the same: We love you. This doesn\u2019t change anything. We\u2019re proud of you.For this reason, I was hesitant to drop the transgender bomb on them. What more did I want? Why bother telling them yet another thing that was weird about me when it didn\u2019t affect the way they loved me?I told myself labels don\u2019t matter. I was already too complicated and had dragged my parents through enough. Of course, I was also a coward.I settled in, waiting to get cancer while I thought about things like changing my name or my pronouns. I dated, usually telling my partners that I was queer without elaborating. If my partners complimented my body, I thanked them. It was a nice body, but they may as well have been praising my VHS collection.My body was a fact about me, but it wasn\u2019t me. I hunted online for images of androgynous, gender-fluid people. They tended to be thin, wealthy looking and white, occupying the spectrum between David Bowie and Tilda Swinton (when dressed like David Bowie). Not exactly me, but closer. Looking at these pictures helped me accept my weirdness as something unique, beautiful.But Charlie was straight. He liked women in sundresses, with cleavage, in knee socks. The women he had dated all had one thing in common: curves. He was attracted to women for their femininity.During our first time in bed, I could sense how attracted he was to me, to my lovely female body. He touched me everywhere, exploring. Would he still like me if I looked the way I wanted to, the way I saw myself? I imagined coming out to him and all the things that could change.We got more serious, and one day I asked him if he would still love me if I got cancer.He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m with you, no matter what.\u201dCharlie once told me he would be attracted to me even if I were a man \u2014 that he loved everything about me, all my complexity. But then I mentioned the top surgery and his face fell. Oh. He would miss my breasts.So it became like a game of queer chicken, trying to find the balance between my identity and his sexuality. I would still be transgender even if I didn\u2019t change a single thing about myself, right? I was trans even in a miniskirt and thick eyeliner, with Jayne Mansfield cleavage. I was trans when I was giving birth and drinking my coffee. Whether or not my identity and its presentation were acceptable to my partner was another issue entirely.As time passed, I stopped wearing makeup; he didn\u2019t complain. I wore the clothes I liked, not the ones that signaled, \u201cgirl.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything. My body, he said, was what he loved because it contained me. When he touched my breasts, I wondered: Could I deny him this part of me? Even though my breasts are mine, was I willing to give up the connection they created between us?Although my hair was growing out and I knew Charlie liked it, I went to the barber and asked for a man\u2019s haircut. Not a woman\u2019s version of a man\u2019s style or a soft butch cut. A man\u2019s haircut. Afterward, covered in loose bristles, I walked out grinning.Charlie smiled when he saw me and cupped his hand around the smooth back of my head.\u201cTwo people called me \u2018sir\u2019 today,\u201d I said.\u201cHow did that make you feel?\u201d\u201cSeen,\u201d I said.A month later I went to a sex shop to pick up some new toys for us, and in the back I found a white cropped, elastic, surgical-strength chest binder; it was like an extra-tight, extra-short tube top. Once I\u2019d struggled to get the fabric around my rib cage, my breasts practically disappeared. I looked at myself sideways in the mirror: flat. I saw myself for the first time since I was very young, before puberty hijacked my body, before I knew that I would one day need a different word to describe myself.I buttoned on a man\u2019s short-sleeve shirt, and there I was. I smiled at my reflection. For the first time in decades, I felt whole.\u201cShow me,\u201d Charlie said that night.I stood in front of him wearing only my underwear and the chest binder. I didn\u2019t know where to put my hands.\u201cWalk for me.\u201dI walked, feeling my body settle into itself. My awkwardness went away, and I stretched out, flexed, showed my biceps. He smiled, taking pleasure in my happiness.\u201cHandsome,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019re handsome.\u201dI sat on the bed next to him and he hugged me, kissed me, held me. Although I wasn\u2019t naked, I felt so exposed to him. He was finally seeing me the way I saw myself. Not girly. Not making an effort to catch his eye. No long hair, breasts or makeup. Just me. I was satisfied.\u201cI like you,\u201d he said.\u201cThis me? This version?\u201d\u201cAll versions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Staying Together by Living Apart (in a Duplex)", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWe were looking at duplexes in Los Angeles and our real estate agent had brought us to a small property, two side-by-side houses on a single lot.\u201cIt\u2019s a very popular situation now,\u201d he said. \u201cLive in one and rent out the other.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing,\u201d I said. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, but he wasn\u2019t quite taking it in.My girlfriend and I were interested in the two tiny houses but they sold to a different couple, who intended to live in one and rent out the other, as the real estate agent had suggested. We, on the other hand, intended to each live in our own little place. It was a plan that seemed to make people uneasy.\u201cIs this because you\u2019re an only child?\u201d one of Sara\u2019s friends asked her.\u201cYes,\u201d she said, which was simpler than explaining all the real reasons. At the time, we were living on opposite sides of San Francisco, and the commute between our places was soul killing. Writers and teachers could still afford to live in Los Angeles, so we started planning to move there.\u201cI so look forward to living near but not with you,\u201d Sara would say. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great when we\u2019re contiguous states,\u201d I would say.My stepmother, aware of trends, told us we would be \u201cLAT,\u201d for \u201cliving apart together,\u201d referring to couples that choose to live separately \u2014 even far apart \u2014 while remaining committed.Sara disagreed. \u201cWe\u2019re living together, apart.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s the same,\u201d my stepmother said.\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite.\u201dMy vote was with Sara. One roof, two households is a unique kind of commitment.My grandparents, who were together for more than 70 years, said that love is compromise. I think my grandfather said that because he was married to the least compromising woman on earth. My mother married twice and my father four times. I joked that I didn\u2019t come from a broken home; I came from scorched earth.And I was married once. My ex and I were together for 16 years, living in the shadow of my disastrous role models. When I got divorced, I felt like a failure for not avoiding my parents\u2019 fate. I wished love involved a little less compromise.I\u2019m older than Sara, a Pilates instructor with a full back dragon tattoo. At first it was a summer romance. She was funny, kind, intuitive and ambitious, and she made me feel like I could be my best self around her. I guess I did the same for her. But that didn\u2019t translate into either of us wanting to live together. If I have a singular concern, maybe a character flaw, it\u2019s my need for autonomy, for having my own space.Sara is the same way. She liked having me visit and liked it when I left. \u201cMostly,\u201d she said one day, \u201cit\u2019s about how you leave your sponge in the sink. You know there\u2019s a basket, right?\u201dNo matter how often she pointed it out, I kept leaving that sponge in a puddle. If we lived in a duplex, she would have her sponge and sink and I\u2019d have mine.\u201cAlso,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m a bad co-sleeper.\u201dSara sleeps like a starfish. Separate beds were crucial, and separate houses around them a luxury. I lose things. A lot. When I was married, the worst emotional roller coaster was when I reached for my keys, found them missing, and knew I hadn\u2019t moved them, so whose fault was it? It could only be my wife\u2019s, I\u2019d think, my anger pungent as sulfur, only to realize moments later that I had left them somewhere else. Followed by shame that I had briefly loathed the woman I lived with for a reason that had nothing to do with her.It was a double-edged message: Maybe living alone would keep me honest, or maybe my spiky anger would accompany me wherever I went.Eventually Sara and I found a small Spanish-style duplex with a huge succulent garden and deferred maintenance. There was a truckload of debris left by a previous occupant. I hired a hauling company, and one of the guys, on perhaps his third trip up the stairs, took in that the woman downstairs was my girlfriend. \u201cYou guys live separate?\u201d he said.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAdjacent?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHe extended his hand for a fist bump. \u201cI was married once,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all right.\u201dI could not quite take it as congratulations.I read biographies of authors because I\u2019m looking to not repeat their mistakes. You won\u2019t find me shooting an apple off my spouse\u2019s head. I note that after divorce, people have habit of finding the easier route, the less challenging follow-up, a way of maintaining distance to avoid pain. Sara was raised by a single mother who, before dying young, gave her pretty unimpeachable advice: Never depend on a man. It\u2019s been said that people are motivated by love or fear. So my question for us is: Are we doing this because we love each other or because we\u2019re afraid of each other?We\u2019ve been here almost five months. It turns out that most of what we predicted has come true \u2014 we love inviting each other over and also sending each other home. There is no design committee, so Sara has decorated her place in Klimt posters and religious icons, and mine is a little neurotically done up in comic book artwork.Weirdly, I have managed to keep my sponge in check now that the security of our love no longer depends on its location.The first time I went downstairs to see her, my hand was on her doorknob before I wondered if I should knock. Yes. She tends to sing out on my back porch before turning the knob. There haven\u2019t been a lot of other negotiations.Recently I celebrated a birthday. Sara gave me flowers and dinner at Musso & Frank\u2019s. That evening, we stood outside her door and kissed good night. Not to get too revealing, but we kiss better now than when we met, in part because we\u2019re saying a small goodbye each time. Nearly every night we still prefer to sleep in our own beds.I went upstairs and attempted to sleep but popped awake with worry. Is this arrangement good or secretly a ruin? Were Sara and I guaranteed to grow apart?No problem of the heart has been solved at 3 a.m. The truth was, I loved how we lived. My anxieties were about that being taken away. I knew I was making the choice to be here out of love, not fear. But when I\u2019m in need of comfort, I need skin contact. I thought about going downstairs, which would have involved unlocking Sara\u2019s door and startling her awake.It turned out that Sara and I were sharing experiences that night, if separately. In the morning I padded downstairs and learned that she had been awake in the night, too. Anxieties. She too loved this life and worried about it. She liked having me near, but sometimes the nights were hard. She noted the weird balance between wanting to depend on someone and feeling tentative about it. \u201cYou could have come up,\u201d I said.\u201cI could have?\u201dIt seemed obvious to me: Isn\u2019t it always a pleasure to be wanted?We sat on her couch for a while, drinking coffee. We held hands. After a few minutes, I stood up to go back to my place. I didn\u2019t really want to go, but I was being polite, and didn\u2019t want to lean too hard on this new intimacy.She looked at me, half-pouting. \u201cLeaving so soon?\u201dSo I sat back down. After a moment I remembered I had photos on my phone to show her, the cat and the squirrel, close together but slightly apart \u2014 and flirting. Glen David Gold lives in Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "An L.G.B.T.Q. Guide to Traveling Safely Abroad", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy did ManAboutWorld write a safety guide?Globalization has made international travel easy and commonplace. And the globalization of travel hides a great disparity in local attitudes toward L.G.B.T.Q. people. We wrote the guide to help L.G.B.T.Q. travelers navigate a complex world of laws and risks, and understand the ways their local interactions can help and hurt local L.G.B.T.Q. communities. By including personal experiences and recommendations from L.G.B.T.Q. travelers all over the world, we are able to present more nuanced information. It\u2019s more like asking a friend than asking Google.It\u2019s more important than ever to know what\u2019s going on with the local L.G.B.T.Q. community. The laws don\u2019t reflect the reality in so many places, and the acceptance and welcome for L.G.B.T.Q. travelers are constantly changing. It\u2019s increasingly important to know where to get the most current information, how to apply that information to your itineraries and personal experience, and what travelers can do to help advance the cause of L.G.B.T.Q. people in the places they visit.How does the new guide differ from last year\u2019s first edition for business travelers? The business travel industry was often ignoring the risks of sending L.G.B.T.Q. employees and contractors into countries that criminalize them without any warning, advice or resources. We launched our L.G.B.T.Q. business travel guide to address that gap. Vacation travelers can choose their destination, but many of us choose to travel to places where we are criminalized. We wanted all L.G.B.T.Q. travelers to have access to those resources.There are specific recommendations for women, transgender and gender nonbinary travelers. These travelers face challenges specific to their gender and gender expression. We worked with experts in those communities to provide the most comprehensive and useful information.What will surprise readers?How local and personal the challenges are. We can\u2019t generalize about countries anymore. We can\u2019t generalize about L.G.B.T.Q. travelers \u2014 our safety and welcome can often be a function of our gender presentation, our visible wealth, our skin color, our accent. What might be fine in Moscow or Kuala Lumpur might not be O.K. in rural parts of Russia and Malaysia. It\u2019s complicated.Can a traveler\u2019s behavior affect local communities?Visitors travel with extraordinary privilege \u2014 especially those from wealthy Western nations. Even places hostile to L.G.B.T.Q. locals are often deferential to visitors. It\u2019s easy to forget that locals are being persecuted for things that are routinely ignored for travelers. I might think nothing of kissing a date good night in a public place, but that could cost a local their friendships, families or careers. A gay party might be raided in a place like Egypt \u2014 the foreigners are let go or at worst deported; the locals go to prison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Soothed. Trump Stirs. How 2 Presidents Have Tackled Racial Flare-Ups.", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was a time, not long ago, when the occupant of the White House held a beer summit to bring together a white police officer and the black professor he had mistakenly arrested. Another time, after the shooting death of a black teenager by a neighborhood watchman resulted in a storm of protest, that president remarked that the victim looked like he could have been his son.When it comes to race, the most jarring difference between the Trump presidency and that of Barack Obama is not necessarily the nature of the ugly incidents playing out across the country under their watch.After all, the arrests of two black men waiting at a Starbucks was preceded by Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard professor, being hauled away in handcuffs when a white neighbor thought he was breaking into his own home. The kneeling protests at N.F.L. games followed the death of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer, not to mention a string of high-profile police shootings of unarmed black men.The most striking difference between then and now is the responses of the commanders in chief, and how those reactions affect the country\u2019s long-simmering racial tensions.His predecessor, Mr. Obama, sought out a language on race that was heavy on balm. When Mr. Obama eulogized black parishioners murdered by a white supremacist at Emanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston, S.C., he famously sang \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201dStill, some people, mostly white, accused him of dividing the country when he spoke empathetically about the racism faced by black Americans.\u201cI think that sense that there\u2019s no leadership, there\u2019s no one sort of guiding Americans to question and to think about all of these tragedies that are occurring right now, makes it all the more anxiety provoking,\u201d said Allyson Hobbs, a professor of history who is director of African and African-American studies at Stanford University.But Mr. Obama was not without his own challenges when it came to leading the country\u2019s racial discourse.When he attempted in 2009 to be critical of the white police officer who had arrested Mr. Gates, saying that the officer had \u201cacted stupidly,\u201d he stirred the ire of police and conservative groups. And even in trying to backtrack and ease the flames, Mr. Obama invited more criticism, this time from African-Americans, who believed he was being too deferential.In speaking on highly charged racial incidents, Mr. Trump often equivocates, which observers say leaves the rest of the country fighting in circles about race. People often debate whether what the president did or did not say was a sign that he was racist. The question then turns to whether that makes his supporters racist, and they in turn push back, accusing their critics of fanning racial tensions that do not exist.Mr. Trump\u2019s most highly criticized response to a racial incident came in August, after white nationalists paraded and demonstrated in Charlottesville, Va., where they were met by counterprotesters. Mr. Trump assigned blame for the ensuing violence to both groups and spoke of \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201dIn other cases, he has ignored or rejected the racial tensions at the core of some high-profile, combustible public issues.Mr. Trump manages to deftly turn racial issues into left-right political fights that are race neutral, said Ernest Lyles, a black private equity partner who lives in New York. In the case of Ms. Barr\u2019s comments, for instance, Mr. Lyles said the president turned what was simply an issue of someone making a racist comment into a battle between a liberal television network doing wrong to a Republican like him.And Mr. Lyles, 39, said he found that unfortunate because he believed that Mr. Trump could actually do more to heal the country\u2019s racial divide than Mr. Obama, because the people who listen to Mr. Trump are less savvy on racial issues.\u201cUnfortunately, for better or worse, America is trained to be more open, and more conditioned to be led by, a white male than someone who isn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Lyles said.Despite the concerns that Mr. Trump has helped fuel the country\u2019s sometimes toxic racial climate, recent events demonstrate that there are still consequences for racial discrimination, and racist acts.For some observers, the chain\u2019s response, however self-serving, demonstrated the growing power of the minority consumer, a power that retail and entertainment companies are particularly attuned to in a country whose population is expected to be less than 50 percent non-Hispanic white by 2045.\u201cAs black income has risen \u2014 as desegregation has marched forward, and as corporations realize the extent to which black dollars are an integral part of their bottom line \u2014 we see a kind of enlightened self-interest in the American corporate and business sectors,\u201d said Lolis Eric Elie, an African-American writer who has worked on several television shows, including \u201cTreme.\u201dThe store closings came on the same day that ABC Entertainment, the network that broadcast the hit reboot of Ms. Barr\u2019s sitcom, \u201cRoseanne,\u201d announced it was canceling the show, which had been seen as an explicit outreach by a mainstream media company to Trump voters.Advertisement"}

They lost 24 games during the regular season. Rather than chase records, they endured injuries and bouts of complacency. Their path to the N.B.A. finals was more Appalachian Trail than autobahn. It took work, which might sound ridiculous, given their lavish roster.But hours before his team\u2019s latest coronation was complete, Coach Steve Kerr reflected on the finals in 2015, back when the run started, back when it was fresh and new.\u201cIt just seemed chaotic,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything seemed so up and down. Now, it seems more businesslike. We\u2019re more poised.\u201dOnly the result was the same. For the third time in four seasons, and for the second year in a row, the Warriors are N.B.A. champions. They demolished the Cleveland Cavaliers, 108-85, on Friday night at Quicken Loans Arena to complete a four-game sweep, thwarting every challenge that LeBron James \u2014 their most familiar, most gifted adversary \u2014 could muster.Stephen Curry led Golden State with 37 points, and Kevin Durant had a triple-double: 20 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists.\u201cTo win in a sweep feels pretty good,\u201d said Durant, who was named the M.V.P. of the finals for the second straight year.The Warriors, as they are known to do, found separation in the third quarter. Klay Thompson made a 3-pointer to push their lead to 17, and a sense of doom settled over the building. There were even some boos.

James fist-bumped several of the Warriors as he checked out of the game to a standing ovation.James finished with 23 points, 8 assists and 7 rebounds in what could have been his final game with the Cavaliers. He can become a free agent this summer, and his future is uncertain.\u201cProbably one of the greatest playoff runs we\u2019ve ever seen from an individual,\u201d the Cavaliers\u2019 coach, Tyronn Lue, said. \u201cSometimes you can give everything you got and still come up short.\u201dAfter Friday\u2019s game, James disclosed that he had seriously injured his right hand in a fit of frustration after the Cavaliers lost Game 1.\u201cPretty much played the last three games with a broken hand,\u201d said James, who wore a brace on the hand at his news conference.Game 1 was the one in which J.R. Smith dribbled the wrong way in the closing seconds of regulation. It was an all-time playoff blunder. The Cavaliers could have won with a shot then. Instead, they lost in overtime. And James was furious about the blown opportunity.\u201cVery emotional,\u201d he said, \u201cfor a lot of different reasons: understanding how important a Game 1 is on the road for our ball club, what that would have done for us, the way we played, the calls that were made throughout the course of that game. I had emotions that the game was taken away from us.\u201dAsked whether he had played his last game with the Cavaliers, James said, \u201cI have no idea at this point.\u201dBut as he weighs the possibilities, he will surely reflect on the Warriors \u2014 an All-Star collective that has reshaped the league. \u201cWe want to keep this thing going as long as we can,\u201d Curry said.Teams need multiple stars to win a title against them. Not even a generational talent like James, operating at the peak of his powers, can do it alone. Before the series was even over, James spoke plainly about the gulf that separated the two teams.\u201cObviously,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom a talent perspective, if you\u2019re looking at Golden State, from their top five best players to our top five players, you would say they\u2019re stacked better than us.\u201dIt was an obvious point \u2014 who would disagree? \u2014 and an especially candid one given that the Cavaliers were still alive. The odds of James\u2019s engineering a comeback, of course, were long. No team in N.B.A. postseason history had ever overcome a series deficit of three games to none.If nothing else, the Warriors rediscovered their familiar rhythm at the right time. They had an uneven regular season, losing 10 of their last 17 regular-season games. Kerr said he was concerned about whether his players would be able to \u201cturn it up\u201d once the playoffs started.\u201cExtremely difficult,\u201d Green said. \u201cNot just the playoff run \u2014 this entire season, you\u2019re coming off a championship and you\u2019re expected to get back to that level for Game 1 of 82.\u201dBut Golden State was seriously challenged only once in this postseason \u2014 by the Houston Rockets, who took the Western Conference finals to their seven-game limit. The Rockets, who had the league\u2019s best record, even had home-court advantage for the final game of the series. But Chris Paul, their point guard, was sidelined with an injury, and the Warriors advanced.On Friday, the Warriors showcased their firepower. In the first quarter, three players made 3-pointers in a span of 43 seconds. The Cavaliers could never match that sort of versatility.\u201cThe bottom line is, we\u2019ve got a lot of talent,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd we had more talent than they did, and talent wins in this league.\u201dIt was appropriate that James had to face the Warriors at the very end, doing so for the fourth straight season. But this series had a different feel to it, which had a lot to do with one player who was absent: Kyrie Irving, the All-Star point guard whom the Cavaliers shipped to the Boston Celtics last summer after he demanded a trade.Irving played a huge role for the Cavaliers in 2015-16, when they stunned the Warriors to win the franchise\u2019s only championship. For the following season, Golden State signed Durant as a free agent.Partly because of Irving\u2019s absence, and partly because of Durant\u2019s presence, this latest (and perhaps last) act of Warriors-Cavaliers did not provide much drama.That the Cavaliers even managed to make the series competitive at junctures \u2014 they had opportunities in Game 3, but lost because Durant did a bunch of Durant things down the stretch \u2014 was due almost solely to James\u2019s extraterrestrial abilities.Over the four games, he averaged 34.0 points, 10.0 assists and 8.5 rebounds while shooting 52.7 percent from the field. He threw a pass to himself off the backboard for a dunk. He resisted the urge to transport Smith to a distant galaxy. He gave people what they had to come to see.\u201cHe literally does everything out there,\u201d Thompson said.But still, it was not enough \u2014 not against the Warriors, who found strength in numbers again.Here\u2019s how the Warriors won Game 4, from Benjamin Hoffman in New York and Marc Stein in Cleveland:Coming out of a timeout, the Warriors were at it again, moving the ball around until Draymond Green had a clear path to the basket for two easy points. An assist on the play gave Kevin Durant a triple-double in the game, as he\u2019s up to 18 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Stephen Curry, Durant\u2019s co-favorite for Finals M.V.P., came through on Golden State\u2019s next possession with yet another 3-pointer. While LeBron James continued to fight all game, he was removed with 4:03 left in the game with 23 points, 8 assists and 6 rebounds. He simply got no help tonight and the horrible effort from the entirety of Cleveland\u2019s roster has to weigh heavily on the Cavaliers\u2019 chances of bringing James back next year.LeBron James was on the bench to start the fourth quarter and Cleveland got an immediate layup from Rodney Hood. Unfortunately for the Cavs, Stephen Curry is determined to short-circuit any momentum they are able to generate. He answered a 3-pointer by George Hill with one of his own, and then hit all three free-throws when he was fouled shooting another 3, pushing his game total to 34 points. The arena in Cleveland is eerily quiet, even with James back in the game, and beyond some fight from Larry Nance, the Cavs aren\u2019t doing much to get them back into things.In an absolutely horrific sequence by the Cavaliers defense, the Warriors kept missing but Cleveland showed no effort at all to get a rebound, looking like a completely broken team being thoroughly outplayed by the rookie Jordan Bell. The series of bad plays finally ended when Klay Thompson hit a 3-pointer.On offense it wasn\u2019t much better for the Cavs, with Rodney Hood getting stripped and Larry Nance taking a bad jumper before a pair of free-throws by Shaun Livingston pushed Golden State\u2019s lead to 21 points.The third quarter ended with a Kevin Durant miss and the Warriors having raced to a 25-13 advantage in their favorite period. This series is over and the only debate left is whether Stephen Curry has done enough to overtake Durant for Finals M.V.P.Everything is going the Warriors\u2019 way on both ends.Kevin Durant hit a jumper coming out of the timeout to push the lead back to 13. LeBron James and Stephen Curry traded missed 3-pointers, but then following a Curry steal, the Warriors picked up a point after a technical foul call on J.R. Smith, who knocked the ball away after a call.Cleveland couldn\u2019t capitalize on their end and Durant found Klay Thompson for a wide-open 3-pointer that grew the lead to 17. Jeff Green finally got Cleveland on the board with a layup, but Curry drove to the hoop for one of his own.Curry is up to 25 points and four assists and his stellar play has been the difference between a close Game 3 and a Game 4 that has teetered on edge of a blowout.Coming out of the timeout, in which an agitated LeBron James was clearly challenging his teammates to show more effort, a determined James did the hard work himself, forcing his way to the basket and drawing a foul. After a missed 3-pointer by Stephen Curry, the Cavs got two more points on a put-back by Kevin Love but Kevin Durant answered with an off-balance midrange jumper over George Hill.A James feed to a driving Kevin Love resulted in another two points for the power forward \u2014 who is up to 13 \u2014 and cut the deficit to 11, forcing Steve Kerr to call a timeout of his own.Cleveland couldn\u2019t score on the opening possession of the second half and then after the Cavaliers twice kept Golden State\u2019s offensive possession going with fouls, Klay Thompson hit a floater in the paint for his first two points of the game.A steal from Draymond Green led to the versatile big man being fouled to prevent an easy dunk, but that didn\u2019t matter as Stephen Curry hit a long 2-pointer to push the Warriors\u2019 lead to 13 points and then it pushed to 15 when a Curry miss turned into an improbably put-back by JaVale McGee who fought for the ball inside with Tristan Thompson.The 6-0 run to start the quarter forced Ty Lue to call a timeout. The Cavs came out of halftime looking terrible on both ends while piling up three fouls in less than two minutes on the court.Stephen Curry is making up for his awful Game 3 in a huge way. He hit a deep 3-pointer with 5 seconds left in the first half to stretch Golden State\u2019s lead to nine points and he has his team in great position to secure the first sweep in the N.B.A. finals since 2007.It was a series of runs for both teams in the first half, with solid adjustments from both coaches pushing their teams in spurts only to fall back a bit. Golden State\u2019s hot start from 3-point range largely faded, but with Cleveland still struggling from the field (39.1 percent) the Warriors were able to maintain their lead by just taking what was given to them on offense and playing hard on defense, with big contributions from JaVale McGee, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala.Curry leads all scorers with 20 points, and is 4 of 6 from 3-point range, and LeBron James is leading the Cavaliers with 16 points and five assists.The biggest knock on Golden State has been Klay Thompson\u2019s foul trouble, which has led to several possessions in which Curry has ended up having to guard James, but with the Warriors just about to enter their favorite quarter, a nine-point lead is a huge advantage.\u201cIt felt like a JaVale series \u2014 which was the case with our opening-round matchup with San Antonio but not so much with New Orleans and Houston,\u201d Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said before the game. \u201cIt\u2019s just a feel for personnel and how we\u2019re going to be guarded.\u201dMcGee was +17 in the first half in 11 minutes. He leads the Warriors in that category in the first half.Jordan Bell scored twice inside and Draymond Green played some terrific defense, but after Stephen Curry couldn\u2019t get a shot off before the shot-clock expired, Andre Iguodala got the ball back with a savvy defensive play in which he exaggerated contact with LeBron James. He then hit a 3-pointer on the other end, showing the full skill set that the team was so clearly missing in the Western Conference finals.A Curry layup was answered by a J.R. Smith 3-pointer, and then after a Curry miss, an Iguodala foul off the ball gave James a pair of free-throws, one of which he made.Stephen Curry hit a contested 3-pointer from deep, and even though Cleveland is repeatedly getting to the line, they are falling behind again, down five with 2:50 to play in the half.During this season\u2019s playoffs, James has accounted for nearly a third of his team\u2019s box-score statistics.Jeff Green started the second quarter with a 3-pointer and after a miss by Stephen Curry, the Cavs got a great hustle play from Larry Nance who followed LeBron James to the hoop and picked up James\u2019s missed layup for an easy basket.Draymond Green scored easily inside but after wasted possessions by both teams, James powered his way to the basket through Curry and not only made the short shot but got a free-throw courtesy of a David West foul.West made up for the foul on the other end with a nice left-handed put-in off an assist from Curry but a few possessions later Nance blew past the entire Warriors defense from a big dunk.Golden State\u2019s shooters had gone largely cold and Cleveland had continued to press inside, narrowing the deficit to three. Then they took over with two free-throws by Kyle Korver \u2014 courtesy of Klay Thompson\u2019s third foul \u2014 and a big dunk from LeBron James. The 14-4 run to start the second has given them a one-point lead, and Cleveland took a timeout to see if they can further capitalize on this momentum.The Cavaliers once again got the game within four points thanks to some hustle plays from LeBron James and J.R. Smith and another 3-pointer from Kevin Love.With Stephen Curry and Draymond Green sitting down for a rest at that point, and with Klay Thompson already on the bench with foul trouble, the hopes of a Cleveland run took a bit of a hit when Nick Young, perhaps Golden State\u2019s worst player in these finals, hit a wide-open 3-pointer. A midrange jumper by Kevin Durant, some terrific defense by Shaun Livingston and another 3-pointer by Andre Iguodala and Golden State\u2019s lead was back to 11.In the final minute of the quarter, there was a flurry of activity on both ends, but the only score came on a tough layup from LeBron James, which left Cleveland down nine going into the second.Cleveland didn\u2019t let a few big runs from Golden State push them completely out of the game, but with the Warriors\u2019 shooters appearing to have cured their woes, the early-going of this game heavily favors the series ending tonight. For that to not happen, James is going to need to show way more offense and he needs to do it quickly.After the timeout, Andre Iguodala got the Warriors going again with a wide-open corner 3-pointer. Golden State then got 3-pointers from Stephen Curry and Draymond Green as well, taking advantage of any open shots they can find (Curry created his himself by just stopping in transition to shoot) and when a Kevin Durant dunk pushed the Warriors\u2019 lead back to 24-13, Tyronn Lue again called a timeout.Considering Golden State\u2019s poor shooting in Game 3, they were no lock to focus on the deep ball in Game 4, but they appear to have retained their confidence in their shooters. And if Cleveland is going to leave Iguodala and Green open all game, those veterans will take advantage of the situation.Another block from Kevin Durant helped set the defensive tone and then Stephen Curry hit a ridiculous circus 3-pointer in which he seemed to be looking for contact more than he was looking for a basket (but he got the basket anyway). Tristan Thompson broke the Cavs\u2019 scoring drought with a tip-in, and after Klay Thompson picked up his second foul of the game with a charge on J.R. Smith, the Warriors brought in Andre Iguodala.A one-shot technical for Kevin Love courtesy of a defensive 3-second violation got the Cavs to six points and then LeBron James floated a short jumper over JaVale McGee for his first points of the game. A 3-pointer by Kevin Love had brought the Cavs all the way back to a two-point deficit and that forced Steve Kerr to call a timeout to try to figure out where his team\u2019s hot start went.Kevin Durant is off to another good start, sinking an 11-footer on one end and blocking a shot on the other. Some solid work inside by JaVale McGee and Stephen Curry helped get Golden State off to a 10-3 lead, which forced Tyronn Lue to call a timeout to get the Cavs reset. In last year\u2019s Game 4, the Cavs rode an explosive first quarter to a dominant win, but thus far they have looked tentative on offense and J.R. Smith\u2019s 3-pointer is their only make of the game.After winning the tip, the Warriors went into a half-court offense and, following a miss by JaVale McGee, they took an early two-point lead with a put-back from Stephen Curry. Misses by both teams set up an open 3-pointer for J.R. Smith and he found the net in what the Cavs have to be hoping is a big game for the struggling shooting guard.Benjamin Hoffman and Marc Stein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Snapchat Makes Mini Movies in Augmented Reality", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA.R. may change entertainment as we know it. For Snapchat, the revolution starts with 15-second cartoons.LOS ANGELES \u2014 On a cool, sunny day in April, a short Frisbee toss from Venice Beach, a team of seven animators sat around a conference table, workshopping a storyboard from an unusual cartoon series. In the storyboard \u2014 rudimentary, comic-striplike panels tracing the arc of a scene \u2014 a barefoot man in rolled-up jeans stands at the edge of a bed of flaming hot coals. The man gathers his nerve, walks across the coals without incident and does a little celebratory dance. But his celebration is premature; in a plot twist in the final frame, his feet burst into flames.Some of the notes in the room weren\u2019t far from what you\u2019d expect in any introductory art class. But other feedback was more peculiar. In lieu of a setting for the story, the animators discussed only how they could \u201cindicate an environment,\u201d perhaps using sand or grass. Later, there was a curious debate about whether or not the character \u2014 otherwise recognizable as a human male \u2014 had any toes. Everyone agreed that they didn\u2019t know for certain. The equivalent of blockbusters, which will rely on special headsets like Magic Leap\u2019s Lightwear and Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens, are in development. And Facebook (which owns the virtual reality company Oculus), Apple and Google have all moved in the last year to make it easier for third-party developers to create new kinds of A.R. experiences for mobile phones. In late 2016, the Libermans\u2019 unique background caught the attention of executives at Snap, which, one year earlier, had demonstrated A.R.\u2019s potential as a creative platform with the rollout of animated overlays on selfies. The company jointly hired the foursome to develop animated A.R. characters based on Bitmoji. \u201cThey\u2019d been there and done that,\u201d said Eitan Pilipski, vice president of camera platform at Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company. \u201cThere was an amazing opportunity to take their creative thinking and put it in the hands of our users.\u201dSharing an office with three of your siblings could be a recipe for disaster, but it seems to have the opposite effect on the Libermans. In Venice Beach, they were like different limbs of the same chestnut-haired, fair-skinned organism, finishing one another\u2019s sentences when not cracking up at inside jokes. The Libermans shared a house for a time when they moved to Los Angeles, too, then spread out to their current arrangement in three apartments on the same street. \u201cBefore college we were together constantly, and afterward it\u2019s been the same,\u201d said David, technology lead, 34.\u201cIt has the feel of being a little under the radar but on the cutting edge,\u201d she said. She also pinpointed something else that might explain Snapchat\u2019s appeal. \u201cA Pixar movie takes five years to make,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an artist, that\u2019s two films in a decade, whereas at a place like Snapchat you can create a lot more volume.\u201dEach of the Libermans handles different responsibilities, which Anna, production lead, 36, said were based on their individual personalities: \u201cDaniil is very creative and helps us to write jokes. Maria is verbal and good at understanding story structure. I\u2019m very good at talking to people and getting them committed to specific dates and times. And David is very technical and has a strong engineering background.\u201dIn the animation stage, the animators aim to \u201csell\u201d the idea of the story, which should be easily \u201cread\u201d by the viewer without the benefit of dialogue (recording multiple languages and voice styles would be too resource intensive). The animators often film themselves role-playing as the character, or pull reference videos from YouTube, in order to realistically portray body movement.Because 3D Bitmoji episodes are designed to be sent between friends, they aren\u2019t just entertainment \u2014 they\u2019re custom memes, conveying the sender\u2019s mood or status. The most successful tend to be those that capture a common experience or sentiment, sometimes indirectly. Anna described \u201cHot Coals\u201d as a universal story about facing your fears, leavened with the twist at the end (what Snap\u2019s animators call a \u201cbonus\u201d) when the character catches fire. That made Maria recall a sort of spiritual precursor, an earlier animation involving a pregnant pause at the top of a diving board. One user\u2019s caption: \u201cMe getting into a new relationship.\u201dWhen the technology is sufficiently mature, experts expect that most forms of entertainment will be reimagined for augmented reality. Mr. Lelyveld, of the Entertainment Technology Center, predicted a surge in sophisticated narrative A.R. experiences in 18 to 24 months, when glasses allowing users to circumnavigate fixed virtual objects in physical space are projected to be widely available. Hands-free A.R. (which may one day rely on contact lenses or cortical implants) could unleash the potential for stories that blur the line between fiction and lived experience. They may share elements with linear film and television, or task-oriented video games. \u201cYou could be watching a sitcom like \u2018Friends,\u2019 but instead of the \u2018Friends\u2019 kitchen table, the characters are all sitting around your kitchen table,\u201d Ms. Burnett said. But the medium\u2019s capacity for contextual awareness allows for hybrid forms unlike any that exist today.Experts cautioned that it was still too soon to say what shape they may ultimately take. \u201cOur language has always been 2D, and if your language can\u2019t express it, you can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d Mr. Lelyveld said. But Hollywood studios are already girding themselves for the new reality. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer science fiction,\u201d said Ms. Papagiannis, the A.R. researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dAfter making it through the gantlet of animation review, \u201cHot Coals\u201d was ready for the final stage of its production cycle before testing and publication: visual effects. The Libermans\u2019 VFX artists added dancing flames, floating embers and, for the climactic moment when the character catches fire, pillars of white smoke. \u201cThe characters are very cartoony, but because they inhabit a real-world environment, atmospheric elements need to be quite realistic in order to bridge the gap,\u201d Anna said.While Mr. Pilipski declined to outline the course of that journey, Snapchat recently rolled out an in-app product, called Snappables, which allows users to play simple A.R. games (How many digital strawberries can you catch in your mouth in 10 seconds?) and invite friends to join. The company also makes sunglasses with embedded cameras, called Spectacles, though they\u2019re not currently A.R. capable.One path Snap isn\u2019t likely to pursue is making 3D Bitmoji more closely resemble their flesh-and-blood analogues. Asked if the company would pivot to lifelike virtual avatars as technology advances, the Bitstrips chief executive, Ba Blackstock, a former cartoonist who joined Snap after the acquisition, balked.All animations courtesy of Snapchat.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the author of \u201cAugmented Human.\" She is Helen Papagiannis, not Pappagiannis.Advertisement"}

It feels like a lifetime ago now. We would go dancing at clubs \u2014 those disco nights \u2014 and then, as a new day dawned, lace up our boots and roll into Central Park. We had the place to ourselves, though getting any speed was tricky since the roads were pocked and potted. On all sides, the lawns were filthy and tattered. But as I looped through it, I fell in love with Central Park.by Keith Hernandezby Susan Jacobyby John Branchby Howard Bryantby Amy Essingtonby Laurent DuboisThis season\u2019s batch features a rakish first baseman, Albert Camus the brooding goalkeeper and a bucking bronc named Lunatic From Hell.Keith Hernandez doesn\u2019t like baseball memoirs. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019ve become a paint-by-numbers exercise,\u201d the former first baseman laments at the outset of his own entry in the genre. He\u2019s confident you know about the time the 1986 Mets won the World Series. He doesn\u2019t want to trot out the old war stories.What he offers instead is an impressionistic account of his baseball boyhood, a kind of \u201cRemembrance of At-Bats Past,\u201d complete with a baked good to set the memories in motion. When Hernandez was growing up in Pacifica, Calif., his father worked as a fireman. After an overnight shift, he would bring home fresh sourdough bread from a bakery in San Francisco. It was \u201csoft on the inside with a crust that made your teeth work just the right amount.\u201d Hernandez aspires for his book to be like that bread: \u201cSomething that you set your teeth into and say, \u2018Keith, that\u2019s pretty good.

While that could be the case for some of Facebook\u2019s patents, many of them imagine new ways to collect, analyze and use personal information and package it for advertisers \u2014 a process that is essential to the company\u2019s business model. In the first quarter of 2018, almost 99 percent of Facebook\u2019s revenue came from advertising.As long as Facebook keeps collecting personal information, we should be wary that it could be used for purposes more insidious than targeted advertising, including swaying elections or manipulating users\u2019 emotions, said Jennifer King, the director of consumer privacy at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School. \u201cThere could be real consequences,\u201d she said.But with more than two billion monthly active users, most of whom share their thoughts and feelings on the platform, Facebook is amassing our personal details on an unprecedented scale. That isn\u2019t likely to change, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia. \u201cI\u2019ve seen no indication that Facebook has changed its commitment to watch everything we do, record everything we do and exploit everything we do,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Dangerous \u2018Bigness\u2019 of the AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust and telecommunications.When Congress enacted the Anti-Merger Act of 1950, the law by which American courts still adjudge corporate mergers, it did so with the repeatedly stated goal of fighting excessive economic concentration. The \u201cdominant\u201d concern, as the Supreme Court wrote in a 1962 merger case that analyzed the law, was about \u201ca rising tide of economic concentration in the American economy.\u201d At the time, the court explained, a wave of corporate consolidation posed the threat of an \u201caccelerated concentration of economic power\u201d and also a \u201cthreat to other values,\u201d like the independence of smaller businesses and local control of industry. In particular Congress had said it intended the new law to stop a wave of mergers in its \u201cincipiency.\u201dJudge Leon\u2019s decision shows just how far the law has wandered from congressional intent. The law has become a license for near-uncontrolled consolidation and concentration in almost every sector of economy. Whether involving airlines, hospitals, the pharmaceutical industry, cable television or the major tech platforms, mergers leading to oligopolies or monopolies have become commonplace.Reading Judge Leon\u2019s opinion makes it clear how this has happened. The decision barely touches on Congress\u2019s concerns about excessive concentration of economic power or other guiding principles or values. Instead, the opinion is mostly a tedious dissection of whether customers might end up paying an extra 45 cents per month for pay-TV service. How did a battle over 45 cents become how we decide the future of the media industries? Yes, higher prices for consumers are a bad thing, but they are not the only thing, and certainly not what Congress cared most about. In fact, the law itself doesn\u2019t even mention prices: It instructs courts to bar mergers when the effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\u201dThe case could have centered on what Congress really cared about: competition, concentration and the direction of the industry. On its face, despite being a \u201cvertical\u201d merger between two companies at different levels in the supply chain, the marriage of such large and powerful players in the media industry looks anything but harmless. One of AT&T\u2019s defenses of the merger was that it wanted to take on internet companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix. But was that really a creditable goal of this deal? Was there good evidence of an effort to prevent new business models from taking flight? And what about the risk of setting off a wave of consolidations, leaving a fully integrated industry immune to new competition?These kinds of considerations would have yielded the question Congress wanted answered: Was the likely effect of the merger to diminish the level of competition in the media industries? Yet in vain pursuit of numerical certainty about the monthly cost of pay-TV service, the ruling never really came to address this broader question.What Congress cared about in 1950 is even more important today. The public cares about the aggregation of wealth in the top echelons, the suppression of wages and the shrinking of the middle class, all of which are linked to industry concentration. That\u2019s why Congress, in the wake of repeated affirmations that the anti-merger laws no longer work, needs to act. It should reassert that Congress in 1950 really did intend to preserve a competitive economy \u2014 one that is free, if possible, from what the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201dTim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Proposed targets from the European Commission, for example, sharply reduce the average allowed level of carbon emissions for cars and trucks in the region.\u201cWe see evolving needs of customers globally, and those needs are in the areas of connected services and powertrain choices,\u201d said Michael Baumann, a spokesman for Ford in Europe, referring to cars\u2019 energy sources.

{"Headline": "11 Ways to Save Money When Booking Travel", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooking flights, rental cars and hotels can add up quickly, but with a few simple tips you can save big when booking your next vacation. We asked a few travel experts how to travel luxuriously on the cheap.Earlier this year, Brian Kelly flew Singapore Airlines\u2019 new first-class suite on its A380 airbus, taking off with a glass of Dom P\u00e9rignon and 50 square feet of legroom. The market rate for his flight from Sydney to Singapore was over $3,000. Mr. Kelly\u2019s cost?\u201c150,000 points and $72,\u201d he said. \u201cSo while not the best redemption in terms of the value I got per point, the flight itself was one of my most memorable ever. It actually has both a seat and a bed.\u201dBlogs and online forums refer to it as travel hacking, stacking, or credit card churning, but the idea is the same: sign up for credit cards with big bonuses and cash back programs to earn points redeemable for free travel. That said, if you use them responsibly, credit card rewards can be, well, rewarding. \u201cDo your research before signing up for a card to make sure you\u2019re getting one that makes sense for you,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. If you dine out frequently, for example, you might want a card that comes with a higher cash back rewards for restaurant spending. Other cards reward you more for spending on travel or gas or groceries.For the same reason, flights are usually cheaper on holidays, but significantly more expensive on the days before and after the holiday. You can save a considerable amount of cash flying on Thanksgiving, for example, instead of the Tuesday before. Of course, the downside is that you will have to travel on a holiday, but the upside is beating the crowds.On the other hand, airline fare pricing is a science that can be tough to predict, said Mr. Kelly. \u201cBetween availability, airline revenue managers, when you\u2019re traveling and more, there are so many moving parts to airfare that you can\u2019t really focus on one too much.\u201d This might also come in handy if you need to cancel just one leg of your flight. For example, if you\u2019re flying to London, but your departure date changes, it may be cheaper to pay a cancel fee for your one-way departing ticket than to cancel and rebook your entire round-trip flight. Of course, this also depends on how the airline handles flight changes. Also, if you end up extending your trip to stay in your destination city longer, it may be easier to make a change when you book separate tickets.It may also be cheaper to fly into or out of an alternative airport. If you\u2019re flying into Los Angeles, for example, don\u2019t limit your search to LAX. Search for flights to and from surrounding airports, like Burbank. Just make sure they\u2019re not too far out of the way of your destination, otherwise you could find yourself on a mini road-trip from the airport to your hotel. Some overseas airlines list cheaper flight prices if you use their country\u2019s version of the website. \u201cParticularly, Norwegian Air is famous for offering discounts as high as 30 percent when you book through the foreign version of its website,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cIf you\u2019re booking a one-way flight from Oslo to New York, you can often find get major discounts by selecting Norway as your home country rather than the U.S.\u201dYou may have to ask Google to translate your page, but if you can navigate the website and book your ticket, this is a relatively easy way to save. Layovers will often make your flight cheaper, but the downside is, well, a layover. One way to use this to your advantage is to turn a longer layover into a bonus trip. For example, if you\u2019re flying to London and flights with layovers in Dublin are cheaper, search for the flights with the longest layovers to see if the prices are similar. If you have a 14-hour layover in Dublin, that could be enough time to grab a hotel, head to Temple Bar and return to the airport in the morning.Flight prices are cheaper than ever \u2026 sort of.For example, Mr. Kelly said that some hotels offer best price guarantees, so if you find a cheaper price than the one the hotel advertises on their own website, they will match it. More properties are willing to do this, Mr. Barba said, so it can\u2019t hurt to call and at least ask. \u201cAt other hotels, I\u2019ve seen a stigma associated with guests that booked with an online agency,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t get the same attention and may even get assigned to their \u2018last sell\u2019 room types.\u201d As you can imagine, these are less desirable rooms, usually smaller, near an elevator or without a view. On a more encouraging note, Mr. Barba said an added bonus of booking directly through the hotel is that it\u2019s easier to get upgraded. \u201cYou can increase your chance of an upgrade by informing the front desk of a special occasion, anniversary or birthday,\u201d he said. Of course, a little politeness toward the front desk staff will go a long way, too, and Mr. Barba suggested never asking for an upgrade outright. Car rental insurance can jack up your bill quite a bit, and the good news is, your existing car insurance policy might come with some form of coverage for rentals. While there are exclusions, chances are, your credit card probably comes with a policy that can make up for anything your personal auto insurance doesn\u2019t cover. Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve compiled some of the highlights of our extensive coverage below. I\u2019ve also been thinking, as I imagine you have, about what issues the controversy raises for Canada.But many people in the immigration world say that at least one key part of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s policy is indefensible in light of Mr. Trump\u2019s southern border crackdown: how it limits the ability of asylum seekers to get in.\u201cCanada looks better with how it treats asylum seekers after they arrive,\u201d Audrey Macklin, a chair in human rights law and a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s law school, told me this week. \u201cBut Canada is harsher and more effective at preventing asylum seekers from arriving.\u201dCanada\u2019s location isolates it from countries where refugees are fleeing on foot or by boat, making such control easier.But it won\u2019t budge on what Professor Macklin and others call the bigger issue: the \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement with the United States.Professor Macklin and others have long rejected the idea that the United States is a safe place to seek asylum. The current border turmoil, she said, has only reinforced that view.Mr. Trudeau said this week that he had no plans to end the agreement, without offering much in the way of a defense of it.Professor Macklin, meanwhile, has a more provocative proposal for killing the agreement. \u201cIf Donald Trump understood what the first safe country agreement does,\u201d she said \u2014 meaning that it pushes immigrants back to the United States \u2014 \u201che would have been the first to suspend it.\u201dNow, a shameless sales pitch for an amazing deal.

But tech companies \u2014 Uber comes to mind \u2014 often scoff at local laws. And it\u2019s not just Google that\u2019s trying to reshape cities.

Raya first appeared several years ago as a dating app aimed at people in creative industries. It has expanded into an invitation-only social network populated by movie stars, fashion designers, pro athletes, tech executives and too many Instagram models to count. \u201cIt\u2019s the Soho House of dating apps,\u201d said Hayley Greenberg, 27, a social media manager in Los Angeles who joined Raya in 2016 and used it for several months. \u201cThey have the really good-looking guys, the athletes, the actors, the guys that have like 500 followers on Instagram but got accepted because they\u2019re a D.J.\u201d On Raya, Ms. Greenberg said, \u201ceveryone\u2019s someone.\u201dThe app costs $7.99 a month, but joining is no small ordeal. Prospective members are evaluated by an algorithm and human gatekeepers, who consider factors like the size of an applicant\u2019s Instagram following, how many Raya members he or she knows and other, less quantifiable attributes. About 8 percent of applicants are accepted, making Raya a slightly harder nut to crack than Harvard Business School.Its website contains no mention of investors, founders or staff members, and the company has never spoken about its origins. For years, members have speculated about who was behind it. A Hollywood superagent? A lonely tech billionaire?The man said that telling Raya\u2019s story would be cathartic, and that it was time to set the record straight on what the app was really about \u2014 what kinds of people it was meant to bring together.Daniel Gendelman, 34, is handsome and thinly bearded. He wore a white T-shirt and ordered plain oatmeal when I met him recently in a Venice Beach restaurant. Mr. Gendelman had hung around the creative upper crust and he knew that online dating didn\u2019t work for everyone. Celebrities avoided it out of embarrassment. Artists and musicians didn\u2019t necessarily want to be on a platform that lumped them in with bankers and lawyers. Instead, Mr. Gendelman thought, what if there were an app that felt more like a dinner party \u2014 an intimate, thoroughly vetted collection of interesting people having candid conversations? He put together a small team and began to build. He called the app Raya, after the Hebrew word for friend, and seeded it with a group of his friends in Los Angeles.\u201cI tried to solve a big problem for a small amount of people,\u201d Mr. Gendelman said.Raya went live in February 2015 and took off quickly, boosted by an early user base that reportedly included the actresses Raven-Symon\u00e9 and Kelly Osbourne. (Mr. Gendelman would not confirm or deny any users\u2019 names, such as John Mayer, Ruby Rose, Zach Braff, Jeremy Piven and Cara Delevingne, who have all reportedly been spotted there.) Their suspicion may have stemmed from his eight-pack abs and frankly ridiculous jaw line. He did not have that problem on Raya, where everyone has eight-pack abs and ridiculous jaw lines.\u201cIt\u2019s way better,\u201d said Mr. Telle, who is now dating someone and has stopped actively using Raya. \u201cI matched with a lot of models, and even one celebrity.\u201dC\u00e9line Bossart, 26, a freelance wine and spirits journalist, said that during the time she used Raya actively \u2014 she now has a boyfriend \u2014 the app lived up to its reputation for civility.Keeping up Raya\u2019s values and mystique is partly why Mr. Gendelman, a self-described introvert, has chosen to stay quiet. For years, he avoided publicly identifying himself, even hiding his job from some friends and family. He has kept the company small \u2014 Raya has just 13 full-time employees \u2014 and has raised only a few small investment rounds.And it has expanded into professional networking, adding a \u201cwork\u201d section that allows users to match with each other for platonic collaborations. (Come for the models, stay for the deals.)Mr. Gendelman would not share financial information but said that he expects Raya to become profitable this year. Most of Raya\u2019s revenue comes from its monthly subscription fees, but there are lots of ways it could make money, by throwing sponsored member events, or introducing paid extras for power users. There is already a feature called \u201cdirect request,\u201d which is similar to Tinder\u2019s \u201csuper like\u201d and prioritizes your profile on another member\u2019s feed for $2.99. Ultimately, though, Mr. Gendelman is in the rare position of running a social network that doesn\u2019t need to be huge to succeed. In fact, Raya probably shouldn\u2019t scale too quickly, given the risk of losing its cachet and allure. Mr. Gendelman is frustrated by the notion that it\u2019s just a hookup app for jet-setters. \u201cI want to have people not feel what you felt \u2014 \u2018it\u2019s for people that look a certain way or do a certain thing,\u2019\u201d he said. Raya, he said, is \u201cfor passionate people anywhere in the world who have something they want to share with other members, and can do it in a respectful way.\u201dThe heart of Raya is its screening process, which is overseen by a secret committee of about 500 trusted members who vote on every application. People who meet the committee\u2019s standards are notified that they\u2019re in, while rejects are placed on the wait list. Mr. Gendelman said that Raya has more than 10,000 members spread across dozens of countries.Having a big Instagram following is not a prerequisite for being admitted. Neither must you be ridiculously attractive, or have lots of money. Mr. Gendelman said instead that conspicuous displays of wealth are a red flag.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of applications where it\u2019s just a Lamborghini, a yacht and a private plane, and we\u2019re just like, \u2018See you later,\u2019\u201d he said. I asked Mr. Gendelman to show me some Raya applications. After swearing me to anonymity, he pulled out his iPhone and navigated to a special section of Raya\u2019s app filled with aspiring members.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Mr. Gendelman said. He voted yes on the photographer but left a note on his application, asking for other committee members\u2019 opinions.Next up was a musician, a young guy with ratty blond hair. He didn\u2019t have a ton of Instagram followers, but he did have 68 phone contacts on Raya. A Google search turned up some recent high-profile media hits for his band. The musician also got a yes.Why? \u201cI think this person looks rad,\u201d Mr. Gendelman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to say it.\u201d Mr. Gendelman wanted to show me that I was wrong about his app, that it\u2019s not just a play place for beautiful snobs. To that end, Raya recently started opening its doors with the introduction of \u201cfriend passes,\u201d a feature that allows members to get one friend fast-tracked for admission. Friend passes will make Raya more democratic, Mr. Gendelman said, a point that is directionally if not factually correct. (There is a word for a private club that admits people based on referrals from friends; it\u2019s not \u201cdemocracy.\u201d)Mr. Gendelman shook his head. \u201cIs Tony decently interesting? Is he passionate?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding \u2014 we\u2019re interested in curating digital dinner parties, so to speak, and that comes in all forms.\u201dWithin the first day of use, I spotted an A-list musician, several TV news anchors, a household-name comedian, two N.F.L. players and a high-ranking tech executive. I saw lots of nonfamous people too \u2014 college students, designers, seemingly the entire editorial staff of Cond\u00e9 Nast. Everyone was either very attractive or the kind of person to whom very attractive people would be drawn.There is something thrilling, and a little embarrassing, about this rarefied air. To go on Raya is to enter a strange and alluring world filled with thirsty elites, a place where fame is measured in Instagram followers and humble-bragging is a high art (\u201cI direct things,\u201d reads the profile of one successful filmmaker; a well-known television actress describes herself only as a \u201ccarb enthusiast\u201d), and where the average B.M.I. seems to hover in the high teens.I spent several weeks glued to Raya, looking for as many familiar faces as possible. And while the experience created a distinct urge to go to the gym and start moisturizing, it didn\u2019t exactly make me long for my single days. But, oddly, it did make me nostalgic for an earlier, more Balkanized era of communication.Then social media companies came along, broke up the clubs and forced all the gamers and sports fans and Instant Pot moms and neo-Nazis onto the same three apps, then acted surprised when nobody got along.It\u2019s not shocking, in other words, that Raya exists as an elite response to the homogenization of digital culture. The popular and beautiful have always had private parties, invite-only conferences and V.I.P. rooms. Why would the internet be any different?What\u2019s stranger is how little of the internet works like Raya, a digital space that is designed for its users\u2019 specific wants and needs. It\u2019s genuinely odd that in an age of plenty, when we have 300 varieties of mustard and lifestyle brands for every conceivable micro-demographic, we\u2019re still satisfied feeding all of our digital communication into a handful of giant, boring platforms. Whether or not Raya fulfills its utopian ambitions, it is at least dangling the possibility that not all digital products have to connect the entire world \u2014 that the internet may still allow for some secrets.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is There a Smarter Path to Artificial Intelligence? Some Experts Hope So", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past five years, the hottest thing in artificial intelligence has been a branch known as deep learning. The grandly named statistical technique, put simply, gives computers a way to learn by processing vast amounts of data. Thanks to deep learning, computers can easily identify faces and recognize spoken words, making other forms of humanlike intelligence suddenly seem within reach.Companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft have poured money into deep learning. Start-ups pursuing everything from cancer cures to back-office automation trumpet their deep learning expertise. And the technology\u2019s perception and pattern-matching abilities are being applied to improve progress in fields such as drug discovery and self-driving cars.But now some scientists are asking whether deep learning is really so deep after all.In recent conversations, online comments and a few lengthy essays, a growing number of A.I. experts are warning that the infatuation with deep learning may well breed myopia and overinvestment now \u2014 and disillusionment later.The danger, some experts warn, is that A.I. will run into a technical wall and eventually face a popular backlash \u2014 a familiar pattern in artificial intelligence since that term was coined in the 1950s. With deep learning in particular, researchers said, the concerns are being fueled by the technology\u2019s limits.Deep learning algorithms train on a batch of related data \u2014 like pictures of human faces \u2014 and are then fed more and more data, which steadily improve the software\u2019s pattern-matching accuracy. Although the technique has spawned successes, the results are largely confined to fields where those huge data sets are available and the tasks are well defined, like labeling images or translating speech to text.The technology struggles in the more open terrains of intelligence \u2014 that is, meaning, reasoning and common-sense knowledge. While deep learning software can instantly identify millions of words, it has no understanding of a concept like \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201cdemocracy\u201d or \u201cmeddling.\u201dResearchers have shown that deep learning can be easily fooled. Scramble a relative handful of pixels, and the technology can mistake a turtle for a rifle or a parking sign for a refrigerator.While that program and other efforts vary, their common goal is a broader and more flexible intelligence than deep learning. And they are typically far less data hungry. They often use deep learning as one ingredient among others in their recipe.Kyndi has been able to use very little training data to automate the generation of facts, concepts and inferences, said Ryan Welsh, the start-up\u2019s chief executive.The Kyndi system, he said, can train on 10 to 30 scientific documents of 10 to 50 pages each. Once trained, Kyndi\u2019s software can identify concepts and not just words.In work for three large government agencies that it declined to disclose, Kyndi has been asking its system to answer this typical question: Has a technology been \u201cdemonstrated in a laboratory setting\u201d? The Kyndi program, Mr. Welsh said, can accurately infer the answer, even when that phrase does not appear in a document.And Kyndi\u2019s reading and scoring software is fast. A human analyst, Mr. Welsh said, might take two hours on average to read a lengthy scientific document, and perhaps read 1,000 in a year. Kyndi\u2019s technology can read those 1,000 documents in seven hours, he said.Kyndi serves as a tireless digital assistant, identifying the documents and passages that require human judgment. \u201cThe goal is increasing the productivity of the human analysts,\u201d Mr. Welsh said.Kyndi and others are betting that the time is finally right to take on some of the more daunting challenges in A.I. That echoes the trajectory of deep learning, which made little progress for decades before the recent explosion of digital data and ever-faster computers fueled leaps in performance of its so-called neural networks. Those networks are digital layers loosely analogous to biological neurons. The \u201cdeep\u201d refers to many layers.Vicarious, whose investors include Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, is a prominent example of the entrepreneurial pursuit of new paths in A.I.The Pentagon\u2019s research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, has proposed a program to seed university research and provide a noncommercial network for sharing ideas on technology to emulate human common-sense reasoning, where deep learning falls short. If approved, the program, Machine Common Sense, would start this fall and most likely run for five years, with total funding of about $60 million.Advertisement"}

Dozens of faces lined my bedroom wall \u2014 boys modeling expensive clothes, young lesbian couples, big, shirtless men leering at the camera \u2014 declared by XY Magazine to be \u201cThe Future of Young Gay America.\u201dThey were all white. Every morning I\u2019d wake to see them, a reminder of the mythical gay adulthood that awaited after high school, after Detroit, far away from there.Now, over a decade later, I\u2019m an editor on The Times\u2019s digital transition team. My job involves thinking about the future of our publication: How can our journalism better serve \u2014 and reflect \u2014 a younger, more diverse and digitally savvy audience? With this mandate, I felt emboldened to pitch a visuals-heavy piece for The Times\u2019s Pride special section.The project began with a question: Why do I, like so many of my friends, consider finding a partner, someone who looks like us, such an impossible task? I can\u2019t think of a single high-profile example of a loving relationship between two queer black people. I\u2019ve had countless conversations since high school with peers about how this dearth of representation has affected us. (Many people on Twitter have pointed me to Omar Little of \u201cThe Wire\u201d and his three boyfriends, but fictional characters on an HBO crime series weren\u2019t quite what I had in mind when I wrote that sentence.)So I took the question to Facebook. I didn\u2019t think much of the post; just a few words I typed before going for a jog: \u201cAre there any gay/queer black/Latinx couples who\u2019re down to be photographed? I grew up never seeing representations of queer black/brown love and this is my first step in trying to change that.\u201dWhen meeting the couples, I heard a refrain of resentment toward \u201cthe media.\u201d Hassan Williams, one of my subjects, was generally gregarious, but when asked about representation, became quiet and lost in thought before saying, \u201cThe media will have you believe that it\u2019s literally impossible to see two queer black folks in love.\u201dSeeing the response to the piece was surreal. I heard from parents of queer children, elder members of the L.G.B.T. community, even straight people who saw their love in ours. One parent told me that she felt inspired to take her daughter to a Pride parade after seeing the story online. Another told me that she sought out a print copy of The Times to give to her son, fresh out of the closet, as inspiration. I heard from one man in his 70s who said he wished he could\u2019ve seen these images growing up.It also served as a personal reminder of the importance of telling these kinds of stories. When I saw the first hard copy of the story \u2014 my words printed on a full page of New York Times broadsheet \u2014 I imagined younger Jamal, one of the last avid customers of my local Barnes & Noble, tracking down the issue, buying multiple copies and tacking one on his wall and one in his locker; smiling people, who looked like him, in love, a stark contrast to anything else he\u2019d ever seen.Advertisement"}

Designers use predictive algorithms and principles of behavioral economics to keep fans engaged. When new games are reviewed, the most flattering accolade might be \u201cI can\u2019t put it down.\u201dNow, the World Health Organization is saying players can actually become addicted.The W.H.O. designation may help legitimize worries about video game fans who neglect other parts of their lives. It could also make gamers more willing to seek treatment, encourage more therapists to provide it and increase the chances that insurance companies would cover it.\u201cIt\u2019s going to untie our hands in terms of treatment, in that we\u2019ll be able to treat patients and get reimbursed,\u201d said Dr. Petros Levounis, the chairman of the psychiatry department at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. \u201cWe won\u2019t have to go dancing around the issue, calling it depression or anxiety or some other consequence of the issue but not the issue itself.\u201dBut gaming has long had an addictive quality. The game EverQuest, introduced nearly 20 years ago, was nicknamed EverCrack for the long binges it inspired.Now, mental health professionals say they increasingly see players who have lost control.\u201cI have patients who come in suffering from an addiction to Candy Crush Saga, and they\u2019re substantially similar to people who come in with a cocaine disorder,\u201d Dr. Levounis said. \u201cTheir lives are ruined, their interpersonal relationships suffer, their physical condition suffers.\u201dAlthough gaming addiction treatment is starting to draw more attention, there is little insurance coverage or accreditation for specialists to treat it.Wilderness camps and rehabilitation centers have sprung up, but can cost tens of thousands of dollars, with scarce proof of success. Mental health generalists are trying to apply familiar therapies for anxiety or alcoholism to patients with an uncontrollable craving for, say, World of Warcraft.Players seeking help often cannot find it.Kim DeVries, a gift shop owner in Tucson, said she started looking for a gaming addiction specialist two years ago after her son failed out of college and was struggling to hold a job.Ms. DeVries wanted someone who understood her son\u2019s seeming compulsion to gaze into a glowing screen for 16 hours on some days, subsisting on crackers and pita chips and listening on a headset to strangers discussing strategy for League of Legends.She struck out. \u201cThey didn\u2019t exist \u2014 there was just no such thing,\u201d she said.Ms. DeVries now resorts to forbidding her son, 24, to play games after 11 p.m.\u201cAt times, I\u2019ll walk by and hear the tap-tapping on his keyboard, and it\u2019ll make me shudder,\u201d she said. Her son declined to be interviewed.The video game industry is expanding so quickly that medical research has struggled to keep up.\u201cThere\u2019s a massive tsunami coming that we\u2019re not prepared for,\u201d said Cam Adair, the founder of Game Quitters, an online support community.But some mental health professionals insist that gaming disorder is not a stand-alone medical condition. Rather, they see it as a symptom or a side effect of more familiar conditions, such as depression or anxiety.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how to treat gaming disorder,\u201d said Nancy Petry, a psychology professor and addiction expert with the University of Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s such a new condition and phenomenon.\u201dBut in the United States, getting care is often an exercise in frustration.\u201cIt\u2019s very wild, wild West,\u201d Mr. Adair said. \u201cThere\u2019s no consistent quality control.\u201dAs a teenager, depressed and anxious after being bullied, Mr. Adair dropped out of school and began fixating on games like StarCraft in his parents\u2019 basement in Calgary, Alberta, he said.He told his parents that he had a job, but would sneak back home to play. At 19, he said, he considered taking his life, eventually writing a suicide note.When Mr. Adair tried to find help, he found few resources.Another resource, the On-Line Gamers Anonymous forum, was founded by Liz Woolley in 2002 after her son, an avid gamer, committed suicide. She maintains a list of medical professionals on the site. But she said she was not always able to confirm how much experience they had with gaming addiction.\u201cAny type of treatment is better than nothing,\u201d Ms. Woolley said. \u201cAt least we have somewhere to send people other than to their basement.\u201dAnother kind of obsessive disorder may provide a template, and a warning, for activists seeking more support and research into gaming addiction: Compulsive gambling was first recognized by the World Health Organization and the American Psychiatric Association more than three decades ago.Formal recognition from medical organizations helps \u201cbring everybody to the table,\u201d said Keith S. Whyte, the executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling. Next month, his group will host its 32nd national conference.But inclusion is \u201cnot a magic bullet,\u201d Mr. Whyte said. A \u201ccomplex patchwork\u201d of national and state certifications for gambling addiction made it easier for some insurers to deny reimbursement, he said.\u201cYou still have to do a tremendous amount of advocacy,\u201d he said.Although reliable treatment for gaming addiction can be hard to find, demand is high.A residential recovery program near Seattle, ReStart, charges adult patients nearly $30,000 for the first seven weeks of care. It has a monthslong waiting list.Six patients, usually men, are initially placed at a rural retreat and weaned off electronics while being taught how to socialize and exercise. ReStart, which is nearly a decade old, started a program for adolescents last year.Hilarie Cash, a co-founder, said she was working to develop a certification program for addiction disorders including internet and gaming dependency. When she speaks at mental health conferences, she said, she often sees counselors \u201ctaking notes like mad.\u201dAddiction therapists are \u201cgetting called more often\u201d about gaming disorder, Dr. Cash said, and many are \u201ckind of tacking it onto what they already offer.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re trying to learn as best they can,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But it shouldn\u2019t be. Yes, the winters are long and brutal, but in warmer months this river-oriented metropolis, 300 miles north of the Montana border, is bursting with life. I took in stunning natural beauty, experienced a unique arts scene, much of it centered around First Nations culture, and gorged on good food. And yet I woke up grinning. In the video I submitted for my application for the 52 Places job, I said that there was a part of my soul that only fills up when I travel. This night, on these very special grounds, it had overflowed. (Soon, the grounds will have even more to offer. Organizers are reintroducing a bison herd, toward their 2019 application for Unesco World Heritage status.) During summer, Wanuskewin opens its tipis for groups of a minimum of 15 people, or smaller groups with a minimum charge of 690 Canadian dollars (about $542) \u2014 usually scouts or families who bring their own sleeping bags and crash on the floor. But because the season hadn\u2019t started and I was alone, they matched me with a Saskatoon buddy, Ashlyn George (more on her later), and asked us to give them feedback on a new Deluxe Tipi Experience they\u2019re planning to offer this year (prices available on request), with equipment provided. It operates much like the student sleepovers with a big educational component and is geared to travelers like me who don\u2019t have gear. All proceeds go back to park operations. Highlights: eating First-Nations-inspired cuisine at the museum restaurant; cooking bannock flat bread on a stick by campfire; snuggling under the cocoon of the buffalo skin; and drinking tea in starlight with good company. For a year, she lived out of her car (and hotels) and documented everything from flying a jet in formation with the Royal Canadian Air Force to the majesty of the northern lights. There are key differences to our mandates: She was working for the government as a function of the tourism arm; could bring a lot more stuff with her since she had a car; and got to go home every once in a while. But she\u2019s also the first person I\u2019ve met who\u2019s done a version of this job and knows what the other side looks like. Ashley Rabbitskin, whose mother is a healer, took us on a walk pointing out the medicinal uses of various plants. She sees herself as their advocate. \u201cI think of plants as family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe rely on the plants and the animals to survive. So in order for our relationship to continue, we have to acknowledge the plants in the way that we acknowledge each other.\u201dAnd Randi Lynn Nanemahoo-Candline, whose Cree name is Morningstar Dancing Deer Woman, gave us a vast and fascinating cultural overview, ranging from how Indigenous people hunted through buffalo jumps (luring bison into stampeding off cliffs) to the native practice of men battling to disgrace one another (to let another man get close enough to touch you was a great shame) rather than to kill.\u2014 Bring a jacket, no matter the time of year. \u2014 You\u2019ll need a car. I tried taking the bus for my first day; the 20 minutes of waiting in the cold changed my mind. \u2014 Can\u2019t pronounce a word in Saskatoon? It\u2019s likely Cree. The city gets its name from a deep purple berry used to make tarts you absolutely must try. Saskatchewan is Cree for \u201cthe swiftly flowing river.\u201d And the Meewasin Trail, where you can walk along that swift river from Wanuskewin straight into downtown Saskatoon, simply means \u201cbeautiful.\u201d Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Buffalo, N.Y.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Artificial Intelligence Keep Your Home Secure?", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersNow, security companies are hoping to harness the potential of artificial intelligence to better safeguard homes.\u201cWe put in the cameras to create a perimeter with no dead zones,\u201d said Ken Young, chief executive of Edgeworth Security, a consulting firm in Pittsburgh that offers monitoring solutions.To protect a property, these systems use technology like geofencing, facial recognition and A.I.-enabled cameras to help identify intruders. If someone breaks that boundary, the cameras will alert a command center. If someone loiters too long at a call box at the entrance to an estate, the system sends an alert to the monitoring center, which responds with a tailored warning, like \u201cYou in the blue shirt, please leave.\u201dMr. Young said the system uses artificial intelligence to tell the difference between movement into and out of a property, but it also uses facial recognition technology to distinguish regular visitors \u2014 like gardeners or delivery people \u2014 from strangers.\u201cWhen I worked at the White House, the grounds were gridded out with cables,\u201d said Mr. Young, who was part of the Marine One security detail and served as an emergency action planner to the executive branch during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all done through the lens of the camera.\u201dCompanies like Galaxy Security also make enhanced video cameras like the ones Edgeworth uses, and other security companies offer enhanced video surveillance as an add-on to other camera systems.The systems that Edgeworth installs can start around $20,000 for eight cameras on a small property and rise to more than $600,000 for large estates. Monitoring costs $8 to $12 an hour, and homeowners can choose when they want the monitoring turned on.That level of security is a draw for wealthy homeowners and property owners.The actor Joe Manganiello realized the weakness of his home security system a few years ago. He was at home in Beverly Hills, Calif., with his wife, the actress Sofia Vergara, when he heard someone walking around their property.Ms. Vergara checked the security cameras and noticed they were blacked out. Two men on their property had been spray-painting the lenses for nearly 45 minutes, which the company monitoring the security feed had missed.\u201cThese guys were trying to crowbar in the kitchen window; then they moved to the living room door,\u201d said Mr. Manganiello, who is known for his roles on \u201cTrue Blood\u201d and \u201cMagic Mike.\u201d \u201cI was standing at the top of the stairs with a weapon.\u201dWhen the men broke through the front door, the security alarm sounded and they ran off, he said. But the attempted break-in made him realize it was time for a security upgrade.Tom Gallagher, president of DSL Construction, which owns 26 residential buildings with more than 1,400 apartments in Los Angeles, said he wanted to change how the properties were protected.\u201cOver the years, it just became increasingly clear to me that the quality of the guards and the guard services were horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t very effective.\u201dAt first, he tried to create his own guard company, but that was too expensive, so he began researching enhanced security systems. He said installing the systems in all of the company\u2019s properties would save $400,000 to $500,000 a year. They will also be more reliable.\u201cWe had cameras out there when we still had guards,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said of his trial phase. \u201cWe had an incident that the cameras picked up. Where was the guard? He was sleeping in his car for six hours.\u201dThomas Tull, the chief executive of Tulco, which owns Edgeworth, said what he wanted for himself and his clients was a system that anticipated risks, not just responded to them.He gave as an example a worker in one client\u2019s home who posted a picture of the house online; the Edgeworth security system flagged the photo within a minute, and it was taken down. In another instance, the plans for someone\u2019s compound were detected on the so-called dark web.\u201cWho knows what they were going to do with it?\u201d Mr. Tull said. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem that didn\u2019t exist 20 or 25 years ago, this digital extension of yourself.\u201dHow these systems learn the difference between good behavior and bad is a fraught ethical question.\u201cThere is inherent bias in the computational systems,\u201d said Illah R. Nourbakhsh, the K&L Gates professor of ethics and computational technologies at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Create Lab.Professor Nourbakhsh said that A.I.-enhanced security systems could struggle to determine whether a nonwhite person was arriving as a guest, a worker or an intruder.One way to parse the system\u2019s bias is to make sure humans are still verifying the images before responding.\u201cWhen you take the human out of the loop, you lose the empathetic component,\u201d Professor Nourbakhsh said. \u201cIf you keep humans in the loop and use these systems, you get the best of all worlds.\u201dSecurity consultants recommend a layered approach that could include artificial intelligence.Michael A. Silva, principal of Silva Consultants in Seattle, said people needed to do a risk assessment first. Some very wealthy people are relatively unknown, so their risk is low, he said, but a less wealthy person with controversial opinions could be a more prominent target.Mr. Silva said any security plan started with the basics \u2014 good locks, strong doors, an alarm system \u2014 and could be expanded to full perimeter screening with either monitoring enhanced with artificial intelligence or more traditional motion detectors and alarms. Celebrities and other well-known people may want to build a safe room in their homes, he said, or have their own command centers.\u201cBefore you start prescribing medicine, you need to diagnose the condition,\u201d Mr. Silva said. \u201cA risk assessment is really crucial.\u201dChristopher Falkenberg, a former Secret Service agent and the president of Insite Risk Management, said that with threats being made so easily over social media, he needed to help clients control their personal information and who had access to it.He said his firm used existing technology and had created some of its own programs to track what was being said about clients online.\u201cWe used to be concerned with a small circle of people with information about you \u2014 the gardeners, the people who were on the property,\u201d Mr. Falkenberg said. \u201cWe can\u2019t vet all the people online the way we used to vet the gardener. We have to talk to clients about controlling the information that they personally put out there.\u201dAt a minimum, what any security program hopes to do is make a home less attractive to criminals.\u201cWe\u2019ll never reduce the crime rate in East Hampton or Greenwich,\u201d Mr. Falkenberg said. But, he added, \u201cif we can make it that much more difficult to target our people, we\u2019ll have achieved our goal.\u201dA few months ago, Mr. Manganiello and Ms. Vergara\u2019s home was targeted again. But this time, their new system from Edgeworth with geofencing technology and A.I.-enabled cameras detected three men before they could get close to the house.\u201cAs they were trying to figure out where to come in, the command center was guiding the police to our house,\u201d Mr. Manganiello said. \u201cThey were able to apprehend them and their getaway driver before they could even touch the house.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Fight for your seat at the table. Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table\u2019 \u2014 Donald J. Trump.\u201dThe crowd burst into applause. President Trump is quite popular in Pineville and the surrounding area, which is the heart of coal country and overwhelmingly supported the president in the 2016 election after he promised to bring coal jobs back to America.Mr. Bowling, though, wasn\u2019t finished.\u201cJust kidding,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was Barack Obama.\u201dThe cheering abruptly stopped.

{"Headline": "In Ruling on Cellphone Location Data, Supreme Court Makes Statement on Digital Privacy", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe decline to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless carrier\u2019s database of physical location information,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority.The 5-to-4 ruling will protect \u201cdeeply revealing\u201d records associated with 400 million devices, the chief justice wrote. It did not matter, he wrote, that the records were in the hands of a third party. That aspect of the ruling was a significant break from earlier decisions.The Constitution must take account of vast technological changes, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, noting that digital data can provide a comprehensive, detailed \u2014 and intrusive \u2014 overview of private affairs that would have been impossible to imagine not long ago.The decision made exceptions for emergencies like bomb threats and child abductions. \u201cSuch exigencies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cinclude the need to pursue a fleeing suspect, protect individuals who are threatened with imminent harm or prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.\u201dIn general, though, the authorities must now seek a warrant for cell tower location information and, the logic of the decision suggests, other kinds of digital data that provide a detailed look at a person\u2019s private life.The decision thus has implications for all kinds of personal information held by third parties, including email and text messages, internet searches, and bank and credit card records. But Chief Justice Roberts said the ruling had limits.\u201cWe hold only that a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party,\u201d the chief justice wrote. The court\u2019s four more liberal members \u2014 Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 joined his opinion.Each of the four other justices wrote a dissent, with the five opinions running to more than 110 pages. In one dissent, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the distinctions drawn by the majority were illogical and \u201cwill frustrate principled application of the Fourth Amendment in many routine yet vital law enforcement operations.\u201d\u201cCell-site records,\u201d he wrote, \u201care uniquely suited to help the government develop probable cause to apprehend some of the nation\u2019s most dangerous criminals: serial killers, rapists, arsonists, robbers and so forth.\u201dIn a second dissent, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the decision \u201cguarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.\u201dWitnesses said that Timothy Ivory Carpenter had planned the robberies, supplied guns and served as lookout, typically waiting in a stolen car across the street.Prosecutors also relied on months of records obtained from cellphone companies to prove their case. The records showed that Mr. Carpenter\u2019s phone had been nearby when several of the robberies happened. He was convicted and sentenced to 116 years in prison.The nation\u2019s highest court faced a far-reaching list of cases that renewed its central role in American life.Mr. Carpenter\u2019s lawyers said cellphone companies had turned over 127 days of records that placed his phone at 12,898 locations, based on information from cellphone towers. The records disclosed whether he had slept at home on given nights and whether he attended his usual church on Sunday mornings.Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the information was entitled to privacy protection.\u201cMapping a cellphone\u2019s location over the course of 127 days provides an all-encompassing record of the holder\u2019s whereabouts,\u201d he wrote, going on to quote from an earlier opinion. \u201cAs with GPS information, the time-stamped data provides an intimate window into a person\u2019s life, revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his \u2018familial, political, professional, religious and sexual associations.\u2019\u201dIn dissent, Justice Kennedy wrote that GPS devices provide much more precise location information than do cell towers. Chief Justice Roberts responded that cell tower technology is developing quickly.\u201cAs the number of cell sites has proliferated,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe geographic area covered by each cell sector has shrunk, particularly in urban areas. In addition, with new technology measuring the time and angle of signals hitting their towers, wireless carriers already have the capability to pinpoint a phone\u2019s location within 50 meters.\u201dChief Justice Roberts left open the question of whether limited government requests for location data required a warrant. But he said that access to seven days of data is enough to raise Fourth Amendment concerns.In a pair of recent decisions, the Supreme Court expressed discomfort with allowing unlimited government access to digital data. In United States v. Jones, it limited the ability of the police to use GPS devices to track suspects\u2019 movements. And in Riley v. California, it required a warrant to search cellphones.Chief Justice Roberts wrote that both decisions supported the result in the new case.As his opinion in Riley pointed out, he wrote, \u201ccellphones and the services they provide are \u2018such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life\u2019 that carrying one is indispensable to participation in modern society.\u201dAnd the Jones decision, he wrote, addressed digital privacy in the context of location information.\u201cThe question we confront today,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis how to apply the Fourth Amendment to a new phenomenon: the ability to chronicle a person\u2019s past movements through the record of his cellphone signals. Such tracking partakes of many of the qualities of the GPS monitoring we considered in Jones. Much like GPS tracking of a vehicle, cellphone location information is detailed, encyclopedic and effortlessly compiled.\u201dRelying on the Smith decision\u2019s \u201cthird-party doctrine,\u201d federal appeals courts have said that government investigators seeking data from cellphone companies showing users\u2019 movements do not require a warrant.But Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the doctrine is of limited use in the digital age.\u201cWhile the third-party doctrine applies to telephone numbers and bank records, it is not clear whether its logic extends to the qualitatively different category of cell-site records,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAfter all, when Smith was decided in 1979, few could have imagined a society in which a phone goes wherever its owner goes, conveying to the wireless carrier not just dialed digits, but a detailed and comprehensive record of the person\u2019s movements.\u201d\u201cWhen the government tracks the location of a cellphone,\u201d the chief justice wrote, \u201cit achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone\u2019s user.\u201dThat was insufficient, the court ruled. But Chief Justice Roberts emphasized the limits of the decision. It did not address real-time cell tower data, he wrote, \u201cor call into question conventional surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras.\u201d\u201cNor do we address other business records that might incidentally reveal location information,\u201d the chief justice wrote. \u201cFurther, our opinion does not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Split to the Nanosecond Is Precisely What Wall Street Wants", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Computer scientists at Stanford University and Google have created technology that can track time down to 100 billionths of a second. It could be just what Wall Street is looking for.For an exchange like Nasdaq, such refinement is essential to accurately order the millions of stock trades that are placed on their computer systems every second.Ultimately, this is about money. With stock trading now dominated by computers that make buying and selling decisions and execute them with blazing speed, keeping that order also means protecting profits. So-called high frequency trading firms place trades in a fraction of a second, sometimes in a bet that they can move faster than bigger competitors.The pressure to manage these high-speed trades grows when the stock market becomes more volatile, as it has been in recent months, in part to prevent the fastest traders from taking unfair advantage of slower firms. High frequency traders typically account for more than half of daily stock trading volume in the United States, according to data from the Tabb Group.\u201cThe financial industry has easily become the most obsessed with time,\u201d said Balaji Prabhakar, a Stanford University electrical engineer who is one of the designers of the new synchronization system.Because the orders are placed from locations around the world, they frequently arrive at the exchange\u2019s computers out of sequence. The new system allows each computer to time stamp an order when it takes place.As a result, the trades can be sorted and executed in correct sequence. In a networked marketplace, this precision is necessary not only to prevent illicit trading on advance information known as \u201cfront-running,\u201d but also to ensure the fair placement of orders.The importance of technical advances in measuring time was underscored by European regulations that went into effect in January and that require financial institutions to synchronize time-stamped trades with microsecond accuracy.\u201cThere are tickets needed, housing, people will need transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of an electronic market almost like a massive flea market hosted by Nasdaq software.\u201dTo go from trading equities to managing all sorts of financial transactions will require more than an order of magnitude speedup in the company\u2019s networks of computers. It will be possible only if all of the exchange\u2019s computers agree on time with nanosecond accuracy.A generation ago, computing usually took place in a single mainframe or personal computer. Now it is routinely spread across thousands of independent processors in machines that can be separated by a few feet or entire continents.Chip designers have long struggled to maintain the precise timing needed to order mathematical operations inside individual computing chips. And synchronizing these vast ensembles of them has become the limiting factor in the speed and processing power of what Google describes as \u201cplanetary-scale\u201d computers.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling,\u201d said Peter Hochschild, a Google software engineer who specializes in the challenges associated with spreading software and data across networked computers. \u201cInside a processor, an enormous amount of stuff happens in a billionth of a second.\u201dA billionth of a second is roughly the time it takes light to travel one foot. It has long been viewed as a crucial measure in computing. In the 1960s, the computing pioneer Grace Murray Hopper would hand out 11.8-inch lengths of wire to illustrate how designing smaller electronic parts would create faster computers.Distance has become even more significant as software has begun to escape the boundaries of individual computers and make its way into the cloud \u2014 the web of giant computer data centers that have come to blanket the planet.Because software and data are no longer in the same place, correctly calculating the order of the events that may be separated by feet or miles has become the dominant factor in the speed with which data can be processed.\u201cSo much of our expectation about computing being correct depends essentially on knowing this order,\u201d said Krishna Palem, a theoretical computer scientist at Rice University.In the world of cloud computing, entire databases are scattered among different computers and data centers.Huygens, named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens, who invented the pendulum clock in 1656, uses so-called machine-learning techniques to synchronize a network of computers to within 100 billionths of a second. In contrast, the N.T.P. standard can synchronize computers no more accurately than a millisecond, or one thousandth of a second.To ensure that buyers and sellers are treated fairly, Nasdaq has for decades looked for ways to ensure that trades are processed in the order they are placed.While building a network for Nasdaq in the 1990s, Brian Reid, a computer scientist at Digital Equipment Corporation, experimented by coiling large rolls of cables of different lengths in a Massachusetts warehouse in order to insert tiny delays in the time it took data to travel in a network to make sure that messages were delivered fairly. He then employed timing information from satellites to synchronize clocks at different locations.Google would later use this method to synchronize computers based on GPS data and atomic clocks to make sure that their database system could correctly order transactions. But since the system requires super-accurate clocks and satellite receivers, it is more costly than the software-based Huygens approach.Mr. Reid built his original system in an era when the Securities and Exchange Commission required that all stock sales be entered by humans.\u201cFive millisecond accuracy in clock synchronization pleased everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took much longer than five milliseconds to press the \u2018Enter\u2019 key on the big green terminals that people used.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Coming Tech Battle With China", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sharma is\u00a0the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Arriving in Beijing last month, I knew I would not be able to connect to Google, Facebook or Uber. As strange as it was to go without these staples of online life in the West, it was even stranger to find that local Chinese didn\u2019t seem to feel deprived at all. They search through Baidu, get their social media fix on WeChat, hail rides on Didi, curate news through sites like Toutiao. And while they know Beijing is watching, they accept this surveillance as normal.The Chinese government has carved out an alternative internet universe with its own brands, rules and culture, in which privacy doesn\u2019t exist. But its real ambition is to break out of this parallel universe and dominate not just the internet but the technology industry worldwide. To contain Beijing, the United States and its allies are fighting back with a campaign of technoprotectionism, opening a perilous new front in the global trade battles.President Trump is the unlikely leader of the fight against Chinese tech dominance. Widely seen as a champion of rust belt industries, he recently slapped heavy tariffs on all the leading aluminum and steel exporters, drawing fierce protests not only from China but also from American allies like Germany and Canada. But steel is a side show compared with the emerging tech battle with China.Technology will decide which country emerges as the world\u2019s dominant economic power in the long run. While about 20 percent of per-capita gross domestic product growth is driven by labor and capital, the remaining 80 percent is determined by how rapidly an economy is developing and applying new technology to increase production. China\u2019s ambition to catch up to Western living standards thus depends largely on how rapidly it can match or surpass Western technology.Mr. Trump is both accelerating and expanding trade battles that began before he took office. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries around the world began to restrict cross-border flows of trade, capital and migrants. Globalization\u2019s champions predicted that borders would continue to fall in at least one area \u2014 digital tech and the internet \u2014 but China has shown that a determined government can build walls in the virtual sphere, too.The president\u2019s tough stand on trade with China may be more popular than he is. The overwhelming consensus in the West is that Beijing is catching up illegitimately, by forcing companies that invest in China to share their best technology, or dispatching hackers to steal it. Though borrowing from the leading tech power is a standard development strategy \u2014 think of 19th-century America copying British industrial technology and Japan\u2019s great success replicating American technology \u2014 the scale and organization of China\u2019s campaign makes the threat feel new.Beijing has banned some foreign competitors like Google and Facebook outright, and regulated others so heavily that they have been compelled to sell themselves to Chinese rivals (Uber) or forced to consider pulling out of China (Amazon). In essence, China has created domestic internet monopolies that are generating enough cash in their vast local market to finance aggressive expansion abroad. I have been told, for example, that Toutiao already sells its novel content curating service to one in 10 Japanese.Last year Beijing rebranded the manufacturing centers of the Pearl River delta as the \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d and began urging the main cities there \u2014 Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong \u2014 to cooperate to become China\u2019s rival to Silicon Valley, which the Chinese would like to make the lesser Bay Area.In Beijing, the buzz was about how \u201cCreated in China\u201d is replacing \u201cMade in China,\u201d with some claiming that Shenzhen is now more innovative than Silicon Valley in key industries. Instead of just assembling simple goods from parts built elsewhere, China is now increasingly seen as a cutting-edge designer and developer of artificial intelligence, drones and other advanced technologies.Mr. Trump was willing to lift the ban on ZTE after the company paid a $1 billion fine and fired its top executives, but Congress was not. The Senate voted to reinstate the ban, which is likely to fuel trade battles to come. When I was in Beijing, many Chinese were talking about how the humiliation of ZTE was inspiring an official push to reduce China\u2019s dependence on the United States for semiconductors, software and other critical tech imports.The European Union recently imposed new data protection rules written largely to give consumers more control of information now in the hands of corporate giants like Facebook, but also to guard against the spread of a China-like surveillance state. The European Union is also pondering a new digital single market, in part to give European companies a market in which they have a chance to grow as large as Chinese rivals.This is how a digitally interconnected world could die by a thousand cuts, and technoprotectionism may get a further push during the next global downturn. From the United States to Europe and Japan, public debts are high and deficits are rising, which means these governments are poorly positioned to spend their way out of any slowdown. Central banks can\u2019t help much, either, since interest rates are still very low, with little room or reason to drop further right now. In this environment, governments may see protectionism as the only lever they have left to pull.For most of the postwar era, the consensus in support of free trade was so strong that governments rarely resorted to raising tariffs even when times were tough. The trade wars that broke out after 2008 have involved mainly nontariff or \u201cstealth\u201d trade barriers, including cheap state loans and subsidies for favored industries. But in the last two years, the rise of Mr. Trump and other antiglobal populists has given new currency to protectionism in all its forms, including technoprotectionism.The global financial markets had largely ignored the brewing trade battles, until recently. As the tariff threats grow in scale, and the battleground shifts from rust belt industries to new technologies, the markets are growing more skittish. So far, stocks have been hit harder in China than in the United States, but there will be no winners. The latest surveys of American investors and manufacturers show that their biggest concern is the threat of a trade war.The risks from deglobalization are growing. If the current skirmishes turn into a full-blown trade war, blame will fall heavily on the thousandth cut. But the real fault will lie with the 999 that came before.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Wounds of the Drone Warrior", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "FeatureEven soldiers who fight wars from a safe distance have found themselves traumatized. Could their injuries be moral ones?Supported byThe infrared sensors and high-resolution cameras affixed to drones made it possible to pick up such details from an office in Virginia. But as Aaron learned, identifying who was in the cross hairs of a potential drone strike wasn\u2019t always straightforward. The feed on the monitors could be grainy and pixelated, making it easy to mistake a civilian trudging down a road with a walking stick for an insurgent carrying a weapon. The figures on-screen often looked less like people than like faceless gray blobs. How certain could Aaron be of who they were? \u201cOn good days, when a host of environmental, human and technological factors came together, we had a strong sense that who we were looking at was the person we were looking for,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cOn bad days, we were literally guessing.\u201dInitially, the good days outnumbered the bad ones for Aaron. He wasn\u2019t bothered by the long shifts, the high-pressure decisions or the strangeness of being able to stalk \u2014 and potentially kill \u2014 targets from thousands of miles away. Although Aaron and his peers spent more time doing surveillance and reconnaissance than coordinating strikes, sometimes they would relay information to a commander about what they saw on-screen, and \u201c60 seconds later, depending on what we would report, you would either see a missile fired or not,\u201d he said. Other times, they would trail targets for months. The first few times he saw a Predator drone unleash its lethal payload \u2014 the camera zooming in, the laser locking on, a plume of smoke rising above the scorched terrain where the missile struck \u2014 he found it surreal, he told me. But he also found it awe-inspiring. Often, he experienced a surge of adrenaline, as analysts in the room exchanged high-fives.Aaron\u2019s path to the drone program was unusual. He grew up in Lexington, Mass., in a home where red meat and violent video games were banned. His parents were former hippies who marched against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. But Aaron revered his grandfather, a quiet, unflappable man who served in World War II. Aaron also had a taste for exploration and tests of fortitude: hiking and wandering through the woods in Maine, where his family vacationed every summer, and wrestling, a sport whose demand for martial discipline captivated him. Aaron attended the College of William & Mary in Virginia, where he majored in history, with a minor in business. A gifted athlete with an air of independence and adventurousness, he cut a charismatic figure on campus. One summer, he traveled to Alaska alone to work as a deckhand on a fishing boat.During Aaron\u2019s junior year, in 2001, he woke up one morning to a phone call from his father, who told him that the twin towers and the Pentagon had been attacked. Aaron thought instantly of his grandfather, who served for three years as a military police officer on the European front after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He wanted to do something similarly heroic. A year later, after spotting a pamphlet at the William & Mary career-services office for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a national-security agency that specializes in geographical and imagery analysis, he applied for a job there.Aaron began working as an imagery analyst at the N.G.A. in 2005, studying satellite pictures of countries that had no link to the war on terror. Not long after he arrived, an email circulated about a Department of Defense task force that was being created to determine how drones could help defeat Al Qaeda. Aaron answered the call for volunteers and was soon working at the Counterterrorism Airborne Analysis Center. He found it exhilarating to participate directly in a war he saw as his generation\u2019s defining challenge. His pride deepened as it became clear that the task force was having a significant impact and that the use of drones was increasing.Aaron spent a little over a year at the task force, including several months in Afghanistan, where he served as the point of contact between the drone center in Langley and Special Forces on the ground. After this, he worked for a private military contractor for a while. In 2010, an offer came from another contractor involved in the drone program to serve as an imagery-and-intelligence analyst. But as Aaron mulled the terms, something strange happened: He began to fall apart physically. The distress began with headaches, night chills, joint pain. Soon, more debilitating symptoms emerged \u2014 waves of nausea, eruptions of skin welts, chronic digestive problems. Aaron had always prided himself on his physical fitness, but suddenly he felt frail. Working for the contractor was out of the question. \u201cI could not sign the paperwork,\u201d he said. Every time he sat down to try, \u201cmy hands stopped working \u2014 I was feverish, sick, nauseous.\u201dAaron went back to Lexington to live with his parents and try to recuperate. He was 29 and in the throes of a breakdown. \u201cI was very, very unwell,\u201d he told me. He consulted several doctors, none of whom could specify a diagnosis. In desperation, he experimented with fasting, yoga, Chinese herbal medicine. Eventually, his health improved, but his mood continued to spiral. Aaron couldn\u2019t muster any motivation. He spent his days in a fog of gloom. At night, he dreamed that he could see \u2014 up close, in real time \u2014 innocent people being maimed and killed, their bodies dismembered, their faces contorted in agony. In one recurring dream, he was forced to sit in a chair and watch the violence. If he tried to avert his gaze, his head would be jerked back into place, so that he had to continue looking. \u201cIt was as though my brain was telling me: Here are the details that you missed out on,\u201d he said. \u201cNow watch them when you\u2019re dreaming.\u201dThe escalation of the drone wars has been met with strikingly little congressional or popular opposition. Unlike the policy of capturing and interrogating terrorism suspects that was adopted after Sept. 11, which fueled vigorous debate about torture and indefinite detention, drone warfare has been largely absent from public discourse. Among ordinary citizens, drones seem to have had a narcotizing effect, deadening the impulse to reflect on the harm they cause. Then again, the public rarely sees or hears about this harm. The sanitized language that public officials have used to describe drone strikes (\u201cpinpoint,\u201d \u201csurgical\u201d) has played into the perception that drones have turned warfare into a costless and bloodless exercise. Instead of risking more casualties, drones have fostered the alluring prospect that terrorism can be eliminated with the push of a button, a function performed by \u201cjoystick warriors\u201d engaged in an activity as carefree and impersonal as a video game. Critics of the drone program have sometimes reinforced this impression. Philip Alston, the former United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, warned in 2010 that remotely piloted aircraft could create a \u201cPlayStation mentality to killing\u201d that shears war of its moral gravity.But the more we have learned about the experiences of actual drone fighters, the more this idea has been revealed as a fantasy. In one recent survey, Wayne Chappelle and Lillian Prince, researchers for the School of Aerospace Medicine at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Fairborn, Ohio, drew on interviews that they and other colleagues conducted with 141 intelligence analysts and officers involved in remote combat operations to assess their emotional reactions to killing. Far from exhibiting a sense of carefree detachment, three-fourths reported feeling grief, remorse and sadness. Many experienced these \u201cnegative, disruptive emotions\u201d for a month or more. According to another recent study conducted by the Air Force, drone analysts in the \u201ckill chain\u201d are exposed to more graphic violence \u2014 seeing \u201cdestroyed homes and villages,\u201d witnessing \u201cdead bodies or human remains\u201d \u2014 than most Special Forces on the ground.Because the drone program is kept hidden from view, the American public rarely hears about the psychic and emotional impact of seeing such footage on a regular basis, day after day, shift after shift. Compared with soldiers who have endured blasts from roadside bombs \u2014 a cause of brain injuries and PTSD among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 the wounds of drone pilots may seem inconsequential. But in recent years, a growing number of researchers have argued that the focus on brain injuries has obscured other kinds of combat trauma that may be harder to detect but can be no less crippling. Drone warfare hasn\u2019t eliminated these hidden wounds. If anything, it has made them more acute and pervasive among a generation of virtual warriors whose ostensibly diminished stress is belied by the high rate of burnout in the drone program.As the volume of drone strikes has increased, so, too, have the military\u2019s efforts to attend to the mental well-being of drone warriors. Last year, I visited Creech Air Force Base in Nevada to interview drone pilots about their work. Forty minutes north of Las Vegas, Creech is a constellation of windswept airstrips surrounded by sagebrush and cactus groves. It is home to some 900 drone pilots who fly missions with MQ-9 Reapers in numerous theaters. Creech also has a group of embedded physiologists, chaplains and psychologists called the Human Performance Team, all of whom possess the security clearances required to enter the spaces where drone pilots do their work, in part so that they can get a glimpse of what the pilots and sensor operators experience.A psychologist on the team named Richard (who, like most of the airmen I spoke to, asked to be identified by only his first name) told me that, two weeks into the job, he poked his head into a ground control station just as the crew was \u201cspinning up for a strike.\u201d A veteran of the Marine Corps, he felt a surge of adrenaline as he watched the screen flash. Then he put the incident out of mind. A few weeks later, he was at his son\u2019s band concert, and as the national anthem played and he peered up at the Stars and Stripes, the memory came back. \u201cI\u2019m looking up at the flag, but I could see a dead body,\u201d he said. He was shaken, but he couldn\u2019t say anything to his family because the operation was classified.Drone warriors shuttle back and forth across such boundaries every day. When their shifts end, the airmen and women drive to their subdivisions alone, like clerks in an office park. One minute they are at war; the next they are at church or picking up their kids from school. A retired pilot, Jeff Bright, who served at Creech for five years, described the bewildering nature of the transition. \u201cI\u2019d literally just walked out on dropping bombs on the enemy, and 20 minutes later I\u2019d get a text \u2014 can you pick up some milk on your way home?\u201d Bright enjoyed serving in the drone program and believed that he was making a difference, a sentiment I heard repeatedly at Creech. But other airmen in his unit struggled to cope with stress, he said \u2014 there were divorces and some cases of suicide.Unlike office-park employees, drone operators cannot reveal much about how their day went because of classification restrictions. Unlike conventional soldiers, they aren\u2019t bolstered by the group solidarity forged in combat zones. Richard told me that when he was in the Marines, \u201cthere was a lot of camaraderie, esprit de corps.\u201d Although service members at Creech can get close to their co-workers, at the end of every shift they go home, to a society that has grown increasingly disconnected from war.The term is not new. It appeared in the 1994 book \u201cAchilles in Vietnam,\u201d by the psychiatrist Jonathan Shay, who drew on Homer\u2019s epic war poem the \u201cIliad\u201d to probe the nature of the wounds afflicting veterans of the Vietnam War. Shay read the \u201cIliad\u201d as \u201cthe story of the undoing of Achilles\u2019 character,\u201d which, he argued, unravels when his commander, Agamemnon, betrays his sense of \u201cwhat\u2019s right,\u201d triggering disillusionment and the desire \u201cto do things that he himself regarded as bad.\u201d Experiencing such disillusionment might not seem as traumatic as coming under enemy fire or seeing a comrade die. Shay disagreed. \u201cI shall argue what I\u2019ve come to strongly believe through my work with Vietnam veterans: that moral injury is an essential part of any combat trauma,\u201d he wrote. \u201cVeterans can usually recover from horror, fear and grief once they return to civilian life, so long as \u2018what\u2019s right\u2019 has not also been violated.\u201dOne author of the Clinical Psychology Review article was Shira Maguen, a researcher who began to think about the moral burdens of warfare while counseling veterans at a PTSD clinic in Boston. Like most V.A. psychologists, Maguen was trained to focus on the aftershocks of fear-based trauma \u2014 I.E.D. blasts that ripped through soldiers\u2019 Humvees, skirmishes that killed members of their unit. The link between PTSD and such \u201clife-threat\u201d events was firmly established. Yet in many of the cases she observed, the source of distress seemed to lie elsewhere: not in attacks by the enemy that veterans had survived, but in acts they had committed that crossed their own ethical lines. \u201cI was hearing about experiences where people killed and they thought they were making the right decision,\u201d Maguen told me recently, \u201cand then they found out there was a family in the car.\u201dIn San Francisco, Maguen convened groups where veterans came together and talked about the killing they had done. In the V.A. no less than in the military, this was a taboo subject, so much so that clinicians often refer to it euphemistically, if at all. The veterans in Maguen\u2019s groups didn\u2019t speak much about fear and hyperarousal, emotions linked to PTSD. Mostly, they expressed guilt and self-condemnation. \u201cYou feel ashamed of what you did,\u201d one said. Others described feeling unworthy of forgiveness and love. The passage of time did little to diminish these moral wounds, Maguen found. Geographic distance didn\u2019t lessen them much either. She recounted the story of a pilot who was haunted by the bombs he had dropped on victims far below. What troubled him was, in fact, precisely his distance from them \u2014 that instead of squaring off against the enemy in a fair fight, he had killed in a way that lacked valor. Obviously not all pilots felt this way. But the story underscored the significance of something Maguen has come to regard as more important than proximity or distance in shaping moral injury \u2014 namely, how veterans made sense of what they had done. \u201cHow you conceptualize what you did and what happened makes such a big difference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes all the difference.\u201dThe meaning and magnitude of moral injury remains contested. \u201cIt is not widely accepted by the military or the psychological community,\u201d Wayne Chappelle, of the School of Aerospace Medicine at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, told me, adding that he did not believe it was prevalent among drone operators. This was somewhat surprising, because Chappelle was an author of the study revealing that many drone warriors struggled with lasting negative emotions after strikes, feeling \u201cconflicted, angry, guilty, regretful.\u201d But the idea that war may be morally injurious is a charged and threatening one to many people in the military. Tellingly, Chappelle described moral injury as \u201cintentionally doing something that you felt was against what you thought was right,\u201d like the wanton abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. The definition used by researchers like Maguen is at once more prosaic and, to the military, potentially more subversive: Moral injury is sustained by soldiers in the course of doing exactly what their commanders, and society, ask of them.Some analysts immediately feel that their work has left an emotional residue. In Aaron\u2019s case, the feeling unfolded gradually, coinciding with a shift in worldview, as his gung-ho support for the \u201cwar on terror\u201d gave way to growing doubts. The disillusionment crept up in stages, starting, he realized in retrospect, a few months after he returned from Afghanistan. Although he felt proud of the work he did to help establish the drone program, he also started to wonder when the war\u2019s objective was going to be achieved. It was around this time that his manager asked him if he wanted to obtain resident C.I.A. employment status and become a career intelligence officer, which required taking a lie-detector test used to screen employees. Aaron said yes, but halfway through the test, after losing circulation in his arms and feeling hectored by the questions, he got up and abruptly left. The next day, Aaron told his manager that he had reconsidered.Aaron ended up taking a trip to California instead, renting a motorcycle and riding all the way up the coast to Alaska, where he spent a week at a monastery on a small island, sleeping in a wood-framed chapel surrounded by spruce trees. Aaron grew up attending an Eastern Orthodox church, and the experience was faith-reaffirming. When he went back to the East Coast, he felt refreshed. But he was also out of money, so he went back to work in a field where he could easily land a job, with a military-and-intelligence contractor.By now, Aaron\u2019s idealism had waned. It receded further when, at the end of 2008, the contractor sent him back to Afghanistan. The first time he was there, in 2006, the war on terror seemed to be hastening the defeat of Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Now it seemed to Aaron not only that progress had stalled, but that things were sliding backward. \u201cWe were actually losing control of vast areas of the country,\u201d he said, even as the number of drone strikes was \u201cfour or five times higher\u201d than before. The escalation under President Obama had begun.As it happened, Aaron had taken with him to Afghanistan a copy of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d He had read the book in high school and, like most people, remembered it as a dystopian novel about a totalitarian police state. This time, what stuck in his mind was a book-within-the-book written by Emmanuel Goldstein, the rumored leader of the resistance, titled \u201cThe Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism.\u201d In the book, Goldstein describes the onset of a \u201ccontinuous\u201d war, waged by \u201chighly trained specialists\u201d on the \u201cvague frontiers\u201d of Oceania \u2014 an opaque, low-intensity conflict whose primary purpose was to siphon off resources and perpetuate itself. (\u201cThe object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war,\u201d Orwell writes.) Aaron had an eerie sense that a perpetual war was exactly what the \u201cwar on terror\u201d was becoming.As his disillusionment deepened, events that Aaron dismissed before as unavoidable in any war began to weigh more heavily on him. He recalled days when the feed was \u201ctoo grainy or choppy\u201d to make out exactly who was struck. He remembered joking with his peers that \u201cwe sometimes didn\u2019t know if we were looking at children on the ground or chickens.\u201d He also thought back to the times when he would be asked \u201cto give an assessment of a compound where they had suspicion \u2014 there was fill-in-the-blank low-level Taliban commander in a remote region in the country. And we had seen other people come in and out of the same compound over the course of the preceding two or three days. They come and say: We\u2019re getting ready to drop a bomb on there \u2014 are there any people other than the Taliban commander in this compound? I\u2019d just say \u2018no\u2019 because they don\u2019t want to hear \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 And then two days later, when they have the funeral procession in the streets that we could observe with the Predators, you\u2019d see as opposed to carrying one coffin through the streets they\u2019re carrying three coffins through the streets.\u201dAaron kept his misgivings mainly to himself, but his friends noticed a change in him, among them Chris Mooney, who picked him up at the airport when he returned from Afghanistan in 2009. He and Aaron had been friends since college, when Aaron exuded confidence and enthusiasm. \u201cHe was magnetic,\u201d Mooney said. At the airport, Mooney could scarcely recognize his friend. His affect was flat, his face a solemn mask. They went to dinner, where, at one point, a patron who overheard them talking came up to Aaron to thank him for his service. Aaron thanked him back, Mooney said, but in a muted tone. Mooney didn\u2019t press him for details, but he knew that something was seriously wrong. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the same guy,\u201d he said.In the early 1970s, some psychiatrists listened to soldiers talk about such incidents at \u201crap groups\u201d organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Until this point, soldiers bearing psychic wounds tended to be dismissed by the military as cowards and malingerers. (\u201cYour nerves, hell \u2014 you are just a goddamned coward,\u201d Gen. George S. Patton snapped at a soldier in a hospital during World War II.) The Yale psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, who sat in on the V.V.A.W. rap groups and wrote about the disfiguring effects of killing and participating in atrocities in his 1973 book, \u201cHome From the War,\u201d helped to recast these veterans as sympathetic figures. Lifton argued that these former soldiers were burdened not by cowardice but by the guilt and rage they felt about their involvement in a misbegotten war. In his view, moral and political questions were inseparable from Vietnam veterans\u2019 psychic wounds, to the point that he believed activism to end the war could lessen their guilt and foster healing.When PTSD was officially recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, in 1980, many hoped it would lead society to reckon more honestly with the ethical chaos of war. The first definition included not only survivor\u2019s guilt but also guilt \u201cabout behavior required for survival\u201d among the potential symptoms, language that addresses acts soldiers perpetrated that went against their own moral codes. Over time, however, the moral questions that animated reformers like Lifton were reduced to \u201casterisks in the clinician\u2019s handbook,\u201d notes the veteran David Morris in his book, \u201cThe Evil Hours,\u201d as military psychologists shifted attention to brain injuries caused by mortar attacks and roadside bombs. One reason for this may be that focusing on such injuries, and on harmful acts in which veterans were the victims, was more comfortable for the military. Another is that it may be more comfortable for V.A. clinicians, who weren\u2019t trained to address veterans\u2019 moral pain and who \u201cmay unknowingly provide nonverbal messages that various acts of omission or commission in war are too threatening or abhorrent to hear,\u201d noted the authors of the 2009 article on moral injury in Clinical Psychology Review. Avoiding such conversations was untenable with service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, who were enmeshed in messy counterinsurgency campaigns that often involved close-range killing and noncombatants. According to Brett Litz, a clinical psychologist at Boston University and an author of the 2009 article, \u201c35 percent of the traumatic events that led soldiers to seek treatment for PTSD in a recent study were morally injurious events.\u201dWhen the drone program was created, it seemed to promise to spare soldiers from the intensity (and the danger) of close-range combat. But fighting at a remove can be unsettling in other ways. In conventional wars, soldiers fire at an enemy who has the capacity to fire back at them. They kill by putting their own lives at risk. What happens when the risks are entirely one-sided? Lawrence Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel and former chief of staff to Colin Powell, fears that remote warfare erodes \u201cthe warrior ethic,\u201d which holds that combatants must assume some measure of reciprocal risk. \u201cIf you give the warrior, on one side or the other, complete immunity, and let him go on killing, he\u2019s a murderer,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re killing people not only that you\u2019re not necessarily sure are trying to kill you \u2014 you\u2019re killing them with absolute impunity.\u201d\u201cOver all, I.S.R. personnel reported pride in their mission, particularly supporting successful protection of U.S. and coalition forces,\u201d the survey found. But many also struggled with symptoms of distress \u2014 emotional numbness, difficulty relating to family and friends, trouble sleeping and \u201cintrusive memories of mission-related events,\u201d including \u201cimages that can\u2019t be unseen.\u201dAs at Creech, steps have been taken to try to mitigate the stress: shorter shifts, softer lighting, embedded chaplains and psychologists. Counteracting this is the workload, which has escalated as drones have assumed an increasingly central role in the battle against ISIS and other foes. According to Lt. Col. Cameron Thurman, who was then the unit\u2019s surgeon general, the number of acknowledged missile strikes ordered by Central Command in the United States rose substantially between 2013 and mid-2017, even as the size of the work force has remained unchanged. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the same number of airmen doing the same number of mission hours but with a 1,000-percent increase in those life-and-death decisions, so of course their job is going to get significantly more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have more moral overload.\u201dA bald man with a blunt manner, Thurman sat across from me in a windowless conference room whose walls were adorned with posters of squadrons engaged in remote combat operations. Also in the room was Alan Ogle, a psychologist who was an author of the recent survey of the 480th Wing. On the PTSD scale, Ogle said, members of the unit \u201cdidn\u2019t score high,\u201d owing to the fact that few had been exposed to roadside bombs and other so-called life-threat events. What seemed to plague them more, he told me, were some forms of \u201cmoral injury.\u201dTwo members of the I.S.R. Wing described to me how changed they were by their work. Steven, who had a boyish face and sensitive eyes, is originally from a small town in the South and joined the military straight out of high school. Four years later, he told me, he no longer reacted emotionally to news of death, even after his grandmother recently died. The constant exposure to killing had numbed him. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing more death than you are normal things in life,\u201d he said. He watched countless atrocities committed by ISIS. During one mission, he was surveilling a compound on a high-visibility day when 10 men in orange jumpsuits were marched outside, lined up and, one by one, beheaded. \u201cI saw blood,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see heads roll.\u201d Ultimately, though, what troubled him most was not bearing witness to vicious acts committed by enemy forces but decisions he had made that had fatal consequences. Even if the target was a terrorist, \u201cit\u2019s still weird taking another life,\u201d he said. Distance did not lessen this feeling. \u201cDistance brings it through a screen,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s still happening, and it\u2019s happening because of you.\u201dAnother former drone operator told me that screens can paradoxically magnify a sense of closeness to the target. In an unpublished paper that he shared with me, he called this phenomenon \u201ccognitive combat intimacy,\u201d a relational attachment forged through close observation of violent events in high resolution. In one passage, he described a scenario in which an operator executed a strike that killed a \u201cterrorist facilitator\u201d while sparing his child. Afterward, \u201cthe child walked back to the pieces of his father and began to place the pieces back into human shape,\u201d to the horror of the operator. Over time, the technology of drones has improved, which, in theory, has made executing such strikes easier, but which also makes what remote warriors see more vivid and intense. The more they watch targets go about their daily lives \u2014 getting dressed, playing with their kids \u2014 the greater their \u201crisk of moral injury,\u201d his paper concluded.This theory is echoed by Maguen\u2019s findings. In one study, she discovered that Vietnam veterans who killed prisoners of war had especially high rates of trauma. Maguen believes the reason is that the victims were not strangers to them. \u201cWhen someone is a prisoner of war, you get to know them,\u201d she explained, \u201cyou have a relationship with them: You are watching them, you are talking to them. It may be that with drone operators, they also know their subjects fairly well: They have watched them, so there\u2019s a different kind of relationship, an intimacy.\u201dThe weather was rainy and overcast. The discussion groups he sat in on, where veterans cried openly as they talked about their struggles, were no more uplifting. But for the first time since leaving the drone program, Aaron felt that he didn\u2019t have to hide his true feelings. Every morning, he and the other veterans would begin the day by meditating together. At lunch, they ate side by side in silence, a practice called \u201cholding space.\u201d In the evenings, he drifted into a deep sleep, unperturbed by dreams. It was the most peaceful sleep he\u2019d had in years.At the Omega Institute, Aaron struck up a friendship with a Vietnam veteran from Minnesota, whom he later invited up to Maine. In the fall of 2015, at this friend\u2019s suggestion, he went to a meeting of the Boston chapter of Veterans for Peace. Soon thereafter, he began to talk about funeral processions he\u2019d witnessed after drone strikes where more coffins appeared than he expected, first with members of the group, later at some interfaith meetings organized by peace activists. It was painful to dredge up these memories; sometimes his back would seize up. But it was a form of social engagement that he found deeply relieving.At one interfaith meeting, Aaron mentioned that he and his colleagues used to wonder if they were playing a game of \u201cwhack-a-mole,\u201d killing one terrorist only to see another pop up in his place. He had come to see the drone program as an endless war whose short-term \u201csuccesses\u201d only sowed more hatred in the long term while siphoning resources to military contractors that profited from its perpetuation. On other occasions, Aaron spoke about the \u201cdiffusion of responsibility,\u201d the whirl of agencies and decision makers in the drone program that make it difficult to know what any single actor has done. This is precisely the way the military wants it, he suspects, enabling targeted killing operations to proceed without anyone feeling personally responsible. If anything, he felt an excess of remorse and culpability, convinced that targeted killings had very likely made things worse.Peter Yeomans, a clinical psychologist who trained with Shira Maguen, has developed an experimental treatment for moral injury rooted in the sharing of testimonials, initially at weekly meetings where veterans come together to talk among themselves, and later at a public ceremony that the participants invite members of the community to attend. One goal of the treatment is to help veterans unburden themselves of shame, Yeomans told me. Another is to turn them into moral agents who can deliver the truth about war to their fellow citizens \u2014 and, in turn, broaden the circle of responsibility for their conduct.In early May, I attended a ceremony in a small chapel on the third floor of the V.A. Medical Center in Philadelphia, where Yeomans now works. Seated on a stage in the chapel were a number of veterans, among them a wiry man with an unkempt brown beard who sat with his eyes closed and his hands folded in his lap. His name was Andy, and when invited to speak, he told the audience that he grew up in a violent home where he watched his older brother and baby sister endure abuse, which made him want to \u201cprotect the defenseless.\u201d After high school, he enlisted in the military and became an intelligence operative in Iraq. One night, on a mission near Samarra, a city in the \u201cSunni triangle,\u201d a burst of sustained gunfire erupted from the second-story window of a house, and Andy said he \u201ccalled air\u201d to deliver a strike. When the smoke cleared from the leveled home, there was no clear target inside. \u201cI see instead the wasted bodies of 19 men, eight women, nine children,\u201d Andy said, choking back tears. \u201cBakers and merchants, big brothers and baby sisters.\u201cI relive this memory almost every day,\u201d he went on. \u201cI confess to you this reality in the hope of redemption, that we might all wince and marvel at the true cost of war.\u201dThe room fell silent as Andy went back to his chair, sobbing. Then Chris Antal, a Unitarian Universalist minister who ran the weekly meetings with Yeomans, invited members of the audience to form a circle around the veterans who had spoken and deliver a message of reconciliation to them. Several dozen people came forward and linked arms. \u201cWe sent you into harm\u2019s way,\u201d began the message that Antal recited and that the civilians encircling the veterans repeated. \u201cWe put you into situations where atrocities were possible. We share responsibility with you: for all that you have seen; for all that you have done; for all that you have failed to do,\u201d they said. Later, members of the audience were invited to come forward again, this time to take and carry candles that the veterans had placed on silver trays when the ceremony began. Andy\u2019s tray had 36 candles on it, one for each person killed in the airstrike that he called in.Yeomans and Antal told me over dinner afterward that they believe audience participation in the ceremony was crucial. Moral injury, they pointed out, is as much about society\u2019s avoidance and denial as it is about the ethical burdens that veterans bear. Antal added that, in his opinion, grappling with moral injury requires reckoning with how America\u2019s military campaigns have harmed not only soldiers but also Iraqis and civilians in other countries.For Antal, broadening the scope to include these civilians is both a spiritual mission and a personal one. He bears a moral injury of his own, sustained when he was serving as an Army chaplain in Afghanistan. While there, he attended transfer ceremonies in which the coffins of fallen U.S. soldiers were loaded onto transport planes to be sent home. During one such ceremony, held at Kandahar Airfield, Antal noticed drones taking off and landing in the distance, and felt a flicker of conscience. The contrast between the dignity of the ceremony, during which the fallen soldier\u2019s name was solemnly announced as \u201cTaps\u201d was played, and the secrecy of the drone campaign, whose victims were anonymous, jarred him. \u201cI felt something break,\u201d he told me. In April 2016, he resigned his commission as a military officer, explaining in a letter to President Obama that he could not support a policy of \u201cunaccountable killing\u201d that granted the executive branch the right to \u201ckill anyone, anywhere on earth, at any time, for secret reasons.\u201dThe secrecy of the drone program makes it riskier for people who have served in it to share their stories. Jesselyn Radack, a lawyer for national-security whistle-blowers who has worked with Aaron, told me that several former drone operators she represents have suffered retaliation for talking about their experiences (she said one client had his house raided by the F.B.I. and was placed under criminal investigation after speaking on camera to a filmmaker). After Aaron began speaking publicly about his own past, someone hacked into his email and his cellphone, and a stream of anonymous threats began flooding his inbox. The hostile messages, calling him \u201cscum\u201d and warning him to \u201cshut his big blabbermouth,\u201d were also sent to his father, whose email was likewise hacked. The barrage of threats eventually prompted Aaron to hire a lawyer to try to identify who was behind the harassment (the attorney he is working with, Joe Meadows of Bean Kinney & Korman, specializes in internet defamation), and to contact both the F.B.I. and the police.The experience left Aaron shaken. But in recent months, he has begun to recover. He is now gainfully employed as an analyst of gold and other precious metals, a hobby he has turned into a vocation. He has started to reach out again to friends like Chris Mooney. He lives with his dog, a German shepherd, which he likes to take on walks through the forests near his home. His physical pain has mostly gone away, thanks in part to the regimen of yoga and meditation that he maintains. He still has his share of violent dreams, he told me. But he appears to have recaptured what for many years he had lost \u2014 his sense of moral purpose and, oddly enough, clarity, which is why he feels more ready to continue speaking publicly about his experience.Not long ago, Aaron was invited to speak at an event organized by a branch of the Mennonite Church titled \u201cFaithful Witness in a Time of Endless War.\u201d It took place on the campus of a school in Lansdale, Pa., in a small auditorium whose stage was festooned with peace quilts. Aaron approached the lectern in a brown blazer, with a somber expression. He reached forward to adjust the mic and thanked the event\u2019s organizers for inviting him to tell his story. Before sharing it, he asked for a moment of silence, \u201cfor all of the individuals that I killed or helped to kill.\u201dEyal Press is a journalist who has spent the past year as a fellow at the New York Public Library\u2019s Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers. He is at work on a book about people whose jobs take them into morally treacherous situations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Regains Its License to Operate in London, a Win for Its New C.E.O.", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Uber won an appeal on Tuesday to regain its taxi license in London after agreeing to stricter government oversight, a crucial victory for efforts by its new chief executive to revamp the company\u2019s grow-at-all-costs culture.On Tuesday, a judge at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court in London bolstered Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s campaign, reissuing Uber\u2019s license, albeit for 15 months \u2014 less than the five years that is typical for taxi licenses. Uber had agreed to install new leadership in London, adopt rules to report incidents to the police, keep tired drivers off the road and share traffic data with the city. The company also named a new independent board to oversee British operations.In reading a statement, the judge, Emma Arbuthnot, laid blame for Uber\u2019s misdeeds at the feet of former managers who had a \u201cgung-ho attitude\u201d to \u201cgrow the business come what may.\u201dJudge Arbuthnot added that the 15-month license required Uber to prove its cultural changes were lasting. \u201cThe question,\u201d she said, \u201cis whether Uber can be trusted.\u201d\u201cUber has been forced to overhaul the way it operates not just in London but across the world, including completely changing its global governance structures and implementing new systems for reporting alleged crimes,\u201d Mr. Khan said.Tom Elvidge, Uber\u2019s general manager in Britain, said in his own statement that the company was \u201cpleased with today\u2019s decision\u201d and would work with city officials to \u201caddress their concerns and earn their trust.\u201dWith more than 3.6 million people who use the service at least once every three months, London is one of Uber\u2019s most lucrative global markets and biggest success stories outside the United States. The appeal removes a black eye as Mr. Khosrowshahi scales back in Asia and prepares for an initial public offering as early as next year.But the company\u2019s size also makes it politically risky for government officials to take its cars off the road. Uber says it provides millions of rides per week in London, and with roughly 45,000 drivers, its fleet nearly doubles the number of black cabs. More than 850,000 people signed a petition supporting Uber after the ban was announced last year.Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, which represents about half the city\u2019s 23,000 cabbies, criticized the city for allowing Uber to become \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d The union lobbied to prevent Uber from regaining a license, and some of its members were in the audience during the hearings.Uber\u2019s experience in London tracks closely with its experience in other major cities. It gained popularity among customers who enjoyed the app\u2019s convenience and comparatively low prices, and Uber\u2019s strategy was to grow as quickly as possible so that it became indispensable.But with its growth came criticism over poor treatment of drivers, inadequate passenger safety and harm to incumbent taxi industries. In September, frustrated by a raft of global scandals, London revoked Uber\u2019s license. Transport for London, which regulates ride-hailing services in the city, said Uber was not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d business, a designation required to operate in Britain.\u201cWe\u2019ve had five years of a very difficult relationship where Uber has felt it didn\u2019t require regulation,\u201d Helen Chapman, Transport for London\u2019s director of licensing, regulation and charging, said during testimony on Tuesday.The two-day trial in London allowed regulators to make their case. Uber managers were questioned about the use of software to avoid government oversight. The software, called Greyball, was developed in part to aid entrance into markets where the company\u2019s service was not permitted. The tool allowed Uber to deploy what was essentially a fake version of its app to duck law enforcement agencies that were cracking down on its service.The managers were upbraided over instances in which sexual assault allegations against drivers were not reported to the police. And they were criticized for a data breach that exposed millions of customers but that was not reported to the authorities for months.In each instance, company representatives accepted blame and outlined the changes made under Mr. Khosrowshahi to address those issues.Mr. Elvidge said regulators had been right to revoke the company\u2019s license given its past behavior. Over several hours of testimony on Monday, he called decisions made by the previous leadership team \u201centirely regrettable,\u201d \u201ca bad idea,\u201d \u201cnot appropriate\u201d and \u201cfundamentally wrong.\u201d\u201cIt was really clear that the corporate culture of the previous leadership had to change,\u201d Mr. Elvidge told the court.Testimony during the trial described an unrestrained company culture, where leaders in San Francisco made decisions that managers in London had to explain to regulators. When a data breach was reported last year, Mr. Elvidge said, he learned about it from news reports. He first told British regulators that only one driver had been exposed, but several hours later shared that in fact information from 2.7 million people in Britain had been taken.Uber said it had created new rules for reporting problems to regulators, including an unusual policy to notify government officials when the company is aware of potentially negative news coverage.To address safety concerns, the company also worked with London\u2019s Metropolitan Police to create a policy for reporting possible crimes by drivers. In the past, Uber left the decision about reporting wrongdoing to customers. The company also said it would be more aggressive about barring drivers when riders complain.Laurel Powers-Freeling, appointed last year as chairwoman of Uber\u2019s independent board in Britain, testified that Uber was seeing major cultural changes.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a real will to take on a new set of values,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But Not Quite Like That.", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveStung by romantic rejection, a woman finds acceptance and catharsis in a man who leaves her with bite marks and bruises.\u201cAre you left- or right-handed?\u201d Dan asked, walking me down the subway steps.\u201cRight-handed,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy?\u201dWhen we stopped at the bottom, he put his arms around me and hugged tightly, nuzzling his lips into my neck. Suddenly, my vision blurred in a flash of blinding pain as I felt his teeth sink into my right shoulder.I had experienced my share of pain over the years \u2014 a broken arm, a split chin \u2014 but not like this. Never intentionally.As we had wrapped our third date earlier that night, he had asked if he could mark my foray into B.D.S.M. by biting me, and I\u2019d said yes. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually do it.After unclenching his jaw, he kissed me on the cheek and said good night. Then he was gone.I walked through the turnstile in a daze, only faintly aware of the people around me. My skin pulsed.I arrived at the subway platform drunk on endorphins, running my fingers under my coat to feel the tiny grooves in my shoulder his bite had left. Only later would I realize he had asked if I was right-handed so he could bite where my handbag would rest \u2014 the pain reminding me of him.Man, that had hurt. What the hell was I getting myself into?\u201cYou O.K.?\u201d Dan texted, minutes later.I stared at the blinking cursor. If I wanted to back out, now was the time. \u201cSee you in two weeks,\u201d I replied.I hadn\u2019t been looking to date. I was still recovering from the demise of my previous relationship with a journalist who broke up with me after I told him about my struggles with alcohol and family issues.The journalist and I had met on OkCupid while I was touring the Southeast with my band. Every day we would text each other a single photo from our oddball work lives: a Nascar race in Charlotte; a tricycle factory in Queens.Meanwhile, I hid what I preferred he didn\u2019t see: Me relapsing on cheap merlot in Raleigh. Crying at a truck stop in Duluth. It was a tough time. My father was hospitalized and dying. But I wanted to be \u201cfun,\u201d so why burden him with unnecessary details?We went through the motions of building a relationship: cooking dinner and watching movies. But when he asked why I didn\u2019t drink, I made excuses about early morning meetings. Concealing the messy parts of myself came naturally. I had done it my whole life.As a child, I had learned to hide who I was to avoid upsetting my father, an Egyptian immigrant. In my teens I was chronically depressed, but he didn\u2019t talk about feelings, so I started sneaking shots of the Tanqueray he kept in the freezer. I became a touring musician, and on my short visits home we maintained an unspoken agreement: I wouldn\u2019t bother my father with who I really was, and he wouldn\u2019t ask.I told all of this to the journalist the night before I boarded a plane to Texas. It was too much for him. Then my father died, and I sank into despair. When it came to dating, I felt hopeless. I thought: Why even bother? As soon as a guy finds out about my baggage, he bolts. I may as well walk around with a \u201cDanger: High Maintenance\u201d sign strapped to my chest.Around this time I received an OkCupid notification that someone had \u201cliked\u201d my profile. I logged on, saw a black-and-white photo of a man\u2019s jawline and clicked.\u201cAbout me,\u201d it read. \u201cI\u2019m a feminist. I respect women while simultaneously enjoy dominating them.\u201dGreat. One of those \u201cFifty Shades\u201d opportunists. I was appalled, of course, so I kept reading.\u201cFavorite things: Sending you to work with marks, the fragrance of your hair lingering on my hands, photography and Dan Savage.\u201dOr could I? I was an adult. Just because I wasn\u2019t dating didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t reply.I opened up a message box and typed: \u201cBig fan of Dan Savage. I\u2019m intrigued.\u201d I hit send and then ran out of the room, screaming.One week and dozens of emails later, Dan and I agreed to meet at Prospect Park. He was handsome, mid-30s, dark brown eyes and hair. Very fit. He told me he\u2019d been a \u201cdominant\u201d for years and lived with his girlfriend in an open relationship. They had rules: no unprotected sex, no sleepovers, no kissing. I had never met a man who communicated his needs so confidently.\u201cWhere would we meet?\u201d I asked.\u201cYour place, before work. 6 a.m.\u201d\u201cYou need to tell me everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of your baggage. Any triggers. I want you to keep a journal and send it to me, too. I have to know what might come up.\u201dLater, after that third date, we agreed on a set of rules and boundaries. I shared everything I was usually too afraid to tell a new partner.\u201cMy dad died three months ago,\u201d I said, \u201cso maybe we avoid the \u2018daddy\u2019 stuff?\u201d\u201cGot it. What else?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a blackout drunk, but if I drink I get really depressed. I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t drink around me.\u201d\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like you to be fully aware anyway.\u201dFor the next two months, Dan texted me constantly. His aura of calm control was a revelation for me. Rather than fleeing from my emotional baggage, he welcomed it without fear or judgment.The nights before his visits I would stay up until 4 a.m. cleaning, eager to please him. He would ring my doorbell as the garbage trucks blared down the street, and it was exhilarating \u2014 until it was exhausting. Though Dan wouldn\u2019t admit it, he was a sadist. He would leave me with bite marks and bruises that lasted for weeks.And I was not a masochist. I hated the pain but found catharsis in how undeterred Dan was by my outbursts. I would cry when his leather belt stung my thighs, but he never tried to curb or deny my feelings. I could sob from the physical pain and then about everything else I had been too afraid to talk about: the relationship I would never have with my father, my impulse to deaden everything with a drink. None of it fazed him.Then Dan would leave and I would sit alone in my bedroom, his sweat still fresh on my skin, wanting so badly to be held.I wasn\u2019t the only woman he visited. He would tell me stories of other women he was sleeping with, and I\u2019d repress any feelings of jealousy. I thought he was more evolved than I, as if attachment were some sort of moral failing on my part.Then an old fling of mine came to town and asked me out to dinner.\u201cUh-oh, he might want to come home with me!\u201d I texted Dan, playfully.\u201cCareful,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t like to share.\u201dI stared at my phone, startled. Since we weren\u2019t romantic, I had assumed he wouldn\u2019t care.\u201cDates are fine, but I don\u2019t want you sleeping with other men,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf that\u2019s a problem, we may need to reassess.\u201dI told Dan I needed time to think about it, and then I went on the date.My friend and I stayed out until 2 a.m., laughing and making out, and I saw how much I missed being kissed and the warmth of another body. Dan had a partner to go home to, and I was on my own. Was this really what I wanted?In the end I kept coming to the same conclusion: This would never be enough. If I had worked up the courage to be forthright with him at the beginning, then I could walk away, too.A few days later, I texted: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just need more.\u201d\u201cIf you change your mind,\u201d he replied, \u201cyou know where to find me.\u201dI had found a strange liberation in submitting to Dan, but it was only a first step. I wanted the domination, but I needed lazy Sundays and walks in the park, too. I wasn\u2019t sure what that kind of relationship would look like. I just knew I couldn\u2019t continue hiding \u2014 from myself or others.So I went back on OkCupid and created a new profile. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a monogamous long-term partner whose natural dominant qualities complement my submissive,\u201d I wrote. \u201cThat kind of trust takes time to build, but I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Wins Exclusive U.K. Rights to Broadcast Some Premier League Matches", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A generation ago, Sky, then an upstart satellite broadcaster, outbid rivals for the rights to televise the Premier League. The deal revolutionized the fortunes of the TV service, and helped turn the British soccer league into one of the world\u2019s most watched \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 in sports.Another transformation now appears to be underway. Amazon, which is increasingly pushing beyond its e-commerce origins, won rights on Thursday to broadcast Premier League games in Britain for the first time.Amazon\u2019s deal highlights the seismic shifts happening in sports and television entertainment, as deep-pocketed digital outlets compete with traditional broadcasters like NBC, Disney and, in Europe, Sky. The fierce battle between Silicon Valley companies and historically dominant studios and broadcasters has extended from developing new scripted shows to broadcasting live sports.The matches that Amazon will broadcast, available to its Prime members in Britain, are relatively minor. It will showcase 20, scheduled at times when there tends to be lower viewership than normal. But Amazon\u2019s victory was in how it can deliver the games: While digital companies have typically bought only the digital streaming rights to sporting events, Amazon\u2019s deal includes the exclusive rights for the matches it shows.\u201cPrime Video continues to drive Prime member adoption and retention,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote.The company has also sought to develop scripted entertainment, earning awards and acclaim with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d though it still lags behind competitors like Netflix.In Britain, Amazon will share the broadcast rights to the Premier League with two British heavyweights \u2014 Sky Sports and BT Sport. Sky and BT will televise the vast majority of matches on offer, totaling 180 in all. Those matches will be at times that are more likely to garner high levels of viewership.The auction for Premier League broadcast rights was held in February, but only Sky Sports and BT won partial rights at the time.\u201cWe welcome Amazon as an exciting new partner, and we know Prime Video will provide an excellent service on which fans can consume the Premier League,\u201d Richard Scudamore, the Premier League\u2019s executive chairman, said in a statement on Thursday.Digital media companies have long proclaimed an interest in sports rights, but they have largely failed to enter competitive bids for marquee properties. And while sports leagues are eager to increase the number of bidders, they have shown a reluctance to turn over rights wholesale to digital partners, preferring instead to craft deals that include digital streaming on top of traditional TV broadcasting.But the format of the Premier League\u2019s auction makes it easier for digital media companies to compete. While most large rights packages in the United States are for seven seasons or more, the Premier League offers only three-season blocks, lowering the get-in cost. The 200 Premier League games on offer were also split into seven packages of 32 or 20 games each, making it easier for Amazon to dip a toe in the water, albeit in a smaller market than the United States.The revenue for the Premier League rights in Britain is supplemented by income from broadcast deals elsewhere, including in the United States, where NBC televises the matches, and in China, where the digital broadcaster PPTV holds the rights.An earlier version of this article misstated when Amazon took over streaming rights for some N.F.L. games. It was in April 2017, not this year.Prashant S. Rao reported from London, and Kevin Draper from New York.Advertisement"}

The administration is scheduled to release on June 15 a final list of Chinese products covered by $50 billion of tariffs. It said that it will impose the tariffs shortly thereafter. China has threatened to retaliate.The Trump administration has two choices. It can settle for relatively unambitious gains and try to spin them as significant. Investors would welcome that outcome. Voters may, too. Alternatively, Mr. Trump can keep demanding big changes in China, and possibly plunge the U.S. into a drawn-out trade war. The imposition of the metals tariffs shows that he is willing to follow through. But it\u2019s still not clear how he will respond when his trade measures do significant harm to businesses or the financial markets.That moment may not be far away.-- Peter EavisReplacing him will be Hans Vestberg, currently the president of the company\u2019s global networks.\u2014 Michael de la MercedDuring his tenure as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam helped reshape the telecom giant \u2014 and part of that was through deal making. Not all of the transactions were particularly flashy, but they tended to follow one of two paths: Overhauling the company\u2019s network operations or building up its digital media division (which is now called Oath).Here are Verizon\u2019s top transactions since Mr. McAdam became C.E.O. in 2011, according to data from Thomson Reuters:\u2022 Verizon had asked Shari Redstone, the media company\u2019s controlling shareholder, if it would ever come up for sale, according to CBS\u2019s lawsuit against Ms. Redstone last month.\u2022 It briefly looked at buying the assets of Fox that Walt Disney ended up agreeing to acquire for $52.4 billion, including the 20th Century Fox movie studio and cable channels like FX.We\u2019ve looked at that over the years, and we made our decision to go digital. That\u2019s why we bought AOL and Yahoo, and we talk now about superchannels of sports and finance and news and some entertainment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn his seven years as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam was known for his relentless focus on his company\u2019s wireless network and his aversion to striking big, splashy deals.As Verizon prepares for the telecom industry\u2019s future \u2014 where the only certain things are the rise of 5G wireless technology and online video streaming \u2014 here\u2019s what two research analysts think about what the company has done and where it\u2019s headed.Craig Moffett, MoffettNathansonMr. McAdam will be defined by the deals that he didn\u2019t do. Unlike AT&T \u2014 which paid nearly $50 billion for the satellite TV service DirecTV and is trying to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion \u2014 Verizon never struck splashy acquisitions, aside from those of Yahoo and AOL (combined purchase price: $9.2 billion).But that conservatism has worked in Verizon\u2019s favor. DirecTV has steadily lost customers in this age of cord-cutting, dragging down AT&T\u2019s financial health.\u201cI think he deserves a lot of credit for avoiding some of the traps that some of his peers have fallen into,\u201d Mr. Moffett said of Mr. McAdam.As for the fear underpinning many telecom companies\u2019 deal-making \u2014 that sticking to basic internet and phone service is boring \u2014 Mr. Moffett said Verizon has shown that worry to be unfounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about being a distribution channel?\u201d he told me. \u201cVerizon fully understood and embraced that there will always be a place for an advantaged network \u2014 and people will pay a premium for it.\u201dAmy Yong, MacquarieMr. McAdam\u2019s relentless focus on making Verizon\u2019s network the best in the U.S. has paid off handsomely, with the company earning a premium from investors based on the strength of its core business.The big question is whether that will be enough going forward, as rivals AT&T and T-Mobile pursue bold moves.Verizon\u2019s cautious strategy may ending up costing the company. Though AT&T\u2019s bet on wireless video streaming hasn\u2019t paid off yet, if it works, it will make that company a formidable creator and distributor of content. And T-Mobile and Sprint could prove to be a strong new rival if their proposed union works out.\u201cThe future is looking very different,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat worked in the past may not be what works in the future.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedA new report suggests that Apple is preparing to sell fewer phones later this year. It may sound worrying. But we\u2019ve seen similar news before, and the fallout is unlikely to be all that bad.But Apple\u2019s phones are getting more expensive, so every sale counts for more. And its services businesses \u2014 things like Music and Pay \u2014 are becoming an increasingly valuable revenue stream, meaning that the company can make more money off existing users even if they don\u2019t upgrade to the latest device.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe job faced by investigators of car collisions is getting more difficult as autonomous car features become more advanced, and the way they do their jobs might need to change to accommodate that.In March, a Tesla Model X collided with a concrete lane divider as it was driven down a highway in Mountain View, Calif. A new report by National Transportation Safety Board investigators suggested that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology played a role in the death of a Tesla owner.The driver was using the advanced driver assistance features traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer lane-keeping assistance, which Tesla refers to as \u201cautopilot.\u201d As the Tesla approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of US-101 from the SH-85 exit ramp, it moved to the left and entered the gore area. The Tesla continued traveling through the gore area and struck a previously damaged crash attenuator at a speed of about 71 mph.Information isn\u2019t recorded in most cars\u2019 event data recorders, the automotive equivalent of airplane black boxes. Instead, the boxes show more basic information such as steering-wheel input and throttle.While automakers commonly provide the information if it is requested by the vehicle owner, accident investigators\u2014typically contractors hired by insurance companies\u2014say they sometimes have to seek a court order to obtain crash data.An update to the rules published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could change that situation, by demanding that automakers log more details about the vehicle\u2019s behavior.The complexity of the mathematical calculations involved means it\u2019s not straightforward to take the network apart to understand how it makes its decisions. This can make unintended behavior hard to predict; and if failure does occur, it can be difficult to explain why. If a system misrecognizes an object in a photo, for instance, it may be hard (though not impossible) to know what feature of the image led to the error.Many artificial intelligence researchers are trying to develop ways to make it easier to understand the inner working of A.I. systems. But for now, that\u2019s likely to involve looking at complex computer code. That suggests that crash investigation teams, as well as the regulations that are applied to automakers, might require an update in the near future, too.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeComcast is threatening to challenge Walt Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox. Behind the scenes, it\u2019s playing down investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 fears of an antitrust response. We may have just gotten a clue about whether it\u2019s right.The head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, appears unruffled about a Disney-Fox deal, at least. From an interview at The Deal\u2019s conference yesterday:\u201cThey had good advice and carved out surgically what a transaction is that might be doable and who knows where that transaction leads.\u201dBut Mr. Delrahim also defended his team\u2019s effort to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, saying it was a merger of a kind that federal regulators had sought to block for decades. (A federal judge is expected to rule on the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against the deal on Tuesday.)Mr. Trump is the black sheep of this family, the estranged sibling who decided to pick fights with his relatives just before arriving to dinner. The dispute, Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, acknowledges, is \u201cmuch like a family quarrel.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 any of that will affect America\u2019s trade policies. But diplomatic tensions look set to rise, and economic uncertainty would rise with them.Elsewhere in trade:The Trump administration removed crippling penalties on the ailing Chinese telecom company in exchange for $1.4 billion in fines and other measures. But did some other big gain drive the deal?Getting Beijing to approve Qualcomm\u2019s takeover of another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors? Maybe. China\u2019s latest trade concessions, which were linked to the Trump administration not imposing certain tariffs? Unlikely.More from Jane Mayer:A business associate who declined to be identified, in order not to jeopardize his ties to the family, told me, \u201cCharles pushed David out. It was done with a wink, and a nod, and a nudge.\u201dSF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group, a company controlled by top executives at the billionaire\u2019s investment firm, has a 15 percent stake in the horse, which is the heavy favorite to win tomorrow\u2019s Belmont Stakes.SF Bloodstock, which according to court filings is owned by SF Agricultural Holdings L.L.C., employs a for-profit model and focuses on the breeding side of the industry, purchasing stallions, or shares in them, and broodmares while selling yearlings at auction. In 2015, it entered into a three-year partnership with WinStar Farm and China Horse Club that allowed them to spend big while spreading risk at yearling and 2-year-old sales. That is how the group partly acquired Justify.Elsewhere in business and sports: An earlier version of this briefing misstated the name of the race that Justify is the heavy favorite to win. It is the Belmont Stakes, on Saturday, not the Preakness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Senate Aide Charged in Leak Case Where Times Reporter\u2019s Records Were Seized", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A former Senate Intelligence Committee aide was arrested on Thursday in an investigation of classified information leaks where prosecutors also secretly seized years\u2019 worth of a New York Times reporter\u2019s phone and email records.The former aide, James A. Wolfe, 57, was charged with lying repeatedly to investigators about his contacts with three reporters. According to the authorities, Mr. Wolfe made false statements to the F.B.I. about providing two of them with sensitive information related to the committee\u2019s work. He denied to investigators that he ever gave classified material to journalists, the indictment said.Mr. Wolfe, the Intelligence Committee\u2019s director of security, was slated to appear before a federal judge on Friday in Washington. Reached on Thursday evening before his arrest, Mr. Wolfe declined to comment.Mr. Wolfe\u2019s case led to the first known instance of the Justice Department going after a reporter\u2019s data under President Trump. The seizure was disclosed in a letter to the Times reporter, Ali Watkins, who had been in a three-year relationship with Mr. Wolfe. The seizure suggested that prosecutors under the Trump administration will continue the aggressive tactics employed under President Barack Obama.In his role with the committee, Mr. Wolfe was responsible for safeguarding classified and other sensitive information shared with lawmakers. He stopped performing committee work in December and retired in May.F.B.I. agents initially approached Ms. Watkins about the relationship she had with Mr. Wolfe, saying they were investigating unauthorized leaks. The Justice Department told her in a letter sent in February that her records had been seized. The Times learned on Thursday of the letter, which came from the national security division of the United States attorney\u2019s office in Washington.In another case, the indictment said, Mr. Wolfe used an encrypted messaging app to alert another reporter in October 2017 that he had served Mr. Page with a subpoena to testify before the committee. The reporter, who was not named, published an article disclosing that Mr. Page had been compelled to appear. After it was published, Mr. Wolfe wrote to the journalist to say, \u201cGood job!\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m glad you got the scoop,\u201d according to court papers.The same month, Mr. Wolfe reached out to a third reporter on the same unidentified app to offer to serve as an unnamed source, the documents said.Mr. Wolfe also communicated with a fourth reporter, using his Senate email account, from 2015 to 2017, prosecutors said. They said he denied those contacts.View the indictment of James A. Wolfe, the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s former director of security, as part of a leaks investigation.News media advocates consider the idea of mining a journalist\u2019s records for sources to be an intrusion on First Amendment freedoms, and prosecutors acknowledge it is one of the most delicate steps the Justice Department can take. \u201cFreedom of the press is a cornerstone of democracy, and communications between journalists and their sources demand protection,\u201d said Eileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman.Ms. Watkins\u2019s personal lawyer, Mark J. MacDougall, said: \u201cIt\u2019s always disconcerting when a journalist\u2019s telephone records are obtained by the Justice Department \u2014 through a grand jury subpoena or other legal process. Whether it was really necessary here will depend on the nature of the investigation and the scope of any charges.\u201dA prosecutor notified Ms. Watkins on Feb. 13 that the Justice Department had years of customer records and subscriber information from telecommunications companies, including Google and Verizon, for two email accounts and a phone number of hers. Investigators did not obtain the content of the messages themselves.The records covered years\u2019 worth of Ms. Watkins\u2019s communications before she joined The Times in December 2017 to cover federal law enforcement. During a seven-month period last year for which prosecutors sought additional phone records, she worked for BuzzFeed News and then Politico reporting on national security.Shortly before she began working at The Times, Ms. Watkins was approached by the F.B.I. agents, who asserted that Mr. Wolfe had helped her with articles while they were dating. She did not answer their questions. Mr. Wolfe was not a source of classified information for Ms. Watkins during their relationship, she said. That same month, F.B.I. agents asked Mr. Wolfe about an article written by Ms. Watkins. He denied knowing the reporter\u2019s sources.During the same interview with the F.B.I., Mr. Wolfe denied knowing Ms. Watkins. But confronted with pictures of the two together, he admitted being in a \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d with her since 2014.Ms. Watkins said she told editors at BuzzFeed News and Politico about it and continued to cover national security, including the committee\u2019s work. Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, said in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019re deeply troubled by what looks like a case of law enforcement interfering with a reporter\u2019s constitutional right to gather information about her own government.\u201dA Politico spokesman, Brad Dayspring, said that the situation was \u201cmanaged accordingly\u201d after Ms. Watkins disclosed the matter, and that her beat was national security and law enforcement, not solely the committee, which other reporters primarily covered.Ms. Watkins also told editors at The Times about the previous relationship when she was hired to cover federal law enforcement.Attorney General Jeff Sessions said last year that the Justice Department was pursuing about three times as many leak investigations as were open at the end of the Obama administration. Under Mr. Obama, the Justice Department prosecuted more leak cases than all previous administrations combined.\u201cThe attorney general has stated that investigations and prosecutions of unauthorized disclosure of controlled information are a priority of the Department of Justice,\u201d John Demers, a top Justice Department official, said in a statement announcing Mr. Wolfe\u2019s arrest.The investigation came to light after the Senate Intelligence Committee made a cryptic announcement on Wednesday that it was cooperating with the Department of Justice \u201cin a pending investigation.\u201d Earlier, the Senate quietly and unanimously adopted a resolution to share committee information with the Justice Department \u201cin connection with a pending investigation arising out of the unauthorized disclosure of information.\u201dMr. Wolfe, a former Army intelligence analyst, worked for the committee in a nonpartisan capacity for nearly 30 years. He worked closely with both Democrats and Republicans on the committee.Mr. Trump has complained bitterly about leaks and demanded that law enforcement officials seek criminal charges against government officials involved in illegal and sometimes embarrassing disclosures of national security secrets.When law enforcement officials obtained journalists\u2019 records during the Obama administration, members of Congress in both parties sounded alarms, and the moves touched off a firestorm among advocates for press freedom that helped prompt the Justice Department to rewrite its relevant guidelines.In addition, the rules generally require the Justice Department to notify reporters first to allow them to negotiate over the scope of their demand for information and potentially challenge it in court. The rules permit the attorney general to make an exception to that practice if he \u201cdetermines that, for compelling reasons, such negotiations would pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation, risk grave harm to national security, or present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.\u201dTop Justice Department officials must sign off on any attempt to gain access to a journalist\u2019s communications records.It is not clear whether investigators exhausted all of their avenues of information before confiscating Ms. Watkins\u2019s information. She was not notified before they gained access to her information from the telecommunications companies. Among the records seized were those associated with her university email address from her undergraduate years.The Intelligence Committee is responsible for carrying out oversight of American intelligence agencies, including the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency, and their secretive operations. It is one of the most tightly secured groups in Congress, with strict rules for lawmakers and the professional staff governing the circulation and release of sensitive, and often classified, information that passes before the committee.As security director, Mr. Wolfe would have been responsible for ensuring that those rules were upheld. When the committee became a matter of intense interest as it undertook a bipartisan investigation of Russia\u2019s election meddling, Mr. Wolfe played a more visible role ushering witnesses in and out of the committee\u2019s secured office space.Matt Apuzzo and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

DeepFarhad isn\u2019t quite ready yet, but our engineers are confident that it will attain Farhad-level insights fairly soon.But while you\u2019re still here in human form, let\u2019s talk about the year\u2019s biggest overarching tech narrative: the \u201ctechlash\u201d against companies like Facebook and Google over issues like privacy, data protection and antitrust concerns. As someone who has been mercifully spared from every twist and turn of the techlash, does it feel like a lot has changed since you left?When I left, Facebook was under the gun, Amazon was getting hit by President Trump, and Apple and Google were trying to stand clear of the fallout. Three months later, Facebook is still under the gun, the president still regards Amazon as a pariah, and Apple and Google still would very much like to be excluded from these narratives.I\u2019m not saying I was expecting wholesale structural change among entrenched businesses over the course of a season. But, still: For all the fireworks in Washington, there\u2019s been little movement on regulation or legislation to curb some of the excesses in tech. I don\u2019t see much of an advance toward stricter antitrust scrutiny of the large tech firms. And their most recent earnings reports show they\u2019re all going gangbusters; Americans may harbor growing worries about the power of tech companies, but not enough to make us quit them.Which isn\u2019t to say the techlash isn\u2019t real, just that change will come slowly. We\u2019re all living in a world where most communication and commerce is ruled by a handful of nearly unregulated oligopolies. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t change quickly, I guess.Techlash indeed!And then there was the bit about how we\u2019re all staring at our phones too much. The tech industry has been consumed recently by new worries over \u201ctech addiction,\u201d and both Facebook and Google recently announced plans to tackle digital \u201cwell-being.\u201d Now Apple\u2019s jumping in, too. In the next version of iOS, your phone will give you detailed stats about how often you use your phone and what you do on it, and it will even let you block yourself and your children from using certain apps.It seems slightly opportunistic to kick a social network while it\u2019s down, but Apple\u2019s aggressive criticism also highlights the real and growing philosophical differences between the two companies. Facebook is an advertising-supported communications conglomerate aimed at the masses, and dead set on remaining free so that all seven billion humans on Earth can eventually be connected (and monetized) through its platform. Apple is predominantly a high-end hardware business that caters to an increasingly privacy-conscious consumer base, and thinks that security will be a differentiating factor when people choose which smartphones, tablets and laptops to buy.Maybe it was inevitable that these two giants would clash, but to a tech writer who lives for drama, it\u2019s still interesting to watch.Anyway, that\u2019s all for now. Here\u2019s hoping that DeepFarhad is ready for next week\u2019s newsletter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thermostats, Locks and Lights: Digital Tools of Domestic Abuse", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The people who called into the help hotlines and domestic violence shelters said they felt as if they were going crazy.One woman had turned on her air-conditioner, but said it then switched off without her touching it. Another said the code numbers of the digital lock at her front door changed every day and she could not figure out why. Still another told an abuse help line that she kept hearing the doorbell ring, but no one was there.In more than 30 interviews with The New York Times, domestic abuse victims, their lawyers, shelter workers and emergency responders described how the technology was becoming an alarming new tool. Abusers \u2014 using apps on their smartphones, which are connected to the internet-enabled devices \u2014 would remotely control everyday objects in the home, sometimes to watch and listen, other times to scare or show power. Even after a partner had left the home, the devices often stayed and continued to be used to intimidate and confuse.For victims and emergency responders, the experiences were often aggravated by a lack of knowledge about how smart technology works, how much power the other person had over the devices, how to legally deal with the behavior and how to make it stop.\u201cPeople have started to raise their hands in trainings and ask what to do about this,\u201d Erica Olsen, director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said of sessions she holds about technology and abuse. She said she was wary of discussing the misuse of emerging technologies because \u201cwe don\u2019t want to introduce the idea to the world, but now that it\u2019s become so prevalent, the cat\u2019s out of the bag.\u201dConnected home devices have increasingly cropped up in domestic abuse cases over the past year, according to those working with victims of domestic violence. Those at help lines said more people were calling in the last 12 months about losing control of Wi-Fi-enabled doors, speakers, thermostats, lights and cameras. Lawyers also said they were wrangling with how to add language to restraining orders to cover smart home technology.Muneerah Budhwani, who takes calls at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said she started hearing stories about smart homes in abuse situations last winter. \u201cCallers have said the abusers were monitoring and controlling them remotely through the smart home appliances and the smart home system,\u201d she said.Graciela Rodriguez, who runs a 30-bed emergency shelter at the Center for Domestic Peace in San Rafael, Calif., said some people had recently come in with tales of \u201cthe crazy-making things\u201d like thermostats suddenly kicking up to 100 degrees or smart speakers turning on blasting music.\u201cThey feel like they\u2019re losing control of their home,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter they spend a few days here, they realize they were being abused.\u201dSmart home technology can be easily harnessed for misuse for several reasons. Tools like connected in-home security cameras are relatively inexpensive \u2014 some retail for $40 \u2014 and are straightforward to install. Usually, one person in a relationship takes charge of putting in the technology, knows how it works and has all the passwords. This gives that person the power to turn the technology against the other person.Emergency responders said many victims of smart home-enabled abuse were women.Connected home gadgets are largely installed by men, said Melissa Gregg, a research director at Intel working on the implications of smart home technology. Many women also do not have all the apps on their phones, said Jenny Kennedy, a postdoctoral research fellow at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, who is researching families that install smart home technology.The people who spoke to The Times about being harassed through smart home gadgetry were all women, many from wealthy enclaves where this type of technology has taken off. They declined to publicly use their names, citing safety and because some were in the process of leaving their abusers. Their stories were corroborated by domestic violence workers and lawyers who handled their cases.Each said the use of internet-connected devices by their abusers was invasive \u2014 one called it a form of \u201cjungle warfare\u201d because it was hard to know where the attacks were coming from. They also described it as an asymmetry of power because their partners had control over the technology \u2014 and by extension, over them.One of the women, a doctor in Silicon Valley, said her husband, an engineer, \u201ccontrols the thermostat. He controls the lights. He controls the music.\u201d She said, \u201cAbusive relationships are about power and control, and he uses technology.\u201dShe said she did not know how all of the technology worked or exactly how to remove her husband from the accounts. But she said she dreamed about retaking the technology soon.\u201cI have a specific exit plan that I\u2019m in the process of implementing, and one of my fantasies is to be able to say, \u2018O.K. Google, play whatever music I want,\u2019\u201d she said. Her plan with the smart thermostat, she said, was to \u201cpull it out of the wall.\u201dWhen a victim uninstalls the devices, this can escalate a conflict, experts said. \u201cThe abuser can see it\u2019s disabled, and that may trigger enhanced violence,\u201d said Jennifer Becker, a lawyer at Legal Momentum, a women\u2019s rights legal advocacy group.Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said disabling the devices could also further cut off a victim. \u201cThey\u2019re not sure how their abuser is getting in and they\u2019re not necessarily able to figure it out because they don\u2019t know how the systems work,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cWhat they do is they just turn everything off, and that just further isolates them.\u201dLegal recourse may be limited. Abusers have learned to use smart home technology to further their power and control in ways that often fall outside existing criminal laws, Ms. Becker said. In some cases, she said, if an abuser circulates video taken by a connected indoor security camera, it could violate some states\u2019 revenge porn laws, which aim to stop a former partner from sharing intimate photographs and videos online.Advocates are beginning to educate emergency responders that when people get restraining orders, they need to ask the judge to include all smart home device accounts known and unknown to victims. Many people do not know to ask about this yet, Ms. Becker said. But even if people get restraining orders, remotely changing the temperature in a house or suddenly turning on the TV or lights may not contravene a no-contact order, she said.\u201cI\u2019m sure that it\u2019s happening,\u201d said Zach Perron, a captain in the police department in Palo Alto, Calif. \u201cIt makes complete sense knowing what I know about the psychology of domestic violence suspects. Domestic violence is largely about control \u2014 people think of physical violence but there\u2019s emotional violence, too.\u201dSome people do not believe the use of smart home devices is a problem, said Ruth Patrick, who runs WomenSV, a domestic violence program in Silicon Valley. She said she had some clients who were put on psychiatric holds \u2014 a stay at a medical facility so mental health can be evaluated \u2014 after abuse involving home devices.\u201cIf you tell the wrong person your husband knows your every move, and he knows what you\u2019ve said in your bedroom, you can start to look crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to believe someone\u2019s crazy than to believe all these things are happening.\u201dAsking everyone in a home to understand smart home technology is essential, researchers said.\u201cWhen we see new technology come out, people often think, \u2018Wow, my life is going to be a lot safer,\u2019\u201d said Katie Ray-Jones, chief executive of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. But \u201cwe often see the opposite with survivors of domestic violence.\u201dIf you are in an abusive relationship, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple to Close iPhone Security Hole That Law Enforcement Uses to Crack Devices", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe F.B.I. eventually paid a third party to get into the phone, circumventing the need for Apple\u2019s help. Since then, law enforcement agencies across the country have increasingly employed that strategy to get into locked iPhones they hope will hold the key to cracking cases.Now Apple is closing the technological loophole that let authorities hack into iPhones, angering police and other officials and reigniting a debate over whether the government has a right to get into the personal devices that are at the center of modern life.Apple said it was planning an iPhone software update that would effectively disable the phone\u2019s charging and data port \u2014 the opening where users plug in headphones, power cables and adapters \u2014 an hour after the phone is locked. While a phone can still be charged, a person would first need to enter the phone\u2019s password to transfer data to or from the device using the port.Such a change would hinder law enforcement officials, who have typically been opening locked iPhones by connecting another device running special software to the port, often days or even months after the smartphone was last unlocked. News of Apple\u2019s planned software update has begun spreading through security blogs and law enforcement circles \u2014 and many in investigative agencies are infuriated.\u201cIf we go back to the situation where we again don\u2019t have access, now we know directly all the evidence we\u2019ve lost and all the kids we can\u2019t put into a position of safety,\u201d said Chuck Cohen, who leads an Indiana State Police task force on internet crimes against children. The Indiana State Police said it unlocked 96 iPhones for various cases this year, each time with a warrant, using a $15,000 device it bought in March from a company called Grayshift.But privacy advocates said Apple would be right to fix a security flaw that has become easier and cheaper to exploit. \u201cThis is a really big vulnerability in Apple\u2019s phones,\u201d said Matthew D. Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University. A Grayshift device sitting on a desk at a police station, he said, \u201ccould very easily leak out into the world.\u201dIn an email, an Apple spokesman, Fred Sainz, said the company is constantly strengthening security protections and fixes any vulnerability it finds in its phones, partly because criminals could also exploit the same flaws that law enforcement agencies use. \u201cWe have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don\u2019t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs,\u201d he said.Apple and Google, which make the software in nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones, began encrypting their mobile software by default in 2014. Encryption scrambles data to make it unreadable until accessed with a special key, often a password. That frustrated police and prosecutors who could not pull data from smartphones, even with a warrant.Since then, two main companies have helped law enforcement hack into iPhones: Cellebrite, an Israeli forensics firm purchased by Japan\u2019s Sun Corporation in 2006, and Grayshift, which was founded by a former Apple engineer in 2016. Law enforcement officials said they generally send iPhones to Cellebrite to unlock, with each phone costing several thousand dollars to open. In March, Grayshift began selling a $15,000 GrayKey device that the police can use to unlock iPhones themselves.Apple has closed loopholes in the past. For years, the police used software to break into phones by simply trying every possible passcode. Apple blocked that technique in 2010 by disabling iPhones after a certain number of incorrect attempts. But the Grayshift and Cellebrite software appear to be able to disable that Apple technology, allowing their devices to test thousands of passcodes, Mr. Green said.Cellebrite declined to comment. Grayshift did not respond to requests for comment.Opening locked iPhones through these methods has become more common, law enforcement officials said. Federal authorities, as well as large state and local police departments, typically have access to the tools, while smaller local agencies enlist the state or federal authorities to help on high-profile cases, they said.\u201cThey are blatantly protecting criminal activity, and only under the guise of privacy for their clients,\u201d he said.Michael Sachs, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said his office uses workarounds \u2014 he declined to specify which \u2014 to access locked iPhones several times a week. That has helped solve a series of cases in recent months, including by getting into an iPhone to find videos of a suspect sexually assaulting a child. The man was convicted this year.The encryption on smartphones applies only to data stored solely on the phone. Companies like Apple and Google regularly give law enforcement officials access to the data that consumers back up on their servers, such as via Apple\u2019s iCloud service. Apple said that since 2013, it has responded to more than 55,000 requests from the United States government seeking information about more than 208,000 devices, accounts or financial identifiers.Apple probably won\u2019t make it any easier for the police if not forced by Congress, given that it has made the privacy and security of iPhones a central selling point. But the company has complied with local laws that conflict with its privacy push. In China, for instance, Apple recently began storing its Chinese customers\u2019 data on Chinese-run servers because of a new law there.Apple\u2019s latest move is part of a longer cat-and-mouse game between tech companies and law enforcement, said Michelle Richardson, an analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which supports protections for online privacy.\u201cPeople always expected there would be this back-and-forth \u2014 that government would be able to hack into these devices, and then Apple would plug the hole and hackers would find another way in,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside a Heist of American Chip Designs, as China Bids for Tech Power", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJINJIANG, China \u2014 With a dragnet closing in, engineers at a Taiwanese chip maker holding American secrets did their best to conceal a daring case of corporate espionage.As the police raided their offices, human resources workers gave the engineers a warning to scramble and get rid of the evidence. USB drives, laptops and documents were handed to a lower-level employee, who hid them in her locker. Then she walked one engineer\u2019s phone out the front door.What those devices contained was more valuable than gold or jewels: designs from an American company, Micron Technology, for microchips that have helped power the global digital revolution. According to the Taiwanese authorities, the designs were bound for China, where they would help a new, $5.7 billion microchip factory the size of several airplane hangars rumble into production.Politicians in Washington and American companies accuse China of veering into intimidation and outright theft to get there. And they see Micron, an Idaho company whose memory chips give phones and computers the critical ability to store and quickly retrieve information, as a prime example of that aggression.Then Micron was the target of the heist in Taiwan, according to officials there and a lawsuit the company has brought against the Taiwanese company that employed the engineers, UMC, and the Chinese company it says wanted access to the technology, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company.Other companies may face predicaments similar to Micron\u2019s, industry experts said.One state-backed factory in the city of Wuhan, owned by Yangtze Memory Technology Company, or YMTC, will be turning out chips that look similar to those made by Samsung, the South Korean chip maker, said Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein.\u201cThe YMTC one is virtually identical to Samsung\u2019s, which makes it pretty clear they\u2019ve been copying,\u201d Mr. Newman said.China defends Made in China 2025 as necessary for its economic survival. It still depends on other countries for crucial goods like chips and software, and China is offering funding for homegrown labs and for entrepreneurs who hope to grab a piece of the future.American business groups worried about Made in China 2025 point to Micron. The account of its struggles was based on Taiwanese and American legal documents.In 2015, representatives from Tsinghua Unigroup, a Chinese chip maker with major state backing, approached Micron with an acquisition offer, which the company rejected. It later also turned down several partnership offers from Chinese companies out of concern for protecting its technology, said a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified because the person lacked authorization to speak publicly.That was when one Chinese company resorted to theft, Micron said in documents filed last December in Federal District Court for the Northern District of California.Micron\u2019s accusations focus on efforts by Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a state-backed chip maker, to build a $5.7 billion factory in China\u2019s Fujian Province. Two years ago, Jinhua tapped UMC, a Taiwanese company, to help it develop technology for the factory. Instead of going through the lengthy steps required to design the technology, Micron said in its suit, UMC and Jinhua decided to steal it.A UMC spokesman denied the allegations and declined to comment further. Jinhua did not respond to requests for comment.First, UMC lured away engineers from Micron\u2019s Taiwan operations with promises of raises and bonuses, according to the Taiwanese authorities. Then, it asked them to take some of Micron\u2019s secrets with them, according to Micron\u2019s court filings and the authorities. The engineers illegally took with them more than 900 files that contained key specifications and details about Micron\u2019s advanced memory chips, the authorities said.Micron grew suspicious, according to its court documents, after discovering that one of its departing engineers had turned to Google for instructions on how to wipe a company laptop. Later, at a recruiting event in the United States aimed at Micron employees, Jinhua and UMC showed PowerPoint slides that used Micron\u2019s internal code names when discussing future chips it would make, according to the court documents.Alerted by Micron, the Taiwanese police tapped the phone of one Micron engineer, Kenny Wang, who was being recruited by UMC. According to an indictment in Taiwan against Mr. Wang and others, UMC reached out to Mr. Wang in early 2016 using Line, the smartphone messaging app, while he was still working for Micron. UMC explained it was having problems developing its memory chip technology. Mr. Wang then grabbed the information it needed from Micron\u2019s servers, and later used it to help UMC\u2019s design. The police said Mr. Wang received a promotion at UMC.When investigators showed up at UMC\u2019s offices early last year, the police said, some employees rushed to hide what they had taken from Micron. Mr. Wang and another former Micron employee gave laptops, USB flash drives and documents to an assistant engineer, who locked them in her personal locker. She then left the office with Mr. Wang\u2019s phone \u2014 the one that the police had tapped, which was quickly tracked down.UMC filed its own criminal complaint against Mr. Wang last year, which Taiwanese prosecutors rejected. Mr. Wang and other engineers who were charged said they had taken the trade secrets for personal research. Mr. Wang did not respond to emails and phone calls for comment.In January, Micron was hit with a patent infringement suit by Jinhua and UMC over several types of memory. As part of the suit, the companies requested that the court bar Micron from making and selling the products and pay them damages. The case is being heard by a court in Fujian Province. The Fujian provincial government is an investor in Jinhua.In a letter sent to President Trump, Senators Jim Risch and Michael D. Crapo, Republicans of Idaho, expressed concern about the entire case and specifically the rapid pace with which the patent lawsuit has proceeded. The case could block Micron from selling some products in China.\u201cIf the case against Micron moves forward, and the Chinese government once again rules in favor of itself, it would cause substantial damage to Micron and the U.S. tech industry as a whole,\u201d said the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times.Jinhua and others are spending big to get there. In Jinjiang, a city in Fujian Province once known as a shoe-manufacturing center, Jinhua\u2019s new factory is almost finished. Rising five stories and stretching several football fields long, the structure boasts 100,000 square feet of new office space.Economic planners in Jinjiang said they were hoping to attract more talent from Taiwan. In addition to adding more flights there, the town was in the process of building out a bilingual international school, a hospital with international accreditation and upscale apartments. The new plant is just a short drive from the airport.\u201cMost of Made in China 2025 is likely to succeed. Not all technologies are rocket science,\u201d said Dan Wang, a technology analyst in Beijing with Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm. \u201cWith enough subsidies, Chinese firms have a good shot at catching up to the technological frontier.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instagram Allows Longer Videos in Challenge to YouTube", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Expanding further beyond its origins as an app for sharing pretty photos, Instagram said on Wednesday that it will now allow users to post videos up to an hour long, a feature that will thrust it into direct competition with YouTube and its own parent company, Facebook.At an event in San Francisco that was delayed about 45 minutes because of technical issues, Instagram said it was debuting IGTV, a new video section for videos that are shot vertically \u2014 which is how people typically record things on smartphones. The company said it would also begin offering IGTV as its own stand-alone app in the next few weeks.Instagram made the announcement at a morning event that had the look and feel of a late-night rave.For nearly an hour, tech industry reporters and social media stars waited in a neon-lit room pulsing with music spun by a live disc jockey. Food was served with Instagram-worthy presentations, including a do-it-yourself a\u00e7a\u00ed station featuring the on-trend breakfast smoothie bowl, and a toast bar which, naturally, featured avocado toast.A company spokesman attributed the long delay before the presentation started to \u201ctechnical difficulties,\u201d and just minutes before Instagram unveiled its push into longer videos, its own blog published the news first.In many ways, Instagram is what Facebook is not. Instagram is native to smartphones, attracts a younger, thought-to-be cooler audience and is popular among celebrities and influencers \u2014 all traits that serve as catnip for advertisers.The new push from Instagram is an acknowledgment of the changing nature of online video viewing. IGTV will feature videos shot vertically to fill the screens of smartphones versus the landscape orientation of televisions and computer monitors. In addition, it was reaching out to the new stars of today\u2019s digital video world \u2014 social media stars with millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram.\u201cVideo is the way we hang out with friends, the way we pass the time, but the way we watch it is changing,\u201d said Kevin Systrom, Instagram\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTeens might be watching less TV, but they\u2019re watching more creators online.\u201dInstagram and YouTube are the two main platforms where creators build an audience to make money from advertising, sponsorship deals or merchandise. As Instagram adds longer videos to its platform, YouTube has been adding social-network-like features to allow creators to communicate more easily with fans.YouTube splits advertising revenue with content creators, something that Instagram does not offer. Mr. Systrom said IGTV will not do advertising at first, but he noted that it wants to do what\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d for creators in the future.Lele Pons, who has 25 million followers on Instagram, took the stage at the event and said she will host a new cooking program for IGTV. At a news conference after the event, Ms. Pons said it was hard to predict how the longer video format on Instagram will change the viewing habits of her fans. She said she will continue to split her efforts \u201c50-50\u201d between YouTube and Instagram.Earlier this week, Facebook announced that it would allow video creators to work more directly with the company. It introduced Brand Collabs Manager, a platform to connect video creators with sponsorship opportunities, opening the door for those with popular followings to earn more through advertising revenue.Whereas Facebook and YouTube are plowing money into buying original content for their video platforms, Mr. Systrom said Instagram had no such plans, because it wants to remain \u201cneutral\u201d for creators.Mr. Systrom said Instagram already employs people to monitor inappropriate content, but would add employees because of the longer videos. He declined to say how many people would be added. (YouTube has been plagued by a deluge of troublesome videos that have driven some advertisers from the platform.)Instagram said it was limiting the number of users who can post hourlong videos, with most users capped at 10 minutes. But the limits are temporary, the company said, and the long term goal is for users to face no time limits.Advertisement"}

Even though I try to signal the difference with warnings like \u201cwonkish\u201d, I know that many readers still don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s a difference between stuff I write to deadline on Mondays and Thursdays and stuff I post when the mood strikes; I get complaints about \u201cwasting space\u201d even when no trees were killed in the making of a post that\u2019s technical, self-indulgent, or both.And to be fair, some of my off-schedule pieces \u2013 even fairly technical expositions \u2014 do end up being featured on the home page and even getting a lot of readers.Another reason was the political grimness of our times, which I have to admit put me out of the mood for music posts for a while.But I still find great comfort in music, maybe even especially in these times, and my mid-60s wannabe hipster tastes are still expanding. So I\u2019ll try to share a few of the bands I\u2019m listening to these days, beginning with Chvrches.

Also, in principle I should dislike the idea of a synth-driven band with two guys doing the instrumentals while a pretty young woman does the singing.

{"Headline": "Firefox Is Back. It\u2019s Time to Give It a Try.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixDo you ever feel that the web is breaking?When shopping online for a toaster oven, you can expect an ad for that oven to stalk you from site to site. If you have just a few web browser tabs open, your laptop battery drains rapidly. And don\u2019t get me started on those videos that automatically play when you\u2019re scrolling through a webpage.The web has reached a new low. It has become an annoying, often toxic and occasionally unsafe place to hang out. More important, it has become an unfair trade: You give up your privacy online, and what you get in return are somewhat convenient services and hyper-targeted ads.Mozilla recently hit the reset button on Firefox. About two years ago, six Mozilla employees were huddled around a bonfire one night in Santa Cruz, Calif., when they began discussing the state of web browsers. Eventually, they concluded there was a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the web.\u201cIf they don\u2019t trust the web, they won\u2019t use the web,\u201d Mark Mayo, Mozilla\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. \u201cThat just felt to us like that actually might be the direction we\u2019re going. And so we started to think about tools and architectures and different approaches.\u201dMost notably, Firefox now offers privacy tools, like a built-in feature for blocking ad trackers and a \u201ccontainer\u201d that can be installed to prevent Facebook from monitoring your activities across the web. Most other browsers don\u2019t include those features.After testing Firefox for the last three months, I found it to be on a par with Chrome in most categories. In the end, Firefox\u2019s thoughtful privacy features persuaded me to make the switch and make it my primary browser.Here\u2019s why you should consider it, too.Firefox especially stood out for some privacy features that are baked into the browser. Inside the privacy settings, you can turn on tracking protection, which blocks online trackers from collecting your browser data across multiple websites. With Chrome, you can install a third-party extension to block trackers \u2014 but the fewer add-ons you have to tack onto your browser, the better.Security experts applauded Mozilla for stepping up its efforts on privacy.\u201cFirefox does seem to have positioned itself as the privacy-friendly browser, and they have been doing a fantastic job improving security as well,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights nonprofit. \u201cOn the other hand, Google is fundamentally an advertising company, so it\u2019s unlikely that they will ever have a business interest in making Chrome more privacy friendly.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t have privacy without security on the web,\u201d said Parisa Tabriz, a director of engineering for Google who specializes in security.In fact, both Chrome and Firefox have tough security. Both include sandboxing, which isolates processes of the browser so a harmful website doesn\u2019t infect other parts of your machine. So if you loaded a website with malicious code, it would be contained within the webpage so it couldn\u2019t infect your files, webcam and microphone.Google said there was one thing it could do better on: the inclusion of privacy settings to block tracking technology, similar to the tools that Firefox includes.\u201cI think that\u2019s something that we can improve on,\u201d Ms. Tabriz said. \u201cFirefox has some settings that we\u2019re also exploring.\u201dWhich browser is faster?Mozilla\u2019s promise that Firefox consumes less computer memory raises hopes that it should also use less battery life. Yet in my tests on a laptop running a script that automatically reloaded the top 10 news sites, Firefox lasted only a few minutes longer than Chrome before the battery was depleted. On another test, which involved streaming a Netflix video on a loop on each browser, the battery lasted about 20 minutes longer when the Chrome browser was used.Yet the path forward for Mozilla looks increasingly promising for consumers.In addition to the normal Firefox browser, Mozilla offers Firefox Focus, a privacy-centric mobile browser that blocks trackers by default and purges your web browsing history as soon as you close out of a page.These are privacy-conscious web products that Mozilla is in a position to expand on in the long term. The nonprofit has no direct relationship with advertisers; it gets a small sum from search providers like Google and Bing when a search is conducted through their sites using a Firefox product.For Mozilla, there\u2019s a plus side to being the underdog.\u201cThe advantage of when you get beaten down is you kind of drop some of your own ego around your decisions,\u201d Mr. Mayo said. \u201cWe had a lot less to lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Twitter Save the Dictionary?", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the industry struggles, these thirsty dictionary empires battle peppily for online dominance.Back in February 2016, the Merriam-Webster Twitter account began gunning for the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump.Merriam-Webster had about 80,000 followers on Twitter when Lauren Naturale, now 35, took over the account the month before.She said Ms. Schneider told her multiple times that a change in the direction of the feed was needed and implied that Ms. Naturale was trying to advance her own personal political agenda. She quit in part because, she said, Ms. Schneider was upset by the idea that Merriam-Webster was being seen as a politically progressive dictionary.\u201cEvery time we were in the news it was a new crisis,\u201d Ms. Naturale said. \u201cIt was treated like it was a disaster for the company.\u201dLauren Sliter, who oversees the site\u2019s marketing and content strategy, said the company had not taken social media seriously until about a year and a half ago. She first started to understand how her team could work off the news after President Trump was inaugurated and Dictionary.com saw a spike in searches for the word \u201cmisogynist.\u201d\u201cBeing able to go into a forum like Twitter and tell that story, let people connect those dots, was a really interesting thing,\u201d Ms. Sliter said.Their tweets, which are sourced from Dictionary.com, are not always as reliable as one might hope a dictionary would be. The Ambien tweet relies on an inaccurate supposition. Ambien\u2019s maker, Sanofi, says the name is a combination of \u201ca.m.,\u201d as in morning, and \u201cbien,\u201d from the French word for good.Ms. Sliter acknowledges that her company\u2019s Twitter strategy is similar to Merriam-Webster\u2019s, though she says that Dictionary.com is more self-deprecating, and more focused on talking about the news and trends. So \u2026 do the two dictionaries get along?\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not mortal enemies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re kind of like compatriots in a way. We\u2019re working together, we\u2019re doing very similar things.\u201dMs. Schneider said that while imitation was the sincerest form of flattery, she didn\u2019t think the two accounts were comparable. Merriam-Webster, she said, has \u201cmore rigor.\u201dGrant Barrett, a former lexicographer for the Oxford and Cambridge University presses and a host of the radio show \u201cA Way With Words,\u201d agreed with Ms. Schneider. He said that Ms. Naturale had done a good job of capturing the wry, dry way dictionary editors joke with one another and that, by contrast, Dictionary.com\u2019s tweets were often \u201ctoo on the nose.\u201dJohn Cheney-Lippold, a professor of American culture at the University of Michigan who specializes in digital media, said that dictionaries had a particular interest in promoting their brands since President Trump catalyzed a post-truth news environment. \u201cThey are trying valiantly to reassert themselves as the epistemic chiefs of the world,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019re engaging more people, but is that translating to sales?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

People who value their privacy come from all demographic groups, but the impact of consumer tracking varies greatly by race, class and power. When you\u2019re the \u201cright\u201d race, gender and sexual orientation, when you\u2019ve got the right schools and jobs on your profile, marketers use tracking to flatter and include you. When you\u2019re not, tracking is more likely to be used to exclude or exploit you. This disparate impact is a civil rights issue, and it should be treated like one by Congress.It\u2019s one thing to receive junk mail or phone calls because you\u2019re on one of those lists. But the sophisticated, real-time ad targeting developed by Facebook and other companies takes this marketing to another level.

{"Headline": "Asteroids and Adversaries: Challenging What NASA Knows About Space Rocks", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "Two years ago, NASA dismissed and mocked an amateur\u2019s criticisms of its asteroids database. Now Nathan Myhrvold is back, and his papers have passed peer review.Supported byThousands of asteroids are passing through Earth\u2019s neighborhood all the time. Although the odds of a direct hit on the planet any time soon are slim, even a small asteroid the size of a house could explode with as much energy as an atomic bomb.So scientists at NASA are charged with scanning the skies for such dangerous space rocks. If one were on a collision course with our planet, information about how big it is and what it\u2019s made of would be essential for deflecting it, or calculating the destruction if it hits.For the last couple of years, Nathan P. Myhrvold, a former chief technologist at Microsoft with a physics doctorate from Princeton, has roiled the small, congenial community of asteroid scientists by saying they know less than they think about these near-Earth objects. He argues that a trove of data from NASA they rely on is flawed and unreliable.Since 2011, a NASA project known as Neowise has cataloged the sizes and reflectivity of 158,000 asteroids, and it claimed that its diameter estimates were often within 10 percent of the actual size. Dr. Myhrvold said the uncertainties were much greater, largely because NASA researchers were using data from a satellite designed for observing distant objects, not nearby asteroids. \u201cThe science is terrible,\u201d he said.Now his arguments have been published in Icarus, one of planetary science\u2019s most prestigious journals.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten people to agree I was right,\u201d Dr. Myhrvold said.\u201cThe Neowise team stands by its data and scientific findings that have been published in several peer-reviewed journal articles,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cNASA is confident the processes and analyses performed by the Neowise team are valid, as verified by independent researchers.\u201dIn an email, Edward L. Wright, a University of California, Los Angeles scientist who served as the principal investigator for the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, the mission that Neowise grew out of, disputed some technical aspects of Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s paper. He said one section about the error analysis was \u201ca waste of paper.\u201dHe did not respond to further emails.Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s findings pose a challenge to a proposed NASA asteroid-finding mission called Neocam, short for Near-Earth Object Camera, which would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars. A congressional committee that controls NASA\u2019s purse strings just included $10 million more in a budget bill for the development of Neocam.The same scientist, Amy Mainzer of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., is the principal investigator for both Neowise and Neocam. NASA said she was unavailable for comment.At least one scientist at NASA found merit in Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s pursuit. David Morrison, a planetary scientist at the space agency\u2019s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. said of the scientific issues raised in the papers: \u201cFor the most part, I think Myhrvold is correct.\u201d\u201cI do think it\u2019s valuable for someone, a smart outsider, to go in and analyze data that are important,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, who is not involved with Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s research or Neowise. \u201cThat has to help science. That cannot be a bad thing.\u201dThe squabble revolves around data collected by NASA\u2019s WISE spacecraft, which scanned the skies beginning in 2009, taking pictures of hundreds of millions of distant galaxies and stars.Asteroids were also whizzing through WISE\u2019s field of view, and the Neowise project was established to analyze them.By looking at heat radiated by asteroids, it is possible to estimate an asteroid\u2019s size and the reflectivity of its surface. The Neowise data is by the far the largest collection, and hundreds of scientific papers have cited those findings.When Dr. Myhrvold made his initial claims, the Neowise scientists made fun of a few errors like an equation that mixed up radius and diameter.Dr. Mainzer also said at the time, \u201cWe believe at this point it\u2019s best to allow the process of peer review \u2014 the foundation of the scientific process \u2014 to move forward.\u201dAmong them is the case of the copied numbers.The Neowise researchers\u2019 model was calibrated with diameters for about a hundred asteroids that have been measured by radar, visiting spacecraft or when an asteroid passed in front of a distant star.When the scientists reported their findings, they did not include the estimates produced by their models, which would have given a sense of how good the model is. Instead they included the earlier measurements.Other astronomers agreed that the Neowise scientists were not clear about what numbers they were reporting.\u201cThey did some kind of dumb things,\u201d said Alan W. Harris, a retired NASA asteroid expert who was one of the reviewers of Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s second paper.Dr. Myhrvold has accused the Neowise scientists of going into a NASA archive of planetary results, changing some of the copied numbers and deleting others without giving notice. \u201cThey went back and rewrote history,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it shows is even this far in, they\u2019re still lying. They haven\u2019t come clean.\u201dDr. Harris said he did not see nefarious behavior by the Neowise scientists, but agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s still weird.\u201dDr. Myhrvold also contends that Neowise set up arbitrary rules for deciding which data to keep and disregard and that they did not describe their methods in enough detail for other scientists to replicate.The tussle has spilled from scientific journals and conferences into contentious letters from lawyers. Dr. Myhrvold has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for information and algorithms that he said would be needed to properly check the Neowise findings.Dr. Myhrvold said NASA and Congress should put planning for the proposed Neocam spacecraft on hold, because it could suffer from the same shortfalls as Neowise. \u201cWhy does it get to avoid further scrutiny and just get money directly from Congress?\u201d he asked.He also said a ground-based observatory, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, already under construction, will accomplish much of Neocam\u2019s mission.In his email, Dr. Wright said Dr. Myhrvold had taken an \u201cadversarial approach.\u201d Dr. Myhrvold, in turn, noted Dr. Wright\u2019s earlier disparaging comments.This rancor perplexes other asteroid researchers.\u201cIt\u2019s a strange story,\u201d Dr. Morrison said. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like this in my field.\u201dThe editors of Icarus now anticipate a rebuttal by Dr. Mainzer after she initially passed on an invitation several months ago to write one.But the analysis was limited to asteroids with the most reliable long-wavelength infrared measurements by WISE, a tiny fraction of the 158,000 that Neowise had analyzed.In follow-up research, Dr. Myhrvold wants to show how the work of Neowise could be better done. He has started collaborating with Jean-Luc Margot, the chairman of the earth, planetary and space sciences department at U.C.L.A. and a colleague of Dr. Wright\u2019s. (Dr. Myhrvold has also given $350,000 to the university, his alma mater. The money will support graduate student research in Dr. Margot\u2019s department, although not necessarily on asteroids.)Dr. Margot said that in preliminary work, he and his students have already reproduced some of Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s results.Unlike Dr. Myhrvold, Dr. Margot said he has had productive conversations with Dr. Wright and others from Neowise. \u201cI have not detected any discomfort,\u201d Dr. Margot said. \u201cI start from the assumption that everyone wants the best out of the data.\u201dDr. Myhrvold thinks there are discoveries in the Neowise data, hidden in what was thrown away during the analysis. \u201cMaybe there are new classes of asteroids out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the only thing we\u2019re going to have for a long time. We ought to get it right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If the American internet giant wants that to change someday, then half a billion dollars\u2019 worth of good will couldn\u2019t hurt.The companies did not provide details of the projects. According to a JD.com spokesman, the deal will give Google less than 1 percent of the Chinese retailer\u2019s shares, which trade on the Nasdaq.Google pulled its search engine out of China in 2010, deciding that it would no longer censor its own search results as required by Beijing. But lately, the company has been looking for other ways to serve the planet\u2019s largest population of internet users.The company never quit China entirely, despite its travails. It has hundreds of employees working on research and product development in the country, which has become a major fount of engineering and scientific talent. Its online advertising business helps Chinese companies reach customers overseas.Still, mounting a broader return to the Chinese market would not be easy for Google, even if the authorities were to permit it. In the eight years since the company withdrew from China, local rivals have created formidable products in many areas in which it competes, including search, chat, video streaming and cloud computing.JD.com, meanwhile, is apparently hoping that Google\u2019s global reach will help it sell more products internationally. The company already counts Walmart as a major shareholder. It has extended its reach into Southeast Asia, setting up a local retail business in Indonesia, becoming a partner on an e-commerce venture in Thailand and backing another one in Vietnam.Across the world, however, JD.com will face tough competition. Alibaba, the Chinese internet behemoth, has poured billions of dollars into its Southeast Asian shopping site, Lazada, and is strengthening its logistics capabilities in that region, Europe and the Middle East.Advertisement"}

And they are up 45 percent from the depths of the housing crisis in 2012.The big rebound in home prices and the lure of making a quick buck drew more than 200 people on Tuesday to a MidtownManhattan hotel for a two-hour free class on flipping houses. The lunchtime program I dropped in on was part of a sophisticated come-on for a paid three-day workshop that Nathaniel \u201cThan\u201d Merrill and his FortuneBuilders company plan to hold in the New York metropolitan area. An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience. The instructor at the afternoon session sought to inspire the crowd, saying that if they only had the courage, they could someday quit their day jobs and live the way they always wanted to. Judging by the enthusiastic reaction, many were buying the message.- Matthew GoldsteinThe Chinese market is valuable and distinctive from the rest of the world. Arm believes this joint venture, which will license Arm semiconductor technology to Chinese companies and locally develop Arm technology in China, will expand Arm\u2019s opportunities in the Chinese market.Arm estimates that 95 percent of all advanced chips designed in China last year were based on its technology. With China desperate to make its own chips in volume, and quickly (there\u2019s more on that theme below), the move could prove shrewd.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation is rushing to build semiconductor factories. But reports claiming that the Chinese government is probing chip makers over price-fixing demonstrate that it\u2019s not there yet.Reuters notes that, according to Trendforce, China accounts for 20 percent of all global DRAM memory sales. For now, those purchases must be made almost entirely from Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, at what the Chinese government appears to believe may be inflated prices.China\u2019s own production plants \u2014 and carefully controlled pricing \u2014 clearly can\u2019t come soon enough.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe hire shows Washington is becoming more intertwined with corporate America, as the state intervenes in M.&A. and other business dealings. George Sard, the firm\u2019s C.E.O., told Michael de la Merced that the government \u201cis pretty central to everything we\u2019re doing.\u201dJames Davis, the executive vice president of Freedom Partners, said the campaign was \u201ca demonstration of our long-term commitment to advance common-sense trade policies that will ensure America\u2019s brightest days are ahead, and to directly confront the protectionist ideas that would hold us back.\u201dSome highlights from Apple\u2019s annual developer conference yesterday:For Microsoft, the deal continues its break with the past.

But under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft is transforming itself into a cloud provider for businesses \u2014 and even adopting open-source technology. GitHub fits that vision neatly.Unless Microsoft treads carefully, some could flee to rival repositories like BitBucket or GitLab, which has seen a big spike in traffic since news of the deal broke.\u201cOf course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What has happened in the city since then? Sabrina Tavernise, a national correspondent for The New York Times, and Lynsea Garrison, a producer for \u201cThe Daily,\u201d examine the question in this five-part audio series about a Baltimore teenager known as Nook, who was fatally shot by a police officer a year and a half after Mr. Gray\u2019s death.JUDGE SHIRLEY M. WATTS: Good morning. ATTENDEES: Good morning.WATTS: Are you ready? CATHERINE E. PUGH: Mhmm.WATTS: Let us begin. Catherine E. Pugh, please raise your right hand and repeat after me. Raise your right hand.PUGH: Left. Oh, the right. I was putting it on the Bible.SABRINA TAVERNISE: So when a new mayor comes in at the end of 2016, the violence in Baltimore is some of the worst the city\u2019s ever seen. WATTS: I \u2014\u2014PUGH: I \u2014\u2014WATTS: State your name.PUGH: Catherine Elizabeth Pugh.WATTS: Do solemnly swear \u2014\u2014PUGH: Do solemnly swear.TAVERNISE: And a week after this new mayor, Catherine Pugh, was sworn in, Nook was shot. He was one of the last killings of the year. So the homicides were urgent. But so was reform.PUGH: There\u2019s been issues around policing in Baltimore for quite some time \u2014 mass incarceration, lack of trust, lack of technology in our police department.TAVERNISE: A few months ago, we went to see her and the police commissioner, Darryl De Sousa, to ask them what had been done.DE SOUSA: We had to recreate the policy on seatbelt use, put cameras in our vans.PUGH: And then we went through the process of selecting a monitor, creating a community oversight group \u2014\u2014[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: So they give us a list of the things that the department was doing, to show us that the city was really serious about change.DE SOUSA: We started a police basketball league, a commissioner\u2019s basketball league, where we have 500 kids. I personally was part of a listening tour where I went to three different middle schools. A lot of people don\u2019t know we have flag football. We do, we do tons of things. Building curriculums \u2026 and we talk about going to the African American Cultural Museum of History. ...TAVERNISE: They were trying to get out there, show that they were different, that they were really serious about wanting to change.PUGH: We want our neighborhoods to be safe. We want them to be protected. We want violence to go down. And community engagement will make a difference in what Baltimore becomes in the future.DE SOUSA: I think that we are taking steps in the right direction.PUGH: And I think we\u2019re headed in the right direction.TAVERNISE: So things seemed to be moving the right direction \u2014 forward.[REPORTER: Now, to a shocking corruption scandal in Baltimore. Seven police officers indicted on federal charges accused of stealing money from innocent people.][MUSIC]TAVERNISE: But then something happens that just sets everything back. It literally just turns back the clock. Indictments are announced against an elite group of Baltimore police officers, the Gun Trace Task Force.[REPORTER: The alleged stealing from city residents was rampant.][KEVIN DAVIS: They\u2019re 1930s-style gangsters, as far as I\u2019m concerned.][REPORTER: And authorities say there was a widespread cover-up.]TAVERNISE: This group was formed in 2007, at the peak of zero tolerance. These officers had been on the front lines of it, but they\u2019d also been doing something else. They\u2019d been stealing from residents.REPORTER: The jury was chosen yesterday. The trial is expected to last three to four weeks.TAVERNISE: This is suddenly a whole new level of bad for the Baltimore Police Department. This isn\u2019t just unfair policing. This is the police turning into criminals themselves. And the week we met Davetta in the library for the first time, these officers were being tried \u2014 eight of them \u2014 mostly on racketeering charges.[MIKE HELLGREN, WJZ: This is Mike Hellgren here outside the federal courthouse this morning. Opening statements are scheduled for this morning in the police corruption trial involving the Gun Trace Task Force, and we\u2019ll be bringing you updates throughout the day here on WJZ. That\u2019s the latest from the federal courthouse.]TAVERNISE: So I walked to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, a big federal building in downtown Baltimore. I met the two prosecutors behind the case. LEO WISE: So ultimately there were, we found over 25 \u2014 this is Leo Wise \u2014 over 25 robberies. TAVERNISE: Can you say it again?WISE: Sure. Sorry, this is Leo Wise.TAVERNISE: Leo Wise and Derek Hines.DEREK HINES: Traffic stop \u2014 this is Derek Hines \u2014 the traffic stop \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: The city calls them the Twin Towers of Justice. They\u2019re really tall and really skinny, and they\u2019re building this case that would eventually lay bare this entire network of crimes that this plainclothes unit had perpetrated for years. [POLICE OFFICER: Sarge!][MUSIC]TAVERNISE: And this is what they bring out in court for all of Baltimore to see. [POLICE OFFICER: Sarge! Hey. You \u2014 hey. Listen. Listen. Where he got in an accident, they\u2019re not going to look at that. You gonna \u2014 ]TAVERNISE: So these police officers, they were operating like a criminal organization. They were going out, planting guns on people, planting evidence. And then stealing from their homes, stealing from their cars, stealing from their wallets.[RADIO CHATTER]TAVERNISE: They were acting with absolute impunity, and they were acting for years.[POLICE OFFICER: So how \u2019bout we just go on the scene, and just act, like, \u201cOh, is everything O.K.?\u201d Get what I\u2019m saying?]TAVERNISE: So these guys, they had the tools of the trade. They had big duffel bags in the back of their cars full of masks, bats, ropes, brass knuckles. It was like they were going to rob banks. They also carried BB guns to plant on people.[POLICE OFFICER: That\u2019s when you know, \u201cOh, well, we were here!\u201d]TAVERNISE: So for example, in one case, the time they had actually stolen the most money was from a man named Oreese Stevenson. He was a drug dealer. And they found several hundred thousand dollars in a safe in his basement. They found the safe, found the money. They took a bunch of it. And then they filmed on their phones a video of them pretending to open it and find it for the first time, and leave the money untouched.[POLICE OFFICER: Hey, yeah, yeah. Get that open here. Hey, Sarge! POLICE OFFICER: Hey, come downstairs, right quick. They about to get it open. Hold up, hold up, hold \u2014\u2014POLICE OFFICER: All right, hold up, hold on, hold on. Take it out, take it out. POLICE OFFICER: Oh, there it is.POLICE OFFICER: Whew! POLICE OFFICER: Hold on, hold on. I need lights. Somebody got a flashlight?JENKINS: How much do you think it is? Don\u2019t touch it \u2014 stand next to it. We\u2019re calling up the feds.]TAVERNISE: They were just making up a scene to give to their superiors to pretend that they\u2019d found exactly the amount that was in there, when in fact, they had already stolen two-thirds of it.[POLICE OFFICER: I see a lot of hundreds.POLICE OFFICER: Yes, sir.]TAVERNISE: Another time, one of them got his cousin and a friend to dress up as police officers. [DONNA CURRY: I\u2019m the owner of Patapsco Feed and Supply pigeon store on Patapsco Avenue.]TAVERNISE: He\u2019d gotten word that a woman who owned a pigeon store was about to pay her taxes, and she probably had $20,000 at home. [CURRY: We had a knock at the door where two men dressed as police came into my home, had paperwork. We\u2019re assuming that they were the police.]TAVERNISE: So his cousin and his friend, dressed as police officers, go into her house in the middle of the night and take the $20,000 out of her wallet. [CURRY: Without me seeing, he took and picked my pocketbook up and took my pocketbook into the kitchen.]TAVERNISE: Pretending that they\u2019re investigating something.WISE: And then it also became clear they were not only stealing money, they were also stealing drugs. So the case took another turn. Because it\u2019s one thing to steal money, right, but another to steal drugs, \u2018cause if you steal drugs, you have to resell them for them to be of any value. So then the question became, \u201cWell, how are they reselling the drugs?\u201d[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: The answer came at one of the most dramatic moments at the trial, when a bail bondsman named Donald Stepp took the stand. He lived in Baltimore County, and he said Wayne Jenkins, head of the Gun Trace Task Force, would bring bags of drugs into his shed almost every night \u2014 drugs that he\u2019d stolen from dealers across Baltimore. He said he\u2019d leave the shed open so that Jenkins could have easy access. [SOUND OF PROTESTS]TAVERNISE: He even brought two trash bags full of prescription drugs during the looting after Freddie Gray\u2019s funeral. Remember those pharmacies that were looted? That\u2019s where they came from. WISE: I mean, money is money, right? But to actively be robbing people, taking drugs and then reselling them, means these officers are actively participating in the crime we have in our city.TAVERNISE: And they weren\u2019t just stealing from drug dealers. They were very deliberately targeting people with criminal records. One of those people was Ronald Hamilton.RONALD HAMILTON: Yes, we was shopping at Home Depot. Me and my wife was looking for blinds.TAVERNISE: He\u2019s a car salesman, and he was called to the witness stand during the trial.HAMILTON: As we looking at the blinds, we sitting down at the desk.TAVERNISE: So he\u2019s with his wife, and he notices that a guy in the next aisle is just constantly staring at him.HAMILTON: The way he was staring at \u2014 he had a good visual on me.TAVERNISE: The guy, like, is standing in the soap aisle, and he just doesn\u2019t move.TAVERNISE: And when he leaves with his wife \u2014\u2014HAMILTON: Made a left, then made a right where the cleaners at. As soon I pulled in, they surrounding my car. It was, like, five police officers.TAVERNISE: So suddenly, his car was surrounded by, like, four or five police officers, and he\u2019s completely confused.HAMILTON: I thought I made an illegal turn or something. I don\u2019t know what was really going through my mind. But when he grabbed me, he said, \u201cWhere your money at?\u201d That was the first question he asked me. I say, \u201cWhat?\u201d So I had, like, $3,000 in my pocket, like, $3,400. He takes that and stuck it in his vest, the top of his vest. He puts me in the car. They take my car, they put my wife in another vehicle. They drive me to this training facility.TAVERNISE: And they take him to a large sort of warehouse-type thing about 20 minutes away.[PHONE RINGING][JENKINS: What\u2019s up, J?POLICE OFFICER: Hey, what\u2019s up? We are headed down now. We got \u2014\u2014 ]TAVERNISE: So they called Jenkins, the ringleader, to tell him they have Ronald.[JENKINS: What\u2019s their age? Are they sitting in the car with you?POLICE OFFICER: Yeah, I got, I got the male, and they got the female. JENKINS: O.K. Hey, did you tell them, did you tell them anything at all? POLICE OFFICER: No. JENKINS: All right, just tell them you gotta wait for the U.S. attorney, who\u2019s one of the task force.POLICE OFFICER: That\u2019s what I did. Yeah, we went, yeah, we wanna meet up with you, and we wanna talk. That\u2019s right. JENKINS: O.K., and when I get there, treat me like I\u2019m ... Like, \u201cHey, sir, how are you? We got our target in hostage.\u201d And then introduce me as the U.S. attorney. POLICE OFFICER: I got you.JENKINS: All right, dog.]HAMILTON: I\u2019m handcuffed. I get out of the car. As they walk me in there, he walks up to me, Officer Jenkins. He introduced himself as a federal agent. I said, \u201cO.K.\u201dTAVERNISE: And he looks at Ronald, and he says, \u201cWe got you.\u201dTAVERNISE: A bunch of controlled buys \u2014 basically, that means an undercover cop buys drugs from a drug dealer and then arrests him.TAVERNISE: And they\u2019re putting on this whole show for him. They have all these files that are just completely fake. Nothing about him in the file at all. HAMILTON: Throwing them in front of me, like, \u201cOh, we got you. We got you.\u201d I said, \u201cO.K., I ain\u2019t doing nothing, so I don\u2019t care what you say.\u201dTAVERNISE: They say, \u201cOh, we know all your history. We know you really well. We\u2019ve been following this for months.\u201d And Ronald isn\u2019t buying it.TAVERNISE: So then they get all blustery. They take him out, put him back in the car.HAMILTON: He puts my wife in the car with me. I\u2019m thinking we\u2019re going towards 83, to go downtown. I ask them, \u201cWhere we going at?\u201d They say, \u201cTo your house.\u201d I say, \u201cFor what? If you have me in handcuffs, you got me under three controlled buys, why are you not taking me to the court?\u201dTAVERNISE: So Ronald looks at his wife, and then he looks back at them.HAMILTON: I knew they was fishy. Once I realized they was taking me to my house, I knew they was up to something. So I leaned over to my wife, and I said, \u201cJust be quiet. They about to rob me.\u201d She was like, \u201cWhat?\u201dTAVERNISE: So they get to the house, and Ronald and his wife are in the back seat. And his wife\u2019s children are at home.TAVERNISE: And the cops bring them in and put them on a love seat in the living room, handcuff them together, and then go upstairs and start searching.TAVERNISE: They\u2019re looking for money. They\u2019re looking for drugs. They\u2019re sure he has drugs in the house.HAMILTON: So they was just going through my house, searching, searching, \u2018cause I\u2019m in my family room, so you can hear them just walking back and forth. Kept bringing me downstairs, like, \u201cWhere the money at? Where the drugs?\u201d I said, \u201cMan, I don\u2019t sell no drugs, man.\u201d I said, \u201cTold on me doing what? I don\u2019t do anything, I sell cars, man. I gamble, sell cars. What do I do?\u201dTAVERNISE: The house is clean. There are no drugs there. But they do find money that he said he has from his car business and from gambling.HAMILTON: I don\u2019t have nothing in here. You didn\u2019t find nothing, no guns, no \u2014 nothing illegal was in my house. Nothing.TAVERNISE: They find $50,000. And they take it.[MUSIC]HAMILTON: I would\u2019ve went to jail for something that never, ever happened. But one police officer telling his story against me? Who you think the public going to believe? TAVERNISE: And this was something that we heard from a lot of people in Baltimore. Drug dealers were robbed, but they had nowhere to go. No legal recourse. No one believed them. We heard this story of one drug dealer who got his money stolen by the task force. But he owed it to someone else. And when they came to collect the debt and didn\u2019t find it, they killed him. Ronald was a perfect target for the task force. He used to sell drugs. Think about it. If he had fought this, and the cops had fought back, by planting drugs on him or something, who\u2019s going to win?TAVERNISE: This whole thing, it\u2019s really messed with Ronald\u2019s head. His wife\u2019s, too.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: You know, it\u2019s, like, something you just don\u2019t think of ever happening in the United States, you know?HAMILTON: Why? TAVERNISE: I don\u2019t know. \u2018Cause it just \u2014 do you think you could ever trust the police again, Ronald?TAVERNISE: They just had this power over people in that way.HAMILTON: No, they had more than power. More than power.TAVERNISE: What\u2019d they have?HAMILTON: They had kryptonite. Them cops did everything they could possibly do to everybody in this city. And everybody that went to jail \u2014 there\u2019s people, it\u2019s people that went to jail for something that never ever, ever, ever took place, and all because a guy in a badge got up there and said it.[MUSIC]HELLGREN: I\u2019m Mike Hellgren, back at the federal courthouse this morning for the second week in the police corruption trial of detectives \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: Walking around Baltimore during the trial, it was the talk of the town. But no one seemed surprised. No one living in West Baltimore, anyway. People said, \u201cOh yeah, we know about that. They\u2019ve been doing that for years.\u201dUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You had corrupt cops forever. You know what I mean. Long after this, there\u2019s still going to be corrupt cops.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Police doing a lot of corrupt stuff nowadays. Robbing people \u2014 they might as well be selling drugs and get the money. They sure is taking it and putting it in they pocket.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: It\u2019s been happening, but nobody believed it, because if you an addict or a seller, and the police \u2014 who, who they going to believe, you or the police?UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You can\u2019t trust them! You can\u2019t trust them. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: These were the people that were sworn in to protect you, and they out here doing most of the dirt their own self.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: So that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t surprised, \u2018cause it\u2019s been happening since the beginning of time. They just bringing it out. TAVERNISE: So the Gun Trace Task Force was formed when Nook was about 9. Zero tolerance was in full swing. The unit was tasked to do exactly as its name suggests: to track down guns and get them off the street. And they were getting results, boosting statistics. And they were getting rewarded for it.SGT. LOUIS HOPSON: They say, \u201cLook. Look at what we\u2019re doing, look how many guns we got.\u201d They don\u2019t ask you how they got them. You just show the stats. And remember, a lot of these young officers get seduced. So say we\u2019re in a five- or six-man unit. One guy in that unit gets a gun. So you might have a sergeant say, \u201cO.K., every gun you get, you get two free days.\u201d You know what I\u2019m saying? TAVERNISE: Really? But isn\u2019t that just their job to get the gun? Why, why do they get a free day for that?HOPSON: Because they can. This is, this is part of the seduction.TAVERNISE: And so the other thing the prosecutors revealed was that beyond stealing from ordinary people, these cops were stealing from the state.WISE: We also, at one point, discovered that they weren\u2019t really working very much, and so they were also charged with just massive overtime fraud. They were sometimes doubling their salary in a year and making $165,000 by claiming to work when they didn\u2019t, claiming to be making arrests when they weren\u2019t. It came out at trial, one officer was working on his house, basically, for a month and pulling down a salary, and didn\u2019t really set foot in the city with the exception of a handful of days in that whole month.TAVERNISE: They built decks, additions on their houses, had fancy cars, said they were at work when they were actually on vacation at the beach. Really egregious violations.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: So this whole time, we were asking ourselves, \u201cHow could this possibly have happened?\u201d I mean, you had all of this scrutiny \u2014 a Department of Justice investigation, the city soul-searching and looking inside itself to figure out how to change its police department. Meanwhile, these guys were out in masks with baseball bats stealing from people in broad daylight.HOPSON: You wanna find corruption? Follow the money trail. It\u2019s always about the money. Especially in Baltimore City, especially in the Baltimore City Police Department. It\u2019s about the money. It always has been. Every time you talk about policing, and they talk about statistics, this is about money, period. You know how many people\u2019s lives have been ruined? Do you know how many people probably in jail, when they shouldn\u2019t be in jail? How many people they planted drugs on? These units, I can go back \u2014 I\u2019m going to tell you a real quick story.TAVERNISE: O.K.HOPSON: If you wanna know how we got here, like the murders and the corruptions, this is \u2014 it\u2019ll probably make a best seller one day, to be honest with you.TAVERNISE: So there\u2019s a very complex explanation that\u2019s incredibly important.HOPSON: They\u2019ve been doing this for years, over and over again, where they get caught and just change the name of the unit. And every plainclothes unit that got caught, just like this last one here, what they would do was, is they would wait a couple of months. They just change the name of the unit and start doing it again.TAVERNISE: And that\u2019s because of this long, deep history in the Baltimore police, where they\u2019re doing something wrong, they get caught, they close ranks, they shut down people who speak up \u2014 like Sgt. Lou Hopson. HOPSON: When I got promoted, 1993, I went to a district that was basically an all-white district. They used to call it \u201cthe country club.\u201d When I first got there my first day, and I was in my cubicle, about four or five white sergeants came in, asking, \u201cWhat, why are you over here?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, this is where they promoted me and sat me.\u201d One of them said, \u201cWell, you know, we don\u2019t really want your kind over here.\u201d So I said, I said to them, \u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s not your decision to make.\u201d TAVERNISE: So what did they say?HOPSON: Well, you know, it was just a whole lot of N-words and things of this nature.TAVERNISE: This is 1993.TAVERNISE: My God.HOPSON: And so, you know, what they try to do is intimidate you to lose it, and use that to get rid of you. You know what, you pushed the wrong buttons here.TAVERNISE: So Sgt. Hopson filed a complaint. HOPSON: Then it really started pumping up.TAVERNISE: And when word spread, he had an even harder time. His case was basically ignored, and then eventually shut. HOPSON: I had an officer come to me, 2003, I think it was.TAVERNISE: He told us many stories like this. Where an officer spoke up about something, and was punished or demoted. HOPSON: He said, \u201cThem guys in my unit stealing like crazy.\u201dTAVERNISE: Saw their careers crash. That culture had taken hold long ago, long before the Gun Trace Task Force was ever formed. HOPSON: You have a lot of good police officers, but a lot of good police officers are stifled. They\u2019re silenced because of what is called retaliation. Retaliation is real. And what I mean by that is, once you file a complaint, they take your complaint and put it on the shelf. And then they would create a complaint on you. I mean, it\u2019s a made-up complaint, but they\u2019ll find a way to charge you. Once they do that, then they will take that complaint, and they will always add a false statement on that complaint, which is a termination offense. So they get rid of you, and meanwhile, the complaint you have against them goes away. So that\u2019s why officers, even today, won\u2019t file a complaint, because as soon as they do, they\u2019re gone. And a lot of them still do, and a lot of them are gone. So they turn their head.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: So there\u2019s this perfect storm. You have this culture that punishes speaking up. Then you have this strategy of chasing statistics, getting good numbers. That gets you promotions and perks. That was the Gun Trace Task Force, this thing that was created to get guns. But then it went off the rails, and nobody did anything to stop it. So instead of getting crime off the street, they\u2019re putting it back in. They are literally part of the problem. But there was something else. Something bigger, and arguably more destructive for Baltimore. Any belief in this institution, any benefit of the doubt it once had from the citizens of this city, that was gone. And it was the police themselves who did it. TAVERNISE: Sgt. Hopson, what proportion of Baltimore Police Department do you think is implicated in this corruption stuff?HOPSON: Let me put it to you this way \u2014 everybody knew. Everybody knew. Everybody knew how corrupt the task force was. If you want an exact number, I don\u2019t think you gonna get it. That\u2019s like asking me, \u201cWhat percentage of the barrel is rotten?\u201d \u2014 that, that we know we had some pretty bad rotten apples in. Can you really answer that? I don\u2019t think you can. Any rotten fruit among good fruit, pretty soon, all the fruit is rotten. That\u2019s what you have here. If you don\u2019t get those rotten apples out, or bad actors in a specific amount of time, then the whole batch becomes certainly not edible. And certainly, you can almost say, they\u2019re crooked. So my \u2014 I would say 50 percent.TAVERNISE: Wow, that\u2019s a lot.TAVERNISE: I put the same question to Tyrone Powers. TYRONE POWERS: Wow. That\u2019s, that\u2019s tough. I would say 50 percent either were involved or, or knew and didn\u2019t tell. As an indication, or maybe as comparison \u2014 when I was in the FBI, we would work drug cartels \u2014 that there is no way the drug cartels or drug organizations can operate in any city without the police being involved. If you\u2019ve got a large drug organization in Manhattan, there\u2019s some corrupt cop, because they cannot operate without police participation. So I can say that in Baltimore City, the situation that we\u2019re into now, everything that\u2019s been involved in getting us here could not have been so without the cooperation of every aspect of the system \u2014 the criminal justice system and, to an extent, the political system from the mayor\u2019s office on down.TAVERNISE: The jury convicted all eight men on racketeering charges. Leo Wise and Derek Hines are seeking sentences of up to 30 years. And the fallout keeps going. Just this week, the city said it will have to re-examine 1,700 cases, cases that the task force had touched. HOPSON: They\u2019re hoping that this closes the door. You know, \u201cLet\u2019s turn the page.\u201d That\u2019s what they want to do. Turn the page and move on. \u201cLet\u2019s not fix the problem. Let\u2019s just turn the page.\u201d You don\u2019t know these people. They better hope, and they better pray that no one has the intuitiveness to go back and really look at this stuff and start peeling back this onion. Because if they do, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of people in jail, I mean a lot of people in jail.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: Now, are you still actively with, working in the police department? Or, what\u2019s your current \u2014\u2014HOPSON: Yep.TAVERNISE: And is it O.K. talking to us? I mean \u2014\u2014HOPSON: What are they going to do? Shoot me? [MUSIC][POLICE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS: Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go \u2014 in Fremont with a signal 13. Call reporting that a partner got shot. No description, no further. It says, in \u2014 call reporting that his partner got shot. No description of the suspect, no further. Be advised, he came in with a name. It\u2019s an off-duty. Let\u2019s go.]TAVERNISE: Back in the fall, something really strange happened. At 4:30 p.m. on November 15th, police responded to a shooting in West Baltimore. They found their colleague, Detective Sean Suiter, lying face down in a vacant lot, shot once in his head, his service weapon beneath his body. Some say it was a suicide staged to look like a murder. Others say it was a murder staged to look like a suicide. But one thing was clear \u2014 he died the day before he was supposed to testify in front of a grand jury about the Gun Trace Task Force. And so even though his death is still a mystery, and no one has been charged, given everything this trial exposed, people in Baltimore think they already know the answer. Like Ronald.[MUSIC]HAMILTON: You think that cop got killed for nothing? TAVERNISE: Yeah. HAMILTON: You really do? TAVERNISE: That Suiter guy, right?HAMILTON: Yeah. The day he about to testify against them? He knew too much. Oh, but you had a first description of a black man with a white T-shirt. The first description of a person that supposedly did it was a black man in a white T-shirt. TAVERNISE: Who do you think actually did it?HAMILTON: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just self-explanatory who did it. It wasn\u2019t a black man in a white T-shirt.LASHANDA \u201cTOBY\u201d DOUGLAS: Oh, that\u2019s the guy right here. Did you see this one?TAVERNISE: We did, yeah. We watched that. Yeah.TAVERNISE: How many times have you watched this?DOUGLAS: Maybe 1,003. Every time I see it, though, guess what? I see something I didn\u2019t see before. I\u2019m not trying to solve no case. I\u2019m just trying to find some closure and peace somewhere, since nobody, like that guy right there, or Detective Tally, or nobody, won\u2019t give me no peace or no closure. I have to find it on my own.TAVERNISE: She\u2019s been watching these videos again and again and again on her phone, Googling for new pieces of information, for any scrap. NOOK\u2019S FRIEND: She think she an investigator, like, oh my gosh, like \u2014\u2014DOUGLAS: I Google everything I can to see a video, a plain video, of that shooting. NOOK\u2019S FRIEND: Google and Google the same thing 50 million times, and then, like, the same stuff pop up, and she going to read it and read it, and then she going to pick through it and see what\u2019s different that she didn\u2019t notice the first time and pick it. I think she really be writing this stuff down, like, if you really go through these tapes, like, she really got notes and everything, like \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: She Googles everything. That\u2019s what one of Nook\u2019s best friends told us. Her son\u2019s name, the video.NOOK\u2019S FRIEND: You did this 60 million times. We both did it together. It\u2019s not going to pop up, Ma, what are you doing? Like, why do you keep doing it?DOUGLAS: First of all, I\u2019m going to show you my screenshots. What I would call my video.TAVERNISE: She takes screenshots of each piece of the video and compares them.DOUGLAS: So my son is running this way, shooting at that car. He turns his back around, right?TAVERNISE: And the more she\u2019s looking at her phone and watching these videos, the more details she sees.DOUGLAS: Focus on that car that Nook in. See the person \u2014 they let Nook out. And he trip. You see him falling? Do you see him falling when he getting out of the car?TAVERNISE: Kind of. DOUGLAS: Mhmm.TAVERNISE: She thinks she sees somebody getting out of the passenger side of the police car. She\u2019s sure she sees it.DOUGLAS: It\u2019s a, it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a body frame hanging out that car, just behind that police. It\u2019s a body frame, hanging out that window.TAVERNISE: She thinks she sees a person hanging out of a car, when we see a mirror.DOUGLAS: It\u2019s not a mirror, it\u2019s a body frame. If you look \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: What do you mean?DOUGLAS: Somebody. A silhouette.TAVERNISE: We don\u2019t see what she\u2019s seeing.DOUGLAS: This the kind of police, saying, wait till they get back, right by that pole. Pay attention to the passenger window. This is a bad spot. Right \u2014 about there. TAVERNISE: And Toby has concluded that the police were in on it. After all, it\u2019s a very strange coincidence that a police car that was unmarked would turn directly behind Nook.DOUGLAS: Let\u2019s start from the beginning. TAVERNISE: Lyns? LYNSEA GARRISON: I can\u2019t tell.DOUGLAS: That\u2019s the beginning. This is the \u2014 just pay attention.GARRISON: Mhmm.TAVERNISE: It does look like somebody\u2019s getting out of the white car.GARRISON: You think so?TAVERNISE: Mhmm. GARRISON: I can\u2019t see. It just looks like he\u2019s \u2014\u2014 TAVERNISE: So see, when, see, when it \u2014 after it makes the turn.GARRISON: Yeah.TAVERNISE: Right \u2014 there.GARRISON: [GASPS] TAVERNISE: Totally, somebody\u2019s getting out of the back.TAVERNISE: But then we start to see it, too.GARRISON: I see it. But then where do they go?TAVERNISE: You can\u2019t see it, \u2018cause there\u2019s a black box, right?TAVERNISE: It no longer feels impossible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How McKinsey Lost Its Way in South Africa", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "When the godfather of management consulting landed its biggest contract ever in Africa, it made the worst mistake in its storied nine-decade history.Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The blackouts kept coming. The state-owned power company, Eskom, was on the verge of insolvency. Maintenance was being deferred. And a major boiler exploded, threatening the national grid.McKinsey & Company, the godfather of management consulting, thought it could help, but was not sure that it should, according to people involved in the debate. The risk was huge. Could McKinsey fix the problems? Would it get paid? Would it be tainted by South Africa\u2019s rampant political corruption?In late 2015, over objections from at least three influential McKinsey partners, the firm decided the risk was worth taking and signed on to what would become its biggest contract ever in Africa, with a potential value of $700 million.It was also the biggest mistake in McKinsey\u2019s nine-decade history.The contract turned out to be illegal, a violation of South African contracting law, with some of the payments channeled to an associate of an Indian-born family, the Guptas, at the center of a swirling corruption scandal. Then there was the lavish size of that payout. It did not take a Harvard Business School graduate to explain why South Africans might get angry seeing a wealthy American firm cart away so much public money in a country with the worst income inequality in the world and a youth unemployment rate over 50 percent.And a bitter irony: While McKinsey\u2019s pay was supposed to be based entirely on its results, it is far from clear that the flailing power company is much better off than it was before.The Eskom affair is now part of an expansive investigation by South African authorities into how the Guptas used their friendships with Jacob Zuma, then the country\u2019s president, and his son to manipulate and control state-owned enterprises for personal gain. International corruption watchdogs call it a case of \u201cstate capture.\u201d Lawmakers here call it a silent coup. It has already led to Mr. Zuma\u2019s ouster and a moment of reckoning for post-apartheid South Africa.Yet despite extensive coverage of the scandal by the local news media, one question has remained largely unanswered: How did McKinsey, with its vast influence, impeccable research credentials and record of advising companies and governments on best practices, become entangled in such an untoward affair?McKinsey admits errors in judgment while denying any illegality. Two senior partners, the firm says, bear most of the blame for what went wrong. But an investigation by The New York Times, including interviews with 16 current and former partners, found that the roots of the problem go deeper \u2014 to a changing corporate culture that opened the way for an aggressive push into more government consulting, as well as new methods of compensation. While the changes helped McKinsey nearly double in size over the last decade, they introduced more reputational risk.The firm also missed warning signs about the possible involvement of the Guptas, and only belatedly realized the insufficiency of its risk management for state-owned companies. Supervisors who might have vetoed or modified the contract were not South African and lacked the local knowledge to sense trouble ahead. And having poorly vetted its subcontractor, McKinsey was less than forthcoming when asked to explain its role in the emerging scandal.Since the Eskom disclosures, much of McKinsey\u2019s business in South Africa has evaporated. Mr. Barton has made six trips there to assess the damage and make amends, and McKinsey has asked its 2,000 global partners to repay South Africa, where it is under investigation.More broadly, the scandal in South Africa \u2014 which has ensnared several other overseas companies \u2014 underscores the risks that arise as governments increasingly turn over responsibilities to consultants who operate mostly in secret, with little or no public accountability.McKinsey built its brand as the ubiquitous adviser to businesses great and small. But in recent years, it has created an increasingly powerful unseen presence as counselor to governments across the globe.The extent of that global influence is difficult to evaluate because, as a matter of policy, the firm will not reveal clients or the advice it gives.Even so, by examining government records, along with McKinsey publications and other company documents, The Times found that the firm shapes everything from education, transportation, energy and medical care to the restructuring of economies and the fighting of wars.McKinsey\u2019s clients include sovereign wealth funds worth more than a trillion dollars, as well as what one marketing brochure describes as \u201cdefense ministries, military forces, police forces and justice ministries in 15 countries,\u201d where the company consults on such matters as the maintenance and support of \u201carmored personnel carriers; minesweepers, destroyers and submarines; and fast jets and transport aircraft.\u201dMcKinsey \u201cis a hidden, unaccountable power that has a prestigious face,\u201d said Janine R. Wedel, a professor at George Mason University who has written extensively on what she calls \u201cthe shadow elite.\u201d She added, \u201cThink of them as a repository of the most intimate information that governments and others have, from what they are investing in to who wields influence.\u201dMcKinsey refused to work in South Africa until it embraced democracy in the mid-1990s, but records show that it consults for many authoritarian governments, including the world\u2019s mightiest, China, to a degree unheard of for a foreign company. Late last year, two McKinsey partners spoke at a meeting of the state-controlled conglomerate China Merchants Group that focused on carrying out Communist Party directives. McKinsey is also advising the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as he seeks to make its economy less reliant on oil.While confidentiality is necessary in private business, it can become problematic when public money is involved, as in South Africa, or for that matter in the United States, where McKinsey has advised more than 40 federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Department and the Food and Drug Administration.Since President Trump took office, McKinsey has greatly expanded consulting for Immigration and Customs Enforcement through that agency\u2019s office of \u201cdetention, compliance and removals.\u201d Their contracts with the agency exceed $20 million. Asked about those contracts, a McKinsey spokesman said the company\u2019s work focused primarily on administration and organization and was unconnected to immigration policy, including the separation of children and parents at the border.Certainly, consulting firms other than McKinsey keep client lists confidential and work for authoritarian governments. And McKinsey has undeniably been a force for good, through its pro bono work and by helping many organizations become more efficient engines of economic growth. As for the quality of people McKinsey hires, many have gone on to run some of the world\u2019s biggest and most successful companies.That is why McKinsey\u2019s behavior in South Africa is so startling.In 2012, a new class of recruits \u2014 the worker bees in McKinsey\u2019s hive \u2014 settled in at its office in Sandton, Johannesburg\u2019s financial center, often called the richest square mile in Africa. They were part of a notably diverse group. Given South Africa\u2019s historic battle against apartheid, it was a point of pride at McKinsey that more than 60 percent of the office\u2019s 250 employees were black South Africans. Many described their work as a calling, an opportunity to make a difference in a young and still-struggling democracy.Years earlier, McKinsey\u2019s South African partners had decided that to be relevant, they had to embrace the public sector, because of its outsize role in South Africa\u2019s economy. But a South African government weakened by corruption also represented a risk to McKinsey\u2019s sterling reputation \u2014 a reputation forged by its founder, a math whiz from the Ozarks named James O. McKinsey, and nurtured by his disciple and successor, Marvin Bower.Over the decades, the firm \u2014 that\u2019s what it calls itself \u2014 became confidant to chief executives and presidents, simultaneously the secret-keeper of corporate America and its most effective evangelist, preaching the McKinsey way to companies across the globe.There came to be a not entirely hyperbolic narrative of McKinsey\u2019s preordained white-shoe path through the world \u2014 the Harvard Business School recruit turned McKinsey consultant turned rising corporate titan. And few companies have a better track record of producing them: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who oversaw I.B.M.\u2019s turnaround in 1990s, is a McKinsey veteran. So is Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, and Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai.\u201cSo pervasive is the firm\u2019s influence today that it is hard to imagine the place of business in the world without McKinsey,\u201d wrote Duff McDonald, author of \u201cThe Firm,\u201d a 2013 book about the company.McKinsey has had its share of bad publicity, but much of it has focused on people who have already left.It looked bad. And while McKinsey was cleared of wrongdoing, the experience helped steer the company away from government work, avoiding the publicity, the ethical quandaries and the generally lower fees that came with public contracts.But if McKinsey had learned a lesson, it soon began to unlearn it.By the early 2000s, McKinsey re-entered the public sphere in a major way \u2014 and now government contracts and work with state-owned companies make up 16 percent of the firm\u2019s revenues.There was another lesson being unlearned as well: Work for a fixed fee.In the late 1980s, an up-and-coming partner in McKinsey\u2019s energy practice, Jeffrey K. Skilling, had been part of a committee considering whether payment should be based on delivered results, such as reduced costs.As Mr. Skilling told the journalist Anita Raghavan, the panel concluded it would not work, because getting paid based on impact, for example, could give McKinsey an incentive to tell clients to reduce costs even if it was not in their interest. Doing that, Mr. Skilling said, \u201ccould destroy\u201d the firm.Mr. Skilling \u2014 who would become Enron\u2019s chief executive and end up in federal prison after its vast accounting fraud was revealed \u2014 saw the ethical trap. A future generation of McKinsey partners came to a different conclusion.Starting around 2001 or 2002, McKinsey again began to rethink its fee-for-service rule. Its competitors were already changing over. After years of deliberation and study, the firm agreed in 2011 to allow \u201cat risk\u201d contracts alongside its traditional fee structure.\u201cThere\u2019s been client demand for that, clients saying we like that approach,\u201d Mr. Barton said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the results you want, then don\u2019t pay us.\u201dWith this new pay policy and avid embrace of government work, the firm\u2019s South African partners had been handed a seductive vision of the future. Some of McKinsey\u2019s young associates in Johannesburg would end up on the ill-fated Eskom deal. But first, there was an ambitious project at the state-owned rail and port agency, Transnet.McKinsey had worked with Transnet since 2005, embedding itself so deeply that one board member wondered how the agency could ever oust the consultants should the need arise. Still, Transnet remained an underachiever, its ports inadequate, its freight rail system moribund.Then, in February 2011, Transnet got a new chief executive, Brian Molefe, who had been running the country\u2019s public pension fund.McKinsey and Mr. Molefe set out to revitalize the agency by buying as many as 1,064 new locomotives in what would be the biggest government procurement in South African history. But McKinsey would have to take on a subcontractor, under a South African law requiring companies that worked with state-owned enterprises to have black-owned partners.According to prosecutors, the Guptas saw these black-empowerment companies as a way to empower themselves, and state-owned companies like Transnet became willing accomplices. Transnet steered McKinsey toward working with a company, Regiments, owned in part by a businessman linked to the Guptas.But weeks before the winning bidders were announced, McKinsey bowed out, saying the process was moving too quickly.As it turned out, Transet agreed to pay about $1 billion more than the agreed-upon price for the locomotives. And, as leaked documents published last year in the local media revealed, one of the winning bidders, a state-owned Chinese company, paid more than $100 million to shell companies tied to another Gupta associate, Salim Essa.Although it is unclear what, if anything, Mr. Molefe knew about those payments, he left Transnet to search for a new challenge. He found it in 2015 as the chief executive at Eskom.The power company had long been the public\u2019s favorite punching bag, notorious for its high rates, sputtering from one crisis to the next. Officials worried about getting enough coal, about delaying maintenance to keep electricity flowing. During the World Cup in 2010, Eskom feared that the lights might go out at any moment with the whole world watching.To address Eskom\u2019s financial troubles, McKinsey and Eskom drew up an audacious new reorganization plan.McKinsey\u2019s team leader on the project was a popular partner, Vikas Sagar, a stylish, Porsche-driving fitness buff in his 40s, known for hugging colleagues when the spirit moved him and fiercely charting his own course. He was assisted by Alexander Weiss, a serious reverse image of Mr. Sagar, who thought little of commuting between his home in Germany and Johannesburg.McKinsey\u2019s proposal appeared perfect for a company in desperate financial straits. Eskom would pay only if the plan produced savings. Then the consultancy would get a percentage. All the risk, ostensibly, would be McKinsey\u2019s, since it might spend heavily but get nothing in the end.Yet for all the upside, the proposal had a Trojan-horse quality: Eskom would hire McKinsey not knowing what the final bill would be.The plan left several McKinsey partners uneasy. Could Eskom absorb and apply McKinsey\u2019s recommendations? And how would a contract with an anticipated payout in the hundreds of millions of dollars be received by South Africans? Also troubling was the fact that McKinsey had won the contract without competitive bidding.\u201cYou are betting the office,\u201d one former partner recalled warning colleagues. If the final payout became public, that official added, \u201cYou are going to be slaughtered just for the size.\u201dThe contract\u2019s structure \u2014 with the risks it posed for McKinsey \u2014 was not universally embraced, either. \u201cTrying to do a 100 percent at-risk contract at Eskom is trying to play God,\u201d a former partner said. \u201cYou are really guaranteeing that I can turn around everything, no problem.\u201d To accomplish that, McKinsey might need more political clout and expertise than it could deliver.Most of McKinsey\u2019s current or former partners who spoke to The Times requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. McKinsey did provide several partners for interviews on the condition that their names not be used. Mr. Sagar did not respond to repeated messages seeking an interview, and Mr. Weiss declined to speak to The Times.Concerns notwithstanding, the prospect of a big payday made the contract popular not only in Johannesburg but throughout McKinsey\u2019s global empire. Supporters included two senior partners with oversight in energy and power: Yermolai Solzhenitsyn, the novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s eldest son, in Moscow, and Thomas Vahlenkamp in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Both declined to be interviewed.In the end, Mr. Sagar and his allies carried the day.In situations like these, risk managers are supposed to serve as corporate lifeguards, ready to whistle back dealmakers if they expose the company to unnecessary legal and reputational peril. Yet the Eskom contract was approved with less scrutiny than regular public contracts. That was because state-owned enterprises were treated as private corporations, where reviews focused on commercial viability, not political risk.Had McKinsey vetted the Eskom contract properly, it might have spared itself some of the grief to come. The contract, it turned out, was illegal: The power company had failed to get a government waiver from the standard fee-for-service payment, despite assuring McKinsey that it had done so.\u201cFor the scale of the fee, they were prepared to throw caution to the wind, and maybe because they thought they couldn\u2019t be touched,\u201d said David Lewis, executive director of Corruption Watch, a local advocacy group.If McKinsey fell short in vetting the Eskom contract, the same could be said about the scrutiny of its minority partner, a company called Trillian Management Consulting.McKinsey\u2019s putative marriage to Trillian produced its first awkward moments when its chief executive, Bianca Goodson, showed up angry at the consultancy\u2019s Sandton headquarters on a January evening in 2016. Under McKinsey\u2019s agreement with Eskom, Ms. Goodson\u2019s company was supposed to provide consulting support, but with only two employees was unsure how to do that.Feeling ignored and marginalized, Ms. Goodson planned to raise her concerns at a meeting of McKinsey partners. Four hours in, she got her chance. But before she could finish, Ms. Goodson wrote in an account later submitted to Parliament, a McKinsey team leader abruptly left the room, another partner said not to worry too much about work because she would still get her financial cut, and another made \u201cwhipping sounds and gestures,\u201d an apparent inside joke, prompting laughter among the partners.Ms. Goodson left more disillusioned than before she arrived. Two months later, she resigned.During the internal debate over the Eskom deal, several partners had questioned whether McKinsey knew enough about who precisely was behind Trillian. Now rumors began reaching the McKinsey office that Trillian Management and its parent company, Trillian Capital, might have ties to the Gupta family.McKinsey knew little about Trillian \u2014 a new company, with no track record, that had broken off from McKinsey\u2019s previous minority partner, Regiments, after a business dispute. What\u2019s more, Trillian had refused McKinsey\u2019s requests to divulge its ownership.Even so, McKinsey chose to kick the can down the road and continue working. What McKinsey did not yet know was that Eskom\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Molefe, had placed dozens of phone calls to one of the Gupta brothers during and after contract negotiations.An influential senior partner in Johannesburg, David Fine, had grown increasingly uneasy about Trillian, according to his testimony to Parliament. One source of concern: Over the objections of two senior partners, McKinsey\u2019s team leader, Mr. Sagar, had been meeting with Eskom and Trillian without any other McKinsey officials present.Eventually McKinsey hired a private investigative firm to dig into Trillian\u2019s background. When that did not produce any definitive leads, Mr. Fine began running internet searches on companies named Trillian and found the name \u201cS. Essa\u201d listed as a director. Weeks later, the South African media revealed the majority owner of Trillian as none other than Salim Essa, the Gupta associate whose shell companies had received more than $100 million in the locomotive deal.On March 30, 2016, McKinsey told Eskom in writing that it was severing its ties to Trillian. But while McKinsey had finally taken a stand, it quietly undercut that decision by continuing to work alongside Trillian \u2014 independently, rather than as a subcontractor.To the consternation of some McKinsey partners, that arrangement continued until the end of June 2016. With the local media revealing ever more of the Gupta family\u2019s influence, Eskom \u2014 not McKinsey \u2014 prematurely terminated the contract. Mr. Molefe resigned that November. Mr. Molefe did not respond to requests for comment for this article; a lawyer for the Guptas declined to comment.The abbreviated tab for barely eight months of work: nearly $100 million, with close to 40 percent going to Trillian.In the United States, with an economy over 50 times as big as South Africa\u2019s, a contract that size might have gone unnoticed. But in South Africa, millions of dollars flowing out of a struggling public utility and into the pockets of consultants driving Porsches and Ferraris created an unsavory image that required a response.Yet McKinsey kept quiet, one of many decisions the firm would come to regret.Late the next year, South Africa\u2019s National Prosecuting Authority would deliver a stinging summation of the Eskom case. McKinsey, the prosecutors would allege, had been instrumental \u201cin creating a veil of legitimacy to what was otherwise a nonexistent, unlawful arrangement.\u201d That arrangement, in turn, allowed a company controlled by the Gupta associate, Mr. Essa, to profit.That conclusion was based in part on a letter obtained by a widely respected human-rights advocate, Geoff Budlender, who had been asked to investigate Trillian, including its ties to McKinsey. For the first time, McKinsey was being publicly held to account.Mr. Budlender asked to interview McKinsey but was told to put his questions in writing, which he did. In response to one question, McKinsey denied working \u201con any projects\u201d with Trillian, as either a subcontractor or a black-empowerment partner.With his trap laid, Mr. Budlender pounced. He attached a Feb. 9, 2016, letter from the McKinsey team leader, Mr. Sagar, to Eskom. \u201cAs you know,\u201d Mr. Sagar had written, \u201cMcKinsey has subcontracted a portion of the services to be performed\u201d to Trillian. The letter went further and authorized Eskom to pay Trillian directly, rather than through McKinsey, as was customary for a subcontractor.Asked to explain the conflicting answers, a McKinsey lawyer, Benedict Phiri, took weeks to respond, saying he needed to speak with his colleagues. Finally, he wrote that, given ongoing legal disputes, it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment.Mr. Budlender concluded that McKinsey\u2019s denial was false. \u201cI have to say that I find this inexplicable, particularly having regard to the fact that McKinsey presents itself as an international leader in management consulting and given the widespread public interest in this matter,\u201d he wrote.In the interview with The Times, the McKinsey managing partner, Mr. Barton, said the office leadership in Johannesburg had been unaware of Mr. Sagar\u2019s letter, and had only learned of it from Mr. Budlender. But three current or former McKinsey partners told The Times that Mr. Sagar\u2019s German colleague, Mr. Weiss, and the firm\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Phiri, also knew of the letter.McKinsey\u2019s lawyers said that the letter should never have been sent. Even so, they said, the authorization to pay Trillian referred to another, much smaller contract, and it was predicated on Trillian\u2019s meeting certain conditions.In late 2017, a parliamentary committee began calling witnesses as part of its own investigation of state capture. One witness was Ms. Goodson, the former Trillian executive, who said she had been told soon after being hired that Mr. Essa owned Trillian. She also testified about meeting Mr. Sagar and Mr. Essa in Melrose Arch, a wealthy enclave with high-end retail and sidewalk dining where deals are made.McKinsey sent Mr. Fine, who withstood nearly four hours of questioning. He addressed criticism head on, beginning with the size of the contract. \u201cWe should have absolutely had a fee structure that was capped,\u201d he said.Mr. Fine, who had no role in the Eskom contract, said he had been assured that Eskom did derive measurable benefits from McKinsey\u2019s consulting. Yet his comments betrayed an element of doubt. As a native South African, he said, he couldn\u2019t help asking himself, \u201cIf these benefits were there, why then has the price of electricity gone up and has the liquidity position of Eskom deteriorated?\u201dMr. Barton, in his interview with The Times, insisted that his firm helped Eskom solve important problems. He expressed frustration at the overarching narrative that McKinsey took money for little work. \u201cThere was real work being done,\u201d he said.Grieve Chelwa, an economics lecturer at the University of Cape Town, said in an interview that McKinsey\u2019s top ranks in South Africa were overwhelmingly filled by Europeans who \u201cmay not have had the political antennae\u201d to pick up potential problems.\u201cThe less charitable interpretation is that they knew,\u201d said Dr. Chelwa, until recently a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Center for African Studies. \u201cThey made a risk calculation that we know what is going on or we have an idea what is going on, but then there is 1.6 billion rand to make, and what is the probability that all this falls in our faces? They made that kind of calculation and they said, \u2018O.K., the risk is worth doing,\u2019 and they did it.\u201dIt is a risk McKinsey now regrets taking.The advocacy group Corruption Watch referred the firm\u2019s conduct to the United States Justice Department for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. McKinsey declined to say whether federal investigators had contacted the firm; the Justice Department declined to comment. The National Prosecuting Authority in South Africa has frozen the proceeds of the Eskom contract, pending the completion of the government\u2019s investigation. And several banks and corporations, including the South African arm of Coca-Cola, have said they will not do business with McKinsey until investigations are concluded.McKinsey vehemently denies breaking any laws, and says that this view has been validated by a monthslong internal inquiry involving more than 50 lawyers reviewing millions of documents and emails.The firm does admit mistakes. McKinsey will now give state-owned companies the same scrutiny it would government agencies or ministries. That policy may have a major impact in China, where McKinsey has advised at least 19 of the biggest state-owned companies as well as the country\u2019s powerful planning agency.In a statement, McKinsey said that it was \u201cnot careful enough about who we associated with,\u201d that it should not have worked alongside Trillian after cutting its ties and that it did not communicate properly with Mr. Budlender. \u201cWe are embarrassed by these failings, and we apologize to the people of South Africa, our clients, our colleagues and our alumni, who rightly expect more of our firm.\u201dAt the end of June, Mr. Barton, 55, will step down as previously planned. McKinsey\u2019s nearly 600 senior partners voted to replace Mr. Barton with Kevin Sneader, a British citizen. Last weekend, as The Times was preparing this article after weeks of questioning McKinsey about its secretive culture, The Financial Times published an interview with Mr. Sneader, who said the firm could no longer \u201chide from the outside world.\u201dMr. Sagar has left the firm with his full benefits in place. Mr. Weiss has been sanctioned, though McKinsey declined to say what that involved. The firm\u2019s Johannesburg lawyer, Mr. Phiri, resigned, and the head of McKinsey\u2019s Africa practice was transferred to Hong Kong.Mr. Fine, who now leads McKinsey\u2019s worldwide public-sector practice in London, cast the fallout from Eskom in personal terms. \u201cI have seen the anger and disappointment in my clients\u2019 eyes,\u201d he told the South African Parliament. He added, \u201cI\u2019ve experienced rejection from people that I really love and trust, and that\u2019s been hard.\u201dWalt Bogdanich reported from Johannesburg, and Michael Forsythe from New York.

Yet at the same time, Facebook has continued to undermine privacy by making it cumbersome to opt out of sharing, trying to convince users that we actually do want to share all of our personal information (and some people actually do) and by leaving the door unlocked for its partners and clients to come in and help themselves. Those partners have included 60 device makers that used application programming interfaces, also known as A.P.I.s, so Facebook could run on their gadgets.The European Union has passed such legislation, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., which forces companies such as Facebook to do a better job shielding individual data.

{"Headline": "Tax Havens Blunt Impact of Corporate Tax Cut, Economists Say", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new corporate tax cuts are unlikely to stimulate the level of job creation and wage growth that the Trump administration has promised, a trio of prominent economists has concluded, because high tax rates were not pushing much investment out of the United States in the first place.\u201cThis idea that if you cut taxes, you\u2019ll attract a lot of physical capital, a lot of investment to the United States, I don\u2019t think is supported by the evidence,\u201d said Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the paper\u2019s authors. \u201cPaper profits \u2014 that doesn\u2019t boost wages for workers. What boosts wages is actual factories.\u201dThroughout the debate over the tax bill, Republicans cast the country\u2019s corporate tax rate as uncompetitive when compared with nations such as Ireland and Canada, and said the rate was pushing American multinationals to park their profits in other countries where their tax bills would be lower.The new research concludes that assumption is wrong. \u201cMachines don\u2019t move to low-tax places,\u201d the economists write, \u201cpaper profits do.\u201dThe research by Mr. Zucman, Mr. Torslov and Mr. Wier employs a first-of-its-kind method to assess how big a share of profits multinational corporations stash overseas. They draw on international data to determine a ratio of pretax profits to wages at individual companies, for both locally owned firms and foreign firms operating in those countries.They find that multinationals operating in tax havens are far more profitable than locally owned companies in those countries, and that their profits dwarf what they pay workers. They break the numbers down to show the outsize profits are largely due to money being \u201cshifted\u201d \u2014 on paper \u2014 into those havens.\u201cIt\u2019s very striking in the sense that these multinational companies, they are the main winners from globalization. And they are also those who have seen their tax rates fall a lot,\u201d Mr. Zucman said. \u201cThis means that other actors in the economy, they have to pay more in order to take up the tax burden.\u201dMr. Zucman said the results should cause policymakers to rethink their efforts on several fronts. They suggest, he said, that advanced countries are underestimating economic growth and undercollecting corporate tax revenues, because they are missing the profits that have been shifted on paper by multinational corporations.Mr. Zucman said it was too soon to tell whether those measures would succeed. But he said it was clear that policymakers should worry less about outdoing their allies with corporate tax cuts, and instead consider steps to crack down on profit-shifting, such as taxing profits where companies register their sales.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name and surname of one of the authors of the research on corporate profits.

This fear stems not from acknowledgment that we have facilitated harassment, but rather from the uncertainty of what constitutes reprehensible behavior.Our shared worry was not spurred by Harvey Weinstein or Matt Lauer, but instead from claims brought against Aziz Ansari. The allegations against Mr. Ansari appeared to be a landmark event, for instead of universally turning favor against him, they divided the community. Some notable feminists, including Bari Weiss, even began to back Ansari.Following the release of the allegations, Weiss published an article in The New York Times in which she calls for women to be more vocal about their wishes, and states that lumping Ansari in with other accused abusers \u201ctrivializes what the #MeToo movement first stood for.\u201d This sentiment was shared by my peers.Following the publication of the original expos\u00e9, my morning commute was dominated by debates over whether what Ansari did was wrong, and whether his accuser went too far.

Apple is pitching the tools as evidence that it is putting its customers\u2019 interests first \u2014 and that if people are worried they are addicted to their smartphone, the iPhone is the device that will help them.The new tools are also a shot across the bow to Silicon Valley\u2019s other big tech companies, like Google, Twitter and particularly Facebook, that depend on users spending more time with their services.Apple\u2019s move is also not happening in a vacuum. Silicon Valley has faced early signs of a reckoning over tech addiction, including an open letter to Apple from investment firm Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System. The letter urged Apple to research the health effects of its products, particularly on children.Will this be enough to help people curb their addiction? Presumably, if you set a limit for yourself you will be able to easily remove the restriction and continue using an app like Instagram when you run out of time.If anything, the feature will certainly make people more mindful (and perhaps ashamed) of how often they use certain apps and encourage them to put their phones down.\u2014 Brian X. Chen and Jack NicasApple took another swing at its rivals Google and Facebook with tools that sharply diminish their ability to track users as they surf across the web.Apple said that by default its Safari browser would disable tracking software that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users\u2019 activity across the internet. The software is often embedded in tools to share, comment or \u201clike\u201d content on third-party sites.To share an article directly to Facebook from a news site, for instance, users of Safari will need to manually allow the software to track them. Apple said it would also make it more difficult for companies that track users using a different technology, known as fingerprinting.As the world wakes up to the sheer amount of user data tech companies have collected over the years, Apple is doubling down on its bid to be the privacy-focused tech firm. Unlike Google and Facebook, which rely on user data to sell ads, Apple\u2019s main business is selling devices to consumers, so its focus on privacy has become a central selling point.Apple said it would also restrict third-party developers\u2019 access to more data on Mac computers, a nod to the scandal over how a Facebook developer enabled the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly harvest the data of millions of Facebook users.\u2014 Jack NicasThe Apple Watch\u2019s latest operating system has a nifty throwback to an old technology: walkie-talkie. \u201cYou press to talk, and your friend can hear your voice \u2014 just like a walkie-talkie,\u201d said Kevin Lynch, Apple\u2019s head of Watch software.The feature works only with users who opt in \u2014 I need your approval to send you a walkie-talkie message \u2014 but it\u2019s striking for the way it improves the Watch\u2019s best feature, letting users stay in touch without having to use a phone.There were also a few new features for activity monitoring. The new software will automatically start tracking a workout even if you didn\u2019t let tell it you were working out. And it has a new way to let you compete with friends. For instance, you can set up a weeklong exercise-off between you and a friend.But all this requires waiting. The new OS will be available for the Watch later this year, through a software update.\u2014 Farhad ManjooApple\u2019s head of software, Craig Federighi, opened the event with the introduction of a new mobile operating system, iOS 12, an update that he said was focused on speed.\u201cFor iOS 12, we are doubling down on performance,\u201d he said. The update increases the speed for many important features of iOS, like the camera app and keyboard. In Apple\u2019s testing, apps launched two times faster in iOS 12 compared with the last system.The new operating system will work with devices as far back as the iPhone 5S from 2013.Here\u2019s something Apple should fix at the event: its Wi-Fi. None of us are able to get on the internet. I\u2019m barely hanging on to a connection on my iPhone hot spot. Wireless has always been spotty at these events with so many devices in the audience fighting for a connection, but this is exceptionally bad.\u2014 Brian X. ChenIt\u2019s crystal clear that iOS 12 is focused on improving on existing features rather than bombarding users with brand-new features.In addition to updating the Photos app and expanding Siri, Apple made minor updates to its Apple News, Stocks, Messages and FaceTime apps. The Apple News app now lets you discover articles through topics, and the Stocks app now loads Apple News stories that are related to stocks that you follow.The Messages app was updated to let you create some custom emojis with the camera. And the FaceTime app lets you do a video call between multiple people, similar to Google Hangouts.Again, Apple is responding to some negative feedback. Over the last few years, app developers and users have complained that iOS was getting increasingly bloated and confusing to use.This is a good time for Apple to slow down on adding new features, especially after the introduction of the iPhone X, which fundamentally changes how the iPhone works by removing the home button.This software conference illuminates Apple\u2019s revised software strategy. In the past, Apple updated each new version of iOS on an annual basis with a long list of new features.But recently, the company announced to employees that it would revise its strategy to a two-year cycle. In other words, next year, you can expect iOS 13 to have a barrage of new features. In the following year, iOS 14 will focus on improving those features. Rinse and repeat.However, Apple doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down the pace of upgrades for the Apple Watch, a much younger product. Each version of Watch OS has introduced significant changes to the way the watch works. Apple\u2019s allocation of resources to the watch shows that the company is treating the wearable computer as the post-smartphone device.In a decade, will we all be wearing our phones?\u2014 Brian X.

{"Headline": "Facebook Gave Device Makers Deep Access to Data on Users and Friends", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "The company formed data-sharing partnerships with Apple, Samsung and dozens of other device makers, raising new concerns about its privacy protections.As Facebook sought to become the world\u2019s dominant social media service, it struck agreements allowing phone and other device makers access to vast amounts of its users\u2019 personal information.Facebook has reached data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers \u2014 including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung \u2014 over the last decade, starting before Facebook apps were widely available on smartphones, company officials said. The deals allowed Facebook to expand its reach and let device makers offer customers popular features of the social network, such as messaging, \u201clike\u201d buttons and address books.But the partnerships, whose scope has not previously been reported, raise concerns about the company\u2019s privacy protections and compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing, The New York Times found.[Here\u2019s what we know about Facebook\u2019s partnerships with device makers.]In the furor that followed, Facebook\u2019s leaders said that the kind of access exploited by Cambridge in 2014 was cut off by the next year, when Facebook prohibited developers from collecting information from users\u2019 friends. But the company officials did not disclose that Facebook had exempted the makers of cellphones, tablets and other hardware from such restrictions.In interviews, Facebook officials defended the data sharing as consistent with its privacy policies, the F.T.C. agreement and pledges to users. They said its partnerships were governed by contracts that strictly limited use of the data, including any stored on partners\u2019 servers. The officials added that they knew of no cases where the information had been misused.The company views its device partners as extensions of Facebook, serving its more than two billion users, the officials said.\u201cThese partnerships work very differently from the way in which app developers use our platform,\u201d said Ime Archibong, a Facebook vice president. Unlike developers that provide games and services to Facebook users, the device partners can use Facebook data only to provide versions of \u201cthe Facebook experience,\u201d the officials said.Some device partners can retrieve Facebook users\u2019 relationship status, religion, political leaning and upcoming events, among other data. Tests by The Times showed that the partners requested and received data in the same way other third parties did.Facebook\u2019s view that the device makers are not outsiders lets the partners go even further, The Times found: They can obtain data about a user\u2019s Facebook friends, even those who have denied Facebook permission to share information with any third parties.In interviews, several former Facebook software engineers and security experts said they were surprised at the ability to override sharing restrictions.\u201cIt\u2019s like having door locks installed, only to find out that the locksmith also gave keys to all of his friends so they can come in and rifle through your stuff without having to ask you for permission,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a research and privacy consultant who formerly served as the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist.By Rich Harris and Gabriel J.X. DanceDetails of Facebook\u2019s partnerships have emerged amid a reckoning in Silicon Valley over the volume of personal information collected on the internet and monetized by the tech industry. The pervasive collection of data, while largely unregulated in the United States, has come under growing criticism from elected officials at home and overseas and provoked concern among consumers about how freely their information is shared.In a tense appearance before Congress in March, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, emphasized what he said was a company priority for Facebook users.\u201cEvery piece of content that you share on Facebook you own,\u201d he testified. \u201dYou have complete control over who sees it and how you share it.\u201dBut the device partnerships provoked discussion even within Facebook as early as 2012, according to Sandy Parakilas, who at the time led third-party advertising and privacy compliance for Facebook\u2019s platform.\u201cThis was flagged internally as a privacy issue,\u201d said Mr. Parakilas, who left Facebook that year and has recently emerged as a harsh critic of the company. \u201cIt is shocking that this practice may still continue six years later, and it appears to contradict Facebook\u2019s testimony to Congress that all friend permissions were disabled.\u201dThe submission followed testimony by Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, during a closed-door German parliamentary hearing in April. Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, one of the lawmakers who questioned Mr. Kaplan, said in an interview that she believed the data partnerships disclosed by Facebook violated users\u2019 privacy rights.\u201cWhat we have been trying to determine is whether Facebook has knowingly handed over user data elsewhere without explicit consent,\u201d Ms. Winkelmeier-Becker said. \u201cI would never have imagined that this might even be happening secretly via deals with device makers. BlackBerry users seem to have been turned into data dealers, unknowingly and unwillingly.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Samsung declined to respond to questions about whether it had any data-sharing partnerships with Facebook. Amazon also declined to respond to questions.Usher Lieberman, a BlackBerry spokesman, said in a statement that the company used Facebook data only to give its own customers access to their Facebook networks and messages. Mr. Lieberman said that the company \u201cdid not collect or mine the Facebook data of our customers,\u201d adding that \u201cBlackBerry has always been in the business of protecting, not monetizing, customer data.\u201dMicrosoft entered a partnership with Facebook in 2008 that allowed Microsoft-powered devices to do things like add contacts and friends and receive notifications, according to a spokesman. He added that the data was stored locally on the phone and was not synced to Microsoft\u2019s servers.Facebook acknowledged that some partners did store users\u2019 data \u2014 including friends\u2019 data \u2014 on their own servers. A Facebook official said that regardless of where the data was kept, it was governed by strict agreements between the companies.\u201cI am dumbfounded by the attitude that anybody in Facebook\u2019s corporate office would think allowing third parties access to data would be a good idea,\u201d said Henning Schulzrinne, a computer science professor at Columbia University who specializes in network security and mobile systems.The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how loosely Facebook had policed the bustling ecosystem of developers building apps on its platform. They ranged from well-known players like Zynga, the maker of the FarmVille game, to smaller ones, like a Cambridge contractor who used a quiz taken by about 300,000 Facebook users to gain access to the profiles of as many as 87 million of their friends.Those developers relied on Facebook\u2019s public data channels, known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. But starting in 2007, the company also established private data channels for device manufacturers.At the time, mobile phones were less powerful, and relatively few of them could run stand-alone Facebook apps like those now common on smartphones. The company continued to build new private APIs for device makers through 2014, spreading user data through tens of millions of mobile devices, game consoles, televisions and other systems outside Facebook\u2019s direct control.Facebook began moving to wind down the partnerships in April, after assessing its privacy and data practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mr. Archibong said the company had concluded that the partnerships were no longer needed to serve Facebook users. About 22 of them have been shut down.The broad access Facebook provided to device makers raises questions about its compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the F.T.C.After the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the F.T.C. began an investigation into whether Facebook\u2019s continued sharing of data after 2011 violated the decree, potentially exposing the company to fines.Facebook officials said the private data channels did not violate the decree because the company viewed its hardware partners as \u201cservice providers,\u201d akin to a cloud computing service paid to store Facebook data or a company contracted to process credit card transactions. According to the consent decree, Facebook does not need to seek additional permission to share friend data with service providers.\u201cThese contracts and partnerships are entirely consistent with Facebook\u2019s F.T.C. consent decree,\u201d Mr. Archibong, the Facebook official, said.But Jessica Rich, a former F.T.C. official who helped lead the commission\u2019s earlier Facebook investigation, disagreed with that assessment.\u201cUnder Facebook\u2019s interpretation, the exception swallows the rule,\u201d said Ms. Rich, now with the Consumers Union. \u201cThey could argue that any sharing of data with third parties is part of the Facebook experience. And this is not at all how the public interpreted their 2014 announcement that they would limit third-party app access to friend data.\u201dTo test one partner\u2019s access to Facebook\u2019s private data channels, The Times used a reporter\u2019s Facebook account \u2014 with about 550 friends \u2014 and a 2013 BlackBerry device, monitoring what data the device requested and received. (More recent BlackBerry devices, which run Google\u2019s Android operating system, do not use the same private channels, BlackBerry officials said.)Immediately after the reporter connected the device to his Facebook account, it requested some of his profile data, including user ID, name, picture, \u201cabout\u201d information, location, email and cellphone number. The device then retrieved the reporter\u2019s private messages and the responses to them, along with the name and user ID of each person with whom he was communicating.The data flowed to a BlackBerry app known as the Hub, which was designed to let BlackBerry users view all of their messages and social media accounts in one place.The Hub also requested \u2014 and received \u2014 data that Facebook\u2019s policy appears to prohibit. Since 2015, Facebook has said that apps can request only the names of friends using the same app. But the BlackBerry app had access to all of the reporter\u2019s Facebook friends and, for most of them, returned information such as user ID, birthday, work and education history and whether they were currently online.The BlackBerry device was also able to retrieve identifying information for nearly 295,000 Facebook users. Most of them were second-degree Facebook friends of the reporter, or friends of friends.In all, Facebook empowers BlackBerry devices to access more than 50 types of information about users and their friends, The Times found.Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.June 4, 2018April 4, 2018March 20, 2018March 17, 2018Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Trump\u2019s Plan to Overhaul the Government: Scaling Back the Safety Net", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, spurred on by conservatives who want him to slash safety net programs, unveiled on Thursday a plan to overhaul the federal government that could have a profound effect on millions of poor and working-class Americans.Produced over the last year by Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, it would reshuffle social welfare programs in a way that would make them easier to cut, scale back or restructure, according to several administration officials involved in the planning.Among the most consequential ideas is a proposal to shift the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a subsistence benefit that provides aid to 42 million poor and working Americans, from the Agriculture Department to a new mega-agency that would have \u201cwelfare\u201d in its title \u2014 a term Mr. Trump uses as a pejorative catchall for most government benefit programs.That proposal, which includes an equally ambitious plan to merge the Education and Labor Departments to consolidate work force programs, is not likely to gain the congressional approval needed to make the changes, Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s aides conceded in a phone call with reporters on Thursday.But the rollout has a bigger long-term purpose, said Margaret Weichert, one of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s deputies who drafted the proposal. She cast the proposal as a rallying cry for \u201csmall government\u201d and said the audacity of the plan proved \u201cwhy many Americans voted for this president.\u201dMr. Trump, for his part, joked on Thursday that the plan was \u201cextraordinarily boring\u201d before TV cameras in the Cabinet Room.But being boring in an all-too-exciting White House has provided cover for a small army of conservatives and think tank veterans who have been quietly churning out dozens of initiatives like the proposal to reshuffle the cabinet, with the ultimate goal of dismantling the American social welfare system from the inside out.\u201cOur guys have been in there since the start, grinding it out, and basically no one is noticing it except the smart liberals like Rachel Maddow,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former adviser, who believes the attack on social programs will be one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most enduring policy achievements.\u201cIt is one of the reasons Trump is at like 97 percent with the base. This is what the base wants,\u201d he said. Referring to the right-wing conspiracy theorist who hosts a popular radio show and the progressive consumer activists allied with Ralph Nader, who became a force in Democratic politics in the 1970s, he added: \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not Alex Jones that\u2019s driving things. It\u2019s these guys \u2014 they are our version of \u2018Nader\u2019s Raiders.\u2019\u201dPhilip G. Alston, a New York University professor and the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, agreed with Mr. Bannon\u2019s assessment. \u201cMy sense is they are making very considerable progress, even though no one is paying much attention,\u201d he said.But Mr. Alston, author of a recent study on endemic poverty in American cities and the rural South, has a different view of what Mr. Trump\u2019s aides are trying to do. \u201cThere is a contempt for the poor that seems to permeate the president\u2019s inner circle that seems very worrying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s done under the banner of providing opportunity and seeking long-term solutions but it all seems designed to increase misery.\u201dThe president himself is deeply uninterested in the details of policy and can identify only a handful of domestic policy aides, including Mr. Mulvaney, by name, according to current and former staff members. His policy operation during the 2016 campaign was skeletal.Aides would often watch Mr. Trump\u2019s stump speech on TV for cues on what he wanted to do, search Google for policy proposals that seemed to be the closest fit \u2014 then draft white papers or debate talking points from the results.As president, Mr. Trump would become so bored with the details of domestic policy that aides long ago stopped sharing all but the most top-line specifics of their plans \u2014 including the reorganization, according to several people who have worked closely with Mr. Trump.If Mr. Trump is fuzzy on policy, he is acutely attuned to the perils of offending his base, especially older voters.A few weeks after Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Mulvaney and a handful of other aides, including Reince Priebus, then the chief of staff, approached the president in the Oval Office to suggest a slate of entitlement changes to reduce costs in the Medicare and Social Security programs.They were a few minutes into their pitch, according to someone familiar with the meeting, when Mr. Trump waved a dismissive hand and shouted, \u201cNo way! What else you got?\u201dMr. Trump has, however, given wide latitude to conservatives like the education secretary, Betsy DeVos; the housing secretary, Ben Carson; Attorney General Jeff Sessions; the director of the Domestic Policy Council, Andrew Bremberg; and Mr. Mulvaney, who has emerged as the most provocative and hyperactive of the president\u2019s senior policy advisers.Mrs. Devos has been especially aggressive, pushing to loosen restrictions on for-profit colleges and enforcement of civil rights laws. She is close to Mr. Mulvaney and supported the proposal to merge her department with the Labor Department, calling it a \u201cbold reform\u201d in a statement.\u201cArtificial barriers between education and work force programs have existed for far too long,\u201d she added.Democratic critics saw the new proposal as a threat to both departments, but the proposal also divided conservatives.Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the Republican chairwoman of the House education committee who has aggressively pushed a higher education bill that would achieve the same goals, said it was \u201ca recognition of the clear relationship between education policy at every level and the needs of the growing American work force.\u201dBut it was one of the rare proposals that fell flat with conservative supporters who champion Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda to shrink the government, in part because it did not include an accounting of staff members or funding for the reorganization.For the most part, however, operatives aligned with Heritage, the Federalist Society and the sprawling Koch brothers network have been on the inside making policy.Benjamin Hobbs, a former employee of Heritage and the Charles Koch Foundation, who received a top policy job at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was a driving force behind a proposal to raise rents on some of the poorest residents of subsidized housing by as much as 44 percent, according to two administration officials.In a recent meeting, Mr. Hobbs raised eyebrows by claiming the increases were intended, in part, to persuade unmarried couples to move in with each other to pool rent payments, according to two people in attendance.Mr. Carson, his boss, broadly supports the idea of reducing dependence, aides said, but was lukewarm on the idea. The backlash to the proposal was so severe that Mr. Carson, speaking this month in Detroit, wavered when asked whether he planned to back legislation needed to achieve the hikes.Rick Dearborn, another former employee at Heritage, who served as deputy chief of staff for Mr. Trump during his first year in office, steered a total of about 70 Heritage-linked experts into policy roles in the White House and various cabinet departments.At the same time, Mr. Bannon, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s most influential aide at the dawn of the presidency, enlisted one of Heritage\u2019s founders, Edwin J. Feulner Jr., to help create a list of action items on scaling back social welfare programs days after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.Heritage had just received a multimillion-dollar commitment from Mr. Bannon\u2019s former benefactor, Rebekah Mercer, according to two people familiar with the gift. Much of the cash was informally earmarked, they said, to help Mr. Trump expand his near nascent policy operation, according to two people familiar with the details of the donation.By early 2017, Heritage produced a government reorganization plan that served as the initial template for Thursday\u2019s announcement. They also drafted a list of 334 policy recommendations, about half of them aimed at domestic programs for poor people or Obama-era regulations protecting low-income consumers.\u201cOnce the transition started, we seized on the opportunity to help out and define the policy agenda of the next administration,\u201d said Paul Winfree, a social policy expert at Heritage, who once worked for the Domestic Policy Council coordinating administration policy of social welfare programs and entitlements.\u201cEven when many thought Trump had no chance, Heritage researchers and alumni were working hard over on implementation plans,\u201d said Mr. Winfree. \u201cWe went to work while much attention was paid to the palace intrigue or on personalities. Having one big personality isn\u2019t enough to change a government. Having many good people, who know and trust each other, in the right places is the key.\u201dThe core of Mr. Trump\u2019s safety net policy is an expansion of work requirements to foster self-sufficiency among recipients of food assistance, Medicaid and housing subsidies to reduce dependence on the government. \u201cOur goal is to get people on the path to self-sufficiency,\u201d Mr. Bremberg said.Its real purpose, advocates for poor people claim, is to kick hundreds of thousands of the needy off the federal rolls, to cut taxes for the rich.That effort dovetailed with a separate but related rollback in the enforcement of fair housing, educational equity, payday lending and civil rights cases pursued aggressively under the Obama administration intended to protect vulnerable populations from discrimination and abusive business practices.\u201cIt\u2019s a war on the poor, pure and simple,\u201d said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which has challenged several Trump administration policies in federal court.The pace of administration activity in all of these areas has picked up sharply this year, in part because many of the conservatives inside the administration believe Mr. Trump\u2019s political and legal troubles will limit their window for action after the midterm elections.Over the last two weeks alone, Mr. Trump\u2019s team unsuccessfully tried to ram through a $15 billion bill clawing back domestic spending, Mr. Mulvaney fired the 25-member advisory board at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where he serves as the acting director, and administration lawyers challenged an Obama-era anti-discrimination rule that resulted in greater funding for projects in minority neighborhoods.What remains unclear is whether the flurry of activity will have a long-term effect on the trajectory of federal spending and the management of safety net programs.This year, the Heritage Foundation reported that Mr. Trump had checked off 64 percent of their policy checklist. But dozens of those victories were partial or pyrrhic.Some proposals, including Medicaid waivers that allow states to impose work requirements and the reorientation of enforcement across an array of federal agencies, are moving ahead despite court challenges. But many others, especially those in Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s dead-on-arrival budget proposals, have been blocked by Democrats with the help of Senate Republicans.As Mr. Mulvaney was pitching his reorganization plan to the cabinet and news media on Thursday, the House was passing a farm bill that included stiffer work requirements for SNAP recipients. Senate Republicans have already vowed to kill that provision.A handful of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s recommendations, including changes to federal personnel management and State Department overseas aid programs, can be accomplished through executive action alone.But many other parts of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s reorganization plan are likely to face similar resistance as work requirements, including efforts to consolidate fisheries and wildlife programs, aggregate food safety and inspection programs in the Agriculture Department, shift rural housing programs to HUD and move the Army Corps of Engineers to civilian agencies, among others.\u201cThis is an art-of-the-possible exercise,\u201d Ms. Weichert said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seattle Officials Repeal Tax That Upset Amazon", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeattle officials scuttled a corporate tax on Tuesday that they had wholeheartedly endorsed just a month ago, delivering a win for the measure\u2019s biggest opponent \u2014 Amazon \u2014 and offering a warning to cities bidding for the retailer\u2019s second headquarters that the company would go to the limit to get its way.But in Seattle, the notion has proved extraordinarily contentious, culminating in the abrupt reversal on Tuesday.Less than a month ago, the tax had passed unanimously. It was signed into law on May 16 by Jenny A. Durkan, Seattle\u2019s mayor, who said the money would \u201cmove people off the street and into safer places\u201d and \u201cclean up the garbage and needles that are in our parks and in our communities,\u201d as well as provide resources including job training and health services.\u201cI know we can be a city that continues to invent the future and come together to build a more affordable, inclusive and just future,\u201d she said.The opponents funded No Tax on Jobs, an effort aimed at getting enough signatures to put a repeal on the November ballot. It became obvious over the weekend that the measure would succeed in coming before voters, leading Ms. Durkan and seven council members to issue a statement saying, \u201cWe heard you.\u201dThe politicians had no stomach for a protracted battle over jobs, even at a moment when the area\u2019s unemployment rate is only 3.1 percent. \u201cIt is clear that the ordinance will lead to a prolonged, expensive political fight over the next five months that will do nothing to tackle our urgent housing and homelessness crisis,\u201d they said.Mike O\u2019Brien, a council member, said in an interview before the vote, \u201cI have a couple of bad choices and I\u2019m picking the less bad,\u201d meaning a vote to repeal.He was puzzled by the intensity and the virulence of the opposition. \u201cThis tax is not a perfect tool, but I think it\u2019s a good one,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there talking to the community, I hear they\u2019ve been convinced by Amazon and other business leaders that this would be bad.\u201dTeresa Mosqueda, one of the two council members opposing the repeal, said there was no backup plan for dealing with the homeless situation.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a path forward,\u201d she said. \u201cI share the frustration with all the City Council that we have been out-messaged.\u201dKshama Sawant, the other opponent of repeal on the council, called the vote \u201cboth capitulation and betrayal.\u201d\u201cThey are choosing to base themselves on making Amazon executives happy,\u201d she said. That \u201cis the biggest lesson that should reverberate to other cities as well.\u201dThe city\u2019s initial plan was for the tax to collect about $500 per employee a year. Amazon responded in early May by stopping its expansion in the city \u201cpending the outcome of the head tax vote.\u201d That was sufficient to get the tax knocked down to about $275 per employee and scaled back in other ways. The tax was limited to companies with at least $20 million in revenue a year.In recent months, however, there has been the beginning of a resistance to the notion that what is good for Amazon is inevitably good for its host.\u201cFrom coast to coast, people lose their homes and get displaced from their communities even as the biggest corporations earn record profits and development booms,\u201d said Sarah Johnson, director of Local Progress, a national association of progressive elected municipal officials. \u201cElected officials across the country are paying close attention to how Amazon and other corporations have responded to Seattle\u2019s efforts to confront their affordable housing and homelessness crisis.\u201dEspecially, it seems, in Silicon Valley itself, where both problems run deep.\u201cWe have needs we need to meet,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, the city\u2019s mayor. \u201cAnd we look to see where there\u2019s the most money. Most of our companies have money. We\u2019re trying to find a way for them to invest it that helps them and the community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Both were fearless explorers who pursued life\u2019s pleasures to the fullest. Both easily made new friends. Both struggled with substance abuse and depression for decades. Both bore their burdens with great humor and enthusiasm. Both died by their own hands.But surely, how a person lived is more important than how he or she died. Especially if that person improves the lives of others, as Bourdain improved mine.Until my 60th birthday, I had never traveled outside the United States. Better late than never. I\u2019ve since visited Thailand, France, Spain, Ireland and the Dominican Republic. I\u2019ve booked trips to Japan and Croatia.And everywhere I\u2019ve traveled, I\u2019ve devoured the local culture, and the local food.

{"Headline": "Top Tech Companies Met With Intelligence Officials to Discuss Midterms", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Eight of the tech industry\u2019s most influential companies, in anticipation of a repeat of the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, met with United States intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for this year\u2019s midterm elections.The meeting, which took place May 23 at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., was also attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oath, Snap and Twitter, according to three attendees of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because of its sensitive nature.The company officials met with Christopher Krebs, an under secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s newly formed \u201cforeign influence\u201d task force.Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the F.B.I. responded to a request for comment.Companies like Facebook and Twitter have been changing the way they operate to counter the kind of misinformation that plagued the two social services in 2016. But the May meeting was the first significant discussion between a group of tech companies and intelligence officials ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.The meeting, which was initiated by Facebook, was seen as a hopeful first step to ensure that the midterms were not a repeat of the Russian interference in 2016, said the three people who attended the meeting.But the people who attended described a tense atmosphere in which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information, only to be told \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that no specific intelligence would be shared.The tech companies shared details about disinformation campaigns they were witnessing on their platforms, but neither the F.B.I. nor the Department of Homeland Security was willing or able to share specific information about threats the tech companies should anticipate, the people said.One attendee of the meeting said the encounter led the tech companies to believe they would be on their own to counter election interference.Facebook, in particular, has been facing pressure to stem disinformation ahead of the elections. The company has been hit hard by reports that it allowed Russian-backed agents to buy advertisements and manage Facebook pages with one notable goal: influence voters in the United States and stoke conflict on hot-button issues like gun control.In public and behind closed doors, intelligence officials have offered scant details about what Russia is doing, prompting frustration from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill.Officials in Washington have described problems that range from intelligence agencies losing track of Russian targets to the same kind of poor communication between various intelligence-gathering agencies that hampered the response of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency has proved an especially vexing target in recent months, stepping up efforts to mask its activity, said an American official with access to intelligence reporting.Unlike in 2016, when Russian hackers left unmistakable footprints \u2014 posting tweets that identified locations, for instance, or working in Cyrillic language documents \u2014 they are now making much better use of virtual private networks and other tools that can hide their true identities and locations.At times, the official said, intelligence agencies have lost track of specific individuals they were tracking, and could not see what, if anything, the Russians were posting or trying to hack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting so many mixed signals, depending on what the agency is,\u201d Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters last week.He said his committee was planning to bring together intelligence officials next month to figure out what was going on and how the government should handle it. \u201cIt compels us to bring everybody together in the same room and try to figure out whether or not there\u2019s some stovepipe issues,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Part of the problem, officials say, is that the White House has expressed little interest in the problem of Russian interference, and that the apathy has had a trickle-down effect. Without pressure from the top, it can be difficult to bring together all the different strands of intelligence collected across America\u2019s spy agencies, and evaluate how to act on it.\u201cWhat we would normally see in a normal administration is the principals meeting to discuss what are they doing individually, what are they doing jointly, or what they are communicating among themselves, what\u2019s the whole of government plan to protect the midterms,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and the top minority member on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with Politico. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any evidence that\u2019s happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Your First Apartment", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf the many new arrivals who pour into New York City each spring with new degrees, new jobs, or simply new life plans, Patrick Laflamme thought that he would be in a fairly good position to find an apartment.A graduate student in cognitive psychology moving from Vancouver, British Columbia, to take a job with an investment bank, Mr. Laflamme had experience with competitive housing markets \u2014 \u201cthe Vancouver rental market is pretty aggressive: you go to see a listing and there are 40 people lined up outside\u201d \u2014 and he was accustomed to spending a large percentage of his income on rent.\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t too picky. I just didn\u2019t want to be more than a half-hour from the financial district,\u201d said Mr. Laflamme, 24, who set what seemed a reasonable budget of about $2,000 a month for a one-bedroom or large studio in Manhattan. \u201cRental agents don\u2019t really exist in Vancouver; you just kind of make it work. I figured that\u2019s what I would do in New York, too.\u201dBut several weeks of looking on Craigslist turned up only bait-and-switch scenarios, studios sneakily shot from angles that made them look like one-bedrooms and suspiciously beautiful apartments in Midtown managed by out-of-state companies without a New York address.\u201cI\u2019d read on some blogs that you should get an agent if you\u2019re not from New York, but I had been a skeptic,\u201d Mr. Laflamme said. \u201cFinally, I got one. Unless you have connections in the city, the barrier to entry is high.\u201dEven for renters accustomed to complex housing markets, finding an apartment in New York can be daunting. Many first-time renters arrive in the city braced for small, expensive apartments, but few are prepared for just how small and expensive.How much flexibility is required to get more space or seemingly basic perks like an elevator or dishwasher? Is it a matter of changing neighborhoods, raising your budget or just looking harder?For those unfamiliar with the city, a good agent can be invaluable for maximizing the number of apartments a potential renter sees \u2014 and then guiding that renter through the application process, and helping determine whether the renter\u2019s budget and expectations are reasonable.Bailey Gladysz said that when she moved to the city five years ago, she and her husband had a budget of $2,400, and they wanted a spacious one-bedroom with natural light in an elevator building in Chelsea. \u201cBrokers would literally take us to the worst apartment and say that we needed to increase our budget,\u201d she recalled.Now a real estate agent with Triplemint, Ms. Gladysz said she would never show renters grim listings to convince them to give in to higher prices. Instead, she tempers expectations at the outset.\u201cIf it\u2019s their first time moving to the city and they\u2019re a new college grad with not much money, I have to politely tell them to drop things off their must-have list,\u201d she said.Many newcomers aren\u2019t being intentionally demanding, she added, they just don\u2019t understand how New York works. When she explains that it is not that unusual for people to send their laundry out or have packages delivered to their workplaces, many are happy to forgo the in-unit washer-dryer or the doorman.And factors that, to the uninitiated, may not seem worth mentioning can sometimes derail or at least drastically change a New York apartment hunt.Kim Bloomfield, an agent at Citi Habitats, recalled showing a man moving from Washington one-bedrooms on the Upper East Side in the $2,300 range, which limited him primarily to walk-ups. \u201cOn the sixth or seventh apartment, he tells me he has a king-size bed that he\u2019s not willing to give up,\u201d said Ms. Bloomfield, who had to explain to the man that not only were the layouts of the older walk-ups in his price range not ideal for a king-size bed, she was not even sure he would be able to get it up the stairs.The man held firm and ended up finding an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. \u201cAt the end of the day, he was willing to move pretty far away from where he was looking to keep his bed,\u201d she said.Deciding what to sacrifice can be difficult, however, especially as financial necessity compels most recent college grads to live with roommates who may not all be on the same page. It is not uncommon, brokers say, for one roommate to get stuck on a specific neighborhood or amenity that the other roommates are more than willing to do without. Several brokers recalled watching would-be roommates break up in the middle of showings.Though the last few years have seen rents in the city level out, the breather came only after a relentless, yearslong climb, and rents remain prohibitively high for many New Yorkers in their 20s and 30s. Student loan debt is another big factor, Mr. Malin said: \u201cIncomes haven\u2019t gone up that dramatically, but rents have gone up and student loan debt has gone up.\u201dAfter college and law school, Kristen Pride recently moved back to Bedford-Stuyvesant, where she grew up. She wanted to find a one-bedroom, but couldn\u2019t afford the $2,300 and $2,400 rents she was seeing, \u201cnot even on an attorney\u2019s salary,\u201d she said. \u201cNot with student loans.\u201dFinally, she found something on StreetEasy in her price range \u2014 an older, unrenovated one-bedroom for $1,750 a month \u2014 and the broker was eager to put her application through. But she was reluctant. Rationally, she knew that the apartment was a good deal, but it felt like a lot to pay, especially for an older building.In the end, she signed the lease, but she hasn\u2019t been able to bring herself to tell anyone in her family how much she pays. \u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is super passionate about gentrification. He gets so mad and is like, \u2018This is crazy, people shouldn\u2019t be paying this much in Bed-Stuy!\u2019\u201dFor the many people who move to New York without a full-time job \u2014 or a well-paid one \u2014 finding a sublet or pre-existing share are among the few available options. In most cases, going one of these routes means the renter can avoid having to submit pay stubs and bank records, or signing a yearlong lease. But the process can be grueling in other ways.Matt Gelman, a 23-year-old copywriter and coder freelancing at a tech company in Dumbo, Brooklyn, recently moved into his second Williamsburg sublet, a $1,300-a-month room he found on Gypsy Housing. On the night he went to see the room, he was told that seven other people were interested, and because of a scheduling glitch, one of them would be touring it at the same time.\u201cThe other guy was clearly interested, so I had to prove I wanted it more,\u201d Mr. Gelman said. \u201cI emailed right away and said I wanted to meet the other roommates.\u201dActually, Mr. Gelman clarified, he Facebook messaged using Google translator, because the roommates, who were French, do not speak much English, and he does not speak French. Fortunately, they have since discovered that they all speak Spanish.But while terrible first-apartment tales tend to get passed around like scary stories at a campfire, it is important to remember that not every first-time renting experience is harrowing.As a senior at Emory University in 2016, Rifat Mursalin attended a presentation by a New York brokerage, but blanched at the prices of their listings. \u201cIt was like $3,800 for a two-bedroom in Hell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d he said. Neither he nor his roommate felt the need to live in Manhattan, \u201cand we could care less about having a doorman or a gym.\u201d A friend suggested he try StreetEasy, where he found a no-fee two-bedroom in East Williamsburg for $2,200 a month.\u201cIt was quite daunting before I came here, but not when I arrived,\u201d said Mr. Mursalin, who also used the site to find his current apartment, a $2,200 two-bedroom in Long Island City. The neighborhood is known for its lushly amenitized new construction, but his building is a bare-bones walk-up. The only upgrade he insisted on, he said, was better transit.And for all those put off by the price of New York apartments, there are some recent arrivals who find them comparatively reasonable. When Madeleine Goldsmith moved to the city from San Francisco last summer to start a new career as a theater producer, she was delighted to see her rent plummet from $1,500 a month to $1,075.\u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s a steal!\u2019\u201d said Ms. Goldsmith, who currently shares a Harlem three-bedroom with two roommates. \u201cIt\u2019s so much cheaper here.

{"Headline": "How I Accidentally Made My Mom a Bollywood Star", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rizwan is a comedian and actor.LONDON \u2014 When I was 16, I started filming silly videos at home on my camcorder and uploading them to YouTube. Like any millennial, I was in search of some juicy online validation. I showed the videos to my mom and told her that people do this for a living. She laughed and told me to get a real job.I succeeded in getting her on my side \u2014 and we got almost eight million views that first year.In 2013, I got a call from a producer in India saying that she was casting a lead role in a prime-time TV series. \u201cHere we go,\u201d I thought. \u201cFinally, Bollywood\u2019s calling.\u201dThe producer clarified. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want your mother.\u201dI told my mom, assuming she would never consider such a thing. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a go,\u201d she said.I was shocked. The woman who just months before had been giving me a hard time about my videos was willing to put herself on tape for an audition. I helped her film it and we sent it off. A few months later, the producer offered her the role. She quit her job as an English teacher in the suburbs of London, flew to Mumbai and started working as a Bollywood actress. She has been there for five years and is best known for playing Mrs. Bhalla on a show called \u201cYeh Hai Mohabbatein,\u201d or \u201cThis is Love.\u201d According to a group that tracks television ratings in India, it\u2019s one of the country\u2019s top five shows, with millions of viewers each week.It\u2019s a golden-ticket story \u2014 the kind of showbiz tale people marvel at \u2014 but it actually feels as if my mother\u2019s life has come full circle.My mother, Shahnaz Rizwan, was born in the 1950s in tumultuous post-partition Pakistan. She was one of nine siblings and her family had very little money. Her dad sold film reels to studios, and one day when a child actor dropped out of a movie, he suggested my mom as a replacement. At age 3 she made her film debut. Over the next decade, she told me, she went on to star in more than 30 black-and-white Pakistani films. By 12, she was supporting her family with her earnings. She was basically the Macaulay Culkin of Karachi.But when she was a teenager, she had to stop acting. People told her it was no profession for a young woman and that only prostitutes worked as actresses. She gave up the movies and quickly transitioned from stardom to normal life.As a young adult, she was the first woman in her neighborhood to ride a bicycle. Today, you\u2019d be praised for choosing such an eco-friendly mode of transport, but back then it was scandalous for a woman to travel by bike without a male escort. Many people scolded her for it, calling her a prostitute (this seemed to be a theme in her early years).She wanted a life beyond the limitations she felt in Pakistan, so she came to Britain in the 1990s with my sister and me tucked under her arms \u2014 and no money, no husband, no connections. It was four years before my dad could follow. In the meantime, my mom did every \u201creal job\u201d possible, from cleaning to sewing in a factory. She got an English degree and eventually found a job teaching English to other immigrants.But she was always a performer. When I was a kid, she would organize plays at our town hall \u2014 she rented it by the hour to write, direct and produce the shows. The cast consisted of her children and the Lithuanian students she roped into learning lines as part of their English lessons. The plot of her first play, \u201cHusband for Sale,\u201d was about a business-minded wife (played by her) who tries to sell off her husband (played by my dad) to a rich elderly lady. I\u2019m sure it was more therapeutic for her than anything.When I was 8 years old, my mom received a letter of deportation, informing her that we\u2019d have to leave the country. She had one main focus \u2014 to get her children educated before we had to go. I studied around the clock, signing up for every scholarship exam possible.While I was doing that, my mom was engaged in a year of protests and legal battles. Every weekend I had to help her distribute fliers door-to-door, to gather petition signatures in support of immigrants\u2019 rights. She managed to build a support network not only for herself but also for other immigrants and began to organize weekly meetings in the basement of a South Asian supermarket. She gave a speech at a conference and caught the attention of a lawyer who offered to represent her at no cost.After all her community work and court proceedings, we gained \u201cindefinite leave to remain.\u201d By the time the Spice Girls released their third album, we were bona fide citizens of Britain.A few years later, I stumbled across YouTube and spent all my spare time learning how to use a secondhand camcorder. Life suddenly became a lot more exciting when I could make a video of me titled \u201cTwerking in Public\u201d and share it with the world.Today, my mother has decided to step away from her TV role. She wants to spend more time back in Britain with her family. But her fame is interfering a bit with my own ambitions. If you type my name into Google \u2014 not that I would know ! \u2014 it auto-suggests \u201cMawaan Rizwan mum.\u201dWhen I visited her in India a couple of years ago, I asked her whether she was feeling overwhelmed by her newfound fame. She said, \u201cI\u2019m not famous, Mawaan, I just have lots of friends now.\u201dSo I think she\u2019s coping just fine. In fact, she\u2019s using her fame to her advantage. When I was at the Mumbai airport with her, our bags were over the weight limit. My mom gave a knowing smile to the woman working at the airline counter. The woman realized who she was and freaked out. Eventually the entire check-in staff started screaming. Workers and passengers lined up for autographs. My mom posed for selfies; no one complained about the bags.When I was a boy, I witnessed my mother make the impossible possible in our lives. Then, with a few silly videos, we did the same for her on a bigger scale than either of us imagined.The only problem now is my dad. Recently, he sat me down so that we could talk. \u201cYou made your mum famous,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about me?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Silicon Valley Could Use More Of: Inefficiency", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Hypocrisy thrives at the Waldorf School of the Peninsula in the heart of Silicon Valley. This is where Google executives send their children to learn how to knit, write with chalk on blackboards, practice new words by playing catch with a beanbag and fractions by cutting up quesadillas and apples. There are no screens \u2014 not a single piece of interactive, multimedia, educational content. The kids don\u2019t even take standardized tests.While Silicon Valley\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is making platforms, apps and algorithms to create maximum efficiency in life and work (a \u201cfriction-free\u201d world, as Bill Gates once put it), when it comes to their own families (and developing their own businesses, too), the new masters of the universe have a different sense of what it takes to learn and innovate \u2014 it\u2019s a slow, indirect process, meandering not running, allowing for failure and serendipity, even boredom.Back in 1911, the English philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said that \u201ccivilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.\u201d By that metric, Uber and Google and Amazon Prime have given us a whole lot of civilization. And there\u2019s no doubt our lives are better for it. (Ordering Chinese takeout in 30 seconds on an app might not be up there with Shakespeare or the incandescent light bulb, but it\u2019s pretty great.) This unrelenting drive for efficiency has, however, blotted out a few things we all know intuitively but seem to be forgetting.To create a product or service that is truly efficient often involves a lot of inefficiency \u2014 more like learning to knit than pressing a button. Likewise, gadgets built with a single-minded focus on efficiency can often backfire, subverting their purpose. Algorithms designed to dish up the news and information we most prefer end up blinkering us to all but a narrow slice of political and social reality. Our smartphones untether us from the office, saving us energy on travel, but also allow our lives to be interrupted nearly 24 hours a day, chewing up any productive idle time.This all seems fairly obvious. But, as Edward Tenner writes in \u201cThe Efficiency Paradox,\u201d \u201cwe sometimes need to be reminded of the obvious.\u201d Tenner has made a career worrying about unintended consequences. His 1996 book, \u201cWhy Things Bite Back,\u201d dealt with phenomena like the overuse of antibiotics leading to resistant bacteria and the introduction of football helmets causing an increase of neck and spine injuries. In 2003, he published \u201cOur Own Devices,\u201d in which he turned to what he called body technologies \u2014 sandals, office chairs, computer keyboards \u2014 and how they had impaired as much as enhanced us. In short, for every three steps forward, he sees the two steps back.With the internet now a dominant social force, Tenner is ready with his wet blanket. But he is not a cyber-pessimist or a fetishizer of the analog. He is, instead, a staunch moderate: \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s mistake is not in developing efficient algorithms from which we all benefit, but in encouraging the illusion that algorithms can and should function in the absence of human skills.\u201dThe dehumanizing effects of big data are well known and Tenner adds no groundbreaking insight here. (Books like Cathy O\u2019Neil\u2019s \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction\u201d and Evgeny Morozov\u2019s \u201cTo Save Everything, Click Here\u201d were more pioneering on this front.) But what Tenner brings is a new frame. Unlike critiquing the denizens of Silicon Valley for deepening social and economic inequality, destroying our brains or helping to undermine democratic norms (issues that seem to matter to us more than them), questioning efficiency is truly kicking the geeks where it hurts.Drawing on an eclectic bunch of anecdotes and studies, Tenner makes his way through four sectors in which \u201cintuition, skill and experience\u201d have been effectively crushed by \u201cbig data, algorithms and efficiency\u201d: media and culture, education, transportation and medicine.A few of his examples:Search algorithms have extended the ability to find scientific journal articles and books dating to the 19th century. In principle, this means scholars may encounter a broad range of research and discovery, dredge up forgotten work and possibly connect important dots. But in reality, as one sociologist found after studying citations in 35 million scientific journal articles from before and after the invention of the internet, researchers, beholden to search algorithms\u2019 tendency to generate self-reinforcing feedback loops, are now paying more attention to fewer papers, and in general to the more recent and popular ones \u2014 actually strengthening rather than bucking prevailing trends.GPS is great for getting from one point to another, but if you need more context for understanding your surroundings, it\u2019s fairly useless. We\u2019ve all had experiences in which the shortest distance, as calculated by the app, can also be the most dangerous or traffic-clogged. Compare the efficiency of GPS with the three years aspiring London cabdrivers typically spend preparing for the arduous examination they must pass in order to receive their license. They learn to build a mental map of the entire city, to navigate under any circumstance, to find shortcuts and avoid risky situations \u2014 all without any external, possibly fallible, help. Which is the more efficient, ultimately, the cabby or Google Maps?In the early 2000s, electronic medical records and electronic prescribing appeared to solve the lethal problem of sloppy handwriting. The United States Institute of Medicine estimated in 1999 that 7,000 patients in the United States were dying annually because of errors in reading prescriptions. But the electronic record that has emerged to answer this problem, and to help insurers manage payments, is full of detailed codes and seemingly endless categories and subcategories. Doctors now have to spend an inordinate amount of time on data entry. One 2016 study found that for every hour doctors spent with patients, two hours were given over to filling out paperwork, leaving much less time to listen to patients, arguably the best way to avoid misdiagnoses.Faced with all these \u201cinefficiently efficient\u201d technologies, what should we do? Tenner wants more balance. Let\u2019s not put the brakes on the drive for efficiency. These tools are good. But they should give way a bit to human sensibility, to our own instincts and insights, which could help them work even better. \u201cAnalog experience can enhance digital efficacy,\u201d he writes. \u201cDigital tools can improve analog access. We don\u2019t have to choose between the two.\u201dHis recommendations are sensible, if hard to imagine actually coming to pass. He wants us to spend more time in the physical world, in the \u201cterrain\u201d of our cities or between the paragraphs of a printed book. We need to get a little lost, pursue \u201cproductive and instructive disorientation, distraction, wild-goose chases, dead ends.\u201d He likes the idea of systematically educating high school students in the skill of online searching, so they can make the algorithms work for them rather than slavishly accepting their results. He wouldn\u2019t mind if we returned to the days of the dial-up modem, when we waited patiently for the pixels to materialize on the screen one by one. Instant gratification has dulled our senses. He\u2019d put us all in Waldorf schools if he could.If this sounds like Tenner is a man impassioned, I should be clearer: This is no manifesto. There is not much blood flowing through this book, which reads more like a report issued by a concerned think tank. Maybe it\u2019s just that preaching moderation doesn\u2019t lend itself to writing that pulls your face to the page.Gal Beckerman is an editor at the Book Review.Advertisement"}

The fatal episode was captured on video from three different angles: two police body cameras and an overhead, heat-sensing helicopter camera. It all happened in 23 seconds.So what exactly led to the deadly encounter, and what happened after? Our analysis establishes five critical moments and reveals a series of split-second decisions that resulted in the death of Stephon Clark, in his backyard.In Mr. Clark\u2019s case, the protesters demanded the city\u2019s leadership fire the two officers involved. Mr. Clark\u2019s family also accused the police department of trying to cover up misconduct by its officers. An investigation into the shooting by the Sacramento Police Department is ongoing. The two officers involved in the shooting are back on desk duty, but aren\u2019t out on patrol.For our analysis, we started by looking at every frame of the crucial 23 seconds. Then, we used Google Earth to map the officers\u2019 and Clark\u2019s movements, by matching up the videos with satellite imagery.Why are we doing this, and what does it explain?Our goal was to shed new light on what happened during the encounter and to explain why it escalated so quickly.Background reading, watching and listening:Advertisement"}

In those days, I was winging it. I knew I had an incredible gig and didn\u2019t want to mess it up by revealing the hassles that went along with it.I also had the disadvantage of working in the days before digital photography was widespread and affordable. I shot on film, with a camera, heavy lenses and a tripod, and lugged this gear around wherever I went. My back was a mess for years. The most valuable thing you can take on your trip isn\u2019t a suitcase or app; it\u2019s the email or number of a local contact. Whenever I travel, I try to make some connections on the ground before I go. Sometimes I travel to a destination I would not have otherwise thought of, because of a friend I\u2019ve made there. Here\u2019s a question for you guys: Is there anything (besides laundry) that you always try to do when you visit somewhere? I often get under the skin of a place by booking a personal service like a shampoo-and-blow-dry or a pedicure. I\u2019d love to chat a little bit more about the difficulties and hardships that have come up on the road and what, if anything, we learned from those experiences.Aside from physical danger, traveling alone for months a year comes with a dose of loneliness and two doses of exhaustion. The cure for loneliness, I always found, was talking to strangers \u2014 easier in some countries than others. Now that I\u2019m in my early 60s I find that age has much more impact on how I experience travel than gender. Being older on the road is equal parts disconcerting, humbling and enlightening. It\u2019s a whole new world. Fortunately I\u2019m in good health and I can do all the same things I did when I was writing the column. But I can tell that the people I encounter along the way see and deal with me differently than when I was doing the column in my 40s. Sometimes that means I get treated extra nicely, especially in generation-conscious Asia. In other situations, though, it means I\u2019m invisible and ignored or just don\u2019t fit the profile. The same applies for food and entertainment. I love eating and drinking on the street and in small local places not because they\u2019re cheap per se, but because they frequently give a better sense what life is actually like in that city or country (It helps if the food is good, of course). So that means eating a big steaming bag of dumplings on the street in Chengdu for 8 yuan (about $1.20), yes. But I think it\u2019s also valuable to show that eating upscale can be done, too.

{"Headline": "Blurred Vision, Burning Eyes: This Is a Lasik Success? ", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome patients who undergo the eye surgery report a variety of side effects. They may persist for years, studies show.Ever since he had Lasik surgery two years ago, Geobanni Ramirez sees everything in triplicate. The surgery he hoped would improve his vision left the 33-year-old graphic artist struggling with extreme light sensitivity, double vision and visual distortions that create halos around bright objects and turn headlights into blinding starbursts. His eyes are so dry and sore that he puts drops in every half-hour; sometimes they burn \u201clike when you\u2019re chopping onions.\u201d His night vision is so poor that going out after dark is treacherous. But Mr. Ramirez says that as far as his surgeon is concerned, he is a success story. \u201cMy vision is considered 20/20, because I see the A\u2019s, B\u2019s and C\u2019s all the way down the chart,\u201d said Mr. Ramirez. \u201cBut I see three A\u2019s, three B\u2019s, three C\u2019s.\u201d None of the surgeons he consulted ever warned him he could sustain permanent damage following Lasik, he added.The Food and Drug Administration approved the first lasers to correct vision in the 1990s. Roughly 9.5 million Americans have had laser eye surgery, lured by the promise of a quick fix ridding them of nettlesome glasses and contact lenses. There is also a wide perception among patients, fostered by many eye doctors who do the surgery, that the procedure is virtually foolproof. Even now, serious questions remain about both the short- and long-term risks and the complications of this increasingly common procedure.Nearly half of all people who had healthy eyes before Lasik developed visual aberrations for the first time after the procedure, the trial found. Nearly one-third developed dry eyes, a complication that can cause serious discomfort, for the first time. The authors wrote that \u201cpatients undergoing Lasik surgery should be adequately counseled about the possibility of developing new visual symptoms after surgery before undergoing this elective procedure.\u201dLack of precise information about complications is a problem that plagues many medical devices, which are tested by manufacturers and often gain F.D.A. approval before long-term outcomes are known, said Diana Zuckerman, president of the nonprofit National Center for Health Research in Washington. \u201cThe F.D.A. keeps promising to do a better job of post-market surveillance, but there is no evidence of real improvement,\u201d she said. Patients\u2019 vision may regress after surgery, and they may need to use eyeglasses at times, some concede. But most Lasik surgeons maintain that soreness, dry eyes, double vision and other visual aberrations like those suffered by Mr. Ramirez subside within months for most patients.\u201cOver all, it is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done for myself,\u201d said Mr. Puglisi, who lives in Baldwin, N.Y.Surgeons frequently point to the procedure\u2019s popularity as evidence of its success: Lasik was performed on some 700,000 eyes last year, up from 628,724 in 2016, according to Market Scope, a market research company that focuses on the ophthalmic industry.\u201cDo bad outcomes sometimes occur? Yes. But the risk is extremely low,\u201d said Dr. Eric Donnenfeld, who was Mr. Puglisi\u2019s surgeon and a past president of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.Yet few studies have followed patients for more than a few months or a year, and many are authored by surgeons with financial ties to manufacturers that make the lasers. But the study also found that even after all those years, nearly half had dry eyes at least some of the time. Twenty percent had painful or sore eyes, 40 percent were sensitive to light, and one-third had difficulty driving at night or doing work that required seeing well up close.A similar percentage experienced \u201csevere or worse\u201d glare, halos and problems driving at night. Still, a year after surgery, the percentage of the roughly 350 patients who had mild difficulties driving at night had increased slightly to 20 percent, while the percentage with mild glare and halos had more than doubled to about 20 percent in each category. The percentage with mild dryness more than doubled to 40 percent.Now a vocal cadre of patient advocates is demanding the agency issue strong public warnings about Lasik. The group is led by Morris Waxler, a retired senior F.D.A. official who regrets the role he played in Lasik\u2019s approval over 20 years ago, and Paula Cofer, a patient-turned-advocate who says Lasik destroyed her eyesight and left her with chronic pain. \u201cWe want the F.D.A. to warn the public that Lasik injures eyes and causes pain, vision problems and other persistent problems that cannot be solved \u2014 and that you don\u2019t get these problems from glasses or contact lenses,\u201d said Dr. Waxler, a former chief of the diagnostic and surgical devices branch in the F.D.A.\u2019s division of ophthalmic devices. Lasik can also interfere with the detection of glaucoma, or the buildup of pressure within the eye that, if left untreated, can lead to blindness.Scott Petty, 36, a 3-D artist from Houston who developed video games for a living, was diagnosed with corneal ectasia six months after having Lasik surgery.His sight has continued to deteriorate, even after he underwent a new procedure called corneal cross-linking to strengthen his cornea. He is in so much pain that he is \u201calmost suicidal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like hot grease is in my eyes, 24-7. I pretty much have to admit my career is over.\u201d Both Mr. Petty and Mr. Ramirez said shame and self-blame keep many Lasik patients from publicly talking about their injuries. \u201cI go to sleep at night beating myself up about it, thinking, \u2018Why did I not at least Google the possible side effects and complications of Lasik?\u2019\u201d Mr. Ramirez said. \u201cI do that when I buy a car.\u201d Lasik \u2014 short for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis \u2014 eliminates the need for glasses by reshaping the cornea, the clear round dome that covers the front of the eye. The cornea\u2019s function is to focus light on the retina at the back of the eye. Lasik surgeons use an ultraviolet laser to reduce the curvature of the cornea for people who are nearsighted, and to accent it for people who are farsighted.The surgeon first uses a suction ring to flatten the eye in order to cut a flap in the cornea, folding the flap back to reveal the middle section, called the stroma. Then the surgeon uses pulses from a computer-controlled laser to destroy a portion of the stroma, and replaces the flap. The entire procedure, which costs $4,176 on average, is usually over in less than 15 minutes. It is not covered by most health insurance policies because it is considered a cosmetic or elective procedure.Dr. Cynthia MacKay, one of the few ophthalmologists who has spoken out against the procedure, said the surgery can injure the eye because it severs tiny corneal nerves, thins the cornea and makes it weaker, and permanently alters the shape of the eye. She said after Lasik, all people lose contrast sensitivity, the ability to distinguish between shades of gray, to some degree. It is an elective procedure, she emphasized, that does not provide any benefits that cannot be obtained with glasses or contact lenses. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with eyes that undergo Lasik except for the fact that they need glasses for distance,\u201d Dr. MacKay said. \u201cThey see well before the procedure and ought to see equally well after the procedure. But they don\u2019t.\u201dIndeed, the F.D.A.\u2019s new clinical trial, carried out with the National Eye Institute and the Navy Refractive Surgery Center and published last year, was the first to report that people who did not have dry eyes or visual aberrations before Lasik were at high risk for developing these problems: 28 percent of these participants developed dry eyes after surgery, and 45 percent reported a new visual aberration three months after surgery. But many of the trial\u2019s 574 participants reported having visual aberrations and dry eyes before surgery, and the study concluded that Lasik slightly reduced the prevalence of these problems.Even after six months, some 41 percent of patients reported visual aberrations, with nearly 2 percent \u2014 or one in 50 \u2014 saying the symptoms presented \u201ca lot of difficulty\u201d or \u201cso much difficulty that I can no longer do some of my usual activities.\u201d And one-quarter of the patients followed six months had mild to severe dry eyes.The authors did not publish findings about other adverse outcomes, like eye pain, difficulty working on a computer and difficulty driving at night, and the raw data has yet to be released as required for publicly funded trials.Dr. John Vukich, chair of the American Society for Cataract and Refractive Surgery\u2019s refractive clinical surgery committee, acknowledged that visual distortions are potential side effects of Lasik, but said technological advances have reduced the risk. \u201cNo eye is optically perfect, and all eyes (with or without Lasik) have at least some degree of higher-order aberrations. These irregularities can cause visual distortions,\u201d he wrote in an email. The study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Malvina Eydelman, director of the division of ophthalmic and ear, nose and throat devices at the F.D.A.\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the researchers had concluded that the multimillion-dollar trial was too small to produce meaningful results, and that the purpose of the study had shifted from determining how many patients have problems functioning to developing a questionnaire that might be used in future research. \u201cThe F.D.A. does not have the money right now to perform the study that was originally planned, which was to estimate the percentage of patients who have difficulty performing their usual activities as a result of symptoms following Lasik surgery, and identify the predictive risk factors for those patients,\u201d Dr. Eydelman said. Even when people experienced difficulties, Dr. Eydelman said, they were not \u201csignificant.\u201d An F.D.A. spokeswoman added that many patients \u201cget used to symptoms over time.\u201dThe F.D.A. clinical trial did little to resolve the contentious debate about dry-eye disease. Many patients say the term is a misnomer that does not begin to describe the severe eye pain they have continued to experience years after surgery.\u201cWhen you hear, \u2018You may have dry eyes,\u2019 it doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal,\u201d said Sarah Clair, 26, of Richmond, Va., who had Lasik in 2016. But her dry-eye syndrome did not resolve as promised, and a year after surgery morphed into intense pain that felt \u201clike someone had punched me in the face,\u201d said Ms. Clair.While some patients have mild symptoms that can be managed with artificial tears or prescription eyedrops, others have crisscrossed the country seeking relief for pain they say feels like needles or knives in their eyes, and use medication to ease the pain. Katie Enders, 35, a kindergarten teacher in Cleveland, said her 2006 Lasik surgery left her feeling she had \u201cpaper cuts in her eyes.\u201d She saw over a dozen doctors and tried several pain medications, finally getting relief from a pain pump implanted in her abdomen that carries a constant infusion of anesthetic up her spine. Many Lasik surgeons are dismissive of claims of persistent severe pain or call it extraordinarily rare. But ophthalmologists who study pain say their thinking has evolved in recent years, and they now recognize Lasik as one of many surgical procedures that can lead to neuropathic pain, or pain caused by nerve damage. Other eye surgeries, like cataract surgery, can have the same effect.\u201cEvery single time you do surgery and cut into tissue, you damage nerves. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s breast surgery or eye surgery,\u201d said Dr. Anat Galor, an associate professor of clinical ophthalmology at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami. \u201cWe have sensory nerves all over our body, and the cornea is one of the most heavily innervated organs in the body, so it is a little more sensitive to nerve damage.\u201d While Dr. Galor said the incidence of neuropathic pain is unknown, Dr. Vukich said it is \u201cone of the rarest conditions associated with Lasik.\u201d Dr. Pedram Hamrah, director of clinical research at the New England Eye Center at Tufts Medical Center, has written about treatments for neuropathic eye pain and is doing research to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes. Among those who may be at risk are people with large pupils; thin corneas, abnormally shaped corneas or other corneal abnormalities or scarring; high degrees of astigmatism; severe dry eye; and possibly people who have other sensitivities, pain syndromes or neurological disorders, frequent headaches or anxiety and depression.The F.D.A.\u2019s Dr. Eydelman said that with Lasik, \u201clike other medical procedures, there are risks,\u201d but that the F.D.A. considers it \u201csafe and effective when used as intended in accordance with approved use.\u201d Critics contend that Lasik should be held to a higher safety standard than other medical procedures, since it is optional. \u201cEven if it\u2019s 2 percent who are at risk for sight-threatening problems, that\u2019s thousands of people being put at risk every year,\u201d Dr. Waxler said. \u201cWhat is an acceptable level of risk when you\u2019re operating on healthy eyes?\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Astrology Religion for Those of Us With No Religion?", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn April I visited a crystal store in Minneapolis. Soft synthesized chimes played, the kind of sounds you get when you search for \u201cspa music\u201d on Pandora. I flipped through \u201cThe Crystal Bible\u201d looking for a stone with healing properties for my sacral chakra \u2014 a center of spiritual power in the body. Next to me, a woman in a purple velvet newsboy hat examined fragrant bundles of palo santo wood, Spanish for \u201choly wood,\u201d a serious look on her face.It had come to this.\u201cIs this the gayest moment of my life?\u201d I wondered.(No, it was not: I once slept with a woman who rubbed her hands with a squirt of organic lavender hand sanitizer from an enormous pump bottle before touching my shoulder while Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d played in the background.)But the crystal store moment made it to my Top 5.I was in a crystal store because I had injured my tailbone in February, and it wasn\u2019t healing. It turns out you need your butt to do everything, and after seeing a doctor and two chiropractors, I was referred to a massage therapist/energy worker who worked out of a chiropractor\u2019s office.The masseuse grazed her hands over my body and informed me that my root chakra, at the base of my spine, was holding a lot of grief about my mother and could not heal until I addressed it and cleared the chakra.Five years ago, I would have laughed and dismissed the energy worker\u2019s diagnosis as nonsense. Expensive woo-woo garbage for suckers. My root chakra? O.K. And this session of hand-fluttering was how much \u2014 $90? Ohhhkay.But I stiffened on her massage table, and my eyes, squished into the puffy face cushion, widened \u2014 I hadn\u2019t told her my mom had recently died.And soon after that, I found myself in line to buy a polished sphere of root-healing red carnelian. Two middle-aged women with matching haircuts held hands in front of me as they bought an oversize amethyst cluster. They nodded at me as they left, recognizing me for what I am now: one of them.It took me 15 years as a lesbian to finally become a person who pays attention to whether Mercury is in retrograde, someone who is excited about the summer solstice on June 21, a person who reads her Chani Nicholas horoscope each week with bated breath.This is the part of queer culture I used to mock the hardest. It has rubbed off on me, at last. And it seems I\u2019m not alone. There has been a 40 percent increase in Google searches for \u201ccrystal healing\u201d over the past four years.But wait \u2014 queers don\u2019t have a monopoly on crystals, tarot or astrology, you say. Of course we don\u2019t; pagan rituals and practices have been around for thousands of years.Yet show me a larger group of people who\u2019ve been more discarded by their childhood religions, or who\u2019ve turned their backs on cultures, traditions and gods that don\u2019t serve, love or want them as they are. Oh, look \u2014 it\u2019s the queers waving back at you, plumes of smoke from smudge sticks wafting behind us like spiritual chemtrails as we sage away those negative vibes.In short: Lots of us are really into this stuff, and always have been. And where queers go, Urban Outfitters follows, years behind but ready to sell cheap crystal-, \u201cwitchcraft\u201d- and astrology-themed jewelry to teenagers.Why is all of this so trendy now, though? Is astrology a religion for those of us with no religion? Are we, the hated millennials, obsessed with the idea of glimpsing our future because it feels terrifying and President Trump is going to get us all nuked anyway? Is it easier to just buy a heart-shaped rose quartz than deal with feelings or existential questions or to work on ourselves?Nah.The meteoric rise of New Age practices may be trendy, but it\u2019s one way millennials are acknowledging that the current system isn\u2019t working. We\u2019re trying out new things that are actually old things; we\u2019re seeing what else could make life a little more meaningful, a little more bearable.And if something helps you during a time of stress in your life, it\u2019s worth it \u2014 even if you suspect it might be turning you into a caricature of the kind of lesbian you swore you\u2019d never be.When my turn came at the register, I handed over my red carnelian and the clerk gently wrapped it in tissue. \u201cYou have a good day,\u201d he said, giving it back. I cradled it, trying to decide which windowsill I would put it in at my house. The one with the morning light, I thought. Right next to my mom\u2019s thin gold necklace, the one I always put in my mouth as I sat on her lap in church.Now, I\u2019m not stupid. I may be a woo-woo, crystal-worshiping homosexual, but I know that a polished red rock is not going to heal my tailbone. It\u2019s not going to bring my mom back either. It may not do a thing. But none of us know anything about anything, really. So why not be open to the possibility of hope?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Torn Apart by Zero Tolerance, Kept Apart by Red Tape", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMother and son last spoke on the child\u2019s ninth birthday, a week ago. This was no celebratory call.Lidia Karina Souza had been released from immigration detention nearly two weeks earlier. But she could not tell Diogo, who was separated from her shortly after they reached the United States, when they would see each other again.\u201cDon\u2019t cry. You are going to get a Nintendo, a birthday party. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d Ms. Souza, who is from Brazil, told her son. The telephone conversation was recorded and later provided to The New York Times.They had parted ways at the southwest border on May 30. Ms. Souza was locked up. Diogo was flown to Chicago, where he was placed in a shelter. Ms. Souza was released on June 9 and allowed to join relatives in Hyannis, Mass., but it is still not clear when her son will rejoin her.\u201cI am going to do everything to get you out of there,\u201d she told him on the call. \u201cIt\u2019s so many papers they need.\u201dPresident Trump has officially ended the policy of separating families when parents are being prosecuted under the \u201czero tolerance\u201d border enforcement program that took effect in May. But frustrating stories like that of the Souza family are playing out across the country, as parents of more than 2,300 children who were separated after their arrival in the United States now face lengthy bureaucratic delays in recovering them.\u201cThere was clearly no plan for reuniting the families,\u201d said Karen Hoffmann, an immigration attorney at Aldea-The People\u2019s Justice Center in Reading, Penn., who is suing the government to reunite three migrants with their children.Part of the problem is that in many cases, parents and children are being detained thousands of miles apart, and the parents do not know exactly where their children are. Though federal agencies have registered each child with an identification number and set up hotlines for parents, immigrant advocates say that many parents have trouble getting through or are not given answers when they call.Late Saturday, the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services announced that they had a \u201cwell-coordinated\u201d process for reuniting families. As of June 20, their statement said, there were 2,053 separated minors in government custody. It said that another 522 children who had not yet been sent by the Border Patrol to a shelter or a foster family were returned to their parents at the border.\u201cA parent who is ordered removed from the U.S. may request that his or her minor child accompany them,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt should be noted that in the past, many parents have elected to be removed without their children.\u201dIf a parent is released from detention, the authorities say, he or she will be reunited with a separated child once the parent fulfills requirements set by the government. But as Ms. Souza\u2019s case illustrates, the red tape can cause lengthy delays.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called on the Trump administration on Sunday to appoint a \u201cczar\u201d to be in charge of coordinating federal agencies to quickly reunite families.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a foreign relations expert to know that the situation created by zero tolerance has left many people with zero confidence that the administration will be able to quickly reunite the kids,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference.Noting that three different cabinet departments had a role in the situation, Mr. Schumer said, \u201cNo one is really in charge if there are three people in charge.\u201dShortly before the government officially announced the zero tolerance policy, it issued a memorandum setting stringent new rules for vetting parents, relatives and other potential sponsors who wish to get children from government custody.For one thing, the memo said that Health and Human Services must obtain the \u201ccitizenship, immigration status, criminal history and immigration history\u201d of the potential sponsor. It also said that the department must collect the names, dates of birth, addresses, fingerprints and identification documents of the potential sponsor and \u201call adult members in the potential sponsor\u2019s household,\u201d and provide that information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that oversees deportation.Previously, Health and Human Services did not share such information with ICE; other members of the household were not typically screened as part of the process; and parents did not have to be fingerprinted to get their children back.\u201cWe have cases of Brazilian minors who remain in a shelter because of the new demands, which ended up intimidating relatives who wanted to bring them home,\u201d said Luisa Lopes, the director of consular affairs for Brazilians abroad. Ms. Lopes said she is aware of 49 Brazilian children who were separated from their parents.Ms. Souza, 27, and her son turned themselves in to the Border Patrol on May 29, declaring that they had a fear of returning to their home country and wished to obtain asylum in the United States. The following day, an agent used Google Translate, she said, to explain to her \u2014 as Diogo erupted in tears \u2014 that because she had not presented herself at an official port of entry, she had entered the United States illegally; therefore she would go to jail, and he would go to a shelter. The son saw his mother being handcuffed.\u201cI told him, I\u2019m not going to jail,\u201d she recalled in an interview conducted in Portuguese. \u201cI am going to a place with other mothers. You are going to a place for children.\u201dMs. Souza appeared soon after in federal court in El Paso, where she pleaded guilty to illegal entry, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to time served. Three detention centers and 10 days later, she was allowed to join a relative in Massachusetts, having passed an interview meant to ascertain whether she had a credible reason to fear returning to Brazil.Before the authorities dropped her off in Dallas for her flight to Boston, they handed her a toll-free number she could call to locate Diogo.She tried the number when she reached Massachusetts, but she could not get through to anyone.\u201cI was devastated, desperate, crazed,\u201d she said.Ms. Souza, an evangelical Christian, said she sought strength in prayer.She also searched on Facebook for a Brazilian woman she had met in detention whose child had also been removed from her. The woman, who is now in Pennsylvania, told Ms. Souza that her daughter had been at a shelter in Chicago called Casa Guadalupe and had befriended a Brazilian boy there named Diogo. She gave Ms. Souza the number.Mother and son spoke for the first time in more than two weeks. She learned that Diogo had contracted chickenpox and, as a result, was isolated from other children. He sobbed, pleading for his mother to come get him.Since then, they have been allowed to speak to each other by phone twice a week, for 10 minutes at a time.\u201cIt has been 16 days, but don\u2019t worry,\u201d Ms. Souza told her son over one call that was recorded. \u201cIt\u2019s coming to an end. Be well. Stay with Jesus. With God on our side, it will all work out.\u201dTo get her son back, Ms. Souza learned, she would have to provide the shelter, which is run by Heartland Alliance, with a mountain of documents.Assisted by a lawyer, Ms. Souza filled out a 36-page packet and submitted documents attesting to her relationship to Diogo. But \u201cevery day, they wanted something else,\u201d Ms. Souza in an interview on Saturday.For example, the adults in the family with whom she lives in Hyannis also had to submit five pages of personal information for a background check.On another call, Diogo urged his mother to hurry his release. With his voice breaking, the boy begged, \u201cAi, Mom, get the papers done fast.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t up to me,\u201d she tried to explain. \u201cI am doing everything, but it\u2019s a lot of paperwork to handle.\u201dBut more days passed, and more requirements had to be met.The last straw, she said, was the fingerprint request last week. A case worker notified Ms. Souza that she and two other adults in the household would have to visit a designated location in their area to be fingerprinted \u2014 on July 6. Her request to get back her son would then take 22 days to be approved, she was told.\u201cThey said she can only get the child in August,\u201d said Jesse Bless, her lawyer. \u201cThat is completely unacceptable. What kind of process for reunification is this?\u201d\u201cIt was zero tolerance, zero planning, zero thought,\u201d said Mr. Bless, a senior counsel at Jeff Goldman Immigration, based in Boston, who has taken Ms. Souza\u2019s case pro bono.He expressed outrage to shelter managers, telling them that Ms. Souza had already been fingerprinted at the border. In response, a Health and Human Services official emailed Mr. Bless, saying: \u201cPolicy and Procedures recently changed and requires all household members and sponsor\u2019s to fingerprint. I can assure you that while at Heartland, Diogo is not isolated.\u201cCase Managers at Heartland truly care about our children and are working diligently to ensure all of our minors are safely released.\u201dMr. Bless said that after he threatened to sue the shelter, \u201cthey agreed to a more expedited, but undefined schedule.\u201d Unsatisfied, he said on Sunday that he intended to travel to Chicago to press the matter further.Meanwhile, Ms. Souza is next scheduled to speak with her son on Wednesday.Her last words to him on his tear-filled birthday were: \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I want you to be okay. Please be strong. O.K., son? Stay with Jesus, my son. Tchau. I love you.\u201d\u201cI love you too,\u201d the boy responded.Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an earlier version of this article misspelled Lidia Souza\u2019s middle name.

{"Headline": "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 I wanted to hate the scooters. I really did.Tech hubris on wheels \u2014 what\u2019s not to loathe?But I wanted to experience the scooter craze for myself. So for a week, I used shared e-scooters as my primary mode of transportation. I rode them to meetings, ran errands across town and went for long joy rides on the Venice Beach boardwalk. In all, I took more than a dozen scooter rides, from just a few blocks to several miles.My journey to e-scooter acceptance began when I saw an empty scooter outside my hotel. I downloaded the Bird app, entered my driver\u2019s license and credit card information, agreed to some basic terms (no riding on sidewalks, no riding two to a scooter, no speeding downhill) and scanned a code on the scooter\u2019s handlebar.The scooter beeped, telling me that it was unlocked, and I was off.Battery-powered scooters have been available for years, but only recently have they been outfitted with GPS trackers and wireless connectivity and arranged into on-demand fleets. These scooters are limited to 15 miles per hour, but that is still zippy enough to put a satisfying whoosh in your hair. And when you\u2019re done riding, just park it anywhere, choose \u201cend ride\u201d on your app, take a photo to help the next rider find it and walk away. Rides are cheap (Bird charges $1 plus 15 cents per minute), and an abundant supply of scooters in Santa Monica meant that I was never more than a block or two from one.The rise of shared e-scooters is just one of several recent tech-powered experiments in urban mobility. Dockless bike-sharing programs, which have been popular in China for years, are starting to take off in America. The programs added 44,000 bikes in the United States during the last half of 2017, according to a report by the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Other wheeled innovations \u2014 like electric unicycles and skateboards \u2014 are also making gains.But people should think twice before condemning e-scooters as an ill-conceived tech-world fantasy. Because if you can get over their dopey aesthetics and dubious corporate strategy, e-scooters actually solve some problems. They\u2019re lightweight and emission-free. They don\u2019t require bulky docks or parking lots, and they\u2019re perfect for trips that are too long to walk but too short to justify driving or hailing a car. If they take off, they could alleviate congestion and become a low-cost way of getting around cities without robust public transportation systems.Opponents of e-scooters typically make three major claims. But as I learned during my experiment in California, none of those arguments hold up particularly well under scrutiny.Anti-scooter activists tend to paint scooter riders as kamikaze daredevils, slaloming through cars and pedestrians. I did see a few instances of dangerous behavior \u2014 couples riding two to a scooter, people riding one-handed while taking selfies and some running red lights. There is also the issue of helmets, which many states require but which, as far as I can tell, no scooter riders are wearing.There have been five traffic incidents involving Bird scooters in Santa Monica since November, and 424 citations of motorized scooter riders, according to a Santa Monica Police Department spokesman. Bird, which declined to provide information about accidents, offers helmets to active riders for a $1.99 shipping fee, and about 30,000 people have taken it up on the deal. (The deal is available only to riders who live in a current Bird market, which excludes out-of-town visitors like me.)There is no doubt that scooters could be safer if helmet laws were better enforced and basic safety training was provided before riding. But it\u2019s probably not time to panic just yet. We don\u2019t have enough data to know if scooters are more dangerous than bikes, motorcycles or other types of two-wheeled transit, and scooter safety will most likely improve as riders get more experience and drivers learn to share the road.In fact, the only scary scooter rides I had were the times that cars veered a little too close to the bike lane I was riding in. If cities want to encourage safe scooter riding \u2014 and they should, given the benefits they have for congestion and environmental health \u2014 they should create protected scooter lanes and encourage drivers to give them more room.It\u2019s true that scooters have gone from nonexistent to ubiquitous in a matter of weeks \u2014 one morning, I counted more than 100 within a few blocks of my hotel. But their visibility is a function of their novelty. We don\u2019t view parked cars and bus stops as eyesores, even though they\u2019re everywhere.Some people object to e-scooters on political and symbolic grounds, claiming that they represent everything that is wrong with the tech industry. Critics have taken aim at their perceived elitism (you need a smartphone and a credit card to use scooter-sharing apps) and the sudden, permissionless way they were rolled out in cities, which fit a pattern of bad behavior set by tech companies like Uber and Airbnb.It\u2019s true that scooter companies have not exactly covered themselves in glory. They have invited a backlash by flooding the streets with scooters with no explanation and little or no contact with local officials. As these companies grow, they will need to prove that they can cooperate with regulators, rather than trying to circumvent them.David Estrada, Bird\u2019s chief legal officer, told me that the company had cooperated with officials in Miami and other cities to plan orderly rollouts. He said the company obeys local laws and doesn\u2019t introduce scooters in cities, such as New York, that expressly prohibit them. But he said that cities tended to drag their feet on new transportation policy, and that seeking pre-emptive approval for e-scooters could take years.\u201cWe\u2019d have happy cities, but we wouldn\u2019t have a business and we wouldn\u2019t be solving a problem,\u201d Mr. Estrada said.It\u2019s possible that the skeptics are right, and that electric scooters will end up like Segways \u2014 novelty gadgets for big-city tourists. It\u2019s also possible that they\u2019ll end up like Uber and Lyft \u2014 a multibillion-dollar industry that spends years battling local officials but ultimately changes urban transportation as we know it. The answer will most likely depend on the regulations that emerge, and whether scooter companies can operate profitably in cities that, unlike Santa Monica, don\u2019t have flat terrain and year-round sunshine.Whatever happens, you can count me as a slightly embarrassed member of Team Scooter. If liking fun, inexpensive, short-distance transportation is wrong, I don\u2019t want to be right.Advertisement"}

Woods stopped and wished McIlroy well. Then he extended his hand for McIlroy to shake, and mischievously pulled him into the bunker.When the Open\u2019s first round began on Thursday at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Woods had to grind to avoid being yanked into the same abyss that swallowed McIlroy, who posted a 10-over 80 in the morning.Teeing off several minutes after McIlroy signed his scorecard, Woods played the first nine in three over, no small feat given that he had tripled the opening hole after finding the fairway with his tee shot.Down the stretch, Woods\u2019s round frayed like a kite tail in Shinnecock\u2019s 20-mile-an-hour gusts. At the par-4 13th, he four-putted on his way to a 78.Woods has not won a tournament since 2013 or a major in 10 years. It is immaterial.

Tour, saw Woods\u2019s caddie, Joe LaCava, in the players\u2019 parking lot on Wednesday and approached him with the tip. LaCava promised to pass it on to Woods.But Thursday brought more of the same troubles. Woods took 30 strokes with his flat stick. \u201cI just didn\u2019t putt very well,\u201d he said after finishing nine strokes behind the four leaders, a group that included a player in his threesome, Dustin Johnson.Still, Woods can expect deep galleries again on Friday. No doubt, fans follow along to see if he can be a major contender again, after four back surgeries since 2014. But they come in appreciation, too, for the athlete who has won 79 PGA Tour events, including 14 majors, and who almost slipped away from the sport \u2014 missing the last two U.S. Opens because of his damaged spine.His competitors understand the sentiment. When Woods stepped on the practice range during a light rain Wednesday afternoon, he was stopped by two young players. One asked if he could have a photograph taken with Woods, and the other shook his hand vigorously as he introduced himself.The player who ended up with the photograph was Scott Gregory, 23, a second-year pro from England who opened on Thursday with a birdie-free 92, the highest score at a United States Open since 2002. After his round, Gregory spent several minutes amiably answering reporters\u2019 questions.Sure, the round was disappointing, he said, but he knows he is a better golfer than that. Otherwise, how would he have qualified for the tournament?Besides, he will always have his photograph with Woods. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for that picture for about 15 years, so that was a pretty big deal,\u201d Gregory said. He already had the photograph framed and displayed in his locker.\u201cIt\u2019s weird, you can feel when he is about,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the putting green and you haven\u2019t seen him, you can still hear that he\u2019s around.\u201dHere are a few obstacles that will test the nerves and skill of golfers at the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills on Long Island.Jason Day, a former world No. 1, referred to that phenomenon as \u201cthe Tiger effect.\u201d On Tuesday, Day said, he was practicing putting in near solitude when Woods showed up. Within seconds, Day said, the practice green filled with players.\u201cEveryone wants to see him,\u201d Day said. \u201cEveryone wants to see what he looks like and how big is he or just kind of see, I guess, the myth.\u201dWoods won the most recent of his three United States Open titles in 2008, while hobbled by a shredded left knee and a fractured left leg. His most formidable adversary that week was not Rocco Mediate, the runner-up who extended Woods to 19 extra holes (an 18-hole playoff and one in sudden death). It was the physical pain from his injuries, which Woods did not disclose until after his win.\u201cYou never want to let any of the guys know you\u2019re hurt in any sport, doesn\u2019t matter, ever,\u201d he said in 2013 on the five-year anniversary of the victory.Those were the days when Woods was an executioner in exercise clothing. He could shatter an opponent\u2019s confidence with his stare, and he gave away few strokes and fewer secrets. But then came the public revelations of marital infidelities in November 2009, leading to the dissolution of his marriage, and the back surgeries followed, leading to the disintegration of his game.Since rejoining the Tour in January, after his latest operation, Woods has shown flashes of his old game \u2014 and a new openness. The glares are gone, replaced by gratitude and a good-natured attitude that Day perhaps tested earlier this week.He said he teased Woods in a text about the \u201cM.C. Hammer\u201d parachute pants, as Day described them, that Woods wore the last time the national championship was held here, in 2004.\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t text me back,\u201d said Day, who can usually count on a reply from Woods. \u201cYou can see his killer instinct is kind of starting to go more toward what it used to be,\u201d Day added, \u201cbut he\u2019s not as aggressive with regards to that.\u201dWoods seems more willing to turn the dagger on himself. By the time he hit his opening shot Thursday, six players were under par (four players finished under 70) and several more had posted scores of over 79. As he watched the early action from his yacht, Privacy, Woods revised his game plan.Instead of focusing on the holes where he thought he could chase birdies \u2014 because the wind swept away those prospects \u2014 Woods said his aim was to avoid any scores over bogey.\u201cAnd then I made three of them,\u201d he said, alluding to consecutive doubles on the back nine and an opening triple.And then he laughed.Woods used to be the game\u2019s best front-runner, but this year he has struggled in his first rounds even in favorable conditions, averaging 71.11 strokes in the first round and 70.63 in the fourth.On a day when Shinnecock Hills turned into a grinder\u2019s paradise, Woods, the prince of perseverance, faltered. And lived to laugh about it.\u201cHe seems on a mission to repair his body, his game and his image,\u201d the Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee said. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because his kids are old enough to Google their father or perhaps when he was at his lowest point he found the value in friends and they got through to him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The world would be a very different place if we had restricted people from buying computers because it was possible to use that computer to do harm. The same can be said of thousands of technologies upon which we all rely each day. Through responsible use, the benefits have far outweighed the risks.Tech companies recently have come under scrutiny for their work with the government.To be clear: Microsoft is not working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border, and contrary to some speculation, we are not aware of Azure or Azure services being used for this purpose. As a company, Microsoft is dismayed by the forcible separation of children from their families at the border.It remains to be seen if Amazon might bow to investor pressure and stop selling its software, or whether Microsoft might cease working with ICE But the news certainly illustrates that relationships between technology companies and government entities have become a serious cause for concern among many critics.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Move Over, China: U.S. Is Again Home to World\u2019s Speediest Supercomputer", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States just won bragging rights in the race to build the world\u2019s speediest supercomputer.For five years, China had the world\u2019s fastest computer, a symbolic achievement for a country trying to show that it is a tech powerhouse. But the United States retook the lead thanks to a machine, called Summit, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.Summit\u2019s speeds, announced on Friday, boggle the mind. It can do mathematical calculations at the rate of 200 quadrillion per second, or 200 petaflops. To put in human terms: A person doing one calculation a second would have to live for more than 6.3 billion years to match what the machine can do in a second.Still stupefying? Here is another analogy. If a stadium built for 100,000 people was full, and everyone in it had a modern laptop, it would take 20 stadiums to match the computing firepower of Summit.China still has the world\u2019s most supercomputers over all. And China, Japan and Europe are developing machines that are even faster, which could mean the American lead is short-lived.Supercomputers like Summit, which cost $200 million in government money to build, can accelerate the development of technologies at the frontier of computing, like artificial intelligence and the ability to handle vast amounts of data.Those skills can be used to help tackle daunting challenges in science, industry and national security \u2014 and are at the heart of an escalating rivalry between the United States and China over technology.Supercomputers now perform tasks that include simulating nuclear tests, predicting climate trends, finding oil deposits and cracking encryption codes. Scientists say that further gains and fresh discoveries in fields like medicine, new materials and energy technology will rely on the approach that Summit embodies.\u201cThese are big data and artificial intelligence machines,\u201d said John E. Kelly, who oversees IBM Research, which helped build Summit. \u201cThat\u2019s where the future lies.\u201dAt 200 petaflops, the new machine achieves more than twice the speed of the leading supercomputer in November, when the last Top 500 list was published. That machine is at China\u2019s National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi.Summit is made up of rows of black, refrigerator-size units that weigh a total of 340 tons and are housed in a 9,250 square-foot room. It is powered by 9,216 central processing chips from IBM and 27,648 graphics processors from Nvidia, another American tech company, that are lashed together with 185 miles of fiber-optic cable.Cooling Summit requires 4,000 gallons of water a minute, and the supercomputer consumes enough electricity to light up 8,100 American homes.The global supercomputer sprint comes as internet giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google in the United States and Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in China take the lead in developing technologies like cloud computing and facial recognition.Supercomputers are a measure of a nation\u2019s technological prowess. It is a narrow measure, of course, because raw speed is only one ingredient in computing performance. Software, which bring the machines to life, is another.Scientists at the government labs like Oak Ridge are doing exploratory research in areas like new materials to make roads more robust, designs for energy storage that might apply to electric cars or energy grids, and potential power sources like harnessing fusion. All of those areas can benefit from supercomputing.Modeling the climate, for example, can require running code on a supercomputer for days, processing huge amounts of scientific data like moisture and wind patterns, and modeling all the real-world physics of the environment. It is not the sort of task that can run efficiently on the cloud computing services supplied by internet companies, said Ian Buck, a computer scientist and general manager of Nvidia\u2019s data center business.\u201cIndustry is great, and we work with them all the time,\u201d said Rick Stevens, an associate director of the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. \u201cBut Google is never going to design new materials or design a safe nuclear reactor.\u201dAt Oak Ridge, Thomas Zacharia, the lab director, cites a large health research project as an example of the future of supercomputing. Summit has begun ingesting and processing data generated by the Million Veteran Program, which enlists volunteers to give researchers access to all of their health records, contribute blood tests for genetic analysis, and answer survey questions about their lifestyles and habits. To date, 675,000 veterans have joined; the goal is to reach one million by 2021.The eventual insights, Mr. Zacharia said, could \u201chelp us find new ways to treat our veterans and contribute to the whole area of precision medicine.\u201dDr. J. Michael Gaziano, a principal investigator on the Million Veteran Program and a professor at the Harvard Medical School, said that the potential benefit might well be a modern, supercharged version of the Framingham Heart Study. That project, begun in 1948, tracked about 5,000 people in a Massachusetts town.Over a couple of decades, the Framingham study found that heart disease \u2014 far from previous single-cause explanations of disease \u2014 had multiple, contributing causes including blood cholesterol, diet, exercise and smoking.Today, given the flood of digital health data and supercomputers, Dr. Gaziano said that population science might be entering a new golden age.\u201cWe have all this big, messy data to create a new field \u2014 rethinking how we think about diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time.\u201dAlthough impressive, Summit can be seen as a placeholder. Supercomputers that are five times faster \u2014 1,000 petaflops, or an exaflop \u2014 are in the works, both abroad and in the United States. The Energy Department\u2019s budget for its advanced computing program is being increased by 39 percent in the two fiscal years ending September 2019, said Paul M. Dabbar, the Energy Department\u2019s under secretary for science.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this to help drive innovation in supercomputing and beyond,\u201d Mr. Dabbar said.An earlier version of this article, using calculations by Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who tracks supercomputer speeds, misstated how long it would take a person to do the calculations that the Summit supercomputer could do in one second. It would take 6.3 billion years, not 63 billion years. The error was repeated in the headline and in a mobile news alert. The article also misspelled the surname of the Energy Department\u2019s under secretary for science. He is Paul Dabbar, not Dabarr.Advertisement"}
