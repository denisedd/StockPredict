{"Headline": "A Reborn Uber Faces Its First Big Reckoning: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ride-hailing company is heading to court today, and the stakes are huge: It\u2019s trying to reverse a decision by London\u2019s transport regulator to suspend its operating license. If Uber loses, its 45,000 drivers in the British capital \u2014 its largest European market \u2014 could ultimately be banned from the roads.The case before Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court has ramifications far beyond London, and, given changes the city has already wrung from Uber, it could embolden others grappling with how to regulate ride-sharing services. The ruling will offer a hint as to whether governments and regulators are becoming more receptive to Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s conciliatory efforts as he seeks to move past the brusque manner associated with his predecessor, Travis Kalanick.\u2022 The Treasury Department is said to be drafting regulations in which companies where Chinese investors own at least 25 percent could not acquire other firms that work on \u201cindustrially significant technology.\u201d (That probably means anything related to China\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan, like computer chips, A.I. and robotics.)\u2022 The National Security Council and the Commerce Department are also reportedly planning controls that would limit the export of those technologies to China.The policies would be the latest move by the Trump administration to punish China over fears that national security is compromised by the theft of American intellectual property.Between slurps of ros\u00e9 and shows by Jon Bon Jovi, bigwigs of the marketing and media worlds last week considered something more serious at their annual meet-up in the South of France: ethics.Paired with the heady exuberance this year was a growing sense of unease among some marketers about what kind of return they are actually getting once they pour money into big technology platforms \u2014 and also what sort of societal problems they may be unwittingly financing in the process.As the C.E.O. of the $6.3 trillion investment giant BlackRock, Mr. Fink has long pressed companies to change their behavior. But a letter he wrote to his firm\u2019s portfolio companies in January \u2014 in which he urged corporate America to contribute positively to society, or else \u2014 hit boardrooms like a bombshell.Deese says he pushed to sharpen the concept, introduced in The Letter, about the public\u2019s loss of faith \u201cin government\u2019s ability to solve big problems and challenges that they see in front of them.\u201d Then he advocated for a \u201cvery clear and crisp articulation, from an investment perspective, of how we see sustainability- and ESG-related issues, and why they\u2019re actually integral to our fiduciary obligation.\u201dDealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Year After Trump\u2019s Paris Pullout, U.S. Companies Are Driving a Renewables Boom", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne big question, however, is whether these corporate renewable deals will remain a relatively niche market, adding some wind and solar at the margins but not really making a sizable dent in overall emissions, or whether these companies can use their clout to transform America\u2019s grid and help usher in a new era of low-carbon power.That trend appears to be accelerating. Corporations have already announced deals for another 2.48 gigawatts of wind and solar in the first half of 2018, as companies like AT&T and Nestl\u00e9 join the search for cleaner power to fulfill their sustainability goals and take advantage of the rapidly declining cost of renewables.\u201cBut with how fast wind and solar prices have fallen, we see this as something that makes financial sense,\u201d he said.\u201cWe think this is a major trend,\u201d said Lisa Wood, vice president of customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute, a major utility trade group. \u201cCustomers are becoming the driver.\u201dThese agreements have gotten increasingly sophisticated: Companies can even arrange to pay for a new wind farm in a different state, such as Oklahoma, and obtain credits from the project even if the electricity is going to someone else. (Basically, the buyer is creating new wind power without using it directly.)\u201cIf we can show utilities that the demand is there, that could convince regulators to expand these programs and allow access for smaller companies,\u201d said Rob Threlkeld, global manager for renewable energy at G.M., which has set the goal to buy 100 percent renewable power by 2050.Mr. Janous of Microsoft, who is engaged in these discussions, says that this aggregation has so far proven to be incredibly challenging. \u201cBut if it\u2019s just Microsoft or just the Fortune 500 companies buying renewable power, that\u2019s not going to be transformative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go beyond that.\u201dA few companies, most notably Google, are now wrestling with an even harder question: What if simply buying up large quantities of wind and solar power isn\u2019t enough?But, as Google itself readily acknowledges, this doesn\u2019t mean that the company is truly powered by 100 percent renewable energy. In many cases, its wind and solar farms operate in different regions (or different countries) than the company\u2019s data centers do. What\u2019s more, the wind and solar farms it has procured don\u2019t provide steady power 24 hours a day, whereas Google\u2019s data centers run around the clock. That means the company is essentially still reliant on fossil fuels to keep the broader grid running.For its next phase, Google wants to locate all of its clean-energy projects in the same grid regions as its data centers, even though that will mean prodding policymakers in places like Taiwan to overhaul electricity markets and allow companies to make direct purchases. Google is also trying to figure out how to assemble a suite of zero-carbon energy sources that can run 24 hours a day, which may require additional technologies like battery storage, demand response programs or even nuclear power.But achieving that goal will take years, and is likely to be far more complicated than simply signing renewable energy contracts.\u201cReaching 100 percent renewable energy is an important milestone, but it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d said Michael Terrell, head of energy market strategy at Google. \u201cWe have to keep our eyes on the ultimate prize, which is to enable carbon free power in every hour of every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After #MeToo, the Ripple Effect", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey call themselves \u201cthe nine.\u201d They are nine women, eight scattered around the United States and one in France, each with accusations of having been sexually harassed or assaulted by a former mentor, the playwright Israel Horovitz. Last fall, they chose to speak out publicly against him, adding their voices to the chorus of women proclaiming #MeToo.\u201cThis group of nine women ground me,\u201d said Laura Crook, an actor who lives outside of Boston. She created small pendants \u2014 nine delicate stones and a pearl with \u201cx9\u201d engraved on a silver bead \u2014 for each of the women. \u201cIt\u2019s like we have spun our individual pain into solidarity.\u201dIt\u2019s a strange sisterhood that perhaps could exist only in this particular moment. But these small networks are one of a number of ways that the conversation around #MeToo has shifted to: What\u2019s next?In the 1960s and \u201970s, feminists had a saying: The personal is political. The idea was that when women shared their individual experiences, their struggles \u2014 the ones many believed they were alone in facing \u2014 suddenly became collective. A slight by a boss became about a system of slights; a problem that seemed insurmountable was less so with the power of the group behind it.It\u2019s difficult to assess a movement while it\u2019s still happening. Yet nine months after the allegations against Harvey Weinstein were first published and \u201c#MeToo\u201d became a rallying cry, one of the most sobering revelations \u2014 and one of the most powerful \u2014 has been the sheer universality of it.And it is not just about an array of abusive men. There is a system that perpetuates it: an elaborate \u201cmachinery,\u201d as Jodi Kantor, among The Times reporters honored with a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on the subject, has put it.It is a machinery that has long protected powerful men and prevented women from coming forward. It includes hefty payoffs and inept human-resources departments; complicit bystanders who include women and men; as well as a culture that, for a long time, simply did not accept that a woman coming forward to accuse a man could be telling the truth.\u201cIf survivors of sexual violation were believed and valued, across culture, society, and law, that in itself would be a major transformation,\u201d said Catharine A. MacKinnon, the legal scholar who, in 1979, first laid the groundwork for sexual harassment law and went on to argue it before the Supreme Court.\u201cWomen have been saying these things forever,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is the response to them that has changed.\u201dIf there are phases to this movement, it feels like we\u2019ve cycled through a number of them: First it was just a few women, then it was an army of them, followed by the collective recognition that perhaps those women should be believed. That was accompanied by \u2014 and still is \u2014 the staccato of men toppling, one after the next, and of proclamations of #MeToo around the world: #YoTambien in Spanish, #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cexpose your pig\u201d) in French and #quellavoltache (\u201cthat time when\u201d) in Italian. It was peppered by worries of a backlash.Then, seven months in, the image of Harvey Weinstein in handcuffs \u2014 led, restrained, into his arraignment by a female detective \u2014 symbolized a new stage: the possibility of real, criminal consequences for alleged perpetrators, even the most powerful among them.\u201cI have to admit I didn\u2019t think I would see the day that he would have handcuffs on him,\u201d the actress Rose McGowan, one of the first women to speak out against Mr. Weinstein, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on the day of his arrest.\u201cThis is a long-term project,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic one thing that\u2019s going to change an entire industry, whether it\u2019s Hollywood or Silicon Valley or the Ford Motor Company.\u201dThe European Parliament recently convened a special session on sexual violence, while France has made catcalling and other forms of public harassment a punishable offense. In May, Sweden became the 10th country in Western Europe to acknowledge, in the eyes of the law, that sex without explicit consent can be rape.\u201cThese first nine months have allowed us to start seeing the magnitude of the issue,\u201d said Tarana Burke, the activist who first coined the phrase \u201cMeToo.\u201d \u201cNow, the months and years ahead have to be focused on solutions.\u201dAnd members of Time\u2019s Up, the organization formed by Hollywood creatives and executives to combat harassment, which includes a multimillion dollar legal defense fund, recently wrote an open letter condemning years-old accusations of abuse against the pop star R. Kelly, prompting Spotify, the streaming behemoth, to stop promoting his music.\u201cThis movement has galvanized people into a community,\u201d said Ms. Hill, who now heads the entertainment industry\u2019s Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace.\u201cI had the letters people wrote me, but there was no organizing around the letters. I think this is how social change occurs.\u201dThe ripple effects have extended beyond sexual harassment.In every walk of culture, it seems, #MeToo has made us question: How did we ever think this was O.K.?\u201cCultural revolutions don\u2019t happen quickly,\u201d Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who is now board chairwoman at Miss America, told me a few weeks ago. (She took over after the chief executive was forced to resign over lewd comments.) \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re seeing so much happen in real time so quickly is really amazing. It\u2019s my greatest hope that there\u2019s no turning back.\u201dIn her 2017 book, \u201cButterfly Politics,\u201d Ms. MacKinnon, the legal scholar, delved into a concept from chaos theory in which a tiny motion of a butterfly\u2019s wings can trigger a tornado half a world away. Under the right conditions, she argued, small actions can produce major social transformations.So too, it seems, with the women who first spoke out against Mr. Weinstein \u2014 and a world that may be profoundly changed.\u201cWhen I embarked on this thing, when I decided to speak out, I was worried I was going to feel more alone than when I started,\u201d said Ms. Crook, one of the Horovitz nine. \u201cAnd to feel the opposite of that is pretty remarkable. We\u2019re one cell of this new organism.\u201dJESSICA BENNETT, the first gender editor of The New York Times, investigated allegations of rape and misconduct by nine women against the playwright and director Israel Horovitz.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Will Not Renew Pentagon Contract That Upset Employees", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google, hoping to head off a rebellion by employees upset that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes, will not renew a contract with the Pentagon for artificial intelligence work when a current deal expires next year.Diane Greene, who is the head of the Google Cloud business that won a contract with the Pentagon\u2019s Project Maven, said during a weekly meeting with employees on Friday that the company was backing away from its A.I. work with the military, according to a person familiar with the discussion but not permitted to speak publicly about it.But it is not unusual for Silicon Valley\u2019s big companies to have deep military ties. And the internal dissent over Maven stands in contrast to Google\u2019s biggest competitors for selling cloud-computing services \u2014 Amazon.com and Microsoft \u2014 which have aggressively pursued Pentagon contracts without pushback from their employees.Google\u2019s self-image is different \u2014 it once had a motto of \u201cdon\u2019t be evil.\u201d A number of its top technical talent said the internet company was betraying its idealistic principles, even as its business-minded officials worried that the protests would damage its chances to secure more business from the Defense Department.About 4,000 Google employees signed a petition demanding \u201ca clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.\u201d A handful of employees also resigned in protest, while some were openly advocating the company to cancel the Maven contract.Months before it became public, senior Google officials were worried about how the Maven contract would be perceived inside and outside the company, The New York Times reported this week. By courting business with the Pentagon, they risked angering a number of the company\u2019s highly regarded A.I. researchers, who had vowed that their work would not become militarized.But if Google drops out of some or all of the competition to sell the software that will guide future weaponry, the Pentagon is likely to find plenty of other companies happy to take the lucrative business. A Defense Department spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Friday.The money for Google in the Project Maven contract was never large by the standards of a company with revenue of $110 billion last year \u2014 $9 million, one official told employees, or a possible $15 million over 18 months, according to an internal email.But some company officials saw it as an opening to much greater revenue down the road. In an email last September, a Google official in Washington told colleagues she expected Maven to grow into a $250 million-a-year project, and eventually it could have helped open the door to contracts worth far more; notably a multiyear, multibillion-dollar cloud computing project called JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure.Whether Google\u2019s Maven decision is a short-term reaction to employee protests and adverse news coverage or reflects a more sweeping strategy not to pursue military work is unclear. The question of whether a particular contract contributes to warfare does not always have a simple answer.When the Maven work came under fire inside Google, company officials asserted that it was not \u201coffensive\u201d in nature. But Maven is using the company\u2019s artificial intelligence software to improve the sorting and analysis of imagery from drones, and some drones rely on such analysis to identify human targets for lethal missile shots.Google management had told employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the use of artificial intelligence for defense and intelligence contracting. At Friday\u2019s meeting, Ms. Greene said the company was expected to announce those guidelines next week.Google has already said that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice and whether it would affect Google\u2019s pursuit of the JEDI contract.Defense Department officials are themselves wrestling with the complexity of their move into cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Critics have questioned the proposal to give the entire JEDI contract, which could extend for 10 years, to a single vendor. This week, officials announced they were slowing the contracting process down.Dana White, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said this week that the JEDI contract had drawn \u201cincredible interest\u201d and more than 1,000 responses to a draft request for proposals. But she said officials wanted to take their time.\u201dSo, we are working on it, but it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t rush toward failure,\u201d Ms. White said. \u201cThis is different for us. We have a lot more players in it. This is something different from some of our other acquisition programs because we do have a great deal of commercial interest.\u201dMs. Greene said the company probably would not have sought the Maven work if company officials had anticipated the criticism, according to notes on Ms. Greene\u2019s remarks taken by a Google employee and shared with The Times.Another person who watched the meeting added that Ms. Greene said Maven had been \u201cterrible for Google\u201d and that the decision to pursue the contract was done when Google was more aggressively going after military work.Google does other, more innocuous business with the Pentagon, including military advertising on Google properties and Google\u2019s ad platform, as well as providing web apps like email.Even though the internal protest has carried on for months, there was no indication that employee criticism of the deal was dying down.Earlier this week, one Google engineer \u2014 on the company\u2019s internal message boards \u2014 proposed the idea of employees protesting Google Cloud\u2019s conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco in July with a campaign called \u201cOccupy Moscone Center,\u201d fashioned after the Occupy Wall Street protests.That engineer resigned from the company this week in protest of Maven and planned for Friday to be his last day. But he said he was told on Friday morning to leave immediately, according to an email viewed by The Times.Peter W. Singer, who studies war and technology at New America, a Washington research group, said many of the tools the Pentagon was seeking were \u201cneither inherently military nor inherently civilian.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is not cannons and ballistic missiles.\u201d The same software that speeds through video shot with armed drones can be used to study customers in fast-food restaurants or movements on a factory floor.Mr. Singer also said he thought Google employees who denounced Maven were somewhat na\u00efve, because Google\u2019s search engine and the video platform of its YouTube division have been used for years by warriors of many countries, as well as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.\u201cThey may want to act like they\u2019re not in the business of war, but the business of war long ago came to them,\u201d said Mr. Singer, author of a book examining such issues called \u201cLikeWar,\u201d scheduled for publication in the fall.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco and Scott Shane reported from Baltimore.

{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Is a Win for Consumers", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moore is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation.The Justice Department must now decide whether to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling, a move that would be sheer folly and a waste of taxpayer money, given the firm rejection of every argument the government\u2019s lawyers made. Hopefully, this decision will also clear the path for other planned cost-cutting mergers in the media and telecommunications industries.The government\u2019s antitrust challenge to this $85 billion deal was one of the flimsiest assaults against a corporate merger in recent memory. These two companies don\u2019t even directly compete with each other. Normally, antitrust cases are brought to block so-called \u201chorizontal\u201d mergers, in which companies in the same line of business \u2014 two airlines, for example \u2014 want to combine forces. Even in such instances, the antitrust laws are antiquated, given that globalized competition and the speed of technological change continually knock down industry leaders.The core argument brought by the Justice Department, in an antitrust action championed by President Trump, was that AT&T could use its new market power to raise prices exorbitantly on cable and satellite operators that want to run Time Warner TV programs \u2014 such as CNN broadcasts or HBO shows. The government\u2019s lawyers argued that consumers\u2019 cable bills would go up if the merger went through.The absurdity of this argument is that the Justice lawyers seemed to be stuck in the 1980s. In 2018, the number of American households getting their television or video entertainment from traditional cable providers is declining. The very notion of \u201cwatching TV\u201d is becoming as obsolete as listening to music on a turntable. My teenage kids and their friends don\u2019t even own TVs. They watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on their computers or smartphones, and one of their favorite \u201cchannels\u201d is YouTube. They can choose from thousands of programs at a very low cost. Today, any hotshot with a camera and a Facebook page can be a media company. Is that enough competition for the Justice Department?In short, there is probably no area in today\u2019s economy where there is less threat of monopolistic power than in media and entertainment. The proliferation of video content and ways to get it means that these companies must stay innovative and affordable, or they are gone as fast as you can say Blockbuster Video.In this cutthroat environment, the AT&T and Time Warner merger is better described as a survival strategy, not a market domination plot. The companies hope to lower costs by merging AT&T\u2019s transmission of video content with the entertainment products that Time Warner offers.This merger could bring welcome competition to Google and Facebook, which have captured about two-thirds of the online advertising market, a point that the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers ignored. Combining AT&T\u2019s mobile, broadband, and DirecTV platforms with Time Warner\u2019s movies, TV shows, music and sporting events could turn them into a serious rival to the tech behemoths.Businesses and families may also benefit from the merger if it accelerates the development of 5G wireless networks. The merged company could use its vast spectrum of resources to jump-start the delivery of Time Warner content through AT&T\u2019s wireless network. This will mean new competition for residential broadband from cable companies such as Comcast.The days when companies like U.S. Steel or General Motors or Microsoft could accumulate the market power to dominate an industry and gouge consumers with higher prices are long gone. Some of the most powerful companies in the world \u2014 Amazon and Walmart, for example \u2014 do just the opposite: they are constantly lowering, not raising their prices.It is too early to know whether this mega-deal will turn out well for shareholders and consumers. But the Justice Department should not be standing in the way. Its goal, instead, should be to allow made-in-America companies like AT&T and Time Warner to do what it takes to become global competitors, not global dinosaurs.The Trump administration should be thankful that, in this merger, it isn\u2019t China buying up America\u2019s strategic companies or assets.

{"Headline": "How Amazon Steers Shoppers to Its Own Products", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt started with a simple battery.Around 2009, Amazon quietly entered the private label business by offering a handful of items under a new brand called AmazonBasics. Early offerings were the kinds of unglamorous products that consumers typically bought at their local hardware store: power cords and cables for electronics and, in particular, batteries \u2014 with prices roughly 30 percent lower than that of national brands like Energizer and Duracell.The results were stunning. In just a few years, AmazonBasics had grabbed nearly a third of the online market for batteries, outselling both Energizer and Duracell on its site.Inside Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters, that success raised a tantalizing possibility. If, with very little effort, Amazon could become a huge player in the battery market, what else might be possible for the company?Anyone who spends much time on the Amazon site can see the answer to that question. The company now has roughly 100 private label brands for sale on its huge online marketplace, of which more than five dozen have been introduced in the past year alone. But few of those are sold under the Amazon brand. Instead, they have been given a variety of anodyne, disposable names like Spotted Zebra (kids clothes), Good Brief (men\u2019s underwear), Wag (dog food) and Rivet (home furnishings). Want to buy a stylish but affordable cap-sleeve dress? A flared version from Lark & Ro ($39), maybe in millennial pink, might be just what you\u2019re looking for.On the surface, the move into the private label business (in which goods are sold under the retailer\u2019s name rather than that of an outside vendor) appears to be a deft move by Amazon. Analysts predict that nearly half of all online shopping in the United States will be conducted on Amazon\u2019s platform in the next couple of years. That creates a massive opportunity for Amazon to more than double revenue from its in-house brands to $25 billion in the next four years, according to analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. That\u2019s the equivalent of all of Macy\u2019s revenue last year.Furthermore, in an effort to incentivize shoppers to sign up for the Amazon Prime program (which now costs $119 a year, up from $99 a year ago), certain of Amazon\u2019s private-label products, such as its Goodthreads men\u2019s khakis or Wag\u2019s salmon-and-lentil dog food, can be purchased only by Prime customers.\u201cAmazon started very slowly in private label,\u201d said Youssef Squali, a managing director of internet and digital media research at SunTrust. \u201cQuite frankly, we think our estimate for the size of the private-label business is conservative,\u201d he added.Amazon declined to make any of its executives available for this article, but in a response to a list of questions, the company said its overarching goal is to provide customers a wide range of products and brands.\u201cWe take the same approach to private label as we do with anything here at Amazon: We start with the customer and work backwards,\u201d the company said in its statement.Amazon is hardly alone in its charge into private label. Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target have been offering store brands for years and are also racing to start more private labels, particularly in apparel.But Amazon holds a unique position in the global marketplace. From its beginnings in 1994, Amazon\u2019s platform was designed to democratize retail. Small vendors or manufacturers could sell outdoor grills, computer bags, and children\u2019s toys alongside established brands. Now, with its expansion into private label, Amazon has shifted away from being an impartial, may-the-best-product-win distribution partner to being a direct competitor to those other vendors.It\u2019s not just lower prices that are driving Amazon\u2019s customers to its private-label goods.Amazon is utilizing its knowledge of its powerful marketplace machine \u2014 from optimizing word-search algorithms to analyzing competitors\u2019 sales data to using its customer-review networks \u2014 to steer shoppers toward its in-house brands and away from its competitors, say analysts.And as consumers increasingly shop using voice technology, the playing field becomes even more tilted. For instance, consumers asking Amazon\u2019s Alexa to \u201cbuy batteries\u201d get only one option: AmazonBasics.The emerging private label threat from Amazon presents a quandary for small vendors and big, national brands alike. Even as Amazon takes away market share and eats into their profit margins, they have little choice but to continue to sell on Amazon\u2019s platform in order to get themselves in front of millions of potential customers.\u201cI think, effectively, you have a company that has conspired with about a billion consumers and technology to destroy brands,\u201d argued Scott Galloway, a founder of business research firm now called Gartner L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business, in a presentation last year. \u201cTheir attitude is that brands have, for a long time, earned an unearned price premium that screws consumers.\u201d\u201cI think there is a potential monopolization case against Amazon,\u201d said Chris Sagers, an antitrust professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in Ohio. \u201cThe Amazon marketing people are geniuses. They\u2019re brilliant,\u201d Mr. Sagers said. \u201cBut if they are getting massive penetration in the market and preventing customers from buying products from their competitors? Well, it\u2019s like they\u2019re writing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for them.\u201dIn an emailed response, a spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is \u201ca small fraction of a very large and vibrant global retail industry, and the competition and invention happening across retail is great for customers.\u201dType the word \u201cbatteries\u201d into Amazon\u2019s search bar and the first thing that will catch your eye is a large sponsor ad running across the top of the screen for Energizer, featuring its ubiquitous drum-playing pink bunny.But after that, the screen is filled with offerings for AmazonBasics batteries, many flagged with badges that denote them as a \u201cbest seller\u201d or \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice,\u201d a designation for items that are highly rated and have low customer returns.Energizer would not say how much it pays Amazon for the banner advertising, but several people with knowledge of Amazon\u2019s pricing say some large brands are spending six figures each month advertising their products on Amazon\u2019s platform even as Amazon\u2019s private-label products are crowding them out.Are the big brands fighting a battle that may be impossible for them to win?For more than two decades, shoppers perusing the aisles of Walmart have run into cans of Sam\u2019s cola or coffee alongside national brands on the shelves. In Costco, shoppers can pickup store-brand Kirkland paper towels and bacon. (Store brands are typically priced well below their big-brand peers because they do not spend money on expensive national marketing campaigns like Procter & Gamble or Kimberly-Clark.)But now, Amazon and many of these big-box retailers are increasing their private-label efforts. In the past year, sales of in-house labels of food and nonfood goods at brick-and-mortar stores grew more than 4 percent, while sales of name brands were flat, according to data from Nielsen\u2019s Total Food View research.For Amazon, the starting line for deciding what goods or products to replicate for an in-house brand is not that different than what happens at retailers like Target or Walmart. They look at what is selling online and figure out if they can manufacture it cheaper.Commodity goods like paper towels, exercise mats, and power strips can be easily cloned at a fraction of the cost. In other cases, particularly apparel, Amazon may use private-label goods to fill a gap if clothing manufacturers or high-end designers are unwilling to sell on their platform.Shoppers looking for Ralph Lauren polos or button-down oxford shirts won\u2019t find them sold directly on Amazon, for example. But they will find Amazon Essentials polos in a rainbow of 16 shades, priced at $12, or oxfords by its Goodthreads label for $25.Amazon\u2019s advantage over traditional retailers is its knowledge and access to data from its platform.Take word searches. About 70 percent of the word searches done on Amazon\u2019s search browser are for generic goods. That means consumers are typing in \u201cmen\u2019s underwear\u201d or \u201crunning shoes\u201d rather than asking, specifically, for Hanes or Nike.For Amazon, those word searches by consumers allow it to put its private-label products in front of the consumer and make sure they appear quickly. In addition, Amazon has the emails of the consumers who performed searches on its site and can email them directly or use pop-up ads on other websites to direct those consumers back to Amazon\u2019s marketplace.Some of this data is also available to big brands or vendors selling on Amazon\u2019s platform through a program called Amazon Retail Analytics Premium. But it is expensive, with vendors paying 1 percent of their wholesale cost of goods sold to Amazon or a minimum of $100,000 to get access to a database that lets them see some, but not all, of the data Amazon has compiled.\u201cAmazon has access to data that nobody else has,\u201d said James Thomson, a former Amazon executive who now works at Buy Box Experts, a consulting firm that advises companies on how to build their brands and sell products on Amazon. \u201cI can\u2019t just walk into a store and say, \u2018Excuse me, did you look at this brand of cereal this morning and decide not to buy it?\u2019 Amazon has that data. They know you looked at a brand and didn\u2019t buy it and they\u2019re not going to share that data with any other brands.\u201dWith that data, Amazon is able to conduct regional or one-day price tests, dropping the cost of its goods in certain markets to discover at what price more customers purchase the item.And while traditional retailers can readily scan their sales data and understand what size shirts and colors sell and which ones don\u2019t, Amazon has hundreds of reviews of competitors\u2019 products on its website, providing customer feedback on how the shirt looked after five washes or how it fit different body types.\u201cAmazon can analyze those reviews and figure out why customers were dissatisfied with a certain product,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner L2. \u201cAmazon can then turn around and create a private label for a similar product but improve upon it based on what customers say.\u201dWhen Amazon introduces a new private-label product, it doesn\u2019t go all in. It often uses a technique analysts call \u201ctest-and-repeat,\u201d ordering a small batch of product from its manufacturers, testing demand and then, if the product is successful, reordering a bigger batch of product as well as expanding its assortment.Again, here, Amazon has a big leg up on traditional retailers. Most retailers appeal to one segment of consumer \u2014 the budget, midmarket, or higher-end shopper. Amazon can offer a variety of private-label goods, positioned toward shoppers in different categories, says Deborah Weinswig, the founder and chief executive of Coresight Research.For instance, through Amazon\u2019s Pinzon brand, it offers a queen-size hypoallergenic mattress topper for $40.37. But it also sells a mattress topper through its AmazonBasics private label for $22.99.Similarly, Amazon sells men\u2019s button-down shirts under both the Amazon Essentials and Goodthreads labels. Analysts at research firm Gartner L2 found, on best-selling products, the Goodthreads apparel cost 60 percent more.But, perhaps more important, Amazon has utilized a reviewing program called Amazon Vine for many of its private-label goods.Amazon Vine, or Vine Voices, are very active reviewers on the Amazon marketplace who are then invited by the company to participate in its Vine program, which identifies them as influential reviewers. In exchange for free products, which they disclose receiving, the reviewers agree to write evaluations on Amazon\u2019s site.Amazon has actively used Vine Voices to help introduce its private label brands. An analysis of more than 1,600 products across ten of Amazon\u2019s private-label brands, including AmazonBasics, Amazon Essentials, Mama Bear, Pinzon, Goodthreads, and others, showed that about half had Vine reviews. Of those 835 products, more than half of the first 30 reviews were from the Vine program, according to ReviewMeta.com, an online tool that helps customers identify inauthentic reviews.While, for the most part, the Vine and non-Vine reviews were similarly rated, in a handful of cases, the Vine reviews were significantly better. For instance, Vine reviews for Amazon\u2019s Mama Bear diapers and baby products averaged 4.36 stars; non-Vine reviews averaged 3.82 stars.Amazon Vine is also available to non-Amazon brands, but, specifics around how the program works are difficult to determine because Amazon doesn\u2019t make it public. But many analysts say it is fairly expensive to participate, saying it can cost manufacturers as much as $5,000 to obtain reviews for one product, along with the cost of giving the product away. (The money to participate goes to Amazon; the Vine reviewers receive no compensation beyond the free product.)A spokeswoman for the company said Amazon does not incentivize positive star ratings or attempt to influence the content of reviews. She also said that the company limits the total number of Vine reviews that it displays for each product.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening on Amazon is different than you see in brick-and-mortar stores,\u201d said Kevin Grundy, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies. \u201cThere, private label brands might take slightly more than 10 percent market share. Amazon\u2019s private label brands are taking more than 25 percent of the online market.\u201dMr. Grundy said when the contract for the AmazonBasics batteries, which are currently made by a manufacturer in the Far East, next comes up for bid, likely bidders could include Energizer and Duracell.The next frontier? Alexa. Competitors and industry analysts are closely watching Amazon\u2019s voice-operated platform, wondering whether Amazon will use that rapidly growing arena to further steer consumers to its own brands.The essay, written by a law student named Lina Khan, argued, essentially, that the current framing of the nation\u2019s antitrust laws have not evolved to deal with the market power of technology giants like Amazon.The articles fed into a growing debate among economists and lawyers around whether Amazon is displaying monopolistic or anticompetitive behavior in its marketplace.Amazon has two strong defenses when these issues are raised.At least since the 1970s, courts have been very skeptical of antitrust plaintiffs who can\u2019t show that the challenged conduct would cause prices to go up or quality to go down. In this case, Amazon can argue, quite vehemently that, through its platform, consumers are paying lower prices, say legal experts.And while Amazon\u2019s brands have quickly gained market share on its platform in some areas, in other segments, such as apparel, they account for less than 1 percent of the inventory sold. And when broadened out to include brick-and-mortar stores, its online share of the battery market equals less than 5 percent. Until Amazon\u2019s share of the total market starts to reach closer to 40 percent or more, it is difficult to argue there is an attempted-monopolization case, say legal experts.But if its private-label business grows as analysts expect it to do, could it face a legal challenge of whether it is a \u201cmonopsony\u201d? In a monopsony, a large buyer controls a large proportion of the market and drives prices down.\u201cIf Amazon is not making its competitors available on voice and Alexa, well, that sounds like possible exclusionary conduct to me,\u201d said Mr. Sagers. \u201cIf a federal court could be convinced that there is a market for in-home, voice retail distribution and that Amazon controls it, then I think Amazon could be looking at a monopsony case.\u201dStill, others argue a dominant question in any sort of antitrust action has been whether the company\u2019s actions or a planned merger would harm consumers.\u201cYou have to show that the end game is some sort of consumer harm, either through higher prices or lower quality,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cAnd so far, Amazon doesn\u2019t even show up on the radar screen when it comes to consumer harm.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Buys GitHub for $7.5 Billion, Moving to Grow in Coding\u2019s New Era", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicrosoft, fully embracing a model it once saw as a threat, said on Monday that it was buying GitHub, an open software platform used by 28 million programmers, for $7.5 billion.The deal is a bid by Microsoft to gain ground in the internet era of software development, where applications increasingly run on remote data centers \u2014 on so-called cloud computing.Amazon is the leader in the cloud market so far, but Microsoft has transformed itself in recent years to become a strong No. 2 as a supplier of cloud computing services. Its vital Office productivity applications and database software are available in cloud versions.Microsoft also competes with Google, IBM, Salesforce and others in the cloud marketplace. All of them are trying to lure software engineers to use their cloud tools and services. The more programmers on a company\u2019s platform, the more software applications are created, attracting customers and still more developers \u2014 a flywheel of growth and profit.\u201cThe strategic battle in the tech world is for developers,\u201d said Frank Gens, chief analyst for IDC, a research firm. \u201cFor Microsoft, the GitHub deal is about strengthening and widening its relationships with developers.\u201dSatya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said the deal would advance Microsoft\u2019s ambitions in cloud computing and bring smarter software to every industry, on any digital device.GitHub, founded in 2008 and based in San Francisco, was created largely as a community for software developers to share programming tools and code. It has been a champion of the open-source software movement, with its ethos of freely sharing code in public.Today, GitHub is used by a wide range in the tech community, from lone programmers to the nation\u2019s largest companies. Developers can share code, make comments and buy software tools. They work in digital storage spaces, called repositories. Some are open to all users; others are closed to members of a team. GitHub now has more than 85 million code repositories.Individuals can use GitHub for free. But there are monthly subscription charges for extra storage, development tools and private repositories. The company does not disclose its revenue, but analysts estimate it is running at $200 million a year.The open-source model was once anathema to Microsoft, the largest commercial software company, which had favored keeping its code proprietary. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft\u2019s former chief executive, once called Linux, the popular open-source operating system, a \u201ccancer\u201d in the body of the technology business.But Microsoft has come to embrace open-source tools. Today, Microsoft is the most active corporation on GitHub, with more than two million contributions of code to GitHub projects.GitHub, seeking to establish a profitable business, has increasingly hosted corporate projects on its platform for a fee. Those ventures have typically used open-source software development techniques while keeping some code proprietary.Executives from both companies insisted that GitHub would remain technologically neutral, welcoming developers using any code or any cloud service, rather than a Microsoft walled garden. The proof, analysts say, will be in how GitHub operates under Microsoft ownership.\u201cDevelopers by their nature are often suspicious of corporate ambitions,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cMicrosoft will have to demonstrate its willingness to put the interests of developers ahead of any Microsoft-specific agenda.\u201dThe $7.5 billion purchase, an all-stock deal, is the second-largest acquisition Microsoft has made since Mr. Nadella became chief executive in early 2014. The bigger deal came in 2016, when Microsoft bought LinkedIn, the social network for professional workers, for $26.2 billion. (GitHub ranks third in Microsoft\u2019s history, also behind the $8.5 billion purchase of Skype in 2011.)If GitHub will remain a neutral home for developers, as Microsoft insists, why did the company pay so handsomely to own it?In an interview, Nat Friedman, corporate vice president for developer services at Microsoft, explained that ownership would give the company the confidence to make a greater commitment to GitHub \u2014 \u201cto confidently go all-in on GitHub.\u201dMicrosoft, Mr. Friedman said, will make nearly all its software-building tools available on GitHub. Over time, as Microsoft shows itself to be a reliable corporate steward of GitHub and is willing to invest in its growth, he said, Microsoft should benefit as more developers adopt its software.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of building trust with developers,\u201d said Mr. Friedman, who will become chief executive of GitHub when the deal closes, which is expected to be this year. \u201cYou earn the right to be considered for other things.\u201dWith GitHub, Microsoft is making a move similar to its LinkedIn acquisition \u2014 buying the leading marketplace in its field. \u201cMicrosoft is rolling up another platform,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management.GitHub has become far more than a platform for software development. It is where developers demonstrate their skills. Software engineers routinely include links to their GitHub projects on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and companies scout for job candidates on GitHub.\u201cIt\u2019s the de facto tool for recruiting technical talent,\u201d Julio Avalos, GitHub\u2019s chief strategy officer, said in an interview this year.The $7.5 billion transaction promises a lucrative payday for GitHub\u2019s venture backers. The start-up had raised a total of $350 million \u2014 a $100 million round in 2012, led by Andreessen Horowitz, and a $250 million round in 2015, led by Sequoia Capital.\u201cGit was a powerful but niche tool, clouds were just things in the sky,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand Microsoft was a very different company.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Pity the Tech B-List", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsI spent most of the week at the Code Conference, where the tech world\u2019s elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry. It was a fascinating event, less in the sense of newsy product announcements (which there weren\u2019t many of) and more in the general finger-in-the-wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself.Notable at this year\u2019s Code was that there seems to be a growing rift between the largest tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 and the rest of the industry.The shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference, even if their presence was minimal. No executives from Apple, Amazon or Google spoke at Code, and when executives from Microsoft and Facebook did take the stage, they mostly talked about the past. (Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, offered some historical perspective on the company\u2019s antitrust woes from the late 1990s; Sheryl Sandberg and Mike Schroepfer from Facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company\u2019s post-Cambridge Analytica \u201cwe\u2019ll do better\u201d script.)Instead, much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech A-list \u2014 large, popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories, but that have spent years locked in a fight for survival against their bigger, more entrenched rivals.From the perspective of the tech B-list, there are two huge fights to be won. First, you need to establish a foothold in a market, either by out-innovating old-line incumbents \u2014 taxis, hotels, music labels \u2014 or by creating a new market altogether. Then, once you\u2019re established and growing, a bigger worry emerges: What if one of the Big Five squashes you?A good example of a tech B-lister is Spotify, which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers \u2014 the three labels that provide the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s music \u2014 but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by a tech giant. Onstage at Code, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek, fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which have their own music streaming services and, more important, control the hardware platforms (iOS, Android, Alexa) on which people consume music.Mr. Ek mostly deflected, saying that there are \u201cvery, very few opportunities that a billion-plus people around the world care about,\u201d and that the giants\u2019 interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category.Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, sounded a similar note at the conference when asked about Facebook\u2019s habit of blatantly copying Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive product features. (Mr. Spiegel\u2019s sassy comeback \u2014 \u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also\u201d \u2014 was the best line there.)\u201cWell, I believe if you don\u2019t create a pure, vertical, integrated capability, vertically integrated capability \u2014 from distribution all the way through content creation and advertising models \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a hard time competing with these guys. And the statistic we throw out, and since we announced this deal in November of 2016, the FANG market caps have gone up over $1 trillion. You better figure out how to vertically integrate here if you want to compete with those players.\u201dIt\u2019s not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets. It\u2019s more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of a $200 billion telecom giant. And it shows just how dominant the tech A-list has become, and how difficult overcoming its concentration of market power is proving to be.Here are a few other tech stories of note this past week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Potent Acquisition Currency: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Microsoft\u2019s surging shares keep it in the deal game.\u2022 Microsoft is acquiring the popular computer code repository GitHub.\u2022 A trade war could put millions of jobs on the line.\u2022 Facebook gave hardware firms deep access to your information\u2022 What to expect from today\u2019s Apple developer conference.Mr. Schultz\u2019s decision to retire will most likely stoke speculation that he is considering a run for president in 2020. On Monday, he acknowledged for the first time that it is something he may consider:\u201cI want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines. For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201cI want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines. For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201dUnder Mr. Schultz\u2019s three decades managing the company, Starbucks grew from a tiny local chain into a global coffee giant, operating 28,000 stores in 75 countries. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Microsoft\u2019s planned acquisition of GitHub, a software development company, is not close to the company\u2019s largest, and it will not have a big, immediate impact on profits.But the deal is a milestone because it reveals the degree to which the rise in Microsoft\u2019s stock has bolstered its heft as an acquirer.Microsoft\u2019s stock has gone up more than 200 percent since Microsoft agreed in 2013 to pay $7.2 billion in cash for Nokia\u2019s handset and services operations. That price tag amounted to 2.6 percent of Microsoft\u2019s total market value back then. The $7.5 billion Microsoft is paying for GitHub is just under 1 percent of Microsoft\u2019s current market capitalization. This lessens the financial hit if the acquisition falls short of expectations, but increases the upside if it outperforms.In recent years, Microsoft\u2019s valuation has also increased, making its stock even more potent as an acquisition currency. Microsoft\u2019s shares currently trade at around 24 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to data from CapitalIQ. That\u2019s far higher than the 15 times it traded at in mid-2013.But it would be a mistake to conclude that Microsoft has not advanced in the market for acquisitions. Its soaring stock has made sure the company has remained a player in the deals game. The jump in its price-to-earnings ratio makes it more likely that a large deal would bolster earnings per share (after factoring in the extra shares issued to do the deal.) With its operations notching up strong organic growth, Microsoft probably does not need to do a big deal anytime soon. But if one were to crop up, shareholders may not balk.- Peter Eavis Satya Nadella happened, for one. (He succeeded Steve Ballmer as C.E.O. of Microsoft in 2014.) And the cloud, for another.Mr. Ballmer tried to target the flashier end of the consumer hardware market, with things like Windows Phone and the Zune music player. It didn\u2019t work. In contrast, Mr. Nadella has focused on enterprise applications \u2014 and in particular, found huge success in cloud computing.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.The company lags only Amazon Web Services as a cloud provider.Preparing for the futureMr. Nadella is also gearing up for the next big thing to be put into the cloud: artificial intelligence.Because such software is computationally demanding, it makes sense to pay for someone else to run programs on huge servers rather than buying one\u2019s own hardware. But it\u2019s also complex, which means that there is going to be a huge market for user-friendly software that can be taken up by regular developers and not just people with A.I. Ph.D.s.That\u2019s why there\u2019s a big race right now \u2014 between the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others \u2014 to offer up tools in the cloud that can process huge data sets and provide useful insights about them.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWhat Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., said of the transaction:\u201cMicrosoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, a senior Microsoft executive, Nat Friedman, will become GitHub\u2019s C.E.O., while the coding hub\u2019s current chief, Chris Wanstrath, will become a Microsoft technical fellow. The acquisition is expected to close by year end.\u2022 GitHub: $7.5 billion\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Gabriel J.X. Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia:Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing.Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, has been adamant that his company stringently protects its customers\u2019 data privacy. Two news stories raise some questions about that categorical claim.The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Not too incriminating. But it\u2019s a reminder that Apple has made use of the data that passes across Facebook\u2019s platform.Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest\u2019s app for \u201cdrapes\u201d might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for \u201cNFL\u201d might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said.None of this is to say that Apple doesn\u2019t act by its word. But it is an important reminder to continue asking whether it really does.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe latest installment in the movie franchise, \u201cSolo,\u201d had its second disappointing weekend, pulling in just $29.3 million in the U.S. (We use \u201cjust\u201d advisedly.) But perhaps more important, it raises questions about the future of what is supposed to be one of Walt Disney\u2019s biggest moneymakers.The trend hasn\u2019t been reassuring, though. Disney likely took about $1 billion from \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d after accounting for production and marketing costs. But \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d the next movie in the main series, showed a marked drop. (To be fair, \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was the first new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie in more than a decade.)But \u201cSolo\u201d may highlight the pitfalls. Disney has said that it plans to release a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie every year, raising the real risk that moviegoers could end up suffering from Force fatigue. Just five months separated \u201cSolo\u201d from \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d Forcing through more movies \u2014 and video content for Disney\u2019s forthcoming streaming service \u2014 could erode the uniqueness that once defined the franchise\u2019s installments.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe automaker will face tough questions and tricky votes Tuesday at its annual shareholder meeting tomorrow.The company doesn\u2019t publish a sustainability report, which investors say makes it hard to keep tabs on workforce issues such as safety. And they are concerned that Tesla can\u2019t manage infrastructure changes ahead involving electric-vehicles and autonomous-driving cars.G.E. could sell assets to raise the cash, but that will be no easy feat. The conglomerate could sell Baker Hughes, but such a deal may only raise $20 billion, Mr. Tusa writes.\u201cThe bottom line is that we see the need to de-risk substantially, which includes the need for cash and a cut to the dividend to help with operational de-levering.\u201dWhile at Kirkland, Mr. Fraidin worked on transactions like 3G Capital\u2019s takeover of H.J. Heinz and Pershing Square and Valeant Pharmaceuticals\u2019 bid for the drug maker Allergan.From a statement by Pat Quinn, Cadwalader\u2019s managing partner:\u201cSteve brings great energy to our team and we look forward to rolling up our sleeves together in the service of our clients. He will significantly enhance our ability to provide market-leading experience and tailored solutions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedOver the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.If that\u2019s accurate, Apple must tread carefully to avoid comparisons to Facebook.One advantage to being retained by lawyers for a client rather than by the client himself is that Mr. Sitrick is technically a member of the legal team, and therefore protected by attorney-client privilege. And though he is not a lawyer, Mr. Sitrick views himself as a litigator in the court of public opinion. He also charges lawyerly rates \u2014 as much as $1,100 an hour.Most of the time, the winner gets to ask Mr. Buffett for investing advice. But lunch has led to a job offer: Mr. Buffett ultimately hired Ted Weschler, who won the auctions in 2010 and 2011, as one of his two investing lieutenants.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Investors Aren\u2019t Spooked by Cracks in the International Economic Order", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s policies are straining the international trading system that for decades has helped corporate America reap increasing profits. So why is the stock market moving higher, while relations between the United States and its largest trading partners are deteriorating?The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up on Monday, the first day of trading after Mr. Trump\u2019s pugnacious stance rattled the summit meeting of the Group of 7 nations that was held over the weekend.The calm makes some sense. Investors think that trade skirmishes could be outweighed by two major reasons to be bullish.First, economic growth in the United States, which has been relatively strong for some time, may now pick up even more. Recent tax cuts might encourage businesses and consumers to spend more. Wall Street analysts expect profits of the companies in the S.&P. 500 index to surge by 26 percent this year, which is a remarkable amount. And companies with top-performing stocks, such as Netflix and Microsoft, sell products and services that are unlikely to be the direct target of hostile trade actions.Second, when Wall Street analysts do drill down to try to discern the impact of specific tariffs on companies, their conclusions are not that worrisome. Take Mr. Trump\u2019s levies on steel and aluminum, which are now in effect. These have enraged other countries and will no doubt push up costs for many United States companies that use the metals. But the overall impact on corporate earnings might be muted.The stock prices of Ford and General Motors \u2014 two companies that should be hurting from the rising metal prices \u2014 have risen since mid-February, when it became clear that the Trump administration was intent on imposing its metals tariffs.Mr. Trump, of course, is threatening more than just metals tariffs. On Friday, the United States is scheduled to release its final list of products from China that will be covered by a further $50 billion of tariffs. The Trump administration said it would impose the tariffs soon afterward. China has threatened to retaliate.Yet investors, even though they know a trade war is looming, have not dumped stocks in some of the companies that look particularly vulnerable. Computer chip makers like Qualcomm have a large proportion of their sales in China, but Qualcomm\u2019s stock has recently rallied.Investors may be less bullish about the overall market than they look. The S.&P. 500 is up only 2 percent since mid-February, when the recent trade tensions began in earnest \u2014 and that small increase has relied heavily on a rally in technology stocks. If it wasn\u2019t for concerns over trade, Wall Street\u2019s recently upgraded earnings expectations might have pushed stocks to much higher levels than they are at right now.The imposition of $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods is likely to lead to some rocky days for the stock market. But unless investors believe that profits are going to get whacked, they appear willing to tolerate Mr. Trump\u2019s trade measures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The C.E.O. of Starbucks Isn\u2019t Leaving. Only Howard Schultz Is.", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKevin Johnson has been chief executive of Starbucks for more than a year now, though you wouldn\u2019t always know it. For much of Mr. Johnson\u2019s tenure, he has been overshadowed by Howard Schultz, the company\u2019s former chief executive and departing executive chairman.\u201cIn these transitions, the prior C.E.O. has to step back a bit to allow the new leader to step forward,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in an interview last week, his first since Mr. Schultz announced his departure. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in that period over the last year and a half.\u201dAlready, Mr. Johnson\u2019s ability to take over from Mr. Schultz \u2014 an emotional leader committed to publicly addressing thorny social issues \u2014 has been put to the test, most notably when the arrest of those two men in Philadelphia set off a national debate about race.\u201cRace relations has been a challenging topic in America for centuries,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, 57. \u201cThe realization that it happened in Starbucks was a wake-up call.\u201dMr. Johnson said he had learned of the incident when he woke up in his home in Seattle on a Saturday morning, his inbox flooded with angry emails. He flew to Philadelphia the next day, and over the following days he made a series of public apologies, met with the two men who had been arrested and fired the store manager who had called the police.As Mr. Johnson and other executives considered what more substantial steps they could take, Mr. Schultz chimed in with an idea to shut down all stores in the United States for half a day to talk about bias.\u201cHe suggested, \u2018Hey, one thing we\u2019ve done in the past, 10 years ago, was close all the stores for the training around pulling espresso shots,\u2019\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cWe immediately said, \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019\u201dOver the years, Mr. Schultz turned the coffee company into a progressive force, giving workers above-average benefits, and weighing in on issues like gun violence, gay marriage and race relations. Mr. Johnson said that wouldn\u2019t change with Mr. Schultz gone.\u201cThe mission and the core values of the company are very, very important,\u201d he said. \u201cThose things are so important, and I intend to continue and enhance those.\u201dSatya Nadella, a Starbucks board member and Microsoft\u2019s third chief executive, after Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates, said he had talked to Mr. Johnson \u201cabout what it means to succeed a legendary founder.\u201d\u201cI shared the best advice I got from Steve and Bill,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cIt was: \u2018Don\u2019t try to be us. Don\u2019t try to fill our shoes.\u2019 He\u2019s not Howard. But at the same time, he\u2019s learned a lot from Howard.\u201dMr. Johnson also has a business to run. That job will be made easier by the fact that Starbucks is a relatively healthy company. Same-store sales grew 2 percent last quarter in the United States, and 4 percent in China. Total revenue for the quarter was $6 billion, and the company is worth some $78 billion.Yet Mr. Johnson faces several operational challenges as he looks to move Starbucks beyond Mr. Schultz. The stock has not budged since Mr. Johnson took over as chief executive in April last year. Tastes are fickle, and Starbucks is scrambling to meet the demands of health-conscious consumers.And while Starbucks continues to open new stores \u2014 it has some 28,000 around the world \u2014 there are concerns that it may be growing too fast for its own good.\u201cThey are opening units in the U.S. at a fairly rapid clip, especially for a company as mature as they are,\u201d said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bernstein.Though Mr. Johnson\u2019s boosters, including Mr. Schultz, say he is the right man for the job, joining Starbucks was not an easy decision, he said. A longtime technology executive who held senior roles at Microsoft before becoming chief executive of Juniper Networks in 2008, Mr. Johnson joined the Starbucks board in 2009. But a few years later, he learned he had skin cancer.At first, he continued to work at Juniper. Then one day, he was at the airport about to travel to Europe for client meetings, having just rescheduled a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201cI sat there and I thought to myself, \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Why am I prioritizing traveling to Europe to sell networking technology over my health, my life, my family, people I love?\u2019\u201dHe soon retired from Juniper to spend more time with his family, but continued serving on the Starbucks board. Then, in 2015, after regaining his health, Mr. Johnson was persuaded by Mr. Schultz to join Starbucks as chief operating officer.Those who work with Mr. Johnson say he has brought a new level of analytical rigor to Starbucks. They credit him with a series of business decisions that have simplified the company and improved profitability.\u201cKevin and Howard will usually get to the same place,\u201d said Rosalind Brewer, Starbucks\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cFor Kevin it has to be a mental, cognitive transition. Whereas Howard has the gut. This is his baby.\u201dPerhaps most important, Mr. Johnson has led efforts to make Starbucks a more technologically adept company. He has overseen the rollout of mobile ordering and pickup, integrated a loyalty program into the Starbucks app and shut down the company\u2019s e-commerce store, a counterintuitive move he said was a recognition that other retailers, like Amazon, could do it better.\u201cThe most difficult transition any company will ever go through is from founder-led to founder-inspired,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this opportunity. But I also recognize it\u2019s a significant responsibility. That\u2019s not lost on me.\u201dAs for Mr. Schultz, should he run for president, at least one former employee \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 is ready to offer a vote of confidence.\u201cNo matter what Howard decides to do in this next chapter of his life,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, \u201che is a great leader and a great person.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Net Neutrality Actually Ended Long Before This Week", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIt seemed obvious that the internet\u2019s great promise was that it operated outside the purview of existing communications monopolies. Because phone and cable companies couldn\u2019t easily dictate what happened online, the internet was exploding in dozens of genuinely new ideas. Among those back then were blogs, Skype, file-sharing, YouTube, Friendster, Netflix \u2014 ideas that scrambled our sense of what was possible in media and communication, and, in the process, posed existential threats to the established giants.Other than the phone and cable companies themselves, I couldn\u2019t see why anyone might oppose the simple premise of protecting the environment that had made all these things possible. Did they hate clean water, too?Net neutrality was too good for us. And even if rules are restored, the notion that the internet should afford at least a minimally competitive landscape for new entrants now seems as antiquated as Friendster.Today, the internet is run by giants. A handful of American tech behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 control the most important digital infrastructure, while a handful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon \u2014 control most of the internet connections in the United States.So, what now?It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201cHistory shows us that companies that have the technical capacity to do things, the business incentive to do them and the legal right \u2014 they will take advantage of what is made available to them,\u201d said Jessica Rosenworcel, an F.C.C. commissioner and a Democrat, who voted against the repeal of net neutrality last year.By repealing neutrality rules, the government has just given our online overlords that legal right, she cautioned.\u201cNow they can block websites and censor online content,\u201d Ms. Rosenworcel said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel good \u2014 and if you rely on the internet to consume or create, it shouldn\u2019t make you feel good, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Twitch, Amazon Tightens Grip on Live Streams of Video Games", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate on a recent night, more than 600,000 people watched one of the most popular video game players, Tyler Blevins, engage in Fortnite Battle Royale with a celebrity guest: Drake.Drake was deferential to Mr. Blevins as they teamed up before an audience that peaked at roughly 667,000 viewers, a ratings record (since broken) for a nontournament live stream. As the game progressed, the world-famous rapper played a supporting role, collecting supplies for Ninja, seemingly content to lend a hand to a master at work.Like others who make significant money on Twitch, Mr. Blevins is a born talker, and he bantered with the fans as he and Drake played. Drake joined the conversation, too. He told the commenters that he liked pineapple on his pizza and explained that he was a Ninja fan before Twitch, back when Mr. Blevins, 27, first found fame among gamers on YouTube and Instagram.Streamlabs \u2014 a San Francisco tech company whose software allows viewers to tip streamers, giving the company insight into an opaque ecosystem \u2014 suggests that Amazon\u2019s lead may be all but insurmountable. Its data shows that, in the last quarter, the average number of people watching Twitch\u2019s streams at any given moment increased to 953,000, up from 788,000. Twitch\u2019s archrival, YouTube Gaming, averaged 272,000 concurrent viewers, down from 308,000 in the previous quarter, Streamlabs reported.YouTube pushed back against the data, but declined to provide numbers of its own. \u201cWe have truly gotten bigger every single month in live gaming, and live gaming viewership is up over two times, year over year,\u201d said Ryan Wyatt, a YouTube vice president in charge of gaming content. (Ali Moiz, the Streamlabs chief executive, stood by his company\u2019s report. \u201cThey should publish their data, if they think this is wrong,\u201d he said of YouTube.)Twitch began in 2011 as an offshoot of Justin.tv, a lifecasting site founded by two Yale graduates, Emmett Shear and Justin Kan. They started the platform after they found that viewers were more interested in watching their lifecasters play video games than eat or sleep. Big tech companies came courting, and Amazon beat out Google.In the four years since the sale, video gaming as a spectator sport has gone mainstream, and Twitch has captured the majority of those who want to watch it live.For the dedicated fans, the live, freewheeling sessions on Twitch have the appeal of a major sporting event crossed with a talk show. The interaction between the host and viewers is one key to the site\u2019s success, making for an involved viewing experience that is markedly different from the prerecorded and edited videos of game sessions that have long been popular on YouTube.On Twitch, the player\u2019s face, when visible, typically inhabits a small part of the screen, and the world of the video game takes center position. On the right side of the screen, endless comments from the viewers \u2014 mostly male, mostly young \u2014 appear in a continuous scroll.Craig Riches, who plays under the name PythonGB, has posted his Minecraft videos on YouTube proper since 2010. Despite his affiliation, he said the Amazon-owned site remained well ahead of Google\u2019s foray into live game-streaming.\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that YouTube Gaming is still playing catch-up to Twitch\u2019s platform,\u201d said Mr. Riches, 23.The hosts on Twitch, some of whom sign up exclusively with the platform in order to gain access to its moneymaking tools, are rewarded for their ability to make a connection with viewers as much as they are for their gaming prowess. Viewers who pay $4.99 a month for a basic subscription \u2014 the money is split evenly between the streamers and Twitch \u2014 are looking for immediacy and intimacy. While some hosts at YouTube Gaming offer a similar experience, they have struggled to build audiences as large, and as dedicated, as those on Twitch.\u201cYou have this really unique live interaction you don\u2019t get with YouTube videos,\u201d said Meg Kaylee, a streamer and host on GameStop TV who built her career playing various games on Twitch after starting on YouTube. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different experience.\u201dCiting Twitch\u2019s fervent audiences and the \u201cbetter job\u201d it does in communicating with talent, Ms. Kaylee, 20, added that she had never really considered signing up with YouTube Gaming.Facebook Live, Periscope and Mixer all grew quickly in the last quarter, according to Streamlabs, but none have approached the scale of Twitch. The number of those watching game streams on Facebook\u2019s platform, for instance, increased to 56,000 from 27,500, according to the firm\u2019s estimates.Even with the rise of live streaming, gamers have continued to do big business posting recorded videos on YouTube\u2019s main site, which reports 1.8 billion \u201clogged in\u201d users a month, across all types of content. That makes it much larger than Twitch, which claims around 100 million monthly viewers. Mr. Wyatt, the YouTube executive, noted the full scope of YouTube\u2019s gaming content, which includes the videos posted on the main site and the live streams on YouTube Gaming, in comparing it with the Amazon-owned platform.\u201cThe size and scale and businesses is not comparable from YouTube to Twitch,\u201d Mr. Wyatt said. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve seen indicates that video-on-demand will be the biggest part of gaming content consumption.\u201dHe also pointed out that YouTube Gaming offered a different kind of programming: its live sessions last \u201ca couple hours at a time\u201d \u2014 a sharp contrast with the typical Twitch marathons.Still, YouTube created YouTube Gaming in direct response to Twitch. During its first few months, in 2015, the platform\u2019s hosts complained about the lack of ways to make money and asked for better tools for managing chat streams, which can easily descend into toxicity.\u201cIt took them a really long time to bring out basic features you would have on Twitch,\u201d said Cole Riness, a professional YouTuber who specializes in family-friendly gaming videos.YouTube has taken steps to address complaints. Most notably, as of April, its subscription systems \u2014 for live and recorded content \u2014 have been unified. As for support, Mr. Wyatt said, \u201cI would argue that we certainly have equivalent moderation tools to any other service on the market.\u201dOther challenges have proved more difficult for YouTube Gaming to solve. The site\u2019s copyright policing has frustrated some hosts, who have found themselves penalized, or even barred, because music was playing in the background of their sessions. Twitch has a reputation for being less punitive \u2014 or perhaps just less aware \u2014 where copyright issues are concerned.While YouTube has made millionaires out of the creators of popular videos through its advertising program, Twitch\u2019s hosts make money primarily from subscribers and one-off donations or tips. YouTube Gaming has made it possible for viewers to support hosts this way, but paying audiences haven\u2019t materialized at the scale they have on Twitch.Now that it seems well on its way to becoming synonymous with long-form live video gaming, Twitch\u2019s competitors may be running out of time to take their shot.Brandon Freytag, a former Twitch employee who is chief executive of Loaded, a talent agency that represents Mr. Blevins, said the most credible challenge to Twitch may come not from another tech company but from within. The most popular hosts, he noted, could be enticed to leave it for another platform, or create their own. They could also make demands of Twitch itself.The popularity of its stars is a force Twitch has yet to reckon with. For now, Mr. Freytag said, the calculus for hosts like Mr. Blevins is pretty simple: \u201cEveryone is on Twitch.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the screen name of Craig Riches.

{"Headline": "IBM Unveils System That \u2018Debates\u2019 With Humans", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A match between an Israeli college debate champion and a loquacious IBM computer program demonstrated on Monday new gains in the quest for computers that can hold conversations with humans. It also led to an unlikely question for the tech industry\u2019s deep thinkers: Can a machine talk too much?At an IBM office in downtown San Francisco, Noa Ovadia, a college senior who won an Israeli championship in 2016, squared off with IBM\u2019s program, called the IBM Debater.She argued against government subsidies for space exploration. The machine argued in favor, delivering three brief speeches in a digitally created monotone and \u2014 at least in small ways \u2014 responding to Ms. Ovadia\u2019s human opinions.\u201cAnother point that I believe my opponent made is that there are more important things than space exploration to spend money on,\u201d the machine said during its lengthy rebuttal. \u201cIt is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this. No one is claiming that this is the only item on our expense list.\u201dUnder development for six years, this artificial intelligence system is part of a broader effort to build technology that can interact with people the way we interact with one another.Companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have for several years offered coffee table gadgets and smartphone apps that answer simple questions or perform simple tasks. (\u201cHey, Siri. Set my alarm for 7 a.m. tomorrow.\u201d)Projects like IBM Debater and Google Duplex show that this kind of system is starting to stretch beyond simple commands. But they also demonstrate the limitations of current technology.IBM\u2019s system was designed to debate about 100 topics, but these interactions are tightly constrained: a four-minute opening statement followed by a rebuttal to its opponent\u2019s argument \u2014 and then a statement summing up its own viewpoint. It was not exactly Lincoln v. Douglas.Subsidized space exploration, the machine said during its opening statement, \u201cinspires our children to pursue education and careers in science and technology and mathematics.\u201d\u201cIt is more important than good roads or improved schools or better health care,\u201d it added.Noam Slonim, an IBM researcher who helped oversee the project, estimated that the technology could have a \u201cmeaningful\u201d debate on those 100 topics 40 percent of the time. IBM chose the topic for the live debate before it began. In some cases, the machine\u2019s lengthy speeches hinted at how it was stitching together its arguments \u2014 identifying relevant sentences and clauses and then combining them into a reasonably coherent, computerized thought.In 2011, IBM demonstrated a system that could beat the leading players at the trivia game show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d The company used this system, called Watson, as a way of promoting a wide range of products and consulting services for hospitals and other businesses.After Watson won, Mr. Slonim, a researcher at an IBM lab in Haifa, Israel, pitched the Debater project as IBM\u2019s next \u201cgrand challenge.\u201dBut the project reflects the recent acceleration of research related to \u201cnatural language understanding,\u201d the effort to build machines that can understand the natural way we humans talk and respond in kind. As this research progresses, it can provide new ways for computers to digest and process information or even lead to machines that can hold a completely convincing conversation.This sort of technology would have a wide range of uses. It could help businesses filter hot-button issues on social media. Or it could provide governments with a more effective way of censoring information.Understanding natural language is such a complex and difficult task, systems like IBM Debater lean on a wide range of systems, each handling a different part of the problem. One system will identify information that helps fuel an argument on one side of the debate. Another will generate the text of the argument. And so on.In recent years, researchers have significantly improved systems that recognize people and objects, identify spoken words and translate between languages.But understanding language is far more complex. That means systems that perform fairly simple language tasks \u2014 like writing a Wikipedia article, let alone engaging in a serious debate on a random topic \u2014 may still be years away.\u201cIt is now very obvious this change is happening,\u201d said Jeremy Howard, an independent researcher working in this area. \u201cBut these things take time.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted the IBM Debater, a computer program that participated in a debate with an Israeli college senior on June 18. During an exchange, the program said, \u201cIt is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this,\u201d not \u201cI dispute this.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco, and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Industries, Looking for Efficiency, Turn to Blockchains", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf some financial institutions had used blockchains before the last recession, we may not have had one. After all, banks sometimes didn\u2019t know which company\u2019s books held bad mortgages, and a blockchain is essentially a single time-stamped ledger transparent to all its users.Since that time, companies in a wide variety of industries, such as health care, government, food, supply chain management and trade finance, have begun exploring blockchain technology. The problems they\u2019re trying to solve mostly come down to inefficiency and fraud.Gartner, a research firm, projects the global business benefits of blockchain technology will total $5 billion in 2018 and more than quadruple to $21 billion by 2021.IBM is helping many companies adopt blockchain technology.\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen over 400 client engagements, and we\u2019re starting to see the results of those in the commercialization of those efforts,\u201d said Marie Wieck, IBM\u2019s general manager for blockchain, contrasting it with 2016, when she saw \u201cblockchain tourism \u2014 everyone was sightseeing,\u201d she said. IBM emphasizes that a blockchain works best as a network, so she\u2019s now seeing more initiatives focusing on getting a minimum number of companies on a blockchain.However, blockchains for businesses are mostly still experiments, said David Furlonger, a Gartner vice president.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of proof of concept work being done in pretty much every industry and government, and the interest remains extremely high from all those participants,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus is very much on research and development work, not massive implementation.\u201dWhether the testing is taking full advantage of the technology\u2019s capabilities is another matter. Noting that one of the core advantages of blockchains is decentralization \u2014 the ability for a network to decide by group consensus, not top-down authority \u2014 Mr. Furlonger said: \u201cMany of the enterprise initiatives are heavily centralized replatforming initiatives, not reimagining the way business can be conducted. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re necessarily bad if you\u2019re able to produce savings, improve efficiency. But it could, to some extent, reinforce the prior paradigm, which was a very heavily centralized model.\u201dOne product, called a distributed contracting network, was just announced for Microsoft\u2019s Xbox. Paul Brody, blockchain global innovation leader at EY, which helped create the product, said it was \u201ca blockchain-based tool for enabling companies to execute digital contracts with each other \u2014 and very specifically, the primary focus is on digital media content, rights and royalties around everything from video games to media and entertainment \u2014 music, movies, etc.\u201dXbox, which features games by publishers around the world, has traditionally tracked and calculated the royalties its content creators were owed manually and with spreadsheets, said Rohit Amberker, director of royalties and content operations at Microsoft. The process typically took 30 to 60 days. The new system is transparent, cutting down costs by a projected two-thirds, Mr. Brody said.One of the first to use it will be Ubisoft, a game publisher, though once it is in use across Microsoft\u2019s gaming ecosystem, it will encompass thousands of content partners, Mr. Amberker said. Eventually, the goal is for the blockchain to also handle payments and for it to be useful to anyone dealing with intellectual property or digital asset rights, including authors, songwriters and developers, he said.The financial services industry is further along than other. Insurwave, a marine insurance program created by seven companies, started at the end of May for more than 1,000 ships. Shaun Crawford, the global head of insurance for EY, which is building the program with GuardTime, said insurance for ships has traditionally been a paper-intensive business.It uses historical data and standard estimates to quantify insurance coverage divorced from the reality of any one ship\u2019s particular risk. That can vary based on a vessel\u2019s age, service history, the routes it travels (whether it passes through conflict zones where ships are more likely to be hijacked) and other factors. With Insurwave, insurers can, for instance, increase a premium on a ship set to sail through a dangerous zone, which might in turn prompt it to choose another course. Everything is signed through the blockchain.The blockchain is in place across the shipping company A. P. Moller-Maersk\u2019s vessels. The insurance companies Willis Towers Watson, XL Catlin and MS Amlin are also on the platform.\u201cIt\u2019s a very sleepy old industry \u2014 insurance \u2014 and we\u2019re shaking it up a bit,\u201d Mr. Crawford said. In building the product after working on proofs of concept, he said: \u201cWe realized we\u2019re not digitizing existing processes, but transforming the way we do business. We had to re-architect our proposition two or three times to really get the blockchain thing working, so there\u2019s a big difference between a proof of concept and the reality of blockchain.\u201dWhen the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.Another blockchain-based product in use is at the bank Northern Trust, which began automating the paper-intensive process of investing by pensions and endowments in private equity.Peter Cherecwich, president of corporate and institutional services, likened the traditional process to buying a house. \u201cYou have to have all the contracts, pass them back and forth, everyone has to sign them at the same time, you move the money at the same time,\u201d he said. All this is automated, and the auditing firm PwC audits the ledger in real time, as opposed to after the fact.By year\u2019s end, a joint venture between Maersk and IBM will use a blockchain instead of masses of paper to manage the movement of goods on ships from suppliers to consumers. This blockchain is complementary to Insurwave. A shipper of avocados from Kenya to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for example, needs a certificate of origin signed by authorities in Nairobi, another document stating the fruit has been inspected, and a bill of lading, packing list and commercial invoice. All the documents, which have to be certified by the authorities, are often shuttled by motorbike in Kenya for signatures.After traveling on a ship, those documents are sent by courier to the Rotterdam customs broker. It takes four to six weeks to validate the documents, so the cargo is released under bond; if anything doesn\u2019t check out, it can be drawn upon to pay penalties. That single shipment involves 30 entities encompassing more than 100 people, requiring more than 200 exchanges of documents, said Mike White, chief executive of the joint venture. A problem anywhere along the line causes a delay, a drawback with perishable food.\u201cAll those documents are digitized, available electronically, and with the government authority, the customs agents, the shippers, the carriers and the terminals,\u201d Mr. White said of the blockchain. \u201cEverybody has access to the documents they need to see, and everybody involved in that transaction can identify immediately if there\u2019s been changes made.\u201dThe venture aims to have more than 50 percent of the major trading routes connected to the platform in three years, but will have competition from Foxconn Technology Group\u2019s coming blockchain-based supply chain software.Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, an open source blockchains project managed by the Linux Foundation, says companies that work in transactions or that serve as a system of record for an industry will have to adapt.The technology, he said, \u201cdoes force them to transform in the same way that companies that were information-centered have had to transform with the rise of the internet. That same kind of thing will hit any company about transactions or about being a system of record for an industry. If they transform themselves before their competitors do it, they\u2019ll have a future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Alibaba and Facebook have done the same in recent days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has returned to record territory, up 8 percent since the end of April. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Market Value Should Cross $1 Trillion and Keep On Trucking", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIt has been a long time coming, but Apple could soon be worth $1 trillion \u2014 and counting. At about $940 billion, the tech giant is close to being the first company to pass that threshold in market capitalization, as Breakingviews predicted seven years ago. Growth has slowed since then, but customers remain loyal and today\u2019s valuation is far from stretched. Apple\u2019s timely focus on data privacy may help it get there.The rather mundane improvements rolling out at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference this week demonstrate how the smartphone market is largely mature. Shipments worldwide declined slightly for the first time last year, the research firm IDC believes, and should grow less than 3 percent annually over the next five years.That said, there\u2019s no obvious replacement for smartphones on the horizon. Apple earned $48 billion last year, mostly from iPhone sales, so this looks like the base camp for the company. Phones are prone to being dropped, dunked in water or lost. Throw in small improvements, and the company can reap more per device. The average iPhone sales price actually rose last year.Apple can wring more dollars out of users in other ways, as well. Service revenue from selling apps, online storage and streaming music is rising at a 31 percent annual clip and now accounts for 15 percent of sales. Add in revenue from ancillary hardware, and analysts think the company can increase operating profit 13 percent this year. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a healthy rate of growth continuing. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is also milking the discomfort of Facebook, Google and others whose businesses rely heavily on sharing data, sometimes controversially, by contrasting them with Apple\u2019s privacy-friendly approach.Yet Wall Street has remained oddly skeptical over the years. Apple is valued at 15 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, which is slightly less than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over all. And peers trade at a substantial premium, with Facebook at 22 times forward earnings and Microsoft and the Google parent Alphabet on a multiple of 25.That\u2019s too large a gap. Microsoft is projected to grow roughly as fast as Apple this year. Facebook and Google are growing faster, but they are in the line of fire from consumers and regulators over data gathering and privacy worries. Apple\u2019s conference this week may be short on pizazz, but the nearly trillion-dollar company can tweak its business without the distraction of defending it.Advertisement"}

She was 53.Ms. Adams had been interviewing for an architectural job in Houston in 1996 when she took a tour of NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center. The tour roused her curiosity and led to two decades of work that challenged her to create living facilities for humans in the rarefied environment of space.\u201cHow could the child of a historian resist?\u201d she said in an interview with Metropolis magazine in 1999. \u201cThis is a big historical effort of our time.\u201dA full-size prototype of TransHab was built, but the project never received the government financing that was needed to deploy it to outer space.She added: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be conducting lab experiments next to someone on a treadmill. Remember, in microgravity, sweat floats. It\u2019s gross.\u201dThe prototype comprised 12,000 cubic feet of living quarters, communal spaces, a galley, a sick bay and work and exercise areas, all protected by thick, bulletproof woven Kevlar.Ms. Adams\u2019s role focused on the human and performance aspects of the interior design.\u201cShe was very persistent and determined,\u201d Mr. Kennedy, who recently retired from NASA, said in a telephone interview. \u201cShe was a strong, independent thinker who was not shy about sharing her thoughts and views and stood up for what she thought was right in the design.\u201dMarc M. Cohen, another former NASA space architect, added in an interview, \u201cShe turned the concept of an inflatable \u2014 a flat tire, essentially \u2014 into a viable interior structure.\u201dThough TransHab never reached outer space, Ms. Adams maintained that the design and testing of it had made it a success.Constance Marguerite Adams was born on July 16, 1964, in Boston. Her father, Jeremy, was a professor of medieval history at Southern Methodist University in Dallas; her mother, Madeleine de Jean, is a writer and Champagne expert. Young Constance often traveled to Europe with her parents and, after their divorce in the 1970s, with her father and her stepmother, Bonnie Wheeler, a medieval studies professor at S.M.U.When business slowed in Germany, where she had worked on master plans, she returned to the United States.

{"Headline": "G.E. Dropped From the Dow After More Than a Century", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were none.General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company\u2019s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company\u2019s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.Over the last year, G.E.\u2019s shares have fallen 55 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Dow. G.E., which closed Tuesday at $12.95, has the lowest share price of any of the index\u2019s 30 components.S. & P. Dow Jones Indices \u2014 which owns the Dow \u2014 suggested that the slide in G.E.\u2019s stock price contributed to the decision to remove the company from the index, where it had been a member continuously since 1907. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction.\u201cThe low price of G.E. shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point,\u201d said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWalgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s share price is higher, and it will contribute more meaningfully to the index.\u201dThe move also is freighted with economic symbolism. With the inclusion of Walgreens Boots, the index \u201cwill be more representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said.The removal of G.E., which will formally occur June 26, reflects a shift in the economic composition of the United States, which long ago tilted away from heavy industry and toward services, such as technology, finance and health care.And it also amounted to a milestone for General Electric. It was the last remaining original member of the index, when the stock market measure was introduced in 1896.Back then, just a few years after the company was formed through a merger of Thomas Edison\u2019s electric companies with a rival, G.E. was the modern-day equivalent of a technology stock, and the Dow itself was geared heavily toward the growth industries of the day such as railroads. In the more than 120 years that followed, the company was often at the center of American capitalism. And as recently as the 1990s. G.E. was at times the most-valuable American company by market value.Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the United States today.After G.E.\u2019s departure from the index, the company with the longest presence in the Dow will be Exxon Mobil, whose corporate predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, joined the Dow in 1928, according to S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and the Feud Over Killer Robots", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "As the tech moguls disagree over the risks presented by something that doesn\u2019t exist yet, all of Silicon Valley is learning about unintended consequences of A.I.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg thought his fellow Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk was behaving like an alarmist.So, on Nov. 19, 2014, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, invited Mr. Musk to dinner at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. Two top researchers from Facebook\u2019s new artificial intelligence lab and two other Facebook executives joined them.As they ate, the Facebook contingent tried to convince Mr. Musk that he was wrong. But he wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cI genuinely believe this is dangerous,\u201d Mr. Musk told the table, according to one of the dinner\u2019s attendees, Yann LeCun, the researcher who led Facebook\u2019s A.I. lab.Mr. Musk\u2019s fears of A.I., distilled to their essence, were simple: If we create machines that are smarter than humans, they could turn against us. (See: \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d) Let\u2019s for once, he was saying to the rest of the tech industry, consider the unintended consequences of what we are creating before we unleash it on the world.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Zuckerberg would talk in detail about the dinner, which has not been reported before, or their long-running A.I. debate.The creation of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 the name for the supersmart technological breakthrough that takes A.I. to the next level and creates machines that not only perform narrow tasks that typically require human intelligence (like self-driving cars) but can actually outthink humans \u2014 still feels like science fiction. But the fight over the future of A.I. has spread across the tech industry.Artificial intelligence research has enormous potential and enormous implications, both as an economic engine and a source of military superiority. The Chinese government has said it is willing to spend billions in the coming years to make the country the world\u2019s leader in A.I., while the Pentagon is aggressively courting the tech industry for help. A new breed of autonomous weapons can\u2019t be far away.\u201cYou can now talk about the risks of A.I. without seeming like you are lost in science fiction,\u201d said Allan Dafoe, a director of the governance of A.I. program at the Future of Humanity Institute, a research center at the University of Oxford that explores the risks and opportunities of advanced technology.In April, Mr. Zuckerberg spent two days answering questions from members of Congress about data privacy and Facebook\u2019s role in the spread of misinformation before the 2016 election. He faced a similar grilling in Europe last month.Facebook\u2019s recognition that it was slow to understand what was going on has led to a rare moment of self-reflection in an industry that has long believed it is making the world a better place, whether the world likes it or not.Even such influential figures as the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the late Stephen Hawking have expressed concern about creating machines that are more intelligent than we are. Even though superintelligence seems decades away, they and others have said, shouldn\u2019t we consider the consequences before it\u2019s too late?\u201cThe kind of systems we are creating are very powerful,\u201d said Bart Selman, a Cornell University computer science professor and former Bell Labs researcher. \u201cAnd we cannot understand their impact.\u201dPacific Grove is a tiny town on the central coast of California. A group of geneticists gathered there, in the winter of 1975 to discuss whether their work \u2014 gene editing \u2014 would end up harming the world. In January 2017, the A.I. community held a similar discussion in the beachside grove.The heavy hitters of A.I. were in the room \u2014 among them Mr. LeCun, the Facebook A.I. lab boss who was at the dinner in Palo Alto, and who had helped develop a neural network, one of the most important tools in artificial intelligence today. Also in attendance was Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book, \u201cSuperintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\u201d had an outsized \u2014 some would argue fear-mongering \u2014 effect on the A.I. discussion; Oren Etzioni, a former computer science professor at the University of Washington who had taken over the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle; and Demis Hassabis, who heads DeepMind, an influential Google-owned A.I. research lab in London.And so was Mr. Musk, who in 2015 had donated $10 million to the Cambridge, Mass., institute. That same year, he also helped create an independent artificial intelligence lab, OpenAI, with an explicit goal: create superintelligence with safeguards meant to ensure it won\u2019t get out of control. It was a message that clearly aligned him with Mr. Bostrom.On the second day of the retreat, Mr. Musk took part in a nine-person panel dedicated to the superintelligence question. Each panelist was asked if superintelligence was possible. As they passed the microphone down the line, each said \u201cYes,\u201d until the microphone reached Mr. Musk. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. The small auditorium rippled with knowing laughter. Everyone understood that Mr. Musk thought superintelligence was not only possible, but very dangerous.Mr. Musk later added: \u201cWe are headed toward either superintelligence or civilization ending.\u201dWarnings about the risks of artificial intelligence have been around for years, of course. But few of those Cassandras have the tech cred of Mr. Musk. Few, if any, have spent as much time and money on it. And perhaps none has had as complicated a history with the technology.Just a few weeks after Mr. Musk talked about his A.I. concerns at the dinner in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s house, Mr. Musk phoned Mr. LeCun, asking for the names of top A.I. researchers who could work on his self-driving car project at Tesla. (That autonomous technology was in use at the time of two fatal Tesla car crashes, one in Florida in May 2016 and the other in March of this year.)During a recent Tesla earnings call, Mr. Musk, who has struggled with questions about his company\u2019s financial losses and concerns about the quality of its vehicles, chastised the news media for not focusing on the deaths that autonomous technology could prevent \u2014 a remarkable stance from someone who has repeatedly warned the world that A.I. is a danger to humanity.There is a saying in Silicon Valley: We overestimate what can be done in three years and underestimate what can be done in 10.On Jan. 27, 2016, Google\u2019s DeepMind lab unveiled a machine that could beat a professional player at the ancient board game Go. In a match played a few months earlier, the machine, called AlphaGo, had defeated the European champion Fan Hui \u2014 five games to none.Even top A.I. researchers had assumed it would be another decade before a machine could solve the game. Go is complex \u2014 there are more possible board positions than atoms in the universe \u2014 and the best players win not with sheer calculation, but through intuition. Two weeks before AlphaGo was revealed, Mr. LeCun said the existence of such a machine was unlikely.A few months later, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, the best Go player of the last decade. The machine made moves that baffled human experts but ultimately led to victory.Many researchers, including the leaders of DeepMind and OpenAI, believe the kind of self-learning technology that underpins AlphaGo provided a path to \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d And they believe progress in this area will significantly accelerate in the coming years.It\u2019s the kind of unpredictability that raise grave concerns about the rise of A.I., including superintelligence.But the deep opposition to these concerns was on display in March at an exclusive conference organized by Amazon and Mr. Bezos in Palm Springs.One evening, Rodney Brooks, a roboticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, debated the potential dangers of A.I. with the neuroscientist, philosopher and podcaster Sam Harris, a prominent voice of caution on the issue. The debate got personal, according to a recording obtained by The Times.Mr. Harris warned that because the world was in an arms race toward A.I., researchers may not have the time needed to ensure superintelligence is built in a safe way.\u201cThis is something you have made up,\u201d Mr. Brooks responded. He implied that Mr. Harris\u2019s argument was based on unscientific reasoning. It couldn\u2019t be proven right or wrong \u2014 a real insult among scientists.\u201cI would take this personally, if it actually made sense.\u201d Mr. Harris said.A moderator finally ended the tussle and asked for questions from the audience. Mr. Etzioni, the head of the Allen Institute, took the microphone. \u201cI am not going to grandstand,\u201d he said. But urged on by Mr. Brooks, he walked onto the stage and laid into Mr. Harris for three minutes, saying that today\u2019s A.I. systems are so limited, spending so much time worrying about superintelligence just doesn\u2019t make sense.The people who take Mr. Musk\u2019s side are philosophers, social scientists, writers \u2014 not the researchers who are working on A.I., he said. Among A.I. scientists, the notion that we should start worrying about superintelligence is \u201cvery much a fringe argument.\u201dPanicking about A.I. now, so early in its development, could threaten the many benefits that come from things like self-driving cars and A.I. health care, he said.\u201cWith A.I. especially, I\u2019m really optimistic,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cPeople who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios \u2014 I just, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201dIn other words: You\u2019re getting ahead of reality, Elon. Relax.\u201cThis is going to be a very central question for how we think about A.I. systems over the next decade and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, a lot of our A.I. systems make decisions in ways that people don\u2019t really understand.\u201dMr. Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind, still thinks Mr. Musk\u2019s views are extreme. But he said the same about the views of Mr. Zuckerberg. The threat is not here, he said. Not yet. But Facebook\u2019s problems are a warning.\u201cWe need to use the downtime, when things are calm, to prepare for when things get serious in the decades to come,\u201d said Mr. Hassabis. \u201cThe time we have now is valuable, and we need to make use of it.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Howard Schultz to Step Down as Starbucks Executive Chairman", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookMr. Schultz\u2019s decision to retire, a plan he said he privately outlined to the board a year ago, will most likely stoke speculation that he is considering a run for president in 2020. He is frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for the Democratic Party and has become increasingly vocal on political issues, including criticizing President Trump last year as \u201ca president that is creating episodic chaos every day.\u201dWhile Mr. Schultz, 64, typically bats away speculation about his political ambitions with an eye roll or a pithy answer, on Monday he acknowledged for the first time that it is something he may consider.\u201cI want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines,\u201d he told The New York Times. \u201cFor some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201d\u201cOne of the things I want to do in my next chapter is to figure out if there is a role I can play in giving back,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what that means yet.\u201dAsked directly if he was considering running for president, he said: \u201cI intend to think about a range of options, and that could include public service. But I\u2019m a long way from making any decisions about the future.\u201dThe possibility that Mr. Schultz, who has spent three decades leading Starbucks, could run for president has become far more realistic with the election of Mr. Trump, a real estate developer and reality-television star before his political career.Under Mr. Schultz\u2019s leadership, Starbucks has waded into debates over social issues such as gay rights, race relations, veterans\u2019 rights, gun violence and student debt. Mr. Schultz was an early champion of the idea of a corporate executive as a moral leader as he sought to achieve what he described as \u201cthe fragile balance between profit and conscience.\u201dStill, Mr. Schultz cautioned against reading too much into his decision to leave Starbucks. \u201cI want to be of service to our country, but that doesn\u2019t mean I need to run for public office to accomplish that,\u201d he said.He stepped away from the chief executive role at Starbucks last April, handing the reins to Kevin Johnson. It was the second time that Mr. Schultz had made that move, having given up the role in 2000 to become chairman, only to return to the chief executive position eight years later.His latest departure, however, is a greater separation than before. Myron E. Ullman, the former chairman of J. C. Penney, will become Starbucks\u2019s new chairman, and Mr. Schultz will be given an honorary title of chairman emeritus.Mr. Schultz said he planned to work on his family foundation and write a book about \u201csocial impact work and the efforts to redefine the role and responsibility of a public company.\u201dBill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, whose father was the lawyer who helped Mr. Schultz buy Starbucks in 1987, said, \u201cHoward has built an amazing organization in Starbucks, and it\u2019s exciting to consider what he might accomplish philanthropically.\u201dOn Monday, just hours before Mr. Schultz planned to send a letter to the company\u2019s 350,000 employees around the world announcing his decision, he visited Starbucks\u2019s first store at Pike Place Market for the last time as its leader.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for almost 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking my green apron off is hard. It is emotional. More emotional than I thought it would be.\u201d\u201cI told myself a long time ago that if I was ever going to explore a second act, I couldn\u2019t do it while still at the company,\u201d he added.Mr. Schultz\u2019s legacy as an entrepreneur will be defined as much for his vision to create a global coffee chain as for his progressive approach to running the company \u2014 or, as he has often said, \u201cto build the company my father never got to work for.\u201dMr. Schultz, who grew up in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, said watching his father, a World War II veteran who became a truck driver and later a taxi driver, struggle to make enough money to pay for basics had led him to offer complete health benefits for full- and part-time employees and their domestic partners, a first for such a chain. He later provided stock options for part-time workers and offered to cover college tuition for students enrolled in online courses at Arizona State University.\u201cHoward proved that a company could be more successful and profitable by elevating humanity,\u201d said Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments and a Starbucks director who will become vice chairwoman when Mr. Schultz steps down.Under Mr. Schultz, the company\u2019s financial success has been immense. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Still, Mr. Schultz\u2019s progressive approach to management has not been without criticism. The company announced two weeks ago that it would let customers and non-customers alike use its restrooms following the incident in Philadelphia, and it was soon criticized by some as putting its store managers in increasingly complex and difficult situations that they may not be properly trained to handle.And Mr. Trump has criticized Starbucks as trying to be too politically correct, bashing the company for no longer selling Christmas-themed cups. \u201cMaybe we should boycott Starbucks?\u201d Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail.For Starbucks, Mr. Schultz\u2019s departure will most likely be seen \u2014 both internally and externally \u2014 as a new challenge. While Mr. Schultz had already handed over the chief executive title to Mr. Johnson, he largely remained the face of the company as he continued to champion the idea of Starbucks as \u201cthe third place\u201d \u2014 a meeting ground between home and work that he modeled from coffee bars in Italy after he took a trip there in 1983.Starbucks itself is transitioning in the United States from a fast-growing company to one that\u2019s more likely to rise and fall with the rest of the economy. Still, it is growing wildly in China, where it is planning to open as many as two new stores a day. It is one of the few American companies that operate in China without a local partner.Mr. Schultz, however, said his decision to leave now \u2014 even after the episode in Philadelphia \u2014 illustrated the complete confidence he had in Mr. Johnson, the company\u2019s top management and its board.\u201cThe timing was never going to be perfect,\u201d he said.At the original Pike Place Market store early Monday, with only a handful of customers looking on, Mr. Schultz leaned over to inscribe the wall next to an espresso bar he installed himself in 1987: \u201cThis is where it all began. My dream to build a company that fosters respect and dignity and create a place where we can all come together over a cup of coffee. Onward with love.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated the year that Howard Schultz said President Trump created \u201cepisodic chaos.\u201d He made the statement last year, not this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Snapchat Makes Mini Movies in Augmented Reality", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA.R. may change entertainment as we know it. For Snapchat, the revolution starts with 15-second cartoons.LOS ANGELES \u2014 On a cool, sunny day in April, a short Frisbee toss from Venice Beach, a team of seven animators sat around a conference table, workshopping a storyboard from an unusual cartoon series. In the storyboard \u2014 rudimentary, comic-striplike panels tracing the arc of a scene \u2014 a barefoot man in rolled-up jeans stands at the edge of a bed of flaming hot coals. The man gathers his nerve, walks across the coals without incident and does a little celebratory dance. But his celebration is premature; in a plot twist in the final frame, his feet burst into flames.Some of the notes in the room weren\u2019t far from what you\u2019d expect in any introductory art class. But other feedback was more peculiar. In lieu of a setting for the story, the animators discussed only how they could \u201cindicate an environment,\u201d perhaps using sand or grass. Later, there was a curious debate about whether or not the character \u2014 otherwise recognizable as a human male \u2014 had any toes. Everyone agreed that they didn\u2019t know for certain. The equivalent of blockbusters, which will rely on special headsets like Magic Leap\u2019s Lightwear and Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens, are in development. And Facebook (which owns the virtual reality company Oculus), Apple and Google have all moved in the last year to make it easier for third-party developers to create new kinds of A.R. experiences for mobile phones. In late 2016, the Libermans\u2019 unique background caught the attention of executives at Snap, which, one year earlier, had demonstrated A.R.\u2019s potential as a creative platform with the rollout of animated overlays on selfies. The company jointly hired the foursome to develop animated A.R. characters based on Bitmoji. \u201cThey\u2019d been there and done that,\u201d said Eitan Pilipski, vice president of camera platform at Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company. \u201cThere was an amazing opportunity to take their creative thinking and put it in the hands of our users.\u201dSharing an office with three of your siblings could be a recipe for disaster, but it seems to have the opposite effect on the Libermans. In Venice Beach, they were like different limbs of the same chestnut-haired, fair-skinned organism, finishing one another\u2019s sentences when not cracking up at inside jokes. The Libermans shared a house for a time when they moved to Los Angeles, too, then spread out to their current arrangement in three apartments on the same street. \u201cBefore college we were together constantly, and afterward it\u2019s been the same,\u201d said David, technology lead, 34.\u201cIt has the feel of being a little under the radar but on the cutting edge,\u201d she said. She also pinpointed something else that might explain Snapchat\u2019s appeal. \u201cA Pixar movie takes five years to make,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an artist, that\u2019s two films in a decade, whereas at a place like Snapchat you can create a lot more volume.\u201dEach of the Libermans handles different responsibilities, which Anna, production lead, 36, said were based on their individual personalities: \u201cDaniil is very creative and helps us to write jokes. Maria is verbal and good at understanding story structure. I\u2019m very good at talking to people and getting them committed to specific dates and times. And David is very technical and has a strong engineering background.\u201dIn the animation stage, the animators aim to \u201csell\u201d the idea of the story, which should be easily \u201cread\u201d by the viewer without the benefit of dialogue (recording multiple languages and voice styles would be too resource intensive). The animators often film themselves role-playing as the character, or pull reference videos from YouTube, in order to realistically portray body movement.Because 3D Bitmoji episodes are designed to be sent between friends, they aren\u2019t just entertainment \u2014 they\u2019re custom memes, conveying the sender\u2019s mood or status. The most successful tend to be those that capture a common experience or sentiment, sometimes indirectly. Anna described \u201cHot Coals\u201d as a universal story about facing your fears, leavened with the twist at the end (what Snap\u2019s animators call a \u201cbonus\u201d) when the character catches fire. That made Maria recall a sort of spiritual precursor, an earlier animation involving a pregnant pause at the top of a diving board. One user\u2019s caption: \u201cMe getting into a new relationship.\u201dWhen the technology is sufficiently mature, experts expect that most forms of entertainment will be reimagined for augmented reality. Mr. Lelyveld, of the Entertainment Technology Center, predicted a surge in sophisticated narrative A.R. experiences in 18 to 24 months, when glasses allowing users to circumnavigate fixed virtual objects in physical space are projected to be widely available. Hands-free A.R. (which may one day rely on contact lenses or cortical implants) could unleash the potential for stories that blur the line between fiction and lived experience. They may share elements with linear film and television, or task-oriented video games. \u201cYou could be watching a sitcom like \u2018Friends,\u2019 but instead of the \u2018Friends\u2019 kitchen table, the characters are all sitting around your kitchen table,\u201d Ms. Burnett said. But the medium\u2019s capacity for contextual awareness allows for hybrid forms unlike any that exist today.Experts cautioned that it was still too soon to say what shape they may ultimately take. \u201cOur language has always been 2D, and if your language can\u2019t express it, you can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d Mr. Lelyveld said. But Hollywood studios are already girding themselves for the new reality. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer science fiction,\u201d said Ms. Papagiannis, the A.R. researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dAfter making it through the gantlet of animation review, \u201cHot Coals\u201d was ready for the final stage of its production cycle before testing and publication: visual effects. The Libermans\u2019 VFX artists added dancing flames, floating embers and, for the climactic moment when the character catches fire, pillars of white smoke. \u201cThe characters are very cartoony, but because they inhabit a real-world environment, atmospheric elements need to be quite realistic in order to bridge the gap,\u201d Anna said.While Mr. Pilipski declined to outline the course of that journey, Snapchat recently rolled out an in-app product, called Snappables, which allows users to play simple A.R. games (How many digital strawberries can you catch in your mouth in 10 seconds?) and invite friends to join. The company also makes sunglasses with embedded cameras, called Spectacles, though they\u2019re not currently A.R. capable.One path Snap isn\u2019t likely to pursue is making 3D Bitmoji more closely resemble their flesh-and-blood analogues. Asked if the company would pivot to lifelike virtual avatars as technology advances, the Bitstrips chief executive, Ba Blackstock, a former cartoonist who joined Snap after the acquisition, balked.All animations courtesy of Snapchat.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the author of \u201cAugmented Human.\" She is Helen Papagiannis, not Pappagiannis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is There a Smarter Path to Artificial Intelligence? Some Experts Hope So", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past five years, the hottest thing in artificial intelligence has been a branch known as deep learning. The grandly named statistical technique, put simply, gives computers a way to learn by processing vast amounts of data. Thanks to deep learning, computers can easily identify faces and recognize spoken words, making other forms of humanlike intelligence suddenly seem within reach.Companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft have poured money into deep learning. Start-ups pursuing everything from cancer cures to back-office automation trumpet their deep learning expertise. And the technology\u2019s perception and pattern-matching abilities are being applied to improve progress in fields such as drug discovery and self-driving cars.But now some scientists are asking whether deep learning is really so deep after all.In recent conversations, online comments and a few lengthy essays, a growing number of A.I. experts are warning that the infatuation with deep learning may well breed myopia and overinvestment now \u2014 and disillusionment later.The danger, some experts warn, is that A.I. will run into a technical wall and eventually face a popular backlash \u2014 a familiar pattern in artificial intelligence since that term was coined in the 1950s. With deep learning in particular, researchers said, the concerns are being fueled by the technology\u2019s limits.Deep learning algorithms train on a batch of related data \u2014 like pictures of human faces \u2014 and are then fed more and more data, which steadily improve the software\u2019s pattern-matching accuracy. Although the technique has spawned successes, the results are largely confined to fields where those huge data sets are available and the tasks are well defined, like labeling images or translating speech to text.The technology struggles in the more open terrains of intelligence \u2014 that is, meaning, reasoning and common-sense knowledge. While deep learning software can instantly identify millions of words, it has no understanding of a concept like \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201cdemocracy\u201d or \u201cmeddling.\u201dResearchers have shown that deep learning can be easily fooled. Scramble a relative handful of pixels, and the technology can mistake a turtle for a rifle or a parking sign for a refrigerator.While that program and other efforts vary, their common goal is a broader and more flexible intelligence than deep learning. And they are typically far less data hungry. They often use deep learning as one ingredient among others in their recipe.Kyndi has been able to use very little training data to automate the generation of facts, concepts and inferences, said Ryan Welsh, the start-up\u2019s chief executive.The Kyndi system, he said, can train on 10 to 30 scientific documents of 10 to 50 pages each. Once trained, Kyndi\u2019s software can identify concepts and not just words.In work for three large government agencies that it declined to disclose, Kyndi has been asking its system to answer this typical question: Has a technology been \u201cdemonstrated in a laboratory setting\u201d? The Kyndi program, Mr. Welsh said, can accurately infer the answer, even when that phrase does not appear in a document.And Kyndi\u2019s reading and scoring software is fast. A human analyst, Mr. Welsh said, might take two hours on average to read a lengthy scientific document, and perhaps read 1,000 in a year. Kyndi\u2019s technology can read those 1,000 documents in seven hours, he said.Kyndi serves as a tireless digital assistant, identifying the documents and passages that require human judgment. \u201cThe goal is increasing the productivity of the human analysts,\u201d Mr. Welsh said.Kyndi and others are betting that the time is finally right to take on some of the more daunting challenges in A.I. That echoes the trajectory of deep learning, which made little progress for decades before the recent explosion of digital data and ever-faster computers fueled leaps in performance of its so-called neural networks. Those networks are digital layers loosely analogous to biological neurons. The \u201cdeep\u201d refers to many layers.Vicarious, whose investors include Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, is a prominent example of the entrepreneurial pursuit of new paths in A.I.The Pentagon\u2019s research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, has proposed a program to seed university research and provide a noncommercial network for sharing ideas on technology to emulate human common-sense reasoning, where deep learning falls short. If approved, the program, Machine Common Sense, would start this fall and most likely run for five years, with total funding of about $60 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Split to the Nanosecond Is Precisely What Wall Street Wants", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Computer scientists at Stanford University and Google have created technology that can track time down to 100 billionths of a second. It could be just what Wall Street is looking for.For an exchange like Nasdaq, such refinement is essential to accurately order the millions of stock trades that are placed on their computer systems every second.Ultimately, this is about money. With stock trading now dominated by computers that make buying and selling decisions and execute them with blazing speed, keeping that order also means protecting profits. So-called high frequency trading firms place trades in a fraction of a second, sometimes in a bet that they can move faster than bigger competitors.The pressure to manage these high-speed trades grows when the stock market becomes more volatile, as it has been in recent months, in part to prevent the fastest traders from taking unfair advantage of slower firms. High frequency traders typically account for more than half of daily stock trading volume in the United States, according to data from the Tabb Group.\u201cThe financial industry has easily become the most obsessed with time,\u201d said Balaji Prabhakar, a Stanford University electrical engineer who is one of the designers of the new synchronization system.Because the orders are placed from locations around the world, they frequently arrive at the exchange\u2019s computers out of sequence. The new system allows each computer to time stamp an order when it takes place.As a result, the trades can be sorted and executed in correct sequence. In a networked marketplace, this precision is necessary not only to prevent illicit trading on advance information known as \u201cfront-running,\u201d but also to ensure the fair placement of orders.The importance of technical advances in measuring time was underscored by European regulations that went into effect in January and that require financial institutions to synchronize time-stamped trades with microsecond accuracy.\u201cThere are tickets needed, housing, people will need transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of an electronic market almost like a massive flea market hosted by Nasdaq software.\u201dTo go from trading equities to managing all sorts of financial transactions will require more than an order of magnitude speedup in the company\u2019s networks of computers. It will be possible only if all of the exchange\u2019s computers agree on time with nanosecond accuracy.A generation ago, computing usually took place in a single mainframe or personal computer. Now it is routinely spread across thousands of independent processors in machines that can be separated by a few feet or entire continents.Chip designers have long struggled to maintain the precise timing needed to order mathematical operations inside individual computing chips. And synchronizing these vast ensembles of them has become the limiting factor in the speed and processing power of what Google describes as \u201cplanetary-scale\u201d computers.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling,\u201d said Peter Hochschild, a Google software engineer who specializes in the challenges associated with spreading software and data across networked computers. \u201cInside a processor, an enormous amount of stuff happens in a billionth of a second.\u201dA billionth of a second is roughly the time it takes light to travel one foot. It has long been viewed as a crucial measure in computing. In the 1960s, the computing pioneer Grace Murray Hopper would hand out 11.8-inch lengths of wire to illustrate how designing smaller electronic parts would create faster computers.Distance has become even more significant as software has begun to escape the boundaries of individual computers and make its way into the cloud \u2014 the web of giant computer data centers that have come to blanket the planet.Because software and data are no longer in the same place, correctly calculating the order of the events that may be separated by feet or miles has become the dominant factor in the speed with which data can be processed.\u201cSo much of our expectation about computing being correct depends essentially on knowing this order,\u201d said Krishna Palem, a theoretical computer scientist at Rice University.In the world of cloud computing, entire databases are scattered among different computers and data centers.Huygens, named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens, who invented the pendulum clock in 1656, uses so-called machine-learning techniques to synchronize a network of computers to within 100 billionths of a second. In contrast, the N.T.P. standard can synchronize computers no more accurately than a millisecond, or one thousandth of a second.To ensure that buyers and sellers are treated fairly, Nasdaq has for decades looked for ways to ensure that trades are processed in the order they are placed.While building a network for Nasdaq in the 1990s, Brian Reid, a computer scientist at Digital Equipment Corporation, experimented by coiling large rolls of cables of different lengths in a Massachusetts warehouse in order to insert tiny delays in the time it took data to travel in a network to make sure that messages were delivered fairly. He then employed timing information from satellites to synchronize clocks at different locations.Google would later use this method to synchronize computers based on GPS data and atomic clocks to make sure that their database system could correctly order transactions. But since the system requires super-accurate clocks and satellite receivers, it is more costly than the software-based Huygens approach.Mr. Reid built his original system in an era when the Securities and Exchange Commission required that all stock sales be entered by humans.\u201cFive millisecond accuracy in clock synchronization pleased everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took much longer than five milliseconds to press the \u2018Enter\u2019 key on the big green terminals that people used.\u201dAdvertisement"}

DeepFarhad isn\u2019t quite ready yet, but our engineers are confident that it will attain Farhad-level insights fairly soon.But while you\u2019re still here in human form, let\u2019s talk about the year\u2019s biggest overarching tech narrative: the \u201ctechlash\u201d against companies like Facebook and Google over issues like privacy, data protection and antitrust concerns. As someone who has been mercifully spared from every twist and turn of the techlash, does it feel like a lot has changed since you left?When I left, Facebook was under the gun, Amazon was getting hit by President Trump, and Apple and Google were trying to stand clear of the fallout. Three months later, Facebook is still under the gun, the president still regards Amazon as a pariah, and Apple and Google still would very much like to be excluded from these narratives.I\u2019m not saying I was expecting wholesale structural change among entrenched businesses over the course of a season. But, still: For all the fireworks in Washington, there\u2019s been little movement on regulation or legislation to curb some of the excesses in tech. I don\u2019t see much of an advance toward stricter antitrust scrutiny of the large tech firms. And their most recent earnings reports show they\u2019re all going gangbusters; Americans may harbor growing worries about the power of tech companies, but not enough to make us quit them.Which isn\u2019t to say the techlash isn\u2019t real, just that change will come slowly. We\u2019re all living in a world where most communication and commerce is ruled by a handful of nearly unregulated oligopolies. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t change quickly, I guess.Techlash indeed!And then there was the bit about how we\u2019re all staring at our phones too much. The tech industry has been consumed recently by new worries over \u201ctech addiction,\u201d and both Facebook and Google recently announced plans to tackle digital \u201cwell-being.\u201d Now Apple\u2019s jumping in, too. In the next version of iOS, your phone will give you detailed stats about how often you use your phone and what you do on it, and it will even let you block yourself and your children from using certain apps.It seems slightly opportunistic to kick a social network while it\u2019s down, but Apple\u2019s aggressive criticism also highlights the real and growing philosophical differences between the two companies. Facebook is an advertising-supported communications conglomerate aimed at the masses, and dead set on remaining free so that all seven billion humans on Earth can eventually be connected (and monetized) through its platform. Apple is predominantly a high-end hardware business that caters to an increasingly privacy-conscious consumer base, and thinks that security will be a differentiating factor when people choose which smartphones, tablets and laptops to buy.Maybe it was inevitable that these two giants would clash, but to a tech writer who lives for drama, it\u2019s still interesting to watch.Anyway, that\u2019s all for now.

{"Headline": "New Goldman Sachs Fund Will Track Paul Tudor Jones\u2019s Feel-Good Companies", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe spiritual guru Deepak Chopra had just finished teaching a class about ethics in business at Columbia Business School when he called the billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones II in the fall of 2012.\u201c\u2018Listen, one of my students has got a really good idea,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jones said Mr. Chopra had told him. The student had posed two questions: \u201cWhy can\u2019t companies be an instrument for goodness? Why can\u2019t companies focus their capital \u2014 human and financial \u2014 on being a change agent for societal betterment, a change agent for justness?\u201dUp until now, Mr. Jones\u2019s measure of corporate America was simply a list of companies, a ranking that he hoped would encourage chief executives to think more about doing right by society.But now it is about to become a financial product.On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs, using Mr. Jones\u2019s metrics, will introduce a new exchange-traded fund as part of series of social impact efforts by the firm.The fund is a feel-good selection of Russell 1000 companies, tracking the top 50 percent of those in each industry based on Just Capital\u2019s publicly available model, which scores businesses using a complex formula related to workers, customers, products, environment, jobs, communities and management. Only 6 percent of the calculation of the index relates to how well a company provides investor return.Whether the formula is a winning one for investors is a bit of an open question. The fund would have outperformed the Russell 1000 by 3.47 percent over the past two years. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is there is no way to test the formula any further back, and each year, the index changes based on shifts in the polling. If Americans become more concerned about job creation and less concerned about worker pay, different companies could be included.So it\u2019s a bit of a guess how well Just Capital\u2019s index will perform over the long term, a point Mr. Jones acknowledges up front.\u201cI think it outperforms\u201d similar indexes, he said. But he quickly warned that \u201cwhen we get in a bear market, this thing is going down 95 percent of what the other ones are, too.\u201d He added: \u201cLet\u2019s just all be honest about that. We are talking about relative outperformance.\u201dAccording to Just Capital, the companies in the fund outperformed the remainder of the Russell 1000 in a number of important, socially conscious ways: They paid 71 percent less in fines for consumer sales-terms violations and 94 percent less in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission fines, produced 45 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of revenue, and created American jobs at a 20 percent greater rate. Investors will pay a 0.2 percent fee, which is about half the price of most other E.S.G.-oriented funds.But Goldman Sachs and Mr. Jones aren\u2019t selling the fund as a quick-buck way for day traders to beat the stock market.Instead, it is being sold as a curated solution at a time when pension funds and other institutional investors are looking to shift their investments into socially responsible funds.\u201cWe are seeing clients think about this product in different ways,\u201d said John Goldstein, a managing director within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \u201cSome look to it as value-aligned market exposure, while others see a set of drivers of performance in a changing world.\u201dWhether social impact investing will turn out to be the most profitable way to invest has become one of the biggest questions within the investment world.Mr. Jones came to the same conclusion several years ago. He said he had been taken aback when he realized how a company\u2019s stock performance correlated with how responsibly it behaved.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. The results were sufficiently profound to make him rethink his own business.\u201cI\u2019ve got to think about, even in my own business, how I am treating my employees, how we\u2019re running and operating this business,\u201d Mr. Jones said. (Among other changes, he said, he and his management team recently tripled the amount of profits his investment fund pays out to charity.)One major distinction between the new fund and the bevy of other socially responsible funds that have emerged is that it does not exclude any company based on a moral argument, except for tobacco. So the fund can include coal companies, for example, but only those that lead the industry based on his metrics.No matter their industry, he wants executives and board members to be thinking: \u201cWhat\u2019s my environmental footprint relative to every one else in my field? Where are my best business practices relative to my competitor? Am I doing as good a job as I possibly can, or is there someone doing better?\u201dWhile it may be in vogue to talk about socially responsible investments, until they prove they can perform better over a significant period of time, it will be hard for even the most virtuous investors to plow significant sums into them.For now, Mr. Jones is happy to get the conversation started.\u201cThe corporate mission as practiced today was designed in 1970 by Milton Friedman, when he famously said the social responsibility of the corporation is to improve its profits,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cThe biggest objective I think for those of us at Just is to begin the debate.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated an aspect of a new exchange-traded fund that is based on Just Capital\u2019s metrics. The fund will not include tobacco companies, even if they lead their industry according to the metrics.An earlier version of this column misquoted a comment by Paul Tudor Jones II. He said \u201cThe social responsibility of the corporation is to improve its profits,\u201d not its products. The column also referred imprecisely to Goldman Sachs\u2019s creation of the new fund. The fund is part of a broader series of social impact efforts by the firm, not its first foray into social impact investing.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s Time to Give It a Try.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixDo you ever feel that the web is breaking?When shopping online for a toaster oven, you can expect an ad for that oven to stalk you from site to site. If you have just a few web browser tabs open, your laptop battery drains rapidly. And don\u2019t get me started on those videos that automatically play when you\u2019re scrolling through a webpage.The web has reached a new low. It has become an annoying, often toxic and occasionally unsafe place to hang out. More important, it has become an unfair trade: You give up your privacy online, and what you get in return are somewhat convenient services and hyper-targeted ads.Mozilla recently hit the reset button on Firefox. About two years ago, six Mozilla employees were huddled around a bonfire one night in Santa Cruz, Calif., when they began discussing the state of web browsers. Eventually, they concluded there was a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the web.\u201cIf they don\u2019t trust the web, they won\u2019t use the web,\u201d Mark Mayo, Mozilla\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. \u201cThat just felt to us like that actually might be the direction we\u2019re going. And so we started to think about tools and architectures and different approaches.\u201dMost notably, Firefox now offers privacy tools, like a built-in feature for blocking ad trackers and a \u201ccontainer\u201d that can be installed to prevent Facebook from monitoring your activities across the web. Most other browsers don\u2019t include those features.After testing Firefox for the last three months, I found it to be on a par with Chrome in most categories. In the end, Firefox\u2019s thoughtful privacy features persuaded me to make the switch and make it my primary browser.Here\u2019s why you should consider it, too.Firefox especially stood out for some privacy features that are baked into the browser. Inside the privacy settings, you can turn on tracking protection, which blocks online trackers from collecting your browser data across multiple websites. With Chrome, you can install a third-party extension to block trackers \u2014 but the fewer add-ons you have to tack onto your browser, the better.Security experts applauded Mozilla for stepping up its efforts on privacy.\u201cFirefox does seem to have positioned itself as the privacy-friendly browser, and they have been doing a fantastic job improving security as well,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights nonprofit. \u201cOn the other hand, Google is fundamentally an advertising company, so it\u2019s unlikely that they will ever have a business interest in making Chrome more privacy friendly.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t have privacy without security on the web,\u201d said Parisa Tabriz, a director of engineering for Google who specializes in security.In fact, both Chrome and Firefox have tough security. Both include sandboxing, which isolates processes of the browser so a harmful website doesn\u2019t infect other parts of your machine. So if you loaded a website with malicious code, it would be contained within the webpage so it couldn\u2019t infect your files, webcam and microphone.Google said there was one thing it could do better on: the inclusion of privacy settings to block tracking technology, similar to the tools that Firefox includes.\u201cI think that\u2019s something that we can improve on,\u201d Ms. Tabriz said. \u201cFirefox has some settings that we\u2019re also exploring.\u201dWhich browser is faster?Mozilla\u2019s promise that Firefox consumes less computer memory raises hopes that it should also use less battery life. Yet in my tests on a laptop running a script that automatically reloaded the top 10 news sites, Firefox lasted only a few minutes longer than Chrome before the battery was depleted.

{"Headline": "Grilling Turns Back to an Ancient Fuel: Wood", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world\u2019s oldest cooking method has become one of its newest culinary quests.While there\u2019s nothing novel about wood-burning grills in restaurants (Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters have used them for decades), what is new is the zeal of the chefs using them, the variety of equipment now available, and the growing number of American home cooks who are forsaking gas and charcoal to master the ancient art of grilling over a wood fire in their backyards.One such convert is Marco Birch, a Manhattan financier by day and ardent wood griller on weekends. \u201cWe discovered parrilla grilling during a bike trip to Argentina,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe sparks and flames grabbed our attention; the unique earthy smoke flavor of the meat sealed the deal.\u201dSo Mr. Birch bought a 48-inch NorthFork Ironworks parrilla (an Argentinian-style wood-burning grill) from Brendan McCarthy, a grill builder and fly-fishing guide in Greenport, N.Y.Mr. McCarthy had experienced his own wood-fire epiphany during an outing with the grill maestro Francis Mallmann, who has restaurants in South America, France and Miami. \u201cPropane has no flavor, and charcoal isn\u2019t much better,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cThe aroma and flavor of wood are in a league of their own.\u201dThat flavor comes from the high, dry heat of a wood fire (1,000 degrees or more), which caramelizes the proteins in meats and the plant sugars in fruits and vegetables. But wood-grilled foods get even more of their distinctive flavor and edge from the fragrant smoke.\u201cWood smoke contains more than a thousand flavor-producing compounds,\u201d said Nathan Myhrvold, the former Microsoft executive who has become an evangelist for modernist cooking. That list of chemicals includes creosol (associated with the smoky peat flavor of Scotch whisky), syringol (responsible for clovelike flavors), and vanillin (source of a vanilla-ish sweetness in smoke).By the time wood becomes charcoal, Dr. Myhrvold said, 99 percent of those compounds are lost. That\u2019s why a wood fire delivers so much more flavor than charcoal. \u201cAlmost any hardwood is good for grilling, but avoid evergreens, like spruce and pine, which put out a black sooty smoke that tastes like turpentine,\u201d he said.Wood grilling is very different from traditional barbecue, although both start with burning logs. In a barbecue pit, the food smokes at a low heat away from the fire for intervals measured in half-days. Grilling is a rapid process in which the food sizzles directly over the fire.Traditionally, people grilled with the wood that grew in their area. In much of North and South America and Europe, that means oak \u2014 a clean, hot-burning wood with a smoke that\u2019s robust enough to stand up to red meat, yet mild enough not to overpower poultry or seafood.Southerners burn hickory; Californians use almond wood; Pacific Northwesterners burn cherry and alder. Mesquite \u2014 the go-to wood in Hawaii, the American Southwest and northern Mexico \u2014 emits a strong-tasting smoke and pyrotechnic sparks that, depending on your level of pyromania, you\u2019ll find thrilling or disconcerting.Grill with a single wood, Mr. Franklin suggested: \u201cWhen you mix woods, you can\u2019t really pinpoint the flavor.\u201dThe cooking properties and smoke flavor vary subtly from wood to wood, but less than you might think. For Ben Eisendrath, the chief executive of Grillworks, the species matters less than using split, seasoned, appropriate-size logs \u2014 seasoned because dry wood burns more efficiently than green, split because the wood ignites more easily, and sized to fit in your grill, which means smaller than what you generally burn in your fireplace.Mr. Eisendrath recommends logs that are 10 to 12 inches long and two to three inches wide. He also recommends mixing lump charcoal with wood in a ratio of about 30 percent to 70 percent to produce a hotter, more even-burning fire.When it comes to lighting the fire, channel your inner Scout. Stack the wood log-cabin style with plenty of air space between logs. Light twisted newspaper and kindling in the center. Another popular method is to light natural lump charcoal in a chimney starter, then arrange the wood (smaller pieces first, then larger) atop the embers.Speaking of chimney starters, there is a stunningly simple way to grill over wood that requires little more than a common kettle grill. Fill your chimney not with charcoal, but hardwood chunks (oak, hickory, apple, cherry and such, the sort sold at hardware stores for smoking). Light the chimney as you would for charcoal: in 20 minutes, you\u2019ll be grilling over wood embers.Wood chunks burn faster than charcoal, so you\u2019ll need to replenish them often. Lighting a second chimney will give you more hot coals at the ready. (When wood-grilling in a kettle grill, never close the lid, or your food will become unbearably smoky.)The chief challenge in grilling over wood is heat control. To increase or decrease the heat on an Argentinian-style parrilla grill, like the Grillworks or NorthFork, simply raise or lower the grill grate with the flywheel.When wood grilling in a fixed-grate grill, like a kettle grill, build a tiered fire with embers piled thicker to one side or at the back of the firebox and spread more sparsely in the center, with an ember-free safety zone away from the coals. Control the heat by moving the food closer to or farther away from the fire. On a fixed-grate grill with a braseiro (an open metal basket for burning logs to embers), simply rake more or fewer coals under the food.Another way to boost the heat is to oxygenate the fire. Mr. Stone uses an ingenious tool called a Blow Poke, a long metal tube you blow through to direct air to a specific part of the fire. (It also comes with a claw at the end for raking the coals.) You\u2019ll look like you\u2019re playing trumpet to some deity of fire. Alternatively, ventilate the fire with a fan or a hair dryer.Remember this simple formula: more air, hotter fire; less air, cooler fire.Wood-burning grills are incredibly versatile. You can grill over flaming logs, the way you might roast marshmallows over a campfire. Or grill over glowing embers, much as you would over charcoal.Use a flame-forward fire for chicken breasts, fish fillets, thin steaks \u2014 foods that benefit from high heat and a pronounced smoke flavor. The ember method gives you a steadier, more predictable heat source, well suited to grilling bread, pizza, thick steaks and chops, and high-moisture vegetables.Most chefs use both techniques. Mr. Franklin slow-smokes bavette on a rack high above the fire, then sears it over embers. Mr. Schwartz does most of his grilling over embers, periodically adding fresh logs to the fire to maintain a steady stream of flavorful smoke. Ms. Robbins roasts potatoes in front of the fire for a soulful twist on baked potatoes, and often grills caveman-style \u2014 directly on the embers.\u201cA wood burning grill is such a simple piece of equipment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even after two years, we\u2019re still finding new ways to use it.\u201dWhichever fuel you use or method for controlling the heat, be prepared to take your time.\u201cThis is not like cooking on a conventional grill,\u201d Mr. Birch said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mesmerizing process and a communal ritual that takes the better part of the day.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

I do think that one of the things that happened in California demographically, was that the G.O.P. hitched its wagon so much to anti-immigrant sentiment in the 1990s that where they had a big inroad with the Latino population they very much lost that.\u201dThere were other parallels, he said. A loss of manufacturing jobs led to a sense of dislocation among the white working class. Rush Limbaugh began his career in Sacramento in the 1980s, just before conservative talk radio played a big role in immigrant bashing in the 1990s, similar to the role Fox News has played today in fanning anti-immigrant sentiment.But California\u2019s rise in the years since, Mr. Pastor says, offers at least some hope that American will overcome its own toxic political environment.\u201cThe serious discussion we have to have about California\u2019s future is not climate change versus no climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cNot about whether we will be a sanctuary state or not, but the nuances of this. Having a big symbolic battle about Trump, as interesting as it will be for the rest of the country, is quite a bit of a distraction from what the state itself needs to do, particularly in a gubernatorial campaign.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)If there is nothing in life better than carving open a perfectly ripe avocado \u2014 and truly, what could be better? \u2014 there is nothing more disappointing than discovering that one has gone bad.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Asteroids and Adversaries: Challenging What NASA Knows About Space Rocks", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "Two years ago, NASA dismissed and mocked an amateur\u2019s criticisms of its asteroids database. Now Nathan Myhrvold is back, and his papers have passed peer review.Supported byThousands of asteroids are passing through Earth\u2019s neighborhood all the time. Although the odds of a direct hit on the planet any time soon are slim, even a small asteroid the size of a house could explode with as much energy as an atomic bomb.So scientists at NASA are charged with scanning the skies for such dangerous space rocks. If one were on a collision course with our planet, information about how big it is and what it\u2019s made of would be essential for deflecting it, or calculating the destruction if it hits.For the last couple of years, Nathan P. Myhrvold, a former chief technologist at Microsoft with a physics doctorate from Princeton, has roiled the small, congenial community of asteroid scientists by saying they know less than they think about these near-Earth objects. He argues that a trove of data from NASA they rely on is flawed and unreliable.Since 2011, a NASA project known as Neowise has cataloged the sizes and reflectivity of 158,000 asteroids, and it claimed that its diameter estimates were often within 10 percent of the actual size. Dr. Myhrvold said the uncertainties were much greater, largely because NASA researchers were using data from a satellite designed for observing distant objects, not nearby asteroids. \u201cThe science is terrible,\u201d he said.Now his arguments have been published in Icarus, one of planetary science\u2019s most prestigious journals.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten people to agree I was right,\u201d Dr. Myhrvold said.\u201cThe Neowise team stands by its data and scientific findings that have been published in several peer-reviewed journal articles,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cNASA is confident the processes and analyses performed by the Neowise team are valid, as verified by independent researchers.\u201dIn an email, Edward L. Wright, a University of California, Los Angeles scientist who served as the principal investigator for the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, the mission that Neowise grew out of, disputed some technical aspects of Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s paper. He said one section about the error analysis was \u201ca waste of paper.\u201dHe did not respond to further emails.Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s findings pose a challenge to a proposed NASA asteroid-finding mission called Neocam, short for Near-Earth Object Camera, which would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars. A congressional committee that controls NASA\u2019s purse strings just included $10 million more in a budget bill for the development of Neocam.The same scientist, Amy Mainzer of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., is the principal investigator for both Neowise and Neocam. NASA said she was unavailable for comment.At least one scientist at NASA found merit in Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s pursuit. David Morrison, a planetary scientist at the space agency\u2019s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. said of the scientific issues raised in the papers: \u201cFor the most part, I think Myhrvold is correct.\u201d\u201cI do think it\u2019s valuable for someone, a smart outsider, to go in and analyze data that are important,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, who is not involved with Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s research or Neowise. \u201cThat has to help science. That cannot be a bad thing.\u201dThe squabble revolves around data collected by NASA\u2019s WISE spacecraft, which scanned the skies beginning in 2009, taking pictures of hundreds of millions of distant galaxies and stars.Asteroids were also whizzing through WISE\u2019s field of view, and the Neowise project was established to analyze them.By looking at heat radiated by asteroids, it is possible to estimate an asteroid\u2019s size and the reflectivity of its surface. The Neowise data is by the far the largest collection, and hundreds of scientific papers have cited those findings.When Dr. Myhrvold made his initial claims, the Neowise scientists made fun of a few errors like an equation that mixed up radius and diameter.Dr. Mainzer also said at the time, \u201cWe believe at this point it\u2019s best to allow the process of peer review \u2014 the foundation of the scientific process \u2014 to move forward.\u201dAmong them is the case of the copied numbers.The Neowise researchers\u2019 model was calibrated with diameters for about a hundred asteroids that have been measured by radar, visiting spacecraft or when an asteroid passed in front of a distant star.When the scientists reported their findings, they did not include the estimates produced by their models, which would have given a sense of how good the model is. Instead they included the earlier measurements.Other astronomers agreed that the Neowise scientists were not clear about what numbers they were reporting.\u201cThey did some kind of dumb things,\u201d said Alan W. Harris, a retired NASA asteroid expert who was one of the reviewers of Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s second paper.Dr. Myhrvold has accused the Neowise scientists of going into a NASA archive of planetary results, changing some of the copied numbers and deleting others without giving notice. \u201cThey went back and rewrote history,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it shows is even this far in, they\u2019re still lying. They haven\u2019t come clean.\u201dDr. Harris said he did not see nefarious behavior by the Neowise scientists, but agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s still weird.\u201dDr. Myhrvold also contends that Neowise set up arbitrary rules for deciding which data to keep and disregard and that they did not describe their methods in enough detail for other scientists to replicate.The tussle has spilled from scientific journals and conferences into contentious letters from lawyers. Dr. Myhrvold has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for information and algorithms that he said would be needed to properly check the Neowise findings.Dr. Myhrvold said NASA and Congress should put planning for the proposed Neocam spacecraft on hold, because it could suffer from the same shortfalls as Neowise. \u201cWhy does it get to avoid further scrutiny and just get money directly from Congress?\u201d he asked.He also said a ground-based observatory, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, already under construction, will accomplish much of Neocam\u2019s mission.In his email, Dr. Wright said Dr. Myhrvold had taken an \u201cadversarial approach.\u201d Dr. Myhrvold, in turn, noted Dr. Wright\u2019s earlier disparaging comments.This rancor perplexes other asteroid researchers.\u201cIt\u2019s a strange story,\u201d Dr. Morrison said. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like this in my field.\u201dThe editors of Icarus now anticipate a rebuttal by Dr. Mainzer after she initially passed on an invitation several months ago to write one.But the analysis was limited to asteroids with the most reliable long-wavelength infrared measurements by WISE, a tiny fraction of the 158,000 that Neowise had analyzed.In follow-up research, Dr. Myhrvold wants to show how the work of Neowise could be better done. He has started collaborating with Jean-Luc Margot, the chairman of the earth, planetary and space sciences department at U.C.L.A. and a colleague of Dr. Wright\u2019s. (Dr. Myhrvold has also given $350,000 to the university, his alma mater. The money will support graduate student research in Dr. Margot\u2019s department, although not necessarily on asteroids.)Dr. Margot said that in preliminary work, he and his students have already reproduced some of Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s results.Unlike Dr. Myhrvold, Dr. Margot said he has had productive conversations with Dr. Wright and others from Neowise. \u201cI have not detected any discomfort,\u201d Dr. Margot said. \u201cI start from the assumption that everyone wants the best out of the data.\u201dDr. Myhrvold thinks there are discoveries in the Neowise data, hidden in what was thrown away during the analysis. \u201cMaybe there are new classes of asteroids out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the only thing we\u2019re going to have for a long time. We ought to get it right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience.

{"Headline": "Facebook Gave Device Makers Deep Access to Data on Users and Friends", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "The company formed data-sharing partnerships with Apple, Samsung and dozens of other device makers, raising new concerns about its privacy protections.As Facebook sought to become the world\u2019s dominant social media service, it struck agreements allowing phone and other device makers access to vast amounts of its users\u2019 personal information.Facebook has reached data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers \u2014 including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung \u2014 over the last decade, starting before Facebook apps were widely available on smartphones, company officials said. The deals allowed Facebook to expand its reach and let device makers offer customers popular features of the social network, such as messaging, \u201clike\u201d buttons and address books.But the partnerships, whose scope has not previously been reported, raise concerns about the company\u2019s privacy protections and compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing, The New York Times found.[Here\u2019s what we know about Facebook\u2019s partnerships with device makers.]In the furor that followed, Facebook\u2019s leaders said that the kind of access exploited by Cambridge in 2014 was cut off by the next year, when Facebook prohibited developers from collecting information from users\u2019 friends. But the company officials did not disclose that Facebook had exempted the makers of cellphones, tablets and other hardware from such restrictions.In interviews, Facebook officials defended the data sharing as consistent with its privacy policies, the F.T.C. agreement and pledges to users. They said its partnerships were governed by contracts that strictly limited use of the data, including any stored on partners\u2019 servers. The officials added that they knew of no cases where the information had been misused.The company views its device partners as extensions of Facebook, serving its more than two billion users, the officials said.\u201cThese partnerships work very differently from the way in which app developers use our platform,\u201d said Ime Archibong, a Facebook vice president. Unlike developers that provide games and services to Facebook users, the device partners can use Facebook data only to provide versions of \u201cthe Facebook experience,\u201d the officials said.Some device partners can retrieve Facebook users\u2019 relationship status, religion, political leaning and upcoming events, among other data. Tests by The Times showed that the partners requested and received data in the same way other third parties did.Facebook\u2019s view that the device makers are not outsiders lets the partners go even further, The Times found: They can obtain data about a user\u2019s Facebook friends, even those who have denied Facebook permission to share information with any third parties.In interviews, several former Facebook software engineers and security experts said they were surprised at the ability to override sharing restrictions.\u201cIt\u2019s like having door locks installed, only to find out that the locksmith also gave keys to all of his friends so they can come in and rifle through your stuff without having to ask you for permission,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a research and privacy consultant who formerly served as the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist.By Rich Harris and Gabriel J.X. DanceDetails of Facebook\u2019s partnerships have emerged amid a reckoning in Silicon Valley over the volume of personal information collected on the internet and monetized by the tech industry. The pervasive collection of data, while largely unregulated in the United States, has come under growing criticism from elected officials at home and overseas and provoked concern among consumers about how freely their information is shared.In a tense appearance before Congress in March, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, emphasized what he said was a company priority for Facebook users.\u201cEvery piece of content that you share on Facebook you own,\u201d he testified. \u201dYou have complete control over who sees it and how you share it.\u201dBut the device partnerships provoked discussion even within Facebook as early as 2012, according to Sandy Parakilas, who at the time led third-party advertising and privacy compliance for Facebook\u2019s platform.\u201cThis was flagged internally as a privacy issue,\u201d said Mr. Parakilas, who left Facebook that year and has recently emerged as a harsh critic of the company. \u201cIt is shocking that this practice may still continue six years later, and it appears to contradict Facebook\u2019s testimony to Congress that all friend permissions were disabled.\u201dThe submission followed testimony by Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, during a closed-door German parliamentary hearing in April. Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, one of the lawmakers who questioned Mr. Kaplan, said in an interview that she believed the data partnerships disclosed by Facebook violated users\u2019 privacy rights.\u201cWhat we have been trying to determine is whether Facebook has knowingly handed over user data elsewhere without explicit consent,\u201d Ms. Winkelmeier-Becker said. \u201cI would never have imagined that this might even be happening secretly via deals with device makers. BlackBerry users seem to have been turned into data dealers, unknowingly and unwillingly.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Samsung declined to respond to questions about whether it had any data-sharing partnerships with Facebook. Amazon also declined to respond to questions.Usher Lieberman, a BlackBerry spokesman, said in a statement that the company used Facebook data only to give its own customers access to their Facebook networks and messages. Mr. Lieberman said that the company \u201cdid not collect or mine the Facebook data of our customers,\u201d adding that \u201cBlackBerry has always been in the business of protecting, not monetizing, customer data.\u201dMicrosoft entered a partnership with Facebook in 2008 that allowed Microsoft-powered devices to do things like add contacts and friends and receive notifications, according to a spokesman. He added that the data was stored locally on the phone and was not synced to Microsoft\u2019s servers.Facebook acknowledged that some partners did store users\u2019 data \u2014 including friends\u2019 data \u2014 on their own servers. A Facebook official said that regardless of where the data was kept, it was governed by strict agreements between the companies.\u201cI am dumbfounded by the attitude that anybody in Facebook\u2019s corporate office would think allowing third parties access to data would be a good idea,\u201d said Henning Schulzrinne, a computer science professor at Columbia University who specializes in network security and mobile systems.The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how loosely Facebook had policed the bustling ecosystem of developers building apps on its platform. They ranged from well-known players like Zynga, the maker of the FarmVille game, to smaller ones, like a Cambridge contractor who used a quiz taken by about 300,000 Facebook users to gain access to the profiles of as many as 87 million of their friends.Those developers relied on Facebook\u2019s public data channels, known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. But starting in 2007, the company also established private data channels for device manufacturers.At the time, mobile phones were less powerful, and relatively few of them could run stand-alone Facebook apps like those now common on smartphones. The company continued to build new private APIs for device makers through 2014, spreading user data through tens of millions of mobile devices, game consoles, televisions and other systems outside Facebook\u2019s direct control.Facebook began moving to wind down the partnerships in April, after assessing its privacy and data practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mr. Archibong said the company had concluded that the partnerships were no longer needed to serve Facebook users. About 22 of them have been shut down.The broad access Facebook provided to device makers raises questions about its compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the F.T.C.After the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the F.T.C. began an investigation into whether Facebook\u2019s continued sharing of data after 2011 violated the decree, potentially exposing the company to fines.Facebook officials said the private data channels did not violate the decree because the company viewed its hardware partners as \u201cservice providers,\u201d akin to a cloud computing service paid to store Facebook data or a company contracted to process credit card transactions. According to the consent decree, Facebook does not need to seek additional permission to share friend data with service providers.\u201cThese contracts and partnerships are entirely consistent with Facebook\u2019s F.T.C. consent decree,\u201d Mr. Archibong, the Facebook official, said.But Jessica Rich, a former F.T.C. official who helped lead the commission\u2019s earlier Facebook investigation, disagreed with that assessment.\u201cUnder Facebook\u2019s interpretation, the exception swallows the rule,\u201d said Ms. Rich, now with the Consumers Union. \u201cThey could argue that any sharing of data with third parties is part of the Facebook experience. And this is not at all how the public interpreted their 2014 announcement that they would limit third-party app access to friend data.\u201dTo test one partner\u2019s access to Facebook\u2019s private data channels, The Times used a reporter\u2019s Facebook account \u2014 with about 550 friends \u2014 and a 2013 BlackBerry device, monitoring what data the device requested and received. (More recent BlackBerry devices, which run Google\u2019s Android operating system, do not use the same private channels, BlackBerry officials said.)Immediately after the reporter connected the device to his Facebook account, it requested some of his profile data, including user ID, name, picture, \u201cabout\u201d information, location, email and cellphone number. The device then retrieved the reporter\u2019s private messages and the responses to them, along with the name and user ID of each person with whom he was communicating.The data flowed to a BlackBerry app known as the Hub, which was designed to let BlackBerry users view all of their messages and social media accounts in one place.The Hub also requested \u2014 and received \u2014 data that Facebook\u2019s policy appears to prohibit. Since 2015, Facebook has said that apps can request only the names of friends using the same app. But the BlackBerry app had access to all of the reporter\u2019s Facebook friends and, for most of them, returned information such as user ID, birthday, work and education history and whether they were currently online.The BlackBerry device was also able to retrieve identifying information for nearly 295,000 Facebook users. Most of them were second-degree Facebook friends of the reporter, or friends of friends.In all, Facebook empowers BlackBerry devices to access more than 50 types of information about users and their friends, The Times found.Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.June 4, 2018April 4, 2018March 20, 2018March 17, 2018Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seattle Officials Repeal Tax That Upset Amazon", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeattle officials scuttled a corporate tax on Tuesday that they had wholeheartedly endorsed just a month ago, delivering a win for the measure\u2019s biggest opponent \u2014 Amazon \u2014 and offering a warning to cities bidding for the retailer\u2019s second headquarters that the company would go to the limit to get its way.But in Seattle, the notion has proved extraordinarily contentious, culminating in the abrupt reversal on Tuesday.Less than a month ago, the tax had passed unanimously. It was signed into law on May 16 by Jenny A. Durkan, Seattle\u2019s mayor, who said the money would \u201cmove people off the street and into safer places\u201d and \u201cclean up the garbage and needles that are in our parks and in our communities,\u201d as well as provide resources including job training and health services.\u201cI know we can be a city that continues to invent the future and come together to build a more affordable, inclusive and just future,\u201d she said.The opponents funded No Tax on Jobs, an effort aimed at getting enough signatures to put a repeal on the November ballot. It became obvious over the weekend that the measure would succeed in coming before voters, leading Ms. Durkan and seven council members to issue a statement saying, \u201cWe heard you.\u201dThe politicians had no stomach for a protracted battle over jobs, even at a moment when the area\u2019s unemployment rate is only 3.1 percent. \u201cIt is clear that the ordinance will lead to a prolonged, expensive political fight over the next five months that will do nothing to tackle our urgent housing and homelessness crisis,\u201d they said.Mike O\u2019Brien, a council member, said in an interview before the vote, \u201cI have a couple of bad choices and I\u2019m picking the less bad,\u201d meaning a vote to repeal.He was puzzled by the intensity and the virulence of the opposition. \u201cThis tax is not a perfect tool, but I think it\u2019s a good one,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there talking to the community, I hear they\u2019ve been convinced by Amazon and other business leaders that this would be bad.\u201dTeresa Mosqueda, one of the two council members opposing the repeal, said there was no backup plan for dealing with the homeless situation.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a path forward,\u201d she said. \u201cI share the frustration with all the City Council that we have been out-messaged.\u201dKshama Sawant, the other opponent of repeal on the council, called the vote \u201cboth capitulation and betrayal.\u201d\u201cThey are choosing to base themselves on making Amazon executives happy,\u201d she said. That \u201cis the biggest lesson that should reverberate to other cities as well.\u201dThe city\u2019s initial plan was for the tax to collect about $500 per employee a year. Amazon responded in early May by stopping its expansion in the city \u201cpending the outcome of the head tax vote.\u201d That was sufficient to get the tax knocked down to about $275 per employee and scaled back in other ways. The tax was limited to companies with at least $20 million in revenue a year.In recent months, however, there has been the beginning of a resistance to the notion that what is good for Amazon is inevitably good for its host.\u201cFrom coast to coast, people lose their homes and get displaced from their communities even as the biggest corporations earn record profits and development booms,\u201d said Sarah Johnson, director of Local Progress, a national association of progressive elected municipal officials. \u201cElected officials across the country are paying close attention to how Amazon and other corporations have responded to Seattle\u2019s efforts to confront their affordable housing and homelessness crisis.\u201dEspecially, it seems, in Silicon Valley itself, where both problems run deep.\u201cWe have needs we need to meet,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, the city\u2019s mayor. \u201cAnd we look to see where there\u2019s the most money. Most of our companies have money. We\u2019re trying to find a way for them to invest it that helps them and the community.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Tech Companies Met With Intelligence Officials to Discuss Midterms", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Eight of the tech industry\u2019s most influential companies, in anticipation of a repeat of the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, met with United States intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for this year\u2019s midterm elections.The meeting, which took place May 23 at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., was also attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oath, Snap and Twitter, according to three attendees of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because of its sensitive nature.The company officials met with Christopher Krebs, an under secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s newly formed \u201cforeign influence\u201d task force.Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the F.B.I. responded to a request for comment.Companies like Facebook and Twitter have been changing the way they operate to counter the kind of misinformation that plagued the two social services in 2016. But the May meeting was the first significant discussion between a group of tech companies and intelligence officials ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.The meeting, which was initiated by Facebook, was seen as a hopeful first step to ensure that the midterms were not a repeat of the Russian interference in 2016, said the three people who attended the meeting.But the people who attended described a tense atmosphere in which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information, only to be told \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that no specific intelligence would be shared.The tech companies shared details about disinformation campaigns they were witnessing on their platforms, but neither the F.B.I. nor the Department of Homeland Security was willing or able to share specific information about threats the tech companies should anticipate, the people said.One attendee of the meeting said the encounter led the tech companies to believe they would be on their own to counter election interference.Facebook, in particular, has been facing pressure to stem disinformation ahead of the elections. The company has been hit hard by reports that it allowed Russian-backed agents to buy advertisements and manage Facebook pages with one notable goal: influence voters in the United States and stoke conflict on hot-button issues like gun control.In public and behind closed doors, intelligence officials have offered scant details about what Russia is doing, prompting frustration from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill.Officials in Washington have described problems that range from intelligence agencies losing track of Russian targets to the same kind of poor communication between various intelligence-gathering agencies that hampered the response of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency has proved an especially vexing target in recent months, stepping up efforts to mask its activity, said an American official with access to intelligence reporting.Unlike in 2016, when Russian hackers left unmistakable footprints \u2014 posting tweets that identified locations, for instance, or working in Cyrillic language documents \u2014 they are now making much better use of virtual private networks and other tools that can hide their true identities and locations.At times, the official said, intelligence agencies have lost track of specific individuals they were tracking, and could not see what, if anything, the Russians were posting or trying to hack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting so many mixed signals, depending on what the agency is,\u201d Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters last week.He said his committee was planning to bring together intelligence officials next month to figure out what was going on and how the government should handle it. \u201cIt compels us to bring everybody together in the same room and try to figure out whether or not there\u2019s some stovepipe issues,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Part of the problem, officials say, is that the White House has expressed little interest in the problem of Russian interference, and that the apathy has had a trickle-down effect. Without pressure from the top, it can be difficult to bring together all the different strands of intelligence collected across America\u2019s spy agencies, and evaluate how to act on it.\u201cWhat we would normally see in a normal administration is the principals meeting to discuss what are they doing individually, what are they doing jointly, or what they are communicating among themselves, what\u2019s the whole of government plan to protect the midterms,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and the top minority member on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with Politico. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any evidence that\u2019s happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Hackers Aren\u2019t Afraid of Us", "Date": "2018-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisMr. Sanger is a national security correspondent for The Times.WASHINGTON \u2014 Ask finance ministers and central bankers around the world about their worst nightmare and the answer is almost always the same: Sometime soon the North Koreans or the Russians will improve on the two huge cyberattacks they pulled off last year. One temporarily crippled the British health care system and the other devastated Ukraine before rippling across the world, disrupting shipping and shutting factories \u2014 a billion-dollar cyberattack the White House called \u201cthe most destructive and costly in history.\u201dThe fact that no intelligence agency saw either attack coming \u2014 and that countries were so fumbling in their responses \u2014 led a group of finance ministers to simulate a similar attack that shut down financial markets and froze global transactions. By several accounts, it quickly spun into farce: No one wanted to admit how much damage could be done or how helpless they would be to deter it.Cyberattacks have been around for two decades, appearing in plotlines from \u201cDie Hard\u201d movies to the new novel by Bill Clinton and James Patterson. But in the real world, something has changed since 2008, when the United States and Israel mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack in history on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, temporarily crippling it in hopes of forcing Iran to the bargaining table. (The two countries never acknowledged responsibility for the attack.)Yet in this arms race, the United States has often been its own worst enemy. Because our government has been so incompetent at protecting its highly sophisticated cyberweapons, those weapons have been stolen out of the electronic vaults of the National Security Agency and the C.I.A. and shot right back at us. That\u2019s what happened with the WannaCry ransomware attack by North Korea last year, which used some of the sophisticated tools the N.S.A. had developed. No wonder the agency has refused to admit that the weapons were made in America: It raised the game of its attackers.That is why cyberweapons have emerged as such effective tools for states of all sizes: a way to disrupt and exercise power or influence without starting a shooting war. Cyberattacks have long been hard to stop because determining where they come from takes time \u2014 and sometimes the mystery is never solved. But even as the United States has gotten better at attributing attacks, its responses have failed to keep pace.So while the United States remains the greatest cyberpower on earth, it is increasingly losing daily cyberconflicts. The range of American targets is so wide and deep that it is almost impossible to understand all of the vulnerabilities. And because most of those targets don\u2019t belong to the government \u2014 banks, power grids, shipping systems, hospitals and internet-linked security cameras, cars and appliances \u2014 confusion reigns over who is responsible for defending them and who will decide when to strike back. We have the most fearsome cyberweaponry on the planet, yet we\u2019re afraid to use it for fear of what will come next.Consider the Russian cyberattacks that preceded the well-known hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers in 2015 and 2016. Just before, Russian hackers had taken up residence in the unclassified servers at the State Department and the White House, and later deep inside the systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.At the State Department, the eviction took weeks, shutting down systems during negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal. The hackers were even bolder at the White House. Instead of disappearing when they were exposed, they fought back, looking to install new malware as soon as the old versions were neutralized. \u201cIt was basically hand-to-hand combat,\u201d recalled Richard Ledgett, the deputy director of the N.S.A. at the time. It appears the attackers just wanted to prove they could go, and stay, anywhere in the American government\u2019s network.Yet out of a reflexive secrecy about cyberoperations \u2014 motivated by an unwillingness to acknowledge both our vulnerabilities and our detection abilities \u2014 the United States never called out the Russians for what they were doing. Nor did we exact any punishment. That proved to be a huge mistake.If Mr. Putin thought there was no price to be paid for invading White House systems, why wouldn\u2019t he attack the Democratic National Committee? And as the Russian attacks continued, no one in the American government detected the larger pattern or Russia\u2019s ambitions to affect the election. Most officials assumed it was plain old espionage.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we had our radar off to these kinds of attacks,\u201d a senior official told me. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t even built the radar.\u201dBy the summer of 2016, some Obama administration officials, waking to the threat, proposed counterstrikes that included exposing Mr. Putin\u2019s hidden bank accounts and his ties to the oligarchs and cutting off Russia\u2019s banking system. But the potential for escalation caused Mr. Obama and his top aides to reject the plan.\u201cIt was an enormously satisfying response,\u201d a senior American official told me later, \u201cuntil we began to think about what it would do to the Europeans.\u201dMr. Obama also understandably feared that anything the United States did might provoke Mr. Putin to tinker with election systems just enough to give credence to Donald Trump\u2019s warning that the system was \u201crigged.\u201dSince the election, the American retaliation has included closing some Russian consulates and recreation centers and expelling spies \u2014 actions one Obama national security official called \u201cthe perfect 19th-century solution to a 21st-century problem.\u201d President Trump has signed off on some additional economic sanctions against individual Russians.But the United States\u2019 problem isn\u2019t toughness \u2014 it\u2019s an absence of strategy. The larger lesson of the past few years is that unless we get smarter a lot faster about deterring these pernicious, hard-to-find forms of cyberaggression, much of what binds our digitally connected society will be eaten away. We have spent so much time worrying about a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor,\u2019\u2019 the attack that takes out the power grid, that we have focused far too little on the subtle manipulation of data that can mean that no election, medical record or self-driving car can be truly trusted. And ultimately that absence of trust will destroy the glue of American society the way the Stuxnet computer worm destroyed those Iranian centrifuges. It will cause them to spin out of control.So what is to be done?First, the United States must significantly improve its cyberdefenses. The wide-open vulnerabilities in America\u2019s networks have essentially deterred the United States from credibly threatening retaliation against the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Iranians. One way to start is to make sure no new equipment goes on the market unless it meets basic security requirements. We won\u2019t let cars on the road without airbags, so why do we do less with the systems that connect them to the internet?Second, we must decide what networks we care most about defending \u2014 and make those priorities clear. Mr. Mattis\u2019s threat to turn to nuclear weapons hardly seems credible \u2014 unless the cyberattack would create an existential threat to America. That requires an intensive public review of what is critical to our nation\u2019s survival. President Trump forfeited the perfect opportunity when he decided against a commission to learn the larger lessons from the 2016 election. Our politics have gotten in the way of our safety.Finally, the United States needs to end the reflexive secrecy surrounding its cyberoperations. We need to explain to the world why we have cyberweapons, what they are capable of and, most important, what we will not use them for. Clearly, it is in the nation\u2019s interests to develop global norms clarifying that some targets are off limits: election systems, hospitals and emergency communications systems, and maybe even electric power grids and other civilian targets.Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, has proposed digital Geneva Conventions that begin to establish those norms, outside the structure of governments and treaties. It\u2019s an imperfect solution, but a start. Intelligence agencies hate this idea: They want the most latitude possible for future operations in an uncertain world. But in any arms control negotiation, to create limits on others, you need to give up something. Otherwise, we will remain trapped in an endlessly escalating war, one we may well lose.David E.

{"Headline": "Amazon Urged Not to Sell Facial Recognition Technology to Police", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome Amazon shareholders are calling for the e-commerce giant to stop selling its facial recognition technology to the police.A group of 19 socially responsible investors, including firms like Sustainvest Asset Management and the Social Equity Group, are applying pressure to Amazon over privacy concerns that they have about the technology.Such government surveillance infrastructure technology may not only pose a privacy threat to customers and other stakeholders across the country, but may also raise substantial risks for our company, negatively impacting our company\u2019s stock valuation and increasing financial risk for shareholders.In addition to our concerns for U.S. consumers who may be put in harm\u2019s way with law enforcement\u2019s use of Rekognition, we are also concerned sales may be expanded to foreign governments, including authoritarian regimes.Amazon had no immediate comment on the letter.We believe it is the wrong approach to impose a ban on promising new technologies because they might be used by bad actors for nefarious purposes in the future. The world would be a very different place if we had restricted people from buying computers because it was possible to use that computer to do harm. The same can be said of thousands of technologies upon which we all rely each day. Through responsible use, the benefits have far outweighed the risks.Tech companies recently have come under scrutiny for their work with the government.To be clear: Microsoft is not working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border, and contrary to some speculation, we are not aware of Azure or Azure services being used for this purpose.
