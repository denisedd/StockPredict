{"Headline": "Facebook Back on the Defensive, Now Over Data Deals With Device Makers", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook endured a new wave of criticism from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe on Monday after disclosures that the social media giant had allowed dozens of hardware manufacturers access to its trove of personal user data.The European authorities who last month enacted the world\u2019s strictest data privacy law said Facebook\u2019s sharing of personal information with cellphone makers and other manufacturers deserved further investigation. Germany\u2019s top privacy regulator, Johannes Caspar, called Facebook\u2019s partnerships \u201can unprecedented violation of privacy laws and user trust.\u201dAnd New York\u2019s attorney general, Barbara Underwood, said her office would expand its investigation of Facebook\u2019s data practices to include Facebook\u2019s sharing with hardware manufacturers.Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have repeatedly cited the 2015 restrictions to assure policymakers that no outside company could again harvest swaths of personal information without the explicit consent of users, as a contractor for Cambridge Analytica did in 2014. But Facebook officials said this week that they did not consider hardware partners to be outside companies, under the terms of Facebook\u2019s privacy policies and a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cFriends\u2019 information, like photos, was only accessible on devices when people made a decision to share their information with those friends,\u201d said the executive, Ime Archibong. \u201cWe are not aware of any abuse by these companies.\u201dBut some American lawmakers criticized Facebook\u2019s rationale and urged the F.T.C. to review whether the partnerships violated Facebook\u2019s promises to the regulator.\u201cI think this explanation is completely inadequate and potentially disingenuous,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee charged with consumer protection. \u201cI think Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony raises very serious and severe questions about Facebook\u2019s credibility.\u201dDavid Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House antitrust subcommittee, responded even more harshly.Senior Republicans also said the partnerships merited further review.Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said in a statement that The Times\u2019s reporting \u201craises important questions about transparency and potential privacy risks for Facebook users.\u201d Mr. Thune said the Senate Commerce Committee, of which he is chairman, would seek more information from Facebook.The F.T.C. is already investigating whether the access to friends\u2019 data that Facebook allowed until 2015 violated the terms of its earlier consent decree with the regulator. Rohit Chopra, a current F.T.C. commissioner, declined to comment on any specific company or investigation, but said he believed that the commission would act to enforce any agreements it had with companies.\u201cToo often, sensitive consumer data gets shared and copied over and over again to a point of no return,\u201d Mr. Chopra said. \u201cF.T.C. orders are not suggestions. When companies violate them, there can be serious consequences.\u201dDuring the event\u2019s keynote address, Craig Federighi, an Apple senior vice president, unveiled a new feature that will let Apple users more easily control what sort of information is shared with Facebook and other social media companies.Mr. Federighi chose to demonstrate the new feature onstage by showing Apple\u2019s Safari browser open to a webpage.

{"Headline": "L\u2019Uomo Vogue Lives Again", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReduce, reuse, recycle. The old call to arms for greener living has finally infiltrated fashion, which generally follows the less enlightened pattern of produce, dismiss, discard.Take the example of L\u2019Uomo Vogue, the influential Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine that did much to promote a progressive vision of men\u2019s wear, visual culture and even, on occasion, politics.Tempered enthusiasm initially greeted the hiring of Mr. Farneti \u2014 a man, a fashion outsider and a distinctly low-profile figure assuming a role long played by a woman who had singularly transformed herself into an identifiable brand. And then Cond\u00e9 Nast announced later in 2017 that, in a belt-tightening move, it would shut down various satellite Vogue editions \u2014 for brides, children, jewelry and men \u2014 over which Ms. Sozzani had long held sway.Among the sundry ways Ms. Sozzani made her mark on fashion, it was her aesthetic savvy that stood out. During her long tenure she scouted and provided a platform for photographers who would become major names in the field. \u201cIt had a piercing presence because the photography was outstanding,\u201d said Angelo Flaccavento, a fashion critic and curator based in Milan. \u201cMasters like Oliviero Toscani and Alfa Castaldi were prominently featured and very active in the definition of the evolved and energetic man L\u2019Uomo Vogue stood for.\u201dThere was something more. \u201cMainly L\u2019Uomo Vogue mattered because it was a huge business,\u201d Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W Magazine, wrote from New York in an email. In an era when publishing relied on advertising and not online subscriptions for survival, L\u2019Uomo Vogue was a robust cash cow. \u201cL\u2019Uomo Vogue was created as a service and a house organ for the Italian men\u2019s wear industry,\u201d he said.Yes, there had been men\u2019s wear before the delightful circus of men\u2019s fashion as we now understand it. Italian designers \u201cinvented men\u2019s pret-a-porter and L\u2019Uomo Vogue was its voice and its image,\u201d Mr. Tonchi said, noting that, with its superhero models and unabashed worship of traditional maleness, L\u2019Uomo Vogue was first among fashion magazines unafraid to celebrate \u201cthe vanity and beauty of a man.\u201dA collective cry of dismay went up when L\u2019Uomo Vogue folded last year and Mr. Farneti let go much of its staff. An equivalent expression of surprise greeted the news this week that the magazine was back in business, resurrected as a quarterly with its first issue out Thursday.Superficially, the revamped magazine has a new look, an impressively larger 10 inch by 12 inch trim size, an editorial emphasis on inclusiveness and an approach to the contested territory of gender that Mr. Farneti claims is part of his mission. It is also printed in English rather than in Italian because, as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the international language and it\u2019s an international magazine.\u201dTo mark the magazine\u2019s comeback, Cond\u00e9 Nast has scheduled a 50th anniversary party on Sunday in the heart of Milan, inviting more than 100 of the publishing and fashion elite in the city to celebrate the arrival of another thick block of glossy paper full of images whose divergence from those to be found in the magazine\u2019s previous iterations was not altogether conspicuous.\u201cThe worst thing a quarterly can do is to look like a magazine that comes out every once in a while,\u201d said Mr. Farneti who, handsome in his tidy blue suit and polished loafers, resembled less the editor of an adventurous fashion magazine than a Macron-style government bureaucrat. \u201cWe want to be as plural as possible,\u201d he added of a decision to commission five female photographers to shoot portfolios with men as their subjects, an odd assertion that seemed to treat gender parity in hiring as a noteworthy event and not the norm, as might be expected.Still, for all that societal notions of what constitutes masculinity are being contested, there is little doubt that this is a compelling moment for men\u2019s fashion. The open work space models of a digital age have altered beyond recognition what constitutes a uniform for the office, with suits now restricted to only the most traditional forms of employment and, perhaps, a day in court.At houses like Louis Vuitton, Dior Homme, Burberry and C\u00e9line, designers as disparate as Virgil Abloh, Kim Jones, Riccardo Tisci and Hedi Slimane have been brought in to recast the image of men in a modern consumer marketplace. And a posse of talented newcomers like Gosha Rubchinskiy, Simon Porte Jacquemus, Craig Green, Benjamin Alexander Huseby and Serhat Isik (of GmbH) and Matthew Williams (of Alyx) have arrived on the scene to shake things up.\u201cEven the Italian sartorial style is not a category that has the same meaning as it had before,\u201d Mr. Farneti said, referring to the tailoring that still dominates Pitti Uomo yet is now in a battle for continued existence.\u201cWhat we used to call a mash-up is now normal,\u201d he added of the new blended dress codes, as reflected in a magazine that features all the usual men\u2019s magazine content on apparel and toys and grooming products but with the addition of a section of editorial pages devoted to the footwear that now is the single largest driver in the men\u2019s wear business.Though the generation that a revitalized L\u2019Uomo Vogue hopes to lure to its pages may consume every new gadget that Apple churns out, it probably does not want to dress the way that, at 57, Mr. Cook does. Attired in a smart blue suit and tie for the Cavalli show, the executive seemed bemused by a parade of scrawny male models clomping around a carpeted runway left soggy by afternoon thundershowers. While Mr. Cook wore a pair of conservative lace-ups, the models showing the designer Paul Surridge\u2019s short-short sets or animal-patterned track suits were shod in the sneakers that, in the manner of the moment, were roughly the size of pontoons.Advertisement"}

Academically, I have no woes. It is the thought of living on my own, in the grown-up world, that troubles me. Society has become so focused on academics, test scores and GPA, that no school wants to spend time teaching kids about buying a house, or paying off loans. Because of this, I am going off to college with little to no knowledge about everyday skills.Professor David Perkins has looked at the issue of what is and is not taught in schools, and tells educators to ask themselves, \u201cWhat\u2019s worth learning in school?\u201d At a seminar that Perkins spoke at, he asked audience members to raise their hand if they had learned in school what mitosis, the process of cell division, was. Nearly every person raised their hand. When Perkins asked how many of them had used their knowledge of mitosis in the last ten years, only one hand went up.I am not arguing that public schools should up and abandon math or science or any subject, but if biology is a required course, why shouldn\u2019t accounting be too? Or home economics? Public schools are built around a curriculum that spends so much time teaching information that will likely never be used again. Instead, teaching important life skills needs to be integrated into the curriculum of public schools. Some courses, like accounting and home ec, are offered as elective classes, but very few kids take them because it won\u2019t make their college application look better or boost their GPA as much as taking the AP Statistics elective. Public schools are doing the bare minimum to make these useful classes available to students and in turn are sending kids off unprepared for their future lives outside of the academic world. There needs to be a bigger push toward making classes about life skills a requirement in public schools, so that people are not going into the workforce, wondering how to do their tax returns.Works CitedHough, Lory. \u201cWhat\u2019s Worth Learning in School?\u201d Harvard Graduate School of Education, 8 Jan. 2015.Ojalvo, Holly Epstein. \u201cWhat Are You Really Learning at School?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Sept. 2011._________In the timeless words of Abraham Lincoln, \u201cAnd in the end, it is not the years in your life that count. It\u2019s the life in your years.\u201d The debate over whether the quality or quantity of life is more important has shaken up the grounds of ethics. Recently, physician-assisted suicide has become legalized in Oregon, Washington, Washington, D.C., Vermont, Montana, Colorado and California. Yet New York, just this past year, banned this end-of-life route.The Death with Dignity Act, passed in selected states, allows strictly qualified terminally ill patients to receive lethal medication from their doctors to end their lives. It is one end-of-life option among others including: palliative sedation, voluntary stopping of eating and drinking, and stopping treatment. All of these alleviate pain and hasten death, however, they are not always effective depending on the diagnoses. Brittany Maynard, who had terminal brain cancer, wrote an article explaining her choice of physician-assisted suicide: \u201cI considered passing away in hospice care \u2026 but even with palliative sedation, I could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal, cognitive and motor loss.\u201d Fundamentally, both physician-assisted suicide and other end-of-life options result in the same outcome. However, physician-assisted suicide is more immediate and less painful while the others, though legal, can result in intolerable, prolonged anguish. Some patients want to have the responsibility of choosing their own way of ending the suffering in the comfort of their own homes, surrounded by their loved ones. For this reason, physician-assisted suicide ought to be legal.By disallowing terminally ill patients from choosing the right to die with dignity, there is an infringement on the right to live a quality life, right to freedom, and right to autonomy. Physicians against assisted suicide claim that since the Hippocratic oath implies a doctor\u2019s responsibility is to heal, assisting patients to hasten their deaths is a violation of medical ethics. John Grohol, a psychologist, wrote a New York Times article stating, \u201cWhen doctors equate healing with quantity of life, they ignore the quality of life. If suffering is intolerable, it is inhumane not to end it.\u201d Therefore, if it is against the patient\u2019s will to continue suffering, disallowing the patient to die peacefully and painlessly is disregarding the patient\u2019s well being and, in fact, rejecting the oath.The Death with Dignity Act entitles a patient to make a decision about his own life and, for once, not allow the disease to dictate the body\u2019s fate. With strict regulations, such as psychiatric evaluations ensuring the patient\u2019s choice is individual and competent, New York should be the next state to adopt such end-of-life care and give people the option to live fully and freely.Works CitedGrohol, John M. \u201cDenying Someone a Peaceful Death Can Be Unethical\u201d The New York Times. 7 Oct. 2014.Maynard, Brittany. \u201cMy Right to Death With Dignity at 29.\u201d CNN, Cable News Network, 3 Nov. 2014._________In China, the competition is great and the opportunities are few. Children are faced with the burden of success the minute they are born. Before they are born, mothers are faced with the pressure of bearing the most well-advantaged offspring. In recent years, there has been an exponential rise in the number of couples who are opting to screen embryos during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Because of the financial burden, lack of facilities for, and social stigma of raising a handicapped child, Chinese parents are more willing to prioritize you sheng (which translates to \u201chealthy birth\u201d) over the protection of an embryo.One of the screening processes, known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is currently used to detect embryos with single gene mutations that could cause diseases and disabilities like Tay Sachs disease or cystic fibrosis. Chinese law prohibits selection of embryos based on anything else (for instance, selecting for male embryos is illegal). However, a whole new array of problems will develop as we achieve a greater understanding of what genes influence intelligence.The trailblazer in this field is the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), which launched a project in 2012 to analyze the DNA of 2,000 of the world\u2019s smartest people. There are thousands of variants that influence mental abilities, but BGI aims to decipher the substantial genetic component of intelligence in the near future. While the study is purely academic, insight into the labyrinthine genetics of genius will define the future of genetic screenings; Pandora\u2019s box will be opened with no possibility for return.Fertility clinics may go from advertising for \u201ccancer-free babies\u201d to promising \u201cprodigy babies\u201d. The starting line for the rat race to the middle class will shift from family standing to predestined genetic design. PGD won\u2019t necessarily result in China mass-engineering super-citizens, but it will easily be misinterpreted by and desensitize result-driven consumers. \u201cSelecting for the smartest embryos\u201d overemphasizes the hereditary facet of intelligence and glosses over the influence of nurture. Clinics cannot guarantee smarter babies, but eager couples will still flock to them nonetheless. In addition, even with PGD for simpler single gene mutations there is the risk of false positives. Now, couples might unknowingly dispose of perfectly healthy embryos in pursuit of a prodigy.It is imperative that the Chinese government take proactive measures to oversee future PGD implementation. In addition to a moratorium so officials, scientists and consumers can deliberate, genetic counselors who are well-versed in bioethics need to lead a nationwide discussion on how far we are willing to let competition define us, literally. The human genome is indisputably the new frontier of exploration. However, unrestrained scientific ambition will move China forward before it is ready.Works CitedCyranoski, David. \u201cChina\u2019s Embrace of Embryo Selection Raises Thorny Questions.\u201d Scientific American, Nature America, Inc, 16 Aug. 2017.Eror, Aleks. \u201cChina Is Engineering Genius Babies.\u201d Vice, Vice Media, 15 March 2013.Kolata, Gina. \u201cBuilding a Better Human With Science?

Though Mr. Clinton was referring to her qualifications and unusually significant political role \u2014 she remains the only first lady ever to maintain an office in the West Wing \u2014 presidential couples always present voters \u201ctwo for the price of one.\u201d Presidents\u2019 spouses fulfill a variety of official responsibilities: They manage paid staffers, promote nonpartisan causes and entertain White House visitors. Crucially, the first lady is unpaid, and, as former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson once quipped, \u201celected by one person \u2014 her husband.\u201dAs every new election raises the prospect of a man in the office of first lady, this amorphous role has become awkward and archaic: The presidential spouse should be absolved of public obligations altogether. The position of first lady evolved within the context of a society that could not imagine a woman in power or a president\u2019s wife with a high-powered career, relegating her to the domestic sphere. It devalued traditionally feminine tasks such as event planning, deeming them unworthy of monetary compensation.Feminist advances have allowed successive presidential spouses to expand their public profiles, becoming vocal advocates for women\u2019s and children\u2019s issues. Thus, some have argued, as Professor Jean H. Baker proposed in The New York Times, that the office should \u201cbe defined as a paid public position, with salary and expectations.\u201dHowever, this change would only affirm the expectation that women subsume their identities into those of their powerful husbands. If the role of the presidential spouse is a \u201cfull-time job,\u201d as Baker claims, he or she would likely be compelled to relinquish their existing occupation, just as Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton gave up prestigious positions. Yet, a life of visiting elementary schools or choosing flower arrangements for the next White House dinner may not appeal to every spouse. Furthermore, since the first lady is eligible for office by virtue of being married to the president, greater politicization inevitably bumps up against charges of nepotism.A far simpler solution would be to abolish the office and treat the presidential spouse as a normal private citizen. After all, the position is dispensable. German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s husband, a theoretical physicist, has eschewed the public eye so unwaveringly that a German newspaper once labeled him \u201cas invisible as a molecule,\u201d a practice that has not impeded the smooth functioning of the German state.The United States can and should follow suit. We can only free ourselves of the sexist assumptions and stereotypes that currently underlie the role of first lady if we free presidential spouses from public servitude.Works CitedBaker, Jean H. \u201cGive First Ladies a Salary and Expectations.\u201d The New York Times. 9 March 2016.Cornwell, Rupert. \u201cBill and Hillary\u2019s Double Trouble: Clinton\u2019s Two for the Price of One\u2019 Pledge Is Returning to Haunt Him, Says Rupert Cornwell.\u201d Independent. 9 March 1994.Finkelstein, Sarina. \u201cWant to Fix Wage Inequality?

In this day and age, the extensive use of fuel-burning vehicles is becoming a larger issue as global warming develops into a growing threat \u2014 especially in the United States. While replacing all gasoline cars with electric vehicles (EVs) would be impractical, widespread change is necessary. A good place for us to begin is with some of our nation\u2019s most admired and respected individuals: police officers.According to the most recent law enforcement census, 17,985 police departments across the United States deploy thousands of police vehicles, becoming one of the country\u2019s largest contributors to greenhouse gases. Living in a city where EVs and hybrids are becoming increasingly common, the dozens of diesel police cars around me begin to feel archaic. Within the next decade, several departments can reasonably aim to replace a majority of their police fleets, or at least nonemergency fleets, with fuel efficient vehicles.In fact, plans for this system have already garnered support and are underway in New York City, one of the nation\u2019s greatest greenhouse gas emitters. For instance, recent city plans call for replacing just under a fifth of its 11,000 car fleet; this is estimated to reduce city government emissions by 50 percent, according to the New York Times article \u201cNew York City Aims for Vast Electric Car Fleet by 2025.\u201dAlbeit costly, replacing only 2,000 cars will pay for itself through fuel savings, while dramatically improving the environment of one of the world\u2019s busiest cities. Furthermore, police officers serve as an example to the public, which is why their use of green vehicles could cause a larger change to ripple across America.The variety and practicality of electric vehicles have grown tremendously in the past half decade, showing no signs of stopping. Some argue against this plan\u2019s practicality due to the failure of the most significant previous attempt in the LAPD, in which a 100 car fleet of EVs had seldom been used since its introduction in 2016. However, cars in this fleet were among first-generation mass market EVs and faced significant limitations.Most modern models have evolved past those limitations with greater durability, safety, speed, affordability and other factors that strengthen the practicality of the car. Some gasoline vehicles may remain for specialized missions, but their necessity is limited.The more Americans neglect the benefits of today\u2019s fuel efficient vehicles, the more dire our climate situation becomes. A solution is widely available, and a step forward taken by our nation\u2019s officials can push us toward a future of clean energy. With this advance, police officers can save more than just lives.Works CitedCity of New York Inventory of New York City\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Emissions, April 2017, by Cventure LLC, Cathy Pasion, Christianah Oyenuga, and Kate Gouin, Mayor\u2019s Office of Sustainability, New York, 2017.Grynbaum, Michael M. \u201cNew York City Aims for Vast Electric Car Fleet by 2025.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 Dec. 2015.King, Alanis. \u201cThat Fleet Of Electric Cars The LAPD Paid At Least $2.9 Million For?

Reynolds Tobacco hid and denied the health risks of smoking in pursuit of greater profits.The courts have forced the companies to release \u201ccorrective statements\u201d in newspapers and on major news channels. Although these statements are a step in the right direction, their sparse design does not catch people\u2019s attention and, therefore, does not effectively spread their information to the public.Tobacco advertisements in the 1900s were flashy and colorful; they featured pictures of grinning doctors endorsing the health benefits of cigarettes and attractive people smoking happily. These advertisements grabbed the reader\u2019s attention, but the corrective statements do just the opposite.The print and televised statements consist of plain black text in bullet points on a white background, with a monotonous, slow voice-over that is reminiscent of a digital assistant added to the televised ones. They appear designed to be unattractive and slip under the radar of viewers and readers.This is not how to get a message across.An antismoking campaign by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention entitled \u201cTips\u201d ran in 2012 and featured former smokers telling their stories with graphic images of their injuries.According to NBC News, this campaign led 1.6 million people to attempt to quit smoking, and 78 percent of surveyed smokers and 74 percent of surveyed nonsmokers recalled seeing at least one Tips advertisement. The CDC\u2019s advertisements made an impact because they caught people\u2019s attention; these corrective statements do not do that, so how will people see them?These statements reveal important information about smoking\u2019s adverse effects and the companies\u2019 deceitful actions. It is imperative that smokers and those considering smoking are fully aware of the negative consequences of their actions. In Texas, women seeking abortions must receive information about the procedure\u2019s risks and alternative options 24 hours beforehand. Don\u2019t smokers, whose choice to smoke exposes them and every person around them to numerous fatal diseases, deserve the same educational material?And how will they receive that information when it is practically invisible?When Kessler ordered these companies to release corrective statements, her intent was that the American public see and hear those statements. In their current form, these advertisements do not satisfy that condition.The courts cannot allow these ineffective statements to continue; the companies must release new advertisements that actually attract the eye to fulfill their obligation. We do not allow our children to avoid apologizing for misconduct; let us apply this same rule in this case. Altria, Lorillard, Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, say it like you mean it.Works CitedFox, Maggie. \u201cGraphic Anti-Smoking Ads Helped 100,000 Kick the Habit for Good, CDC Says.\u201d NBCNews.com, NBCUniversal News Group, 9 Sept. 2013.Maheshwari, Sapna. \u201cWhy Tobacco Companies Are Paying to Tell You Smoking Kills.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 24 Nov. 2017._________\u201cThe King and I\u201d\u201cMiss Saigon\u201d\u201cAllegiance\u201dAt face value, these recent Broadway musicals are evidence of an increasingly diverse Broadway: one that allows Asian-American artists to thrive alongside those of every color and identity. In fact, the 2015-16 Broadway season was praised for bringing diversity \u201cfront and center\u201d with shows emphasizing heritage, like \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cAllegiance.\u201d However, as diverse audience members search for representation on the Broadway stage, we must reevaluate: Do these shows offer Asian-American artists the same opportunities as those of other ethnicities? The Asian American Performers Action Coalition\u2019s report \u201cEthnic Representation on New York Stages\u201d confirms the trend of growing diversity: Between the 2006-07 and 2015-16 New York theater seasons, minority actors\u2019 representation increased from 15 percent to 35 percent while Asian-American actors\u2019 representation rose to only 9 percent.High Asian-American representation accompanies musicals such as \u201cThe King & I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d \u2014 among the only shows to employ large Asian-American ensembles. According to the same report, the 2015 revival of \u201cThe King & I\u201d hired \u201calmost half of all Asian actors employed that season.\u201d Japanese-Canadian director Stafford Arima confirms their impact: \u201cYou would look at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and just see 12 productions of the \u2018King and I\u2019 and nine productions of \u2018Miss Saigon\u2019.\u201dThese classic musicals, however, carry the remnants of a less racially-aware time. \u201cThe King & I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d include large Asian ensembles, but consistently cast Asian-American actors as background to white story lines. Unlike the vibrant cultural celebrations of \u201cHamilton\u201d or \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d which pridefully explore ethnocultural roots through hip-hop or religion, these Asian-centric shows only \u201ccelebrate\u201d a long history of Anglo-European interference in Asia and the Pacific Islands.Asian-American actors deserve to play characters that embrace their history without focusing on the white man\u2019s role in it. They deserve to involve themselves in shows that look toward a future in which Asian-American pride is loud and present. They deserve the same opportunity to love, honor and celebrate their culture as the trailblazing African-American, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ actors currently shining on the Broadway stage.The theater community should take pride in its beacons of diversity \u2014 \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d \u2014 but should also recognize the inequality among actors of color. Modern musicals such as \u201cAllegiance,\u201d about Japanese-American internment, or \u201cHere Lies Love,\u201d about the political controversy of the Philippines, drive the industry in a positive direction, yet they have not closed the gap between Caucasian and minority \u2014 particularly, Asian \u2014 representation on Broadway. Let Broadway applaud itself for its monumental gains in the past decade, but never let it stop pushing for the equal, truthful and proud representation its diverse audience deserves.Works CitedBandhu, Pun.

My friends, who also have their driving permits, frequently joke with me about the woes of lane-changing, parallel parking and three-point turns as we prepare for our looming driver\u2019s license tests.Yet we remain part of a dwindling majority. In 1976, nearly 87 percent of high school seniors held a driver\u2019s license. By 2016, this percentage dropped to under 72, a decrease that may correlate with a climbing dependence on parental or public transportation, a lack of car ownership, or simply not needing to drive anywhere.Then add these declining rates to a rising innovation: autonomous cars. The introduction of effective autonomous cars could drastically reduce vehicular deaths, since 94 percent of traffic fatalities involve human error. Self-driving cars would eliminating the dangers of intoxicated driving, distracted driving or simply incompetent driving \u2015 and render learning to drive unnecessary.But, following the fatal Arizona crash between an autonomous Uber car and a pedestrian, Americans question the true safety of such technology. Company documents reveal that Uber\u2019s self-driving cars drove an average of only 13 miles before a human supervisor had to interfere to prevent a crash. In comparison, a study by Virginia Tech found that the average American driver crashes approximately once every 49,505 miles. Juxtaposed with the data of human drivers, Uber\u2019s autonomous cars appear laughably incompetent. Nevertheless, autonomous cars collectively travel about 113,636 miles per crash, indicating that they can and will be more reliable than humans.Autonomous cars remain far from flawlessly navigating the roads, but we often fail to consider that developers designed our traffic regulations with humans \u2014 and human error \u2014 in mind. An entire network of self-driving cars would optimize traffic congestion and pollution by reducing the number of cars on the road. Consequently, regulations such as speed bumps and parking spaces may become restrictive rather than protective. To take full advantage of autonomous cars, we must prepare to rescind and replace longstanding laws.As self-driving cars continue to improve, so does public reception of them. The percentage of Americans that distrust driverless cars decreased drastically from 74 percent in 2017 to 47 percent in 2018. If this downward trend continues, autonomous cars will soon be an accepted and integral part of society. Akin to penmanship and opera singing, human driving will soon be a practice of the past. And, given the potential security benefits and efficacy of autonomous cars, this is a future that we must accept \u2014 and even embrace.Works CitedBahrampour, Tara. \u201cNot Drinking or Driving, Teens Increasingly Put off Traditional Markers of Adulthood.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 19 Sept. 2017.Blanco, Myra. \u201cAutomated Vehicle Crash Rate Comparison Using Naturalistic Data.\u201d Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, Virginia Polytech Institute and State University, 8 Jan. 2016.\u201cCritical Reasons for Crashes Investigated in the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey.\u201d National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Feb. 2015.Giffi, Craig A. \u201cA Reality Check on Advanced Vehicle Technologies.\u201d Deloitte Insights, Deloitte Insights, 5 Jan. 2018.Wakabayashi, Daisuke. \u201cUber\u2019s Self-Driving Cars Were Struggling Before Arizona Crash.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 March 2018._________Education has become an industry in which the upper-class\u2019s monopoly of resources is unchecked. A New York Times study of 38 top colleges in America, including five Ivy League schools, found that more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent. China faces a similar conundrum, where rich families in urban areas can send their kids to \u201ckeypoint\u201d high schools. These schools receive more funding per student than average schools, have better teachers, and reliably place their students into elite colleges. In a world where income inequality is growing \u2014 China\u2019s bottom 25 percent owns less than 1 percent of the aggregate wealth while the top 1 percent owns over one-third \u2014 one wonders if people not born into wealth are doomed to poverty.However, in 2016, the Chinese Ministry of Education sparked hope when it announced 140,000 spaces \u2014 about 6.5 percent of spots in top colleges \u2014 would be reserved for students from less developed provinces. Unfortunately, this policy immediately ignited strong protests by urban parents. Under protest banners of \u201cfairness in education,\u201d protesters rallied to preserve using \u201cGaokao\u201d college-entrance examination score, as the sole metric. They noted that Gaokao mimics China\u2019s old imperial civil service exam (\u201cKeju\u201d) in relying purely on exam results and praised this meritocratic system as superior. Essentially, their argument is that in the long race of college applications, no one should be forced to run 6.5 percent further than their competitors.What these protesters failed to mention is that times have changed, and the race\u2019s participants begin on vastly different starting lines. The Keju system that was effective in bringing people from rural areas to government posts in cities, and thus increased social mobility, is not applicable in a country experiencing the fastest urbanization trend in history. As recently as 1993, over 40 percent of students in China\u2019s colleges were children of farmers or factory workers. But now social mobility is becoming an obsolete concept. Today, less than 10 percent of young people in the countryside go to senior high schools compared with 70 percent of their urban counterparts.Fairness in education is the right slogan, but a truly meritocratic system should not ignore complex social realities that put some students at a disadvantage from a young age. The Chinese government\u2019s new higher-education admissions policy is a step toward balancing the unequal \u2018starting lines\u2019 that poor, rural students face. More such creative, comprehensive policies should be encouraged. Without these measures, growing inequality in society cannot be redressed. Every citizen \u2014 regardless of location, family background or wealth \u2014 should have hope that hard work and dedication can transform their lives.Works CitedAisch, Gregor, et al. \u201cSome Colleges Have More Students From the Top 1 Percent Than the Bottom 60.

Today, our political climate is marked by increasingly acerbic and polarizing rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum. While we tend to blame those in Washington for splitting America into two, there is another major reason for this internal discord \u2014 ourselves. From social media to news outlets, we often shut ourselves in echo chambers that reinforce our existing views but exclude alternative views.Understandably, we naturally do so in the first place because we like hearing what we want to hear and because we feel confident when others accept our opinions, especially when we browse through and post on social media. But, why is this specifically bad?While some may contend that these platforms allow us to converse with like-minded individuals, echo chambers have silent, pernicious effects on the way we perceive truth. When we surround ourselves only with ideas that are similar to our own, we succumb to groupthink as we take everything we read as fact. This dangerous cycle perpetuates disinformation since we almost always don\u2019t take the time to independently verify what we read and view to be true in the echo chamber.Statistical data already proves this phenomenon. In a 2016 study published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, Swedish researchers analyzed 700,000 posts on a right-wing forum. The results were shocking: It took only six months for the average user to adopt the community\u2019s radical opinions and go from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cWe.\u201dOnce we fall under the influences of this \u201cmob mentality,\u201d we regard our beliefs as hard fact and refuse to engage in conflicting opinions, extinguishing civil discourse. For instance, when people of the same political affiliation were told to debate the merits behind denigrating rumors about the opposite party, the discussions notably veered toward reaffirming those erroneous statements.Despite the plethora of multifaceted and diverse opinions offered online, we still overwhelming choose to latch onto narrow viewpoints that we want to hear. Instead of willfully ignoring the other side, we must learn to engage in opposing perspectives to listen and understand rather than to respond or scorn at. Instead of taking everything we read in blind faith, we must learn to analyze and question it.So, at the end of the day, don\u2019t be afraid to question anything in life. Even if you feel like it\u2019s a \u201cdumb\u201d question, ask it. The more you learn, the less \u201cdumb\u201d questions you will have. But most importantly, learn to be prepared for the answer, too. It may not be what you want to hear, but that\u2019s the truth. The plain truth.Works CitedB\u00e4ck, Emma A., et al. \u201cFrom I to We: Group Formation and Linguistic Adaption in an Online Xenophobic Forum.\u201d 13 March 2018.

Although the wall hasn\u2019t been built yet, planning is underway and it\u2019s now possible to see eight prototype walls in Otay Mesa, San Diego. According to the Trump administration, this planned wall will reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants. However, building a wall is actually counterproductive and there are many more effective alternatives.It\u2019s true a wall may keep some undocumented immigrants out, which might decrease the number of these immigrants in the workforce. But, according to the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cmost undocumented immigrants now simply overstay legally obtained short-term visas \u2014 and do not sneak across the border.\u201d Simply flying to the U.S. as a tourist or visitor, many people arrive legally and then stay on as undocumented immigrants. Clearly, physically blocking people from crossing the border using a wall is not an effective way to solve the problem.Building the wall would also cut into the budget for other kinds of border control. The Trump administration plans to spend over 18 million dollars on building a border wall, or over 50 percent of the 33 billion border security budget. Spending so much to build the wall would mean budget cuts for routine spending on maintenance and border control upgrades during the wall\u2019s construction. Spending cuts would result in reductions in patrol routes, lights, cameras, sensors and personnel. This lack of maintenance and improvements would result in more undocumented immigrants crossing over during construction, not fewer.Instead of building a wall, there are more effective ways to solve the undocumented immigration issue. First, money budgeted for the wall could be spent on enhancing law enforcement efforts aimed at companies that hire undocumented immigrants. If hiring regulations are enforced and it becomes harder for undocumented immigrants to find jobs, the number of illegal border crossings would decrease. Another critical way to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants is to continue investing in other forms of enhanced border control technology like drones and heat sensors, which would increase law enforcement\u2019s ability to find undocumented immigrants sneaking across border.If completed, the wall wouldn\u2019t be an effective protection against undocumented immigrants. Even China\u2019s Great Wall was ineffective at keeping out groups like the Mongolians or at keeping Han Chinese from leaving China to settle outside the wall illegally. Eventually, immigrants will always find ways to cross the physical obstacles that governments put in their paths. Therefore, the U.S. border security budget should be spent on actual solutions instead of on creating a big, inefficient wall that may eventually become just another tourist attraction like the one in China.Works CitedBurgos, Fredy. \u201cTrump\u2019s Mexico Border Wall Isn\u2019t Going to Stem the Flow of Undocumented Immigrants.\u201d Newsweek, 20 Dec. 2017.Nixon, Ron. \u201cTo Pay for Wall, Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures.\u201d The New York Times, 8 Jan. 2018.Nixon, Ron. \u201cWhat Border Agents Say They Want (It\u2019s Not a Wall).\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 March 2018.Urrea, Luis Alberto. \u201cLooking at Trump\u2019s \u2018Beautiful Wall\u2019.\u201d The New York Times, 3 March 2018._________Many Americans characterize the Electoral College as a fair system that represents all Americans. Supporters point to the fact that small states like Wyoming and Delaware would be unimportant in a direct election for president and thus ignored. Under the Electoral College, they reason, candidates must pay attention to all states. Yet nearly every argument in support for the Electoral College is inconsistent.The truth is that small states are still ignored despite the extra representation. Rather than diversifying the states that candidates visit, the Electoral College forces candidates to focus on the swing states. This is because of its all-or-nothing approach to granting electors: If a candidate wins a majority in a state, he or she will win all the electors in the state. It matters not whether the candidate wins by 60 percent or 90 percent. The results of this are horrible. As The New York Times stated, \u201cIn 2016, two-thirds of all public campaign events were held in just six states\u2026.\u201dIn addition, there is not a clear reason why the small states should have their votes count more than the large states if the Electoral College does nothing to diversify the states candidates visit. Small states should have their votes count less precisely because they are smaller than the large states.Most in favor of abolishing the Electoral College want a direct national vote giving one vote to every person. However a direct national vote would still retain several problems of the Electoral College, most notably the spoiler effect. The spoiler effect occurs when a third candidate splits the vote of one of the two parties causing the candidate who would have won to lose and the candidate that a minority of Americans wanted to win. This has happened both to Republicans and Democrats and it discourages Americans from voting for a third party for fear of wasting their vote on a candidate who cannot win. Americans would still be stuck with two-party rule under this system.This problem could be alleviated with instant-runoff voting. Under this system, voters could rank their choices for candidates. If no candidate has a majority in the first round, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and the second choice of those who voted for that candidate is considered. This process is continued until one of the candidates has a majority. With instant-runoff voting, the fear of giving away an election would be eliminated because voters could choose third parties as higher choices and give lower priority to the major parties. This would diversify the political landscape of the United States and give Americans more choices for elections.Works CitedEdwards, George C., I.,II. \u201c5 Myths about the Electoral College.\u201d The Washington Post, Nov. 04, 2012, ProQuest.\u201cIt\u2019s Time to Give Instant Run-Off Balloting a Try.\u201d Montgomery Advertiser, Sept. 17, 2017, ProQuest.Lehnert, Tim. \u201cNo Vote \u2018Wasted\u2019 in This System.\u201d Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 30, 2016, ProQuest.\u201cLet the People Pick the President.\u201d Editorial.

Instead of squandering limited sources on policing an issue that history has proved impossible to eradicate, why not give sex work a legal framework that provides sex workers with medical help and legal protection against violence?Prostitution is a multimillion dollar business, yet no one is collecting taxes from it. According to Nevada brothel owner Dennis Hof, the city of Las Vegas alone could make $25 million a year, just from taxing prostitution. A study conducted by the University of California found that one American city spends on average of $2000 arresting one prostitute; this amounts to $125 million a year in enforcement costs nationwide. Legalizing sex work would turn it into a revenue maker, rather than a burden for the taxpayer.Making prostitution legal could minimize serious health concerns. Decriminalizing prostitution allows the government to regulate and monitor the trade. This, in turn, could ensure that HIV and other STD protection programs are carried out effectively, and research proves this to be true; according to expert Steffanie Strathdee\u2019s study, 46 percent of HIV infections could be averted in any of the Canadian, Kenyan and Indian cities she researched, simply by fully decriminalizing prostitution. An Australian study found that the prevalence of STDs was \u201c80 times greater in 63 illegal street prostitutes than in 753 of their legal brothel counterparts\u201d. Additionally, it was found that condom use was significantly higher in legalized sex work compared to illegal prostitution.It could be argued that authorizing sex work encourages ill treatment toward women. Research shows the opposite; legalizing prostitution actually reduces violence toward women. A study in the Netherlands found that opening designated legal street prostitution zones decreased rape and sexual abuse by 30-40 percent. It was also found that giving sex work a legal framework empowered women to demand safer sex and legal punishment of abuse. Furthermore, as Peter G. Hill brings up in his New York Times Letter to the Editor, legalizing prostitution allows the government to enforce age restrictions on sex trade, preventing underage teens from being lured into the trade.I am not proclaiming a moral judgment on prostitution; I am stating facts. Prostitution is a reality of the modern world. This modern world demands equality. It demands protection and change. Yet change, protection and equality are not being demanded for sex workers. It\u2019s time for the government to stop telling people how to live their lives, and it\u2019s time for the citizens to demand protection for those who need it.Works CitedAkers, Mick. \u201cThis Pimp Wants to End Sex Trafficking.\u201d LasVegasSun.com, 20 March 2017.Becklund, Laurie . \u201cProstitution Arrests Cost $2,000 Each, Study Finds.\u201d Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Times, 10 July 1987.Kastoryano, Stephen, et al. \u201cStreet Prostitution Zones and Crime.\u201d Cato Institute, 19 Apr. 2017.\u201cOpinion | Should Prostitution Be Legalized?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Sept. 2015.\u201cProstitution, Public Health, and Human-Rights Law.\u201d The Lancet.\u201cSimple Way to Curb HIV?

I only recently recognized the connection between these two facets of myself \u2014 or rather, the lack of one: in all of my stories since childhood, I had never written about a Chinese American character. The reason? I\u2019d never really read about one either.The lack of ethnic representation in children\u2019s literature is stark. According to the publisher Lee & Low, only about 10 percent of children\u2019s books published in the last two decades contain diverse themes. Meanwhile, roughly 80 percent of people involved in children\u2019s literature \u2014 authors, illustrators, editors, publishers, etc. \u2014 are white. When people of color constitute roughly 39 percent of the current U.S. population, these numbers convey a serious problem. It has been said that books act as mirrors, allowing readers to reflect on their own identities. Children of color are deprived of the opportunity to truly see themselves in the pages they read, thus made to understand that they can never be the protagonists of their own stories.Too often, multicultural books are pushed aside because they can\u2019t connect with the majority of white readers. But to make such an argument when nonhuman characters are so popular in children\u2019s literature is to suggest that white children have more in common with animals than other children. Moreover, research has continuously shown that reading facilitates empathy and understanding. A study conducted by Laurel Hartmann specifically found that multicultural picture books \u201chelped encourage the students to search for similarities between their own lives and the lives of members of diverse cultures around the world.\u201d Thus, representative books may be just as important for white children as for children of color.In recent years, more and more attention has been brought to this issue. In 2014, an online campaign under the hashtag #WeNeedDiverseBooks turned into a nonprofit organization that advocates for diversity in children\u2019s literature. Independent publishers such as Lee & Low Books, ArtePublico Press\u2019 Pi\u00f1ata Imprint, and Just Us Books have introduced more diverse characters into print. It is up to us to support these efforts to ensure that children of color have a chance to see themselves and be seen, to remember that their stories are just as real, valid and deserving. It is up to us to buy diverse books from local bookstores, contact school libraries to ask for more inclusive selections, and promote minority writers who are representing their communities.And as a young minority writer myself, I am learning to find my voice and to speak out for all those who have lost their own. In doing so, I hope that the writers of the next generation will never learn to silence their heritage as I did.Works CitedHartmann, Laurel K. \u201cUsing Multicultural Literature in the Classroom to Encourage Tolerance and Respect.\u201d MS Thesis.

Beijing\u2019s municipal government is waging a targeted, unethical and destructive campaign against migrant communities.On November 18, 2017, a fire killed 19 people in a blue-collar apartment, prompting China\u2019s capital to initiate a safety blitz against \u201cillegal structures\u201d on its outskirts, seeking to \u201cimprove safety,\u201d according to government officials. Consequently, thousands of migrants living in these low-rent areas were forced to move or leave Beijing entirely with as little as one day\u2019s notice, as their homes and business were destroyed. These mass evictions trample on the human rights of Chinese citizens and were met with unusual public backlash. Over 100 Chinese intellectuals authored an open letter condemning the governmental actions and demanding an immediate termination of the campaign, compensation to the evicted, and increased awareness of the migrants\u2019 rights.Furthermore, the illegitimate displacements pose a serious threat to the psychological health of victims and deprive migrant children of equal access to education. At Yingbo, a private kindergarten in suburban Beijing, dozens of security officers forcibly evacuated students, causing significant trauma. Geoffrey Crothall, the director of China Labour Bulletin, explains that this coldblooded operation \u201creinforced [evictees\u2019] feelings of resentment and social exclusion.\u201dIn fact, this campaign fits into China\u2019s ongoing efforts to shrink Beijing\u2019s population. Home to approximately 21.7 million residents (including 8 million migrants), the city suffers from a \u201cmetropolitan disease\u201d and desperately needs a reduction in size. Last year, the level of annual per capita water resources was one-eightieth of the world average. In 2014, Beijing had the country\u2019s highest rates of congestion and per capita commuting time. In an attempt to transform the overcrowded capital into an upscale metropolis, Beijing aims to cap its population at 23 million by 2020.However, diluting the population of Beijing by evicting migrant workers has an acutely negative impact on the city. A Forbes study shows that the total GDP of Chinese cities is proportional to its migrant population. As Beijing\u2019s population ages, migrants are a vital bulwark against failing social and economic institutions. Li Tie, the president of the China City Development Center, states, \u201cBeijing cannot survive without them.\u201dPolicymakers must consider patterns of urban ecology when reforming Beijing. The government should allow more time for migrant families to move between houses, jobs and schools, as necessary. To empower this vital community, new employment opportunities and relocation compensation should be offered. As Beijing strives to transform into a world-class capital, it must stop treating migrants like second-class citizens.Works Cited\u201cBeijing\u2019s Total Water Consumption Will Be Less Than 4 Billion This Year.\u201d The Beijing News, 18 May 2017.Buckley, Chris. \u201cWhy Part of Beijing Looks Like a Devastated War Zone.\u201d The New York Times. 30 Nov. 2017.Hernandez, Javier and Zhao, Iris. \u201cOne Target in Beijing\u2019s Migrant Crackdown: Schoolchildren.\u201d The New York Times. 24 Dec. 2017.\u201cLi Tie: Beijing Cannot Survive without the Migrants.\u201d Sina Finance. 29 Nov. 2017.Ma, Beibei \u201cBeijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform Analyzes Four Major Causes of the \u2018Metropolitan Disease\u2019 of Beijing.\u201d China Youth Online. 23 Jan. 2016.\u201cNotice on Special Operations for Security Hazard.\u201d Beijing Municipal Work Safety Committee, 20 Nov. 2017.________Abortion is one of the most polarizing topics in the United States. For many on both sides, you\u2019re either with them or against them, and unwilling to compromise. But what if there was a way to reduce abortion rates without blocking women from getting them? The answer is simple: better sex education.For the past few decades there has been a large push to end the abstinence-only sex education implemented by many schools across the U.S. Several studies have found that an abstinence-only education does not work, as it is becoming increasingly unlikely to expect young people to remain abstinent until they are married, considering the increasing age of marriage. There has also been significant evidence that cohesive sex ed classes decrease the chances of unplanned pregnancy and abortion. In theory, abstinence is an idealistic solution, but it has been shown time and time again to be unsuccessful in practice.One program that has actually shown positive results is the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which is evidence-based and funds a wide variety of organizations working to prevent teen pregnancy. In the past decade the CDC has reported the average teenage birthrate has dropped more than 40 percent, due to the help of the TPP and similar programs.After defunding the planned parenthood budget and closing 81 clinics in Texas, teen abortion rates were found to have risen a significant amount. Meanwhile, Colorado offered free birth control, and teen abortions decreased by 42 percent in just 4 years. This is just one example of how it has been shown that limiting access to family planning services such as planned parenthood actually drives up the need for abortions, while providing contraception and informing people of how to be safe drives the need for abortion down. Why is it then that Republican lawmakers continue to slash funding for these organizations?It would be logical to assume that an administration with a pro-life agenda would be eager to decrease abortions in any way they could, however, this seems to not be the case. Regardless of its proven benefits, the Trump administration canceled funding for 81 projects in the TPP program, while increasing funds for abstinence programs. The fact that the government is ignoring fact-based evidence under the guise of being \u201cpro-life\u201d is appalling. It has been shown that quality sex education is highly beneficial, and if the government truly wants to stop abortions from happening, this is the way to do it. Until then, we need to call them out for their blatant hypocrisy and urge legislators to pay attention to the facts, protect the rights of its citizens and remind others to stay informed.Works CitedBaker, Aspen. \u201cA Better Way to Talk about Abortion.\u201d TED: Ideas Worth Spreading, May 2015.Bassett, Laura. \u201cTeen Abortions Surged In Texas After Republicans Defunded Planned Parenthood.\u201d The Huffington Post, 12 July 2017.Bennet, James. \u201cOpinion | The Gathering Threat to Abortion Rights.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 31 Jan. 2018.Bump, Philip. \u201cAnalysis | How America Feels about Abortion.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 24 April 2017.Carroll, Aaron E. \u201cSex Education Based on Abstinence?

Discussions with my peers in the wake of the #MeToo movement have yielded shared feelings of disgust toward these abusers, and horror that we too may be part of the problem. This fear stems not from acknowledgment that we have facilitated harassment, but rather from the uncertainty of what constitutes reprehensible behavior. Our shared worry was not spurred by Harvey Weinstein or Matt Lauer ..., but instead from claims brought against Aziz Ansari. The allegations against Mr. Ansari appeared to be a landmark event, for instead of universally turning favor against him, they divided the community. Some notable feminists, including Bari Weiss, even began to back Ansari. Following the release of the allegations Weiss published an article in The New York Times in which she calls for women to be more vocal about their wishes, and states that lumping Ansari in with other accused abusers \u201ctrivializes what the #MeToo movement first stood for.\u201d This sentiment was shared by my peers. Following the publication of the original expos\u00e9, my morning commute was dominated by debates over whether what Ansari did was wrong, and whether his accuser went too far. The fact that such discussions occurred is evidence of a systematic problem across the younger generations; we are unsure what exactly constitutes inappropriate sexual behavior.The Economist recently published the results of a survey in which participants were asked whether they felt certain actions constituted sexual harassment. The findings were divided by nation, age and gender. The study concluded that in the U.S. there exists both a generational and gender gap. Older generations were shown to be less likely than younger generations to view actions such as commenting on attractiveness to be sexual harassment. Similarly, women were far more likely to view actions as harassment than their male counterparts. The divide demonstrated by the study coupled with the discourse surrounding Ansari paint a picture of a society confused, unsure and anxious. The only viable solution to such sentiments is further education.I propose redefining sexual harassment and restructuring the way young men are taught about relationships. I believe that boys should be taught from a young age what is and is not acceptable, similarly to how young children are taught the difference between a \u201cgood touch\u201d and a \u201cbad touch.\u201d While I understand my claims may be viewed as shortsighted or worse, defensive of predators, my intent is the opposite. We young men know we are the problem and that until we change these issues will still occur. We want to be a part of the solution and long for education.Works Cited\u201cOver-Friendly, or Sexual Harassment?

It\u2019s easy, often helpful, and most importantly: free.But soon, everything about that is going to change.On December 14, 2017, the Federal Commissions Committee (FCC) voted to repeal 2015\u2019s net neutrality rules, officially called Title II. These rules required internet service providers (ISPs) to give equal access to all content online without charging its consumers for higher quality, nor special treatment to certain websites. This repeal may not change the web drastically, but it will take the entire internet as we know it and chuck it down the drain.The ringleader behind the repeal, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, claimed last April that Title II \u201cabandon[s] successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom.\u201d But let\u2019s travel to net-neutrality-free countries like Portugal, where these hypothetical harms are already a reality. Portugal\u2019s wireless carrier, Meo, splits internet access into packages: a package where customers pay for traditional data, plus monthly paying packages for any other sites and apps they use \u2014 entertainment, shopping, communication. For instance, more data for both messaging apps and social networks cost \u20ac4.99 [$5.86] a month each. This means you could be paying up to $140.64 USD a year for both packages. Imagine losing almost $150 a year, just for your favorite messaging and social media sites.But wait, there\u2019s more! With no net neutrality, an ISP could block any access to an app unless the customer or the app company pays up. ISPs who view a site as a competitor, or even disagree with their political views, can be censored.And if Portugal can do that, what\u2019s stopping America from doing the same? Without the safety blanket of net neutrality, what\u2019s stopping them from silencing social movements like Black Lives Matter? Suppressing resources from communities that need them most like women, the LGBT+ and immigrants? It doesn\u2019t just hurt small businesses trying to expand, students living in poverty, or even long-distance relationships relying on the internet to communicate. It blocks any of our voices from being heard.Net neutrality is hanging by a thread, but there\u2019s still a small flicker of hope in the midst of the internet\u2019s impending doomsday. Recently, congressional Democrats introduced a resolution of disapproval to counter the FCC\u2019s repeal. Both the House and Senate must pass it in under 60 days.To my fellow Gen Z kids, and those older too \u2014 the clock is ticking. It\u2019s time to let these people know we want to save our messy, manic and magical internet.Works CitedCollins, Keith. \u201cWhy Net Neutrality Was Repealed and How It Affects You.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Dec. 2017.

In a world where freedom is a luxury, underaged brides watch their aspirations die as they are sold into patriarchal family structures that display the very roots of male dominance. The underage marriage of Indian women must be eradicated in order to protect the interests of women worldwide.According to UNICEF\u2019s Child Marriage Statistics, an estimated 47 percent of girls in India continue to be involuntarily married before the age of eighteen \u2014 leaving them little time to grow and develop their social footing. Misogyny is inevitable for several of these girls \u2014 many of their fathers marry them off in an attempt to increase food rations and investments in men, who are regarded as more valuable in rural Indian societies. Unfortunately, girls are simply seen as a \u201cliability and a burden,\u201d according to Dinesh Shur, a village pastor, in a CBN article detailing child marriage in India.As such, futures remain desolate for child brides in rural India. Their educational careers are left on an indefinite hold as they bear children, often by the time they reach puberty. Instead, they spend their time doing dreary chores for their husband\u2019s families. \u201cAfter marriage, what is my work now? Washing dishes, cleaning the floor, washing clothes and cooking,\u201d states Seema, in an article written by Nel Hedayat that details the life of a child bride. With no education, no work experience and no one to turn to, child brides are left dependent on any support offered by their in-laws.What families don\u2019t realize is that by allowing girls to obtain an education rather than being forced into domestic labor could lead to the socioeconomic advancement of India as this enables potential members of the workforce. Additionally, jobs will provide women with financial security and a voice in a male-dominated society. The New York Times article \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?\u201d states: \u201cWorking, and the control of assets it allows, lowers rates of domestic violence and increases women\u2019s decision-making in the household. And an economy where all the most able citizens can enter the labor force is more efficient and grows faster.\u201dAfter being upheld for thousands of years, child marriage may seem hard to stop; but it is all of our duties to help these girls through supporting and donating to educational, self-defense and women\u2019s rights groups in India. We must strive to make it possible that no young woman will ever have to see a day when a price tag is set upon her self worth and freedom again.Works CitedHedayat, Nel. \u201cWhat Is It like to Be a Child Bride?\u201d BBC News, BBC, 4 Oct. 2011.Pande, Rohini, and Charity Troyer Moore. \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 Aug. 2015.Thomas, George. \u201cIndia\u2019s Innocent: Secret Weddings of Child Brides.\u201d CBN.com \u2014 The Christian Broadcasting Network, 26 March 2017.\u201cUNICEF Child Marriage Statistics.\u201d UNICEF.________It\u2019s a Saturday evening. You\u2019re flipping through the television channels when you stumble upon the movie \u201cShe\u2019s All That.\u201d Or \u201cAnother Cinderella Story.\u201d Or \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d While each may have different characters, plot lines and messages, they are all classified as teen movies, which means they share one common feature: bullying.The bullying that occurs in these films is usually of a specific type: The football player and his buddies see the nerd with his calculator in the hallway and shove him into a locker. The cheerleaders fill the chubby girl\u2019s locker with soda so that when she opens it, she gets drenched. The huge bodybuilder of a senior beats up the scrawny freshman who accidentally bumped his backpack.I don\u2019t know if times have changed or movie writers have just forgotten what it felt like to be in high school, but in my four years of being a student, bullying has rarely been carried out in this manner. More often, it happens in whispers, through subtly closed off circles, through feigned compliments that turn into mocking giggles as soon as backs are turned. It happens over the internet: in group chats that exclude one specific person, in comments of \u201cGORGEOUS!\u201d under an Instagram post that the commenters definitely do not think is gorgeous. This cyberbullying is particularly prevalent in the lives of current teenagers, who have almost unlimited access to social media, and it \u201ccan have such a negative impact \u2026 [and] can do great harm to a whole peer group, or to school culture more generally.\u201d These more subtle types of harassment seem to be more prominent in a high school setting than physical attacks, and hurt much more.Most teen movies fail to capture this kind of bullying accurately, and in this way contribute to an unrealistic view of high school life. Bullying can have very strong effects on teenagers, \u201ccausing depression and anxiety \u2026 disrupting [teenagers\u2019] sleep, [and] causing gastrointestinal issues and headaches.\u201d If movies continue to portray bullying in the wrong way, not only may these symptoms be increased as teenagers begin to feel that their own experiences are invalid, but people will not be able to recognize true bullying behaviors. Kids are taught constantly in school not to be a bystander, but even the most noble of students cannot be expected to intervene when they don\u2019t realize that someone is being bullied. Teen movie writers need to take on the responsibility that comes with targeting the adolescent demographic, and complete research and focus groups to make sure that they are portraying one of the most common experiences in teenage life accurately. This, if nothing else, they owe to their viewers.Works CitedKlass, Perri. \u201cIn the Fight Against Bullying, a Glimmer of Hope.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 Dec. 2017.Strickland, Ashley. \u201cBullying Is a \u2018Serious Public Health Problem,\u2019 Experts Say.\u201d CNN, CNN, 21 June 2017._________\u201cI swear, I\u2019m so OCD,\u201d the girl says after neatly placing a bundle of colored pencils into a decorated pouch. I offer an awkward laugh, but all I can think about is my friend, who\u2019s OCD keeps him from going to school and hanging out with friends, or the article I read that says people with OCD are 10 times more likely than people without to commit suicide. How many times have you heard similar off-handed comments? \u201cThis class makes me depressed.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s so psycho.\u201d Today, a girl described the weather as \u201cbipolar.\u201d These comments are thrown around frequently without any thought to the harm they might be doing. Even I\u2019ve done it. Most of the time there\u2019s no malice, but comments like these, which trivialize serious illnesses, feed a society that stigmatizes the mentally ill, isolating them and making it impossible for them to live fulfilling lives.Using mental illnesses like descriptive adjectives and not serious disorders is trivializing, and contributes to the stigmatization of those afflicted. NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) estimates that 1 in 5 Americans suffers from a mental illness, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. \u2014 claiming well over 41,000 lives a year. In simpler words, mental illness is a big deal; such a big deal the World Health Organization sites depression \u2014 just one of many mental illnesses \u2014 as the leading cause of disability. So why do we act like they\u2019re not by using them as descriptors or for cheap laughs?Mental illness stigma leads to misunderstandings about the conditions and can create barriers to accessing treatment. In the New York Times piece \u201cAlone With My Husband\u2019s Secret,\u201d Carolyn Ali writes of her husband\u2019s struggle with depression. Even after telling his wife, he asked to keep his condition a secret from his family members because of fear of their reaction. Ali says the experience also took a tremendous toll on her. She wonders why these surprisingly common experiences are kept secret and why the stigma exists. This is just one story, but it underscores what experts say about stigma being a major cause of under-treatment.Although there are many things that lead to the stigmatization of mental illness, and many reasons for treatment barriers, the trivializing of these conditions through jokes and minimization of the severity of the conditions is contributing to the exacerbation of the problem. It can be easily addressed through increased understanding of the words we use to describe experiences and ourselves. Recognizing how serious these disorders are and choosing not to use them as merely descriptors for an exaggerated situation is one small step to a society where stigma won\u2019t prevent those from getting the treatment that they need.Works CitedAli, Carolyn. \u201cAlone With My Husband\u2019s Secret.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 Feb. 2018.Hawkes, Nigel. \u201cStigma Is Leading to under-Treatment of Mental Health Conditions, Says Leading Psychiatrist.\u201d The BMJ, British Medical Journal Publishing Group, 21 April 2016.\u201cMental Health By The Numbers.\u201d NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness, 12 March 2018.\u201cPatients with OCD Are 10 Times More Likely to Commit Suicide.\u201d ScienceDaily, ScienceDaily, 19 July 2016.Wilkerson, Abby L. \u201cShould I Tell My Students I Have Depression?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Dec. 2016._______As R. David Lankes once said, \u201cBad libraries build collections, good libraries build services, and great libraries build communities.\u201d In an age where access to the internet is becoming more and more prevalent in people\u2019s lives, some argue that libraries are more of a financial burden than a benefit to society. However, libraries are more than an obsolete source of information. They are places of community and opportunity still important to this day, and thus should not be discarded but adapted for modern purposes.According to the Editorial Board from The New York Times, in 2015 more people visited New York\u2019s libraries than all the baseball stadiums, sports arenas, city-owned museums, gardens and zoos combined. This could be due to the fact that \u201cvirtually all libraries provide free access to the internet [and] WiFi\u201d as reported by the American Library Association. For some, libraries are even a safe haven. One woman called Sandra recalled, \u201c[Libraries were] a space to feel safe. During my high school years of hormone induced mental imbalance, I knew that I could depend on my local library.\u201d The continued use of libraries and the invaluable services they offer, such as technology training and workshops, proves the necessity of libraries in the modern world.Even more than a library\u2019s usefulness for information and support, they also provide a place for the city\u2019s community to gather. The American Library Association found that libraries have been used for book clubs, classes, forums and more. From study groups to citywide events, libraries are the ideal location for people to come together. And in an age where people\u2019s lives are becoming increasingly digitized and secluded, community is all the more important. As a high school student who utilizes the library at least once a week, I can sincerely say that I have built friendships between those bookshelves.Some people may argue that libraries still cling to archaic methods, which extremely diminishes their useful potential. And some libraries are indeed losing their effectiveness by sticking with old routines as the world shifts to a digital face. But many libraries have already adapted wonderfully to the changes. From starting online ebook libraries to integrating new software into their systems, these libraries prove that the answer is not to shut down libraries, but to help them change.Libraries are invaluable for their services, support and the opportunities they offer for the community. By helping them to adapt to current technology and modern techniques, we can ensure that libraries will continue to benefit their cities. So support your local library and take advantage of its services. Maybe you\u2019ll learn something new, or make an unexpected friend. And who knows? You may even read a book while you\u2019re there.Works Cited\u201cALA Library Fact Sheet 6.\u201d American Library Association.The Editorial Board. \u201cNew York City\u2019s Libraries Need Money.\u201d The New York Times.

Unfortunately, this is exactly the life of women in Saudi Arabia, where the treatment of women restricts their fundamental human rights.During my two years living in Dubai and Qatar, I went to Saudi Arabia three times with my father where I witnessed their discriminatory policies. In a mall in Riyadh, I was shocked to see a woman awkwardly eating noodles without taking off the veil of her niqab. She used a fork to lift the noodles toward the eye-opening, and slightly pulled the lower part away from her face, then pointed the fork down so the noodles would slide onto the inside of the veil without revealing her face.As it turns out, the Saudi government strictly prohibits women in public from ever taking off their niqabs. Saudi Arabia claims these restrictions are to ensure \u201cwomen\u2019s modesty\u201d commanded by Allah. Yet, not only are these restrictions undignifying, the Quran calls for \u201cboth men and women \u2018to cover and be modest.\u2019\u201d The fact that the Saudi government only restrict women reveals a double standard.However demeaning the requirement of wearing a niqab in public might be, it is only one symptom of a system that restricts women\u2019s fundamental rights. According to Human Rights Watch, Saudi females\u2019 lives are controlled by male guardians from birth to death due to its unique guardianship system. As hundreds of Saudi females have attested, this is a most inhuman policy as the male guardian decides whether \u201chis\u201d woman can see a doctor or even leave prison. Presumably, Saudi leadership, composed entirely of men, believes that women are unable to make the types of decisions that men make. Over time, the system gradually changes Saudi women\u2019s mind-sets, reducing them to men\u2019s property, even in their hearts. Rania, a 34-year-old Saudi woman, said, \u201cWe are entrusted with raising the next generation but you can\u2019t trust us with ourselves. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dWhile the Saudi government argues that these policies are protecting women, they have nothing to do with protection and everything to do with dehumanization. However, President Trump has proposed multiple economic collaborations with Saudi Arabia, and during his recent meeting with Prince Salman, \u201cover 20 people were at the table, yet none were women.\u201d This symbolic irony along with other policies reveal the U.S. government\u2019s unwillingness to address this gender disparity.It is time for our free nation to push for urgently-needed reforms by placing conditions of ending human rights violations to U.S.-Saudi trade deals. Instead of ignoring these human rights abuses, the United States of America should show the world that abuses are not tolerated.Works Cited\u201cBoxed In: Women and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Male Guardianship System.\u201d Human Rights Watch, 6 June 2017.Cochrane, Emily. \u201cOver 20 People Were at the Table When Trump Met the Saudis.

That is, well, tobacco in the form of cigarettes. Now, because of vape pens \u2014 technology that delivers nicotine through heated oils \u2014 American youth are experiencing the rapid rebranding of our favorite vice. While vape companies such as Juul are capitalizing on the image of a sleeker, less carcinogenic way of getting buzzed, vaping is simply a method of concealing nicotine use, without eliminating any of its physiological consequences. The discreet nature of vaping and the game of cat and mouse that it inspires between teachers and students is prompting a psychological shift among youth that enables drug consumption, while masquerading as doing the opposite.Joe Camel, the icon of tobacco conglomerate R.J. Reynolds, was executed in 1997, after nearly a decade of representing the Camel brand of cigarettes. The reasoning behind the federal government\u2019s decision to outlaw the swaggering camel was that he made smoking seem carefree and enticing to youth. Currently we are experiencing a more subtle version of the Joe Camel, in which vape pens such as Juul are reclaiming fun, risqu\u00e9 smoking. Not only do vapers have a nearly endless array of flavors to choose from, they also have apparatus that can disappear in a closed fist, according to a review of the Juul pen by NPR, in which owning a Juul is like a badge of honor. \u201cY\u2019all this kid came into my 7th period to get a juul and we all started laughing when he left so the teacher was really confused,\u201d according to @hyphyybriannaa, quoted in the study.A recent Times report on vaping attributes vaping partially to a decline in teenage cigarette smoking. While vaping is indeed helping teens move away from more carcinogenic forms of consuming nicotine, it also has the detrimental effect of making drug use seem more commonplace, cosmetic and convenient. After all, some brands of vaporizer can be charged in a laptop USB port, and concealed all day for undetectable puffing. Vaping might in fact just be hiding the harmful effect of drugs through a sleek image. In the National Institute on Drug Abuse study cited in the Times report, 51.8 percent of teens surveyed claimed that the substance inside vaporizers was \u201cjust liquid.\u201dDoes better technology make drug use permissive? No, but it certainly makes it easier. Vape pens are likely going to be short-lived in schools, which will make them only more appealing to youth. In order to truly lessen drug use, government and schools have to go after image, not just drugs themselves.Works CitedChen, Angus. \u201cTeenagers Embrace JUUL, Saying It\u2019s Discreet Enough To Vape In Class.\u201d NPR. 4 December 2017.Elliot, Stuart. \u201cJoe Camel, a Giant in Tobacco Marketing, Is Dead at 23.\u201d The New York Times. 11 July 1997.Hoffman, Jan. \u201cMarijuana and Vaping Are More Popular Than Cigarettes Among Teenagers.\u201d The New York Times. 14 December 2017.________Since 1970, the global Catholic population has nearly doubled. At the same time, 5,000 fewer priests are active in the Church, creating a worldwide priest shortage in which more than 20 percent of parishes lack a resident priest. To address this crisis, the Catholic Church should end the ban on female ordination.Although most supporters of a male-only clergy cite Church tradition, ordaining women only chafes against modern constraints. In fact, the Church didn\u2019t change their rules on ordination in this respect until the 11th century. To be clear, this means women served as priests, deaconesses and even bishops for nearly 1000 years. In the early Middle Ages, the changing Church not only closed these roles to men, but attempted to change contemporary and ancient records to obscure that women ever served in these roles, a campaign that has been remarkably successful through modern times.If tradition is not enough proof, then perhaps Scripture itself provides a better basis. In Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans, he refers to \u201cour sister Phoebe, a deacon\u201d (Rom 16:1). Further, his letter to the Galatians states that \u201cIn Christ there is no Jew or Greek, slave or citizen, male or female. All are one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Gal 3:28). Even the Gospels show the importance of women to Jesus\u2019s ministry. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is widely accepted as the first disciple, and the first Apostles, or witnesses to the Resurrection, are all women, including Mary Magdalene, who reveals the news to the initially disbelieving male disciples. When it comes to celebrating the Resurrection, the purpose of a Catholic Mass, Scripture proves women are equally qualified to do so.If there ever was a time to expand the priesthood, it is now. The Francis Effect has expanded the laity in new ways, welcoming lapsed Catholics disillusioned by social positions of the Church and the sexual abuse scandal, as well as LGBT Catholics. The energy of young people on the side of the Francis Effect can and should be harnessed by a movement to allow women to fulfill their vocation to the priesthood.However, proponents of ordaining women should acknowledge the difficulty of any movement in an institution as reluctant to change as the Church. Some dioceses in the United States don\u2019t even allow girls to altar serve, and Pope Francis, the face of the inclusive Church movement, has made clear his opposition to ordaining women. Still, if Church leaders want to recruit more priests to end the shortage, they would be wise to open the position to the other half of the population.Works CitedEgan, Timothy. \u201cA Francis Effect for a Broken System.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 24 Sept. 2015.\u201cFrequently Requested Church Statistics.\u201d CARA, Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, 2017.Macy, Gary. \u201cThe Hidden History of Women\u2019s Ordination: Female Clergy in the Medieval West.\u201d Oxford University Press, 2008._________In 1997, Tarana Burke was working at a youth camp when a 13-year-old girl told Ms. Burke that her stepfather had been sexually abusing her. Tarana was left speechless \u2014 what could she tell the girl, and hundreds of others in her position, that would convey that she understood and felt their pain? Ten years after that conversation, Ms. Burke finally found what she needed to say: me too.As a survivor of child sexual assault, I have been waiting for these two words for a very long time \u2014 seeing the #MeToo movement explode empowered me to share my experiences with others after years of being silent. The #MeToo movement brought me to a place in which I felt that I could openly discuss my experience without judgment or victim blaming. Saying #MeToo is a statement of understanding like no other. But what must remain fundamental is that the movement is about more than awareness and empathy. It is also about changes to laws and policies that perpetuate the imbalance of power between men and women. It is about challenging social norms and a culture in which the victim is instinctively blamed for the crime.This issue requires us, as a society, to examine ourselves and our culture that allows and encourages this type of behavior. At some point, we must ask ourselves if the \u201cproblem\u201d of sexual assault is an unintended consequence or the purposeful product of a system designed to systematically isolate, silence and marginalize those with lesser power. A report from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that 75 percent of workplace harassment incidents go unreported \u2014 for those who did speak out, 75 percent faced retaliation from their employer. A matter of such magnitude cannot be mended on a case-by-case basis. Comprehensively fixing this issue starts with providing women effective reporting options beyond filing a complaint with HR or talking to their managers \u2014 options that often have only the company\u2019s best interest at heart \u2014 and giving women decision-making roles in which they have the same chance for success as men.Although the #MeToo movement is not exempt from criticism, those who call it as a \u201cmoral panic\u201d are misdiagnosing it. What #MeToo is a social movement that finally holds powerful men accountable for their actions; as author David Perry writes, #MeToo is not an act of persecution, but rather a rebellion against the powers that persecute. In order for our culture to change and in order for future generations to grow up in an equitable world, we must build on #MeToo as a vehicle for reform in our courts, workplaces and schools. It is a wake-up call and an opportunity to inspire genuine change \u2014 an opportunity that we cannot waste.Works CitedBeck, Richard. \u201c#MeToo Is Not a Witch Hunt.\u201d Vox. 11 Jan. 2018.Bennett, Jessica. \u201cThe #MeToo Moment: No Longer Complicit.\u201d The New York Times. 7 Dec. 2017.Campbell, Alexia Fernandez. \u201cHow the Legal System Fails Victims of Sexual Harassment.\u201d Vox. 30 March 2018.Garcia, Sandra. \u201cThe Woman Who Created #MeToo Long Before the Hashtag.\u201d The New York Times. 20 Oct. 2017.Golshan, Tara. \u201cStudy Finds 75 Percent of Workplace Harassment Victims Experienced Retaliation When They Spoke Up.\u201d Vox. 15 Oct. 2017.Gorman, Michele. \u201c1 in 4 Women Experienced Sexual Assault in College, Survey Finds.\u201d Newsweek. 21 Sept. 2015.Guerra, Cristela. \u201cWhere\u2019d the \u2018Me Too\u2019 Initiative Really Come From?

{"Headline": "A Year After Trump\u2019s Paris Pullout, U.S. Companies Are Driving a Renewables Boom", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne big question, however, is whether these corporate renewable deals will remain a relatively niche market, adding some wind and solar at the margins but not really making a sizable dent in overall emissions, or whether these companies can use their clout to transform America\u2019s grid and help usher in a new era of low-carbon power.That trend appears to be accelerating. Corporations have already announced deals for another 2.48 gigawatts of wind and solar in the first half of 2018, as companies like AT&T and Nestl\u00e9 join the search for cleaner power to fulfill their sustainability goals and take advantage of the rapidly declining cost of renewables.\u201cBut with how fast wind and solar prices have fallen, we see this as something that makes financial sense,\u201d he said.\u201cWe think this is a major trend,\u201d said Lisa Wood, vice president of customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute, a major utility trade group. \u201cCustomers are becoming the driver.\u201dThese agreements have gotten increasingly sophisticated: Companies can even arrange to pay for a new wind farm in a different state, such as Oklahoma, and obtain credits from the project even if the electricity is going to someone else. (Basically, the buyer is creating new wind power without using it directly.)\u201cIf we can show utilities that the demand is there, that could convince regulators to expand these programs and allow access for smaller companies,\u201d said Rob Threlkeld, global manager for renewable energy at G.M., which has set the goal to buy 100 percent renewable power by 2050.Mr. Janous of Microsoft, who is engaged in these discussions, says that this aggregation has so far proven to be incredibly challenging. \u201cBut if it\u2019s just Microsoft or just the Fortune 500 companies buying renewable power, that\u2019s not going to be transformative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go beyond that.\u201dA few companies, most notably Google, are now wrestling with an even harder question: What if simply buying up large quantities of wind and solar power isn\u2019t enough?But, as Google itself readily acknowledges, this doesn\u2019t mean that the company is truly powered by 100 percent renewable energy. In many cases, its wind and solar farms operate in different regions (or different countries) than the company\u2019s data centers do. What\u2019s more, the wind and solar farms it has procured don\u2019t provide steady power 24 hours a day, whereas Google\u2019s data centers run around the clock. That means the company is essentially still reliant on fossil fuels to keep the broader grid running.For its next phase, Google wants to locate all of its clean-energy projects in the same grid regions as its data centers, even though that will mean prodding policymakers in places like Taiwan to overhaul electricity markets and allow companies to make direct purchases. Google is also trying to figure out how to assemble a suite of zero-carbon energy sources that can run 24 hours a day, which may require additional technologies like battery storage, demand response programs or even nuclear power.But achieving that goal will take years, and is likely to be far more complicated than simply signing renewable energy contracts.\u201cReaching 100 percent renewable energy is an important milestone, but it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d said Michael Terrell, head of energy market strategy at Google. \u201cWe have to keep our eyes on the ultimate prize, which is to enable carbon free power in every hour of every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China Trade War, Apple Worries It Will Be Collateral Damage", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, may be the leader of the world\u2019s most valuable public company, but lately he has had to act a lot like the tech industry\u2019s top diplomat.Last month he visited the Oval Office to warn President Trump that tough talk on China could threaten Apple\u2019s position in the country. In March, at a major summit meeting in Beijing, he called for \u201ccalmer heads\u201d to prevail between the world\u2019s two most powerful countries.Since he took over Apple from its co-founder Steve Jobs, in 2011, questions about whether Mr. Cook, 57, could recreate the magic that led to the iPod and iPhone have persisted. For Mr. Cook, the analogous breakthrough \u2014 and potentially his legacy as the heir to Mr. Jobs \u2014 has come not from a gadget, but from a geography: China.Under Mr. Cook\u2019s leadership, Apple\u2019s business in China grew from a fledgling success to an empire with annual revenues of around $50 billion \u2014 just a bit under a quarter of what the company takes in worldwide. He did this while China was tightening internet controls and shutting out other American tech giants.The Trump administration has told Mr. Cook that it would not place tariffs on iPhones, which are assembled in China, according to a person familiar with the talks who declined to speak on the record for fear of upsetting negotiations. But Apple is worried China will retaliate in ways that hamstring its business, according to three people close to Apple who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.There is also concern that Apple could face reprisals for legal and regulatory efforts in Washington that have made it difficult for the Chinese tech giant Huawei to sell its phones and telecom equipment in the United States.Apple executives and lobbyists in Beijing and Washington, led by Mr. Cook, have been trying to work both sides. They have fostered close ties to the administration of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, an effort called Red Apple by employees at Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, after the official color of the Chinese Communist Party.At the same time, Mr. Cook has been pleading with the Trump White House to understand that a trade war is bad for the economy \u2014 and bad for Apple.Mr. Cook, who knows a bit of Mandarin, has attended China\u2019s most important political events in a critical year for Mr. Xi. Days after a Chinese Communist Party congress wrote Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas and name into the constitution, elevating him to the same status as Mao Zedong, Mr. Cook joined a small group of American and Chinese executives for a meeting where Mr. Xi lectured about innovation and reform.Later, Mr. Cook attended China\u2019s World Internet Conference, an effort by Beijing to create a Davos-like conference for technology. There he met Wang Huning, a new member of China\u2019s standing committee \u2014 the party\u2019s top leadership group \u2014 and an ideological force behind China\u2019s deepening authoritarianism.In March, just after an annual meeting of China\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament formally abolished presidential term limits, Mr. Cook attended a major summit meeting that brings together Chinese policymakers and corporate leaders.Then Mr. Cook switched to explaining why he thought a trade war would reverse the new tax law\u2019s progress, the people said. Mr. Cook told the president that tariffs were effectively a tax on consumers and that the trade deficit with China is inflated because of flaws in how it is calculated, one of the people said.\u201cHe was very helpful in making some suggestions, and I might also add he loves the tax cut and tax reform,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC shortly after the meeting. \u201cHe says Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.\u201dMr. Trump has also told crowds this year that Apple planned to build multiple factories in the United States. Apple has no plans to do so and has not publicly corrected him.He has met with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, but they tend to disagree on trade issues, this person said, and he has avoided engaging with perhaps the administration\u2019s most hawkish member on trade, Peter Navarro, a top adviser to the president.Mr. Cook still sees an opening to engage on the trade issue because of disagreement inside the White House, and he doubts that a trade war \u2014 or Chinese retaliation against Apple \u2014 ultimately will happen, this person said.\u201cHe\u2019s willing to put a brave face on and work with the Trump administration because they probably have more at stake than any other tech company when it comes to China and the tariffs,\u201d said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and partner at the investment firm Loup Ventures.The specter of Chinese retaliation against Apple has increased since the administration targeted the Chinese tech company ZTE for breaking American sanctions against Iran and North Korea. But the administration backed away from stiffer penalties this month and said it would fine ZTE $1 billion and install a compliance team picked by the United States.Apple, meanwhile, has a deal with China\u2019s biggest telecom company, China Mobile, giving it a direct channel to nearly 900 million subscribers in China. The competition to sell smartphones in the country has become increasingly intense, with a number of other Chinese companies also offering high-end \u2014 but usually lower-priced \u2014 phones.Mr. Cook\u2019s frequent visits to China are part of Apple\u2019s increased efforts to court China\u2019s leadership, started in 2016 after the country suddenly removed Apple\u2019s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store there.The company has reason to fear retaliation. In 2014, the Obama administration indicted five Chinese military hackers, stoking tensions already high from leaks about American surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.Apple\u2019s primary leverage with the Chinese government is Chinese consumers\u2019 love for Apple products, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents Apple and other tech companies.However, Mr. Garfield added, Chinese consumers would also love Facebook and Google, two products blocked in China. \u201cThere are limits,\u201d he said. \u201cXi and the national party will do what\u2019s in their interest.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco and Washington, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon to Buy Online Pharmacy PillPack, Jumping Into the Drug Business", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the world of health care, PillPack, an online pharmacy, is a pretty small player. Its work force of 1,000 or so people pales in comparison with the 235,000 who work for Walgreens.But when Amazon announced on Thursday that it was buying PillPack, the deal immediately shook the industry. Shares of Walgreens and Rite Aid tumbled more than 9 percent, while CVS Health dropped 6.6 percent.That\u2019s because with one move, Amazon answered the question about when \u2014 and how \u2014 it would grab a piece of the $560 billion prescription drug industry.It was precisely the sort of deal that the health care industry had feared.Amazon has been hinting at its interest in selling drugs, but it faced the problem of securing pharmacy licenses in each state. PillPack will help overcome that hurdle, since the start-up is licensed to ship drugs in 50 states \u2014 clearing the way for the e-commerce giant to quickly become a major player in the business.And it will be doing so without much financial stress. Amazon, which has a market value of over $840 billion, is paying about $1 billion for the start-up, according to one person briefed on the deal, who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. Amazon beat out Walmart for the company, the person said.\u201cPillPack\u2019s visionary team has a combination of deep pharmacy experience and a focus on technology,\u201d Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive of its consumer business, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see what we can do together on behalf of customers over time.\u201dPillPack, which started in 2013, distributes pills in easy-to-use packages designed for consumers with chronic conditions and multiple prescriptions. The company sorts prescriptions by the dose and includes a label with a picture of each pill and directions on how it should be taken.TJ Parker, a pharmacist, and Elliot Cohen, an engineer, founded the start-up after meeting through a health care innovation program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company\u2019s primary pharmacy is in Manchester, N.H., but it also has numerous other pharmacies, including in Miami, Brooklyn and Austin, Tex. While it has licenses to deliver drugs in all 50 states, it does not now ship to Hawaii.It has raised $118 million in funding, with investors including Accel Partners, Atlas Venture, CRV, Founder Collective, Menlo Ventures, Sherpa Ventures and Techstars.Its national reach made it an attractive prospect for Amazon, said Adam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, who studies the industry.\u201cIt\u2019s a turnkey mail pharmacy operation,\u201d Mr. Fein said.Even as Americans have shifted their buying habits online, prescription drugs have remained a stubbornly brick-and-mortar purchase. About 90 percent of all prescriptions are filled at a pharmacy counter, according to Iqvia, a research firm.If Amazon can break that habit, it could upend the industry. \u201cIt helps people to eliminate that trip and buy everything they need from Amazon,\u201d said Stephen Buck, a pharmaceutical supply-chain expert who co-founded the drug-price website GoodRx.In a call with investors on Thursday, Stefano Pessina, chief executive officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, said he was not concerned about Amazon\u2019s acquisition. He said the physical pharmacy would remain important to customers in the future.\u201cWe are not complacent, we know we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working in that direction, but we are not worried,\u201d he said.Carolyn Castel, a spokeswoman at CVS Health, said her company had the same abilities as PillPack, with many more existing customers.\u201cKeep in mind that we have not seen a large shift of patients that are looking for their medications to be delivered versus coming to a retail pharmacy,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cAnd for those patients that do desire to transition, we offer the option.\u201dIndependent online pharmacies have had a tough time because consumers who do buy their prescriptions through mail order are often required to do so by their insurance plans. Pharmacy benefit managers have traditionally offered employers and insurers incentives requiring that long-term prescriptions be filled through the managers\u2019 own mail-order pharmacies.And for short-term prescriptions, like antibiotics, many consumers prefer their corner drugstore, since they often need to fill those drugs right away. About 85 percent of prescriptions in the United States are for refills, according to Iqvia.But Mr. Buck and others said Amazon might have a new opportunity. A growing number of Americans are without health insurance or have such high deductibles that they may be better off bargain shopping on their own. He estimated that 25 million Americans fell into that category.Until now, he said, PillPack has not aggressively competed on price. With Amazon in charge, \u201chow about they start posting prices that are really, really aggressive?\u201d Mr. Buck said.The deal for PillPack could be just one piece in Amazon\u2019s broader health ambitions.Amazon has also pushed to expand its medical supplies business, seeking to become a major supplier for hospitals and outpatient clinics. It received wholesale pharmacy licenses from several states this year that permit it to start selling medical equipment to businesses. Its products could be used to supply operating and emergency rooms, along with outpatient locations.The company previously tried to enter the pharmaceutical world in 1999 by purchasing 40 percent of Drugstore.com. However, it ran into logistical and regulatory challenges that ultimately derailed the effort.John Sculley, a former chief executive of Apple and the chief marketing officer of RxAdvance, a pharmacy benefit manager, said PillPack was a natural choice for Amazon.\u201cThis one plays right into everything they know how to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s in their wheelhouse.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Pity the Tech B-List", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsI spent most of the week at the Code Conference, where the tech world\u2019s elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry. It was a fascinating event, less in the sense of newsy product announcements (which there weren\u2019t many of) and more in the general finger-in-the-wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself.Notable at this year\u2019s Code was that there seems to be a growing rift between the largest tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 and the rest of the industry.The shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference, even if their presence was minimal. No executives from Apple, Amazon or Google spoke at Code, and when executives from Microsoft and Facebook did take the stage, they mostly talked about the past. (Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, offered some historical perspective on the company\u2019s antitrust woes from the late 1990s; Sheryl Sandberg and Mike Schroepfer from Facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company\u2019s post-Cambridge Analytica \u201cwe\u2019ll do better\u201d script.)Instead, much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech A-list \u2014 large, popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories, but that have spent years locked in a fight for survival against their bigger, more entrenched rivals.From the perspective of the tech B-list, there are two huge fights to be won. First, you need to establish a foothold in a market, either by out-innovating old-line incumbents \u2014 taxis, hotels, music labels \u2014 or by creating a new market altogether. Then, once you\u2019re established and growing, a bigger worry emerges: What if one of the Big Five squashes you?A good example of a tech B-lister is Spotify, which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers \u2014 the three labels that provide the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s music \u2014 but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by a tech giant. Onstage at Code, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek, fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which have their own music streaming services and, more important, control the hardware platforms (iOS, Android, Alexa) on which people consume music.Mr. Ek mostly deflected, saying that there are \u201cvery, very few opportunities that a billion-plus people around the world care about,\u201d and that the giants\u2019 interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category.Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, sounded a similar note at the conference when asked about Facebook\u2019s habit of blatantly copying Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive product features. (Mr. Spiegel\u2019s sassy comeback \u2014 \u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also\u201d \u2014 was the best line there.)\u201cWell, I believe if you don\u2019t create a pure, vertical, integrated capability, vertically integrated capability \u2014 from distribution all the way through content creation and advertising models \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a hard time competing with these guys. And the statistic we throw out, and since we announced this deal in November of 2016, the FANG market caps have gone up over $1 trillion. You better figure out how to vertically integrate here if you want to compete with those players.\u201dIt\u2019s not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets. It\u2019s more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of a $200 billion telecom giant. And it shows just how dominant the tech A-list has become, and how difficult overcoming its concentration of market power is proving to be.Here are a few other tech stories of note this past week:Advertisement"}

For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201dUnder Mr. Schultz\u2019s three decades managing the company, Starbucks grew from a tiny local chain into a global coffee giant, operating 28,000 stores in 75 countries. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Microsoft\u2019s planned acquisition of GitHub, a software development company, is not close to the company\u2019s largest, and it will not have a big, immediate impact on profits.But the deal is a milestone because it reveals the degree to which the rise in Microsoft\u2019s stock has bolstered its heft as an acquirer.Microsoft\u2019s stock has gone up more than 200 percent since Microsoft agreed in 2013 to pay $7.2 billion in cash for Nokia\u2019s handset and services operations. That price tag amounted to 2.6 percent of Microsoft\u2019s total market value back then. The $7.5 billion Microsoft is paying for GitHub is just under 1 percent of Microsoft\u2019s current market capitalization. This lessens the financial hit if the acquisition falls short of expectations, but increases the upside if it outperforms.In recent years, Microsoft\u2019s valuation has also increased, making its stock even more potent as an acquisition currency. Microsoft\u2019s shares currently trade at around 24 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to data from CapitalIQ. That\u2019s far higher than the 15 times it traded at in mid-2013.But it would be a mistake to conclude that Microsoft has not advanced in the market for acquisitions. Its soaring stock has made sure the company has remained a player in the deals game. The jump in its price-to-earnings ratio makes it more likely that a large deal would bolster earnings per share (after factoring in the extra shares issued to do the deal.) With its operations notching up strong organic growth, Microsoft probably does not need to do a big deal anytime soon. But if one were to crop up, shareholders may not balk.- Peter Eavis Satya Nadella happened, for one. (He succeeded Steve Ballmer as C.E.O. of Microsoft in 2014.) And the cloud, for another.Mr. Ballmer tried to target the flashier end of the consumer hardware market, with things like Windows Phone and the Zune music player. It didn\u2019t work. In contrast, Mr. Nadella has focused on enterprise applications \u2014 and in particular, found huge success in cloud computing.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.The company lags only Amazon Web Services as a cloud provider.Preparing for the futureMr. Nadella is also gearing up for the next big thing to be put into the cloud: artificial intelligence.Because such software is computationally demanding, it makes sense to pay for someone else to run programs on huge servers rather than buying one\u2019s own hardware. But it\u2019s also complex, which means that there is going to be a huge market for user-friendly software that can be taken up by regular developers and not just people with A.I. Ph.D.s.That\u2019s why there\u2019s a big race right now \u2014 between the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others \u2014 to offer up tools in the cloud that can process huge data sets and provide useful insights about them.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWhat Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., said of the transaction:\u201cMicrosoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, a senior Microsoft executive, Nat Friedman, will become GitHub\u2019s C.E.O., while the coding hub\u2019s current chief, Chris Wanstrath, will become a Microsoft technical fellow. The acquisition is expected to close by year end.\u2022 GitHub: $7.5 billion\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Gabriel J.X. Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia:Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing.Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, has been adamant that his company stringently protects its customers\u2019 data privacy. Two news stories raise some questions about that categorical claim.The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Not too incriminating. But it\u2019s a reminder that Apple has made use of the data that passes across Facebook\u2019s platform.Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest\u2019s app for \u201cdrapes\u201d might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for \u201cNFL\u201d might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said.None of this is to say that Apple doesn\u2019t act by its word. But it is an important reminder to continue asking whether it really does.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe latest installment in the movie franchise, \u201cSolo,\u201d had its second disappointing weekend, pulling in just $29.3 million in the U.S. (We use \u201cjust\u201d advisedly.) But perhaps more important, it raises questions about the future of what is supposed to be one of Walt Disney\u2019s biggest moneymakers.The trend hasn\u2019t been reassuring, though. Disney likely took about $1 billion from \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d after accounting for production and marketing costs. But \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d the next movie in the main series, showed a marked drop. (To be fair, \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was the first new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie in more than a decade.)But \u201cSolo\u201d may highlight the pitfalls. Disney has said that it plans to release a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie every year, raising the real risk that moviegoers could end up suffering from Force fatigue. Just five months separated \u201cSolo\u201d from \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d Forcing through more movies \u2014 and video content for Disney\u2019s forthcoming streaming service \u2014 could erode the uniqueness that once defined the franchise\u2019s installments.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe automaker will face tough questions and tricky votes Tuesday at its annual shareholder meeting tomorrow.The company doesn\u2019t publish a sustainability report, which investors say makes it hard to keep tabs on workforce issues such as safety. And they are concerned that Tesla can\u2019t manage infrastructure changes ahead involving electric-vehicles and autonomous-driving cars.G.E. could sell assets to raise the cash, but that will be no easy feat. The conglomerate could sell Baker Hughes, but such a deal may only raise $20 billion, Mr. Tusa writes.\u201cThe bottom line is that we see the need to de-risk substantially, which includes the need for cash and a cut to the dividend to help with operational de-levering.\u201dWhile at Kirkland, Mr. Fraidin worked on transactions like 3G Capital\u2019s takeover of H.J. Heinz and Pershing Square and Valeant Pharmaceuticals\u2019 bid for the drug maker Allergan.From a statement by Pat Quinn, Cadwalader\u2019s managing partner:\u201cSteve brings great energy to our team and we look forward to rolling up our sleeves together in the service of our clients. He will significantly enhance our ability to provide market-leading experience and tailored solutions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedOver the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.If that\u2019s accurate, Apple must tread carefully to avoid comparisons to Facebook.One advantage to being retained by lawyers for a client rather than by the client himself is that Mr. Sitrick is technically a member of the legal team, and therefore protected by attorney-client privilege. And though he is not a lawyer, Mr. Sitrick views himself as a litigator in the court of public opinion. He also charges lawyerly rates \u2014 as much as $1,100 an hour.Most of the time, the winner gets to ask Mr. Buffett for investing advice. But lunch has led to a job offer: Mr. Buffett ultimately hired Ted Weschler, who won the auctions in 2010 and 2011, as one of his two investing lieutenants.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Threatens Harley-Davidson, Saying It \u2018Surrendered\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump lashed out at one of his favorite American manufacturers on Tuesday, criticizing Harley-Davidson over its plans to move some of its motorcycle production abroad and threatening it with punitive taxes in return.In a series of tweets on Tuesday, the president accused the Wisconsin-based company of having \u201csurrendered\u201d in Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with Europe. He told Republican lawmakers at a White House meeting that the move amounted to a betrayal, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been very good to Harley-Davidson.\u201dMr. Trump has made clashes with American corporations a staple of his presidency, previously assailing businesses like Amazon and Carrier. In many cases, business associations and brand experts have counseled companies to maintain a low profile when going up against Mr. Trump and wait for his attention to be diverted to another topic.It is unclear whether that will be the case with Harley-Davidson, an iconic American brand that Mr. Trump has frequently celebrated. Last year, the president invited Harley-Davidson executives to the White House, where he thanked the company for \u201cbuilding things in America.\u201d His affinity for the firm was not lost on the European Union when it looked for retaliatory targets.On Tuesday, the administration fired back at the European Union and other countries that have imposed retaliatory tariffs, calling them \u201cgroundless\u201d and a violation of World Trade Organization rules.Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the reciprocal tariffs imposed by Europe, Canada, Mexico and China \u201cdo great damage to the multilateral trading system,\u201d and he vowed to \u201ctake all necessary actions under both U.S. law and international rules to protect its interests.\u201dEarlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump accused Harley of using the trade dispute as an excuse to send more jobs offshore, after the recent construction of a plant in Thailand. The suggestion echoed the sentiment expressed by one of the unions that represent Harley workers.Harley developed its Thai plant to mitigate tariffs that are in place in Asia, but it decided to move more production abroad in direct response to the new European tariffs. Harley has not said where it will build the bikes for the European market or how many jobs it might cut in the United States as a result.Mr. Trump also revived a threat that he used to lob at companies when he was a presidential candidate, warning Harley that it would pay a financial price for moving manufacturing abroad.While running for office in 2016, he said on several occasions that if elected he would make Ford pay a 35 percent tax on cars that it made in Mexico and sold into the United States. He did not say what presidential authority would give him that power, and the warning on Tuesday appeared to misunderstand \u2014 or misconstrue \u2014 the fact that Harley would be using its overseas production facilities to sell motorcycles in Europe, not back into the United States.Overseas markets have become critical to Harley-Davidson, as sales slow in the United States. The company recently announced plans to consolidate some of its American plants, including closing its factory in Kansas City, Mo., and merging its operations with one in York, Pa.On Tuesday, employees at the York facility said they were sympathetic to Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns but also understood the company\u2019s need to protect its bottom line. Many of the workers voted for Mr. Trump and still support him, but said the president, in his former life as a businessman, would do the same thing Harley-Davidson was doing to survive.\u201cHarley-Davidson is as American as apple pie, and the president understands that,\u201d said Sue Thomas, who does a variety of jobs at the York plant. \u201cI believe he\u2019s a bit hurt, and those who fly the flag high are understandably disappointed because Harley-Davidson is an American treasure.\u201dBut Ms. Thomas added: \u201cI know the president believes Harley-Davidson should work with him, but he\u2019s a businessman, too, and I don\u2019t believe for a moment he wouldn\u2019t do this with his business.\u201dDavid Paige, an 11-year staff engineer at Harley-Davidson, said that what was best for the long-term interests of the business was ultimately best for him, too.\u201cHarley is doing what Harley needs to do to survive, and that\u2019s important to my feeding my family,\u201d Mr. Paige said.The president\u2019s public attack on Harley is likely to further frustrate Republicans, who have been increasingly worried about the fallout from his trade war.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said Tuesday that the company\u2019s move was a sign that unilateral tariffs did not work.\u201cI don\u2019t think tariffs are the right way to go,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI think tariffs are basically taxes, and what ends up happening is you get escalating tariffs, or escalating taxes.\u201dRepresentative Jim Sensenbrenner, another Wisconsin Republican, urged Mr. Trump to take a more targeted approach in his trade negotiations that would protect American workers and businesses.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that such a strong Wisconsin company like Harley-Davidson should have to bear the brunt of this trade dispute,\u201d he said.And Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who is a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, defended Harley\u2019s patriotism and condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies as bad economics.\u201cThis will go over like a Vespa at Sturgis,\u201d Mr. Sasse said, invoking the scooter brand and the South Dakota site of a large annual motorcycle rally. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that Harley is unpatriotic \u2014 it\u2019s that tariffs are stupid.\u201dThe company has remained publicly quiet since announcing its manufacturing decision in a public filing on Monday. The Harley-Davidson Twitter feed has not addressed Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns, and the company declined to make its chief executive available for an interview.At the York plant on Tuesday, a man who identified himself only as \u201cthe boss\u201d handed out a statement reiterating the Monday filing, which said the shift in operations \u201crepresents the only sustainable option\u201d for the company to make its bikes affordable and accessible to European customers.\u201cEurope is a critical market for Harley-Davidson,\u201d the statement said.Alan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Stacy M.

{"Headline": "Apple Shuns the Tech Industry\u2019s Apology Tour", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Sorry, Apple\u2019s not sorry.Though Apple acknowledged the darker side of society\u2019s obsession with the digital world, it didn\u2019t go anywhere near the idea that its own technology might bear any of the blame.Apple did announce several new ways of letting adults and children limit how much time they spend on their phones. A tool called Screen Time, for example, is meant to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps. And parents will be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones.Apple\u2019s software chief, Craig Federighi, said the company felt it was time to address smartphones\u2019 oversize impact on everyday life. \u201cFor some of us, it\u2019s become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we\u2019ve become,\u201d he said.These features looked quite handy \u2014 we will know for sure once they\u2019re released to users this year. If they do push users to quit wasting so much time on Facebook and YouTube (where getting people to waste time is a big part of the business plan), they are sure to roil Apple\u2019s relationship with others in tech.But that is not Apple\u2019s problem; it is more concerned about selling you a new phone.Apple is also putting considerable resources into making its Watch stand apart from its phone, a direction that in the long run will create more opportunities to go without a phone. Are you wearing an Apple Watch instead of carrying an iPhone? In time, Apple may not care.But at its event here, Apple\u2019s support for what\u2019s being called \u201cdigital well-being\u201d often awkwardly butted up against Apple\u2019s larger goal: to make the digital world so awesome, you can\u2019t resist it.The next iPhone will let you turn your face into an emoji, and now it can even do \u201ctongue detection\u201d \u2014 an animated version of your face can stick out its tongue when you do. With Apple\u2019s new augmented reality system, the iPhone can turn Legos into a video game. But if you can\u2019t even play with some Legos without reaching for your phone, isn\u2019t that kind of a problem?Apple wants to stand apart from the techlash with its emphasis on privacy and its oft-stated distaste for the excesses of the internet ad industry. On Monday, the company said its Safari web browser would disable tracking software, or cookies, that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users\u2019 activity across the internet.The new Safari feature is a direct swipe at the data-collection practices of big internet companies that Apple has tried hard to separate itself from.Apple argues that it has always been one of the more high-minded of the big tech companies, so it shouldn\u2019t be lumped in with outfits like Facebook.But that argument has always been a little complicated. Apple benefits from our obsession with social software; people buy its powerful phones to use Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year for the privilege of being the iPhone\u2019s default search engine.\u201cWe aim to put the customer at the center of everything we do,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said several times Monday.That seemed like a promise as well as a backhanded defense. Apple will give you the world.

{"Headline": "We Have Reached Peak Screen. Now Revolution Is in the Air.", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut now that smartphones have achieved dominance, revolution is again in the air.There\u2019s a reason tech companies are feeling this tension between making phones better and worrying they are already too addictive. We\u2019ve hit what I call Peak Screen.For much of the last decade, a technology industry ruled by smartphones has pursued a singular goal of completely conquering our eyes. It has given us phones with ever-bigger screens and phones with unbelievable cameras, not to mention virtual reality goggles and several attempts at camera-glasses.So tech giants are building the beginning of something new: a less insistently visual tech world, a digital landscape that relies on voice assistants, headphones, watches and other wearables to take some pressure off our eyes.This could be a nightmare; we may simply add these new devices to our screen-addled lives. But depending on how these technologies develop, a digital ecosystem that demands less of our eyes could be better for everyone \u2014 less immersive, less addictive, more conducive to multitasking, less socially awkward, and perhaps even a salve for our politics and social relations.Who will bring us this future? Amazon and Google are clearly big players, but don\u2019t discount the company that got us to Peak Screen in the first place. With advances to the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, Apple is slowly and almost quietly creating an alternative to its phones.If it works, it could change everything again. As I argue below, there are many ways that screens have become too dominant in our lives. The sooner we find something else, the better.When you do give in, you lose your mind.\u201cWhat you get sucked into is not the one thing that caught your attention \u2014 your text message or tweet or whatever,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at the technology research firm Creative Strategies. Instead, you unlock your phone and instantly, almost unconsciously, descend into the irresistible splendors of the digital world \u2014 emerging 30 minutes later, stupefied and dazed.\u201cYou open this irresistible box, and you can\u2019t fight it,\u201d she said.Tech companies understand this power, of course; our inability to resist screens explains why phone screens keep getting bigger.He was wrong. Rivals, led by Samsung, found that big-screen phones sold very well. The eyes won out over the hands. Eventually Apple joined the party, making iPhones with bigger and then still bigger displays. The largest-screen iPhones now account for half of Apple\u2019s sales and the majority of its profits.But screens have now become a crutch for technologists, a lazy, catchall way to add digital experiences to every product.Or look at augmented reality, the technology that allows you to see digital imagery superimposed on the real world. In a few specific uses \u2014 turning your face into a dog\u2019s on Snapchat \u2014 this can be fun. But too often, A.R. feels gimmicky. Rather than commingling the digital and the real, it simply uses a screen to usurp the world around you.At Apple\u2019s developer conference this month, Martin Sanders, a Lego executive, showed off a new A.R. Lego set. When he pointed his iPad at a Lego structure, his screen filled with digital fireworks, superheros, sports cars \u2014 a whole bustling Lego town that he didn\u2019t have to build with his hands or imagine with his head.\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do here!\u201d Mr. Sanders exclaimed as he and an assistant stood completely still, staring at animated Legos through a piece of digital glass. It was bizarre. The whole point of Lego is physical interaction, but thanks to A.R., he had turned Lego into just another video game.There are two ways we may break our fevered addiction to screens.First, we will need to try to use our phones more mindfully, which requires a combination of willpower and technology.Help is on the way. For the last week, I\u2019ve been using Screen Time, one of the new features in Apple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system. The software gives you valuable information about how much you are using your phone, and it can even block you from using apps that you deem unhealthy. I found Screen Time very well designed, and I suspect it will profoundly change how we use our phones.But in addition to helping us resist phones, the tech industry will need to come up with other, less immersive ways to interact with digital world. Three technologies may help with this: voice assistants, of which Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Assistant are the best, and Apple\u2019s two innovations, AirPods and the Apple Watch.All of these technologies share a common idea. Without big screens, they are far less immersive than a phone, allowing for quick digital hits: You can buy a movie ticket, add a task to a to-do list, glance at a text message or ask about the weather without going anywhere near your Irresistible Screen of Splendors.These are all works in progress. Voice assistants still cannot do everything for you, though Google and Amazon have thousands of engineers working to improve them. AirPods are fantastic \u2014 they have fewer connection issues than any other wireless headphones \u2014 and after years of refinement, the Apple Watch shows you just enough stuff from your phone to make it useful without becoming overbearing.If Apple could only improve Siri, its own voice assistant, the Watch and AirPods could combine to make something new: a mobile computer that is not tied to a huge screen, that lets you get stuff done on the go without the danger of being sucked in. Imagine if, instead of tapping endlessly on apps, you could just tell your AirPods, \u201cMake me dinner reservations at 7\u201d or \u201cCheck with my wife\u2019s calendar to see when we can have a date night this week.\u201dApple has never been scared of disrupting its own best inventions. By rethinking screens, it may have a chance to do that once more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM Unveils System That \u2018Debates\u2019 With Humans", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A match between an Israeli college debate champion and a loquacious IBM computer program demonstrated on Monday new gains in the quest for computers that can hold conversations with humans. It also led to an unlikely question for the tech industry\u2019s deep thinkers: Can a machine talk too much?At an IBM office in downtown San Francisco, Noa Ovadia, a college senior who won an Israeli championship in 2016, squared off with IBM\u2019s program, called the IBM Debater.She argued against government subsidies for space exploration. The machine argued in favor, delivering three brief speeches in a digitally created monotone and \u2014 at least in small ways \u2014 responding to Ms. Ovadia\u2019s human opinions.\u201cAnother point that I believe my opponent made is that there are more important things than space exploration to spend money on,\u201d the machine said during its lengthy rebuttal. \u201cIt is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this. No one is claiming that this is the only item on our expense list.\u201dUnder development for six years, this artificial intelligence system is part of a broader effort to build technology that can interact with people the way we interact with one another.Companies like Google, Amazon and Apple have for several years offered coffee table gadgets and smartphone apps that answer simple questions or perform simple tasks. (\u201cHey, Siri. Set my alarm for 7 a.m. tomorrow.\u201d)Projects like IBM Debater and Google Duplex show that this kind of system is starting to stretch beyond simple commands. But they also demonstrate the limitations of current technology.IBM\u2019s system was designed to debate about 100 topics, but these interactions are tightly constrained: a four-minute opening statement followed by a rebuttal to its opponent\u2019s argument \u2014 and then a statement summing up its own viewpoint. It was not exactly Lincoln v. Douglas.Subsidized space exploration, the machine said during its opening statement, \u201cinspires our children to pursue education and careers in science and technology and mathematics.\u201d\u201cIt is more important than good roads or improved schools or better health care,\u201d it added.Noam Slonim, an IBM researcher who helped oversee the project, estimated that the technology could have a \u201cmeaningful\u201d debate on those 100 topics 40 percent of the time. IBM chose the topic for the live debate before it began. In some cases, the machine\u2019s lengthy speeches hinted at how it was stitching together its arguments \u2014 identifying relevant sentences and clauses and then combining them into a reasonably coherent, computerized thought.In 2011, IBM demonstrated a system that could beat the leading players at the trivia game show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d The company used this system, called Watson, as a way of promoting a wide range of products and consulting services for hospitals and other businesses.After Watson won, Mr. Slonim, a researcher at an IBM lab in Haifa, Israel, pitched the Debater project as IBM\u2019s next \u201cgrand challenge.\u201dBut the project reflects the recent acceleration of research related to \u201cnatural language understanding,\u201d the effort to build machines that can understand the natural way we humans talk and respond in kind. As this research progresses, it can provide new ways for computers to digest and process information or even lead to machines that can hold a completely convincing conversation.This sort of technology would have a wide range of uses. It could help businesses filter hot-button issues on social media. Or it could provide governments with a more effective way of censoring information.Understanding natural language is such a complex and difficult task, systems like IBM Debater lean on a wide range of systems, each handling a different part of the problem. One system will identify information that helps fuel an argument on one side of the debate. Another will generate the text of the argument. And so on.In recent years, researchers have significantly improved systems that recognize people and objects, identify spoken words and translate between languages.But understanding language is far more complex. That means systems that perform fairly simple language tasks \u2014 like writing a Wikipedia article, let alone engaging in a serious debate on a random topic \u2014 may still be years away.\u201cIt is now very obvious this change is happening,\u201d said Jeremy Howard, an independent researcher working in this area. \u201cBut these things take time.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted the IBM Debater, a computer program that participated in a debate with an Israeli college senior on June 18. During an exchange, the program said, \u201cIt is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this,\u201d not \u201cI dispute this.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco, and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Bug Changed Privacy Settings of Up to 14 Million Users", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook has been fighting for months the perception that it did not do enough to protect people\u2019s privacy. On Thursday, the company said it had again failed to keep the information of millions of users private.As many as 14 million Facebook users who thought they were creating private posts last month that only a small group of friends could see were, in fact, making public posts that anyone could view.Facebook blamed a software bug for the problem. The company did not say how it had found the bug, or how it knew the problem was limited to 14 million people.In a statement, Facebook said the bug affected users from May 18 to May 22, while the company was testing a new feature. By May 27, the company had changed the affected posts from a public setting back to a private one.In the last few months, Facebook executives have repeatedly been forced to apologize to users for failing to protect their privacy.Norman Sadeh, co-director of Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Privacy Engineering Program, said that although Facebook survived temporary losses of trust from the public in the past, the recent scandals appeared to be taking their toll on the social media company.In response to the problems, the company has added a number of new privacy controls, as well as a centralized page for privacy and security settings. Mr. Sadeh said the new settings were still confusing.One of Facebook\u2019s key privacy features is that it lets people decide an audience for their posts. Someone can, for example, share a post with only a limited group of family and friends, or decide to make a post public so that anyone, including people not logged on to Facebook, can see it.It was unclear if users could have done anything to their settings to prevent being affected by the bug the company revealed on Thursday.Until Facebook and other companies improve their approach to privacy and develop settings that are easier to use and more aligned with what users want, \u201cpeople should probably refrain from sharing too much sensitive information with these platforms,\u201d Mr. Sadeh said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Gave Data Access to Chinese Firm Flagged by U.S. Intelligence", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has data-sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese electronics companies, including a manufacturing giant that has a close relationship with China\u2019s government, the social media company said on Tuesday.The agreements, which date to at least 2010, gave private access to some user data to Huawei, a telecommunications equipment company that has been flagged by American intelligence officials as a national security threat, as well as to Lenovo, Oppo and TCL.The four partnerships remain in effect, but Facebook officials said in an interview that the company would wind down the Huawei deal by the end of the week.The deals were part of an effort to push more mobile users onto the social network starting in 2007, before stand-alone Facebook apps worked well on phones. The agreements allowed device makers to offer some Facebook features, such as address books, \u201clike\u201d buttons and status updates.Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends \u2014 including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.Huawei used its private access to feed a \u201csocial phone\u201d app that let users view messages and social media accounts in one place, according to the officials.Facebook representatives said the data shared with Huawei stayed on its phones, not the company\u2019s servers.Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who leads the Commerce Committee, has demanded that Facebook provide Congress with details about its data partnerships. \u201cFacebook is learning hard lessons that meaningful transparency is a high standard to meet,\u201d Mr. Thune said.His committee also oversees the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Facebook to determine whether the company\u2019s data policies violate a 2011 consent decree with the commission.\u201cI look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that information about their users was not sent to Chinese servers,\u201d said Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\u201cAll Facebook\u2019s integrations with Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL were controlled from the get-go \u2014 and Facebook approved everything that was built,\u201d said Francisco Varela, a Facebook vice president. \u201cGiven the interest from Congress, we wanted to make clear that all the information from these integrations with Huawei was stored on the device, not on Huawei\u2019s servers.\u201dBanned in China since 2009, Facebook in recent years has quietly sought to re-establish itself there. The company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has tried to cultivate a relationship with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and put in an appearance at one of the country\u2019s top universities.Still, Facebook has struggled to gain momentum, and in January an executive in charge of courting China\u2019s government left after spending three years on a charm campaign to get the social media service back in the country.None of the Chinese device makers who have partnerships with Facebook responded to requests for comment on Tuesday.Huawei, one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world, is a point of national pride for China and is at the vanguard of the country\u2019s efforts to expand its influence abroad. The company was the recipient of billions of dollars in lines of credit from China\u2019s state-owned policy banks, helping to fuel its overseas expansion in Africa, Europe and Latin America. Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, is a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army.United States officials are investigating whether Huawei broke American trade controls by dealing with Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. The Trump administration has taken aim at Huawei and its rival ZTE in recent weeks, and in April the Federal Communications Commission advanced a plan to bar federally subsidized telecom companies from using suppliers that are considered national security threats.Facebook has not entered into a data-sharing agreement with ZTE, officials at the social network said.TCL, a consumer electronics firm, has accused the Trump administration of bias against Chinese companies and last June dropped a bid to buy a San Diego-based company that makes routers and other hardware.Lenovo, a maker of computers and other devices, recently shelved ambitions to acquire BlackBerry after the Canadian government signaled that such a deal could compromise national security.Nicholas Confessore, Michael Forsythe and Paul Mozur contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple and Samsung End Smartphone Patent Wars", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple initially sought to block Samsung phones from the market, but the technology at dispute has long been outdated, and the fight has since largely been about money. Apple at one point sought more than $2 billion, while Samsung had argued it owed just $28 million.With two of global industry\u2019s biggest players fighting over one of history\u2019s most successful products, the case was one of the most closely watched legal fights in modern business.\u201cAnd if I had to characterize it, it didn\u2019t really accomplish anything,\u201d said Brian J. Love, a Santa Clara University law professor who tracked the case. \u201cClose to a decade of litigation, hundreds of millions of dollars spent on lawyers, and at the end of the day, no products went off the market.\u201dApple won on paper, but it failed in its goal to gain a competitive advantage over Samsung and other phone makers in its series of lawsuits against them, said Mr. Love and Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School who studies patent law.After years of legal fees and countless hours of its executives\u2019 time, Apple walked away with negligible profits on the cases, particularly in the context of its $267 billion cash pile. Apple still earns most of the smartphone industry\u2019s profits, but Samsung and other handset makers have kept up the pressure with strong market share and innovative products.\u201cApple can find better ways of earning hundreds of millions of dollars than fighting a decade-long lawsuit,\u201d Mr. Love said.For other companies, the case is likely to serve as a lesson that \u201cthe courtroom is not always the place to try to get ahead,\u201d Mr. Carrier said. \u201cThere\u2019s always the trade-off between litigation and innovation, and in the time these companies spent in the courtroom, they weren\u2019t innovating.\u201dHe said the case set the legal precedent that even if a company is shown to infringe on some patents, the courts might not block the product if the patents at issue play a small role in the device.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, referred to a previous company statement that said the \u201ccase has always been about more than money.\u201d\u201cApple ignited the smartphone revolution with iPhone and it is a fact that Samsung blatantly copied our design,\u201d Apple said in the statement. \u201cIt is important that we continue to protect the hard work and innovation of so many people at Apple.\u201dA Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister, declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Market Value Should Cross $1 Trillion and Keep On Trucking", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIt has been a long time coming, but Apple could soon be worth $1 trillion \u2014 and counting. At about $940 billion, the tech giant is close to being the first company to pass that threshold in market capitalization, as Breakingviews predicted seven years ago. Growth has slowed since then, but customers remain loyal and today\u2019s valuation is far from stretched. Apple\u2019s timely focus on data privacy may help it get there.The rather mundane improvements rolling out at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference this week demonstrate how the smartphone market is largely mature. Shipments worldwide declined slightly for the first time last year, the research firm IDC believes, and should grow less than 3 percent annually over the next five years.That said, there\u2019s no obvious replacement for smartphones on the horizon. Apple earned $48 billion last year, mostly from iPhone sales, so this looks like the base camp for the company. Phones are prone to being dropped, dunked in water or lost. Throw in small improvements, and the company can reap more per device. The average iPhone sales price actually rose last year.Apple can wring more dollars out of users in other ways, as well. Service revenue from selling apps, online storage and streaming music is rising at a 31 percent annual clip and now accounts for 15 percent of sales. Add in revenue from ancillary hardware, and analysts think the company can increase operating profit 13 percent this year. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a healthy rate of growth continuing. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is also milking the discomfort of Facebook, Google and others whose businesses rely heavily on sharing data, sometimes controversially, by contrasting them with Apple\u2019s privacy-friendly approach.Yet Wall Street has remained oddly skeptical over the years. Apple is valued at 15 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, which is slightly less than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over all. And peers trade at a substantial premium, with Facebook at 22 times forward earnings and Microsoft and the Google parent Alphabet on a multiple of 25.That\u2019s too large a gap. Microsoft is projected to grow roughly as fast as Apple this year. Facebook and Google are growing faster, but they are in the line of fire from consumers and regulators over data gathering and privacy worries. Apple\u2019s conference this week may be short on pizazz, but the nearly trillion-dollar company can tweak its business without the distraction of defending it.Advertisement"}

Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington.

The commission is empowered to impose fines of up to $11bn \u2014 which is 10 percent of the global turnover of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet \u2014 but typically decisions are at the lower end of the range.The decision will mark an escalation of the commission\u2019s battle with Google, which began eight years ago with an investigation into comparison shopping, then only a narrow part of online commerce. Though that case concluded with a \u20ac2.4bn fine, it has not led to significant changes to Google\u2019s business.The issue with AndroidAs the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android.The bigger picture\u2014 Michael de la MercedAthenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday:To ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership.The context Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealth\u2019s co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home.In an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit:\u201cI believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country \u2013 these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, it\u2019s easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.\u201dWhat happens nowAthenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale.Elliott\u2019s response to the newsFrom a spokesman:\u201cElliott welcomes the Board\u2019s decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth\u2019s shareholders, employees and customers.

He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide \u201cfew clarifications\u201d about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasn\u2019t.Here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing:\u201cThe allegation is false, the facts are not correct.\u201d\u201cThose boxes were not ours. As far as I\u2019m aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t represent the company properly, I didn\u2019t represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.\u201dDid Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users.\u201cIt was my firm impression that Mr. Collins\u2019 questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data\u2026 so I answered no.\u201d\u201cWhen I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.\u201d\u201cI also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebook\u2019s request.\u201dHow useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the company\u2019s work in the U.S.?\u201cThat data was less useful than simply using Facebook\u2019s own advertising algorithms.\u201d\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMore from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X.

The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week.Anthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group.The consumer advisory board\u2019s members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard.The White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly.\u201cAnything that we can do to unlock government data, we\u2019re committed to. We\u2019d love to hear from any academic that has any insights.\u201dSo far, a big part of the administration\u2019s approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly.

(but not literally)\u201d; \u201cdeath is only the beginning\u201d; \u201cShatzi, many happy returns \u2026 as trees, as bumble bees, as many happy memories.\u201dMs. Weisberger worked the crowded room. \u201cI have been studying and learning about death and dying, and I want to tell people what I\u2019ve learned,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people are coming because they love me, and some people are coming because they\u2019re curious about what the hell it\u2019s about.\u201dAt 88, Ms. Weisberger has found a second calling in what has been labeled the positive death movement \u2014 a scattering of mostly women who want to break the taboos around discussions of death.All share a common idea: that Western culture has become too squeamish about talking about death, and that the silence impoverishes the lives leading up to it.Ellen Goodman, a retired newspaper columnist who started the Conversation Project after caring for her mother at the end of life, likened the foment to the earlier movement for natural childbirth. \u201cBirth was perceived as a medical event, and then in came the women\u2019s movement and \u2018Our Bodies, Ourselves,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t doctors who changed the way we give birth in America. It was women who said that giving birth was a human event. I think that we\u2019re trying to do that now. Dying is a human experience. We\u2019re trying to put the person back into the center of the experience.\u201dMs. Weisberger is by no means a morbid person. She sings in the Brooklyn Women\u2019s Chorus and shops at the new Trader Joe\u2019s in her neighborhood. But a few years ago, after sitting with a friend who was dying of cancer, she realized that she was unsatisfied with the American way of death.\u201cShe became terrified, so scared that she couldn\u2019t even talk about it,\u201d Ms. Weisberger said of her friend. \u201cI kept urging her to talk about what was going on, but she wouldn\u2019t. And then she died. So that was a problem. We had not dealt with the issue \u2014 myself, herself and the others.\u201cSo I started studying about it,\u201d she said. Down the digital rabbit hole she went.If there is a germinal moment for the positive death movement, it is 2003, when a social worker at a New York hospice center became disillusioned by the care that the medical staff were able to give to dying patients and their families. The social worker, Henry Fersko-Weiss, saw what doulas did for women during and after childbirth. Why couldn\u2019t dying people get the same level of attention and emotional support?\u201cThere are tremendous similarities between birthing and dying,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal unknown, there\u2019s a great deal of pain and a need for support for the people around the person who is going through the experience.\u201dFor doulas in either setting, he said, \u201carranging the atmosphere, creating a special space around the event, is exactly the same.\u201dAs Mr. Fersko-Weiss was getting his program underway, Joanna Ebenstein, a graphic designer in Brooklyn, was thinking about death from a completely different angle.From the first posts, she said, she started hearing from an audience she had not known was out there: people who felt isolated by their interest in death. Before then, the only people she knew who shared her interest in death had been in the goth subculture.\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be curious about death now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how can you not be? It\u2019s a great human mystery. It\u2019s the thing that defines our life, but we\u2019re supposed to pretend it\u2019s not interesting to us? It\u2019s in horror movies and pop culture, but there was no high culture discourse around it.\u201dShe withheld her name from the blog because she was afraid her design clients, especially Scholastic, would think she was creepy. This was the era when Sarah Palin warned that the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act was trying to impose \u201cdeath panels.\u201dMs. Ebenstein, 46, sees her work as resurrecting a lost strand of American culture.\u201cThis idea that we have now, that death is exotic and cannot be seen, is brand new,\u201d she said. \u201cYour grandparents tended to die in the house. They\u2019d be laid out in the parlor when they died, which the Ladies\u2019 Home Journal advocated changing to the \u2018living room\u2019 when the funeral parlor came around. The living room became the living room because it\u2019s no longer the parlor for laying out the dead. And that\u2019s around 1900. All of these changes are happening, and now we think of death as something that happens offstage, that we don\u2019t see and children certainly shouldn\u2019t see. But that was not possible until so recently.\u201dIn April of 2013, Ms. Doughty tweeted, \u201cWhy are there a zillion websites and references for being sex positive but nothing for being death positive?\u201dWith that, an inchoate curiosity had a brand name, a cachet and an internet presence. All it needed was an occasion to gather.On a Monday evening at Bluestockings bookstore on the Lower East Side, Emily Leshner, a graduate student in visual media anthropology, had a question about the end of life. Specifically, she wanted to discuss the issue of digital immortality: is it right for people\u2019s social media profiles to live on when they die? \u201cOur digital presence exists beyond our biological life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me think what kind of person I\u2019d want to be my legacy.\u201dIt was the monthly gathering of the Lower East Side Death Cafe, one of a handful of death cafes that have formed in the last few years around the city. Jafar Al-Mondhiry, a resident in internal medicine, picked up Ms. Leshner\u2019s question. He hoped to start a death-related podcast for other residents \u2014 a virtual death cafe. \u201cIs social media a triumph over the body?\u201d he asked.Around two tables piled with carrots and other snacks, the conversations were lively and unstructured. Melanie Nilsson described taking her father\u2019s cremated remains to all of his favorite restaurants for a year. Millet Israeli, a former corporate lawyer who changed careers to become a grief counselor, asked what sort of reactions the others got when they told friends they were attending a death cafe.\u201cThey said, \u2018Is that some sort of goth thing?\u2019\u201d Ms. Leshner said. \u201cThat it\u2019s dark and trendy and cool.\u201dThe death cafe, she said, \u201cis almost like my form of activism to create an atmosphere publicly that permits talking about death. If we can talk about death and dying, maybe that will spread to easier conversations about grief and terminal illness.\u201dMs. Israeli recalled a guided meditation at the Zen Center imagining her own death: the mouth becoming dry, the body shutting down, the attention becoming more internal. Even with all her work as a grief counselor, Ms. Israeli said, she was nervous going into it. \u201cIt seemed scary,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the experience was the opposite. As heavy as that sounds, it made it feel lighter. It felt safer than it did going in.\u201dThis is the odd math of the positive death activities. Embracing mortality, practitioners say, helps them live with less fear, more life.Ms. Cunningham discussed alternatives to embalming \u2014 which involves toxic chemicals \u2014 and coffins made of wool or other materials that decompose easily. The group included 24 women and two men.\u201cWe\u2019re part of a movement, and it\u2019s really a return to a female presence at the time of death,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said.Several of those attending worked in hospice or in the funeral trade. Others had enrolled after the deaths of people close to them.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit macabre,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always been superfascinated by dying \u2014 the physiological processes, but also this idea of what happens to our consciousness. I don\u2019t believe in heaven or an afterlife.\u201cI also feel that decomposition is deeply spiritual. One of the things that draws people to this work is that we don\u2019t have a basis in religion. That\u2019s why a lot of people are becoming part of this death positive movement.\u201dOthers offer different explanations for why all this is happening now. The AIDS crisis transformed grief and caregiving into expressions of community. The mass shootings on the news call for examination: What if today was your last day? The rising interest in Buddhism introduced alternative concepts of dying. And the aging population brought more urgency to questions of how people want to consider the last years.\u201cThe first step is recognizing that death is a natural part of life\u2019s journey,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe can have it go well or have it go poorly. They say death and taxes are the only things guaranteed in life. But people don\u2019t pay their taxes. So I\u2019m saying death is the only one that\u2019s for sure.\u201dAt the FUN-eral, Ms. Weisberger showed off a burial shroud she plans to use when her time comes. She bought it online, from Amazon, she thinks. Three friends have agreed to wash her body according to Jewish tradition, and Ms. Cunningham \u2014 who supplied the cardboard coffin \u2014 will provide dry ice to preserve her body before burial, she said.On the wall was a quote from Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, who died in 2011: \u201cRemembering that I\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.\u201d Ms. Weisberger found it on WeCroak.\u201cI was about to give up on WeCroak until I saw this,\u201d she said.Ms. Weisberger assured her friends that she was in no hurry to occupy the coffin in the corner. Her health was good and her studies in death and dying gave her motivation to keep going, maybe to age 100, she said.After all, she had too much work to do to stop now.\u201cI really want to experience my dying,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die in a car crash or be unconscious. I want to be home, I want to be in my bed, I want to share the experience with anybody who\u2019s interested.\u201dIt has been the journey of a lifetime, she said, and the last chapter was still to come.\u201cThere\u2019s so much more to share, but I don\u2019t want to go on \u2014 no, I really do want to go on,\u201d she said.Everybody laughed. For one afternoon, death did not get the last word.Advertisement"}

China changed its labor laws in 2014 to limit their use to 10 percent of any work force in an attempt to stop companies exploiting them to cut costs. The China Labor Watch investigation \u2014 published on Sunday in association with the Observer \u2014 found that more than 40 percent of the staff in the Foxconn factory were agency workers. Those working overtime were being paid at the normal hourly rate instead of the time-and-a-half required by Chinese law and by Amazon\u2019s own supplier code of conduct.\u201dAmazon confirmed to the newspaper that its own audit of the factory this year had revealed how Foxconn had been employing too many agency workers and that they were not rewarded suitable overtime pay. \u201cWe immediately requested a corrective action plan from Foxconn,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.Foxconn said that it was \u201ccarrying out a full investigation of the areas raised by that report.\u201d The company added that it \u201cworks hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations\u201d in the markets where it operates and that \u201cif infractions are identified, we work to immediately rectify them.\u201dHere\u2019s a rundown of some of the issues that have reportedly plagued Foxconn\u2019s factories:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. Dropped From the Dow After More Than a Century", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were none.General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company\u2019s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company\u2019s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.Over the last year, G.E.\u2019s shares have fallen 55 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Dow. G.E., which closed Tuesday at $12.95, has the lowest share price of any of the index\u2019s 30 components.S. & P. Dow Jones Indices \u2014 which owns the Dow \u2014 suggested that the slide in G.E.\u2019s stock price contributed to the decision to remove the company from the index, where it had been a member continuously since 1907. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction.\u201cThe low price of G.E. shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point,\u201d said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWalgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s share price is higher, and it will contribute more meaningfully to the index.\u201dThe move also is freighted with economic symbolism. With the inclusion of Walgreens Boots, the index \u201cwill be more representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said.The removal of G.E., which will formally occur June 26, reflects a shift in the economic composition of the United States, which long ago tilted away from heavy industry and toward services, such as technology, finance and health care.And it also amounted to a milestone for General Electric. It was the last remaining original member of the index, when the stock market measure was introduced in 1896.Back then, just a few years after the company was formed through a merger of Thomas Edison\u2019s electric companies with a rival, G.E. was the modern-day equivalent of a technology stock, and the Dow itself was geared heavily toward the growth industries of the day such as railroads. In the more than 120 years that followed, the company was often at the center of American capitalism. And as recently as the 1990s. G.E. was at times the most-valuable American company by market value.Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the United States today.After G.E.\u2019s departure from the index, the company with the longest presence in the Dow will be Exxon Mobil, whose corporate predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, joined the Dow in 1928, according to S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.Advertisement"}

Uber\u2019s chief, Dara Khosrowshahi, called the policy \u201cjust plain wrong.\u201d The Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives that Mr. Blankfein once co-chaired, described the separation of children from their parents as \u201ccruel and contrary to American values.\u201dJamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, sent an email to all of the bank\u2019s employees Tuesday that condemned the Trump administration\u2019s policy and said his \u201cheart goes out to the impacted families.\u201dA Goldman spokesman said Mr. Blankfein \u201chas long believed that on the broader topic of immigration, there are no easy answers, which is why it\u2019s proven difficult for Washington to reach any sort of consensus.\u201dMr. Blankfein\u2019s more restrained approach is notable in part because at times he has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration. He was among the first chief executives to criticize the president\u2019s travel and immigration ban in early 2017. He attacked Mr. Trump\u2019s response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va., last year. He opposed the nation\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

Cohn. The road from Goldman to Washington is so heavily traveled that the firm is sometimes nicknamed \u201cGovernment Sachs.\u201dThe options for how to handle thousands of undocumented immigrants at the border were all difficult, Mr. Blankfein said.

{"Headline": "Marc Benioff of Salesforce: \u2018Are We Not All Connected?\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bycorner officeA billionaire tech mogul with a spiritual side, Mr. Benioff riffs on his early days at Apple and Oracle, and what\u2019s wrong with Facebook. Salesforce may not be a household name like Facebook or Twitter, but the software company and its chief executive, Marc Benioff, are hugely influential forces in the technology industry. Salesforce is a cloud computing pioneer that helped popularize the software-as-a-service business model. And Mr. Benioff has fashioned himself as a benevolent chieftain who can make the world a better place while making hefty profits, too. An entrepreneur at an early age, Mr. Benioff became a star executive at Oracle before leaving to co-found Salesforce nearly 20 years ago. Today, Salesforce is worth roughly $100 billion, and Mr. Benioff is a billionaire many times over. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Salesforce headquarters in San Francisco.What was your childhood like? Do you want me to lie down? Yeah. Close your eyes and count backward from 100.O.K., great. I\u2019m happy to. I was born an entrepreneur. When I was about 12 years old, I would go around to people\u2019s homes and repair their antennas and their CB radios. Then I got a regular job at a jewelry store, cleaning the cases after school, which I did not really enjoy. But across the street there was a Radio Shack and that\u2019s where I found a computer for the first time. I wrote my first piece of software, and sold it when I was about 15 years old.In 1984, you interned at Apple. What was that like? I was at the University of Southern California, putting myself through school with royalties of my software company. And I was writing a bunch of adventure games for the Atari 800, the Apple II, the Commodore 64. Then when the Macintosh was introduced in 1984, I sold my other computers and bought the Macintoshes.The summer before my junior year, I worked for Apple. There was a pirate flag on the roof. There was a motorcycle in the lobby. Steve Jobs was running between the two Macintosh buildings. It was a big scene.What did you do there? No one was really paying attention exactly to what I was doing. I wrote this piece of software which was a game called \u201cRaid on Armonk,\u201d which was where IBM\u2019s headquarters were at the time. And my manager said to me, \u201cNo, no. You cannot do this.\u201dWhat did you do after college? I wrote a business plan for a network-type company based on something that Apple was working on called AppleLink. But U.S.C. was like, \u201cNo, no. You\u2019re not going to create a company when you graduate from school. We want you to go get a real job in a real company, and we want you to go into sales.\u201d So I asked around, and this person who I was working with at Apple mentioned this company called Oracle.What did you learn while you were at Oracle? Then Larry [Ellison, Oracle\u2019s co-founder] took notice of me, and I started working directly for him. That was a very powerful moment, when he started to shape how I thought about business. Larry took the long view. He was like, \u201cI want to think about this company over 50 years, not over 10 years or five years.\u201d Now he\u2019s been doing it for 40 years.Why did you strike out on your own? As I came into my 10th year at Oracle, I was really burning out, but I couldn\u2019t exactly figure out why. I didn\u2019t have a good feeling when I went in the building. I went into Larry\u2019s office and said, \u201cI need to take some time off.\u201d And right away he said, \u201cYeah, why don\u2019t you just take a sabbatical. You\u2019ve worked really hard for 10 years.\u201dFirst I went to Hawaii for a few months and really, really worked on my meditation practice. Then I went to India for six weeks with a friend of mine who was also going through a similar life transformation. We had these amazing experiences going to all of these different ashrams and meeting all these different spiritual masters. It was almost like a guru tour. I definitely came back from that trip as a different person. How so? I came back with a clear vision of what the future of the internet was going to be in regards to software-as-a-service and cloud computing. I also had a much deeper sense of my spiritual self. So I said, \u201cWhen I start a company, I will integrate culture with service.\u201d When I started Salesforce, on March 8, 1999, I said we\u2019re going to put one percent of our equity, product and time into a foundation and create a culture of service within our company. We\u2019ll be creating new technology, the cloud; we\u2019ll be creating a new business model, subscription services; and we\u2019ll create a culture built on philanthropy.How do you make sure new Salesforce employees get what the company\u2019s all about?On their first day of work, we take everyone and we show them the kitchen and the bathroom and their office and their desk. Then we take them out and they do service in the afternoon. They\u2019ll go to a homeless shelter or they\u2019ll go to the hospital or go to a public school. This is a very core part of our culture.I want a company where people are excited to come to work every day, where they feel good when they get here, where it doesn\u2019t take from them, but it\u2019s giving to them, it\u2019s giving to others. Why do people want to be here? It\u2019s not that we have more amenities than everybody else. We have less. We don\u2019t have a cafeteria. But we have a stronger purpose and a stronger mission. A reader, Ellen McBarnette, asks, \u201cDo public companies have a responsibility to contribute to the public good?\u201dThere\u2019s a shift going on. When I went to U.S.C., it was all about maximizing value for shareholders. But we\u2019re moving into a world of stakeholders. It\u2019s not just about shareholders. Your employees are stakeholders, so are your customers, your partners, the communities that you\u2019re in, the homeless that are nearby, your public schools. A company like ours can\u2019t be successful in an unsuccessful economy or in an unsuccessful environment or where the school system doesn\u2019t work. We have to take responsibility for all of those things. This idea that somebody put into our heads \u2014 that companies are somehow these kind of individuated units that are separate from society and don\u2019t have to be paying attention to the communities they\u2019re in \u2014 that is incorrect. We need to have a more enlightened view about the role of companies. This company is not somehow separate from everything else. Are we not all connected? Are we not all one? Isn\u2019t that the point?So what is Salesforce doing about it? Salesforce is the biggest tech company in San Francisco. We can unleash a power onto this city. All of these people can go into the public schools and volunteer, and they can work and make the city better. They can improve the state of the city, improve the state of the world. All I have to do is give them permission to do that.You\u2019ve been outspoken on issues like L.G.B.T.Q. rights and tougher gun laws. What issues are you focused on right now? We\u2019re working on the homeless programs here. We have a plan to get every homeless family off the streets within five years.That\u2019s a pretty ambitious goal. Are you setting yourself up for failure? We\u2019ve already moved hundreds of families back into society and into homes. But we cannot delegate these complex problems off to the government and say, \u201cWe\u2019re not all part of it.\u201d They\u2019re part of the solution, but I believe that for $150 million, we can get every homeless person in San Francisco into homes.Now when I say every single person, I actually don\u2019t believe it. There are some people in San Francisco who are intentionally homeless. They just want to be homeless. San Francisco is kind of the Four Seasons of homelessness. They all say this is the best place in the world to be homeless.His memo is very clear. He talks about putting growth above trust, and you can\u2019t do that. Never put growth before trust. If you put growth above trust, then all of a sudden you create a toxic culture. People don\u2019t want to work in that environment or use the product. Then you get these campaigns, #deleteuber, #deletefacebook. It\u2019s a referendum on the culture, not the product.Has your meditation practice influenced how you lead? Having a beginner\u2019s mind informs my management style. I\u2019m trying to listen deeply, and the beginner\u2019s mind is informing me to step back, so that I can create what wants to be, not what was. I know that the future does not equal the past. I know that I have to be here in the moment. Advertisement"}

In fact, we\u2019re talking about developing something together.\u201dShe added: \u201cA few months in, I\u2019m not going to be publicly poaching. But I\u2019m going to be out there like I was with Jordan, proactively approaching people who are available or coming available.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re homing in on a strategy,\u201d she said of the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d adaptation. \u201cThe estate has actually been super helpful. Offering insight. Giving permission to make some big moves. They\u2019re not being precious.\u201dFor a company that spent an estimated $4.5 billion on programming last year, however, the programing slate is thin.\u201cWe\u2019re not going for something small and niche,\u201d said Ms. Salke, describing her strategy. \u201cYou can still have something that feels specific. But it needs to invite people in.\u201dThat\u2019s certainly how her bosses in Seattle feel. Because Amazon\u2019s hefty investment in content has yielded only mixed results in Hollywood, it is up to Ms. Salke to change that as quickly as possible.\u201cThe pressure on Amazon is their Prime membership growth has been slowing,\u201d said Greg Melich, a retail analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cAs a result, they need the members they have to get that much more engaged. And people that stream content also shop more frequently, spend more and are more likely to renew their Prime membership.\u201dMs. Salke comes to Amazon with a proven track record. She helped orchestrate a turnaround for NBC, taking it from a nadir when it briefly abandoned 10 p.m. dramas to first place for each of the last two seasons. During her tenure, NBC found the smash hit \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d Ms. Salke previously worked at Fox\u2019s television production studio, where she guided notable shows like \u201cGlee\u201d for Fox and \u201cModern Family\u201d for ABC.Dan Fogelman, the creator of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d credited Ms. Salke with taking an interest in his drama even before it became a runaway hit.\u201cWhen she is impassioned about a project, she is more intimately involved with the material than a quote-unquote entertainment president normally would be,\u201d he said.Ms. Salke may luck out with another film from the Price era, however \u2014 one from Mr. Fogelman. He directed \u201cLife Itself,\u201d a romantic drama about intersecting lives over multiple generations that is scheduled for release by Amazon in September. Amazon has high box office hopes for the film, which could also figure in the Academy Awards race.Ms. Salke will probably add a senior executive to Amazon\u2019s film team.

{"Headline": "How Snapchat Makes Mini Movies in Augmented Reality", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA.R. may change entertainment as we know it. For Snapchat, the revolution starts with 15-second cartoons.LOS ANGELES \u2014 On a cool, sunny day in April, a short Frisbee toss from Venice Beach, a team of seven animators sat around a conference table, workshopping a storyboard from an unusual cartoon series. In the storyboard \u2014 rudimentary, comic-striplike panels tracing the arc of a scene \u2014 a barefoot man in rolled-up jeans stands at the edge of a bed of flaming hot coals. The man gathers his nerve, walks across the coals without incident and does a little celebratory dance. But his celebration is premature; in a plot twist in the final frame, his feet burst into flames.Some of the notes in the room weren\u2019t far from what you\u2019d expect in any introductory art class. But other feedback was more peculiar. In lieu of a setting for the story, the animators discussed only how they could \u201cindicate an environment,\u201d perhaps using sand or grass. Later, there was a curious debate about whether or not the character \u2014 otherwise recognizable as a human male \u2014 had any toes. Everyone agreed that they didn\u2019t know for certain. The equivalent of blockbusters, which will rely on special headsets like Magic Leap\u2019s Lightwear and Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens, are in development. And Facebook (which owns the virtual reality company Oculus), Apple and Google have all moved in the last year to make it easier for third-party developers to create new kinds of A.R. experiences for mobile phones. In late 2016, the Libermans\u2019 unique background caught the attention of executives at Snap, which, one year earlier, had demonstrated A.R.\u2019s potential as a creative platform with the rollout of animated overlays on selfies. The company jointly hired the foursome to develop animated A.R. characters based on Bitmoji. \u201cThey\u2019d been there and done that,\u201d said Eitan Pilipski, vice president of camera platform at Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company. \u201cThere was an amazing opportunity to take their creative thinking and put it in the hands of our users.\u201dSharing an office with three of your siblings could be a recipe for disaster, but it seems to have the opposite effect on the Libermans. In Venice Beach, they were like different limbs of the same chestnut-haired, fair-skinned organism, finishing one another\u2019s sentences when not cracking up at inside jokes. The Libermans shared a house for a time when they moved to Los Angeles, too, then spread out to their current arrangement in three apartments on the same street. \u201cBefore college we were together constantly, and afterward it\u2019s been the same,\u201d said David, technology lead, 34.\u201cIt has the feel of being a little under the radar but on the cutting edge,\u201d she said. She also pinpointed something else that might explain Snapchat\u2019s appeal. \u201cA Pixar movie takes five years to make,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an artist, that\u2019s two films in a decade, whereas at a place like Snapchat you can create a lot more volume.\u201dEach of the Libermans handles different responsibilities, which Anna, production lead, 36, said were based on their individual personalities: \u201cDaniil is very creative and helps us to write jokes. Maria is verbal and good at understanding story structure. I\u2019m very good at talking to people and getting them committed to specific dates and times. And David is very technical and has a strong engineering background.\u201dIn the animation stage, the animators aim to \u201csell\u201d the idea of the story, which should be easily \u201cread\u201d by the viewer without the benefit of dialogue (recording multiple languages and voice styles would be too resource intensive). The animators often film themselves role-playing as the character, or pull reference videos from YouTube, in order to realistically portray body movement.Because 3D Bitmoji episodes are designed to be sent between friends, they aren\u2019t just entertainment \u2014 they\u2019re custom memes, conveying the sender\u2019s mood or status. The most successful tend to be those that capture a common experience or sentiment, sometimes indirectly. Anna described \u201cHot Coals\u201d as a universal story about facing your fears, leavened with the twist at the end (what Snap\u2019s animators call a \u201cbonus\u201d) when the character catches fire. That made Maria recall a sort of spiritual precursor, an earlier animation involving a pregnant pause at the top of a diving board. One user\u2019s caption: \u201cMe getting into a new relationship.\u201dWhen the technology is sufficiently mature, experts expect that most forms of entertainment will be reimagined for augmented reality. Mr. Lelyveld, of the Entertainment Technology Center, predicted a surge in sophisticated narrative A.R. experiences in 18 to 24 months, when glasses allowing users to circumnavigate fixed virtual objects in physical space are projected to be widely available. Hands-free A.R. (which may one day rely on contact lenses or cortical implants) could unleash the potential for stories that blur the line between fiction and lived experience. They may share elements with linear film and television, or task-oriented video games. \u201cYou could be watching a sitcom like \u2018Friends,\u2019 but instead of the \u2018Friends\u2019 kitchen table, the characters are all sitting around your kitchen table,\u201d Ms. Burnett said. But the medium\u2019s capacity for contextual awareness allows for hybrid forms unlike any that exist today.Experts cautioned that it was still too soon to say what shape they may ultimately take. \u201cOur language has always been 2D, and if your language can\u2019t express it, you can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d Mr. Lelyveld said. But Hollywood studios are already girding themselves for the new reality. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer science fiction,\u201d said Ms. Papagiannis, the A.R. researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dAfter making it through the gantlet of animation review, \u201cHot Coals\u201d was ready for the final stage of its production cycle before testing and publication: visual effects. The Libermans\u2019 VFX artists added dancing flames, floating embers and, for the climactic moment when the character catches fire, pillars of white smoke. \u201cThe characters are very cartoony, but because they inhabit a real-world environment, atmospheric elements need to be quite realistic in order to bridge the gap,\u201d Anna said.While Mr. Pilipski declined to outline the course of that journey, Snapchat recently rolled out an in-app product, called Snappables, which allows users to play simple A.R. games (How many digital strawberries can you catch in your mouth in 10 seconds?) and invite friends to join. The company also makes sunglasses with embedded cameras, called Spectacles, though they\u2019re not currently A.R. capable.One path Snap isn\u2019t likely to pursue is making 3D Bitmoji more closely resemble their flesh-and-blood analogues. Asked if the company would pivot to lifelike virtual avatars as technology advances, the Bitstrips chief executive, Ba Blackstock, a former cartoonist who joined Snap after the acquisition, balked.All animations courtesy of Snapchat.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the author of \u201cAugmented Human.\" She is Helen Papagiannis, not Pappagiannis.Advertisement"}

DeepFarhad isn\u2019t quite ready yet, but our engineers are confident that it will attain Farhad-level insights fairly soon.But while you\u2019re still here in human form, let\u2019s talk about the year\u2019s biggest overarching tech narrative: the \u201ctechlash\u201d against companies like Facebook and Google over issues like privacy, data protection and antitrust concerns. As someone who has been mercifully spared from every twist and turn of the techlash, does it feel like a lot has changed since you left?When I left, Facebook was under the gun, Amazon was getting hit by President Trump, and Apple and Google were trying to stand clear of the fallout. Three months later, Facebook is still under the gun, the president still regards Amazon as a pariah, and Apple and Google still would very much like to be excluded from these narratives.I\u2019m not saying I was expecting wholesale structural change among entrenched businesses over the course of a season. But, still: For all the fireworks in Washington, there\u2019s been little movement on regulation or legislation to curb some of the excesses in tech. I don\u2019t see much of an advance toward stricter antitrust scrutiny of the large tech firms. And their most recent earnings reports show they\u2019re all going gangbusters; Americans may harbor growing worries about the power of tech companies, but not enough to make us quit them.Which isn\u2019t to say the techlash isn\u2019t real, just that change will come slowly. We\u2019re all living in a world where most communication and commerce is ruled by a handful of nearly unregulated oligopolies. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t change quickly, I guess.Techlash indeed!And then there was the bit about how we\u2019re all staring at our phones too much. The tech industry has been consumed recently by new worries over \u201ctech addiction,\u201d and both Facebook and Google recently announced plans to tackle digital \u201cwell-being.\u201d Now Apple\u2019s jumping in, too. In the next version of iOS, your phone will give you detailed stats about how often you use your phone and what you do on it, and it will even let you block yourself and your children from using certain apps.It seems slightly opportunistic to kick a social network while it\u2019s down, but Apple\u2019s aggressive criticism also highlights the real and growing philosophical differences between the two companies. Facebook is an advertising-supported communications conglomerate aimed at the masses, and dead set on remaining free so that all seven billion humans on Earth can eventually be connected (and monetized) through its platform. Apple is predominantly a high-end hardware business that caters to an increasingly privacy-conscious consumer base, and thinks that security will be a differentiating factor when people choose which smartphones, tablets and laptops to buy.Maybe it was inevitable that these two giants would clash, but to a tech writer who lives for drama, it\u2019s still interesting to watch.Anyway, that\u2019s all for now.

For the past few days the president has been engaged in a campaign of words over his trade plans with another of the state\u2019s businesses \u2014 Harley-Davidson, the 115-year-old motorcycle maker that has long been an icon of Wisconsin.He added: \u201cBuild them in the U.S.A. Your customers won\u2019t be happy if you don\u2019t.\u201dPlans for the Foxconn factory, too, have been a matter of great debate. Advocates have held it up as opening a new high-tech manufacturing era for the southeastern portion of the state, once a major center for auto assembly.State officials say the jobs would pay, on average, $53,875 a year plus competitive benefits packages. Gov. Walker called it the state\u2019s largest-ever economic development project and said it could help reverse a \u201cbrain drain\u201d problem the state has long grappled with.With campaigns underway, Mr. Trump\u2019s pointed remarks about Harley-Davidson have also left Mr. Walker and other Wisconsin Republicans in a difficult position: How to support one of the state\u2019s beloved companies without crossing the president?Mr. Walker, who has a 2003 Harley Road King and has ridden it regularly during his campaigns, did not mention the company on Thursday.

{"Headline": "Apple to Close iPhone Security Hole That Law Enforcement Uses to Crack Devices", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe F.B.I. eventually paid a third party to get into the phone, circumventing the need for Apple\u2019s help. Since then, law enforcement agencies across the country have increasingly employed that strategy to get into locked iPhones they hope will hold the key to cracking cases.Now Apple is closing the technological loophole that let authorities hack into iPhones, angering police and other officials and reigniting a debate over whether the government has a right to get into the personal devices that are at the center of modern life.Apple said it was planning an iPhone software update that would effectively disable the phone\u2019s charging and data port \u2014 the opening where users plug in headphones, power cables and adapters \u2014 an hour after the phone is locked. While a phone can still be charged, a person would first need to enter the phone\u2019s password to transfer data to or from the device using the port.Such a change would hinder law enforcement officials, who have typically been opening locked iPhones by connecting another device running special software to the port, often days or even months after the smartphone was last unlocked. News of Apple\u2019s planned software update has begun spreading through security blogs and law enforcement circles \u2014 and many in investigative agencies are infuriated.\u201cIf we go back to the situation where we again don\u2019t have access, now we know directly all the evidence we\u2019ve lost and all the kids we can\u2019t put into a position of safety,\u201d said Chuck Cohen, who leads an Indiana State Police task force on internet crimes against children. The Indiana State Police said it unlocked 96 iPhones for various cases this year, each time with a warrant, using a $15,000 device it bought in March from a company called Grayshift.But privacy advocates said Apple would be right to fix a security flaw that has become easier and cheaper to exploit. \u201cThis is a really big vulnerability in Apple\u2019s phones,\u201d said Matthew D. Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University. A Grayshift device sitting on a desk at a police station, he said, \u201ccould very easily leak out into the world.\u201dIn an email, an Apple spokesman, Fred Sainz, said the company is constantly strengthening security protections and fixes any vulnerability it finds in its phones, partly because criminals could also exploit the same flaws that law enforcement agencies use. \u201cWe have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don\u2019t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs,\u201d he said.Apple and Google, which make the software in nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones, began encrypting their mobile software by default in 2014. Encryption scrambles data to make it unreadable until accessed with a special key, often a password. That frustrated police and prosecutors who could not pull data from smartphones, even with a warrant.Since then, two main companies have helped law enforcement hack into iPhones: Cellebrite, an Israeli forensics firm purchased by Japan\u2019s Sun Corporation in 2006, and Grayshift, which was founded by a former Apple engineer in 2016. Law enforcement officials said they generally send iPhones to Cellebrite to unlock, with each phone costing several thousand dollars to open. In March, Grayshift began selling a $15,000 GrayKey device that the police can use to unlock iPhones themselves.Apple has closed loopholes in the past. For years, the police used software to break into phones by simply trying every possible passcode. Apple blocked that technique in 2010 by disabling iPhones after a certain number of incorrect attempts. But the Grayshift and Cellebrite software appear to be able to disable that Apple technology, allowing their devices to test thousands of passcodes, Mr. Green said.Cellebrite declined to comment. Grayshift did not respond to requests for comment.Opening locked iPhones through these methods has become more common, law enforcement officials said. Federal authorities, as well as large state and local police departments, typically have access to the tools, while smaller local agencies enlist the state or federal authorities to help on high-profile cases, they said.\u201cThey are blatantly protecting criminal activity, and only under the guise of privacy for their clients,\u201d he said.Michael Sachs, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said his office uses workarounds \u2014 he declined to specify which \u2014 to access locked iPhones several times a week. That has helped solve a series of cases in recent months, including by getting into an iPhone to find videos of a suspect sexually assaulting a child. The man was convicted this year.The encryption on smartphones applies only to data stored solely on the phone. Companies like Apple and Google regularly give law enforcement officials access to the data that consumers back up on their servers, such as via Apple\u2019s iCloud service. Apple said that since 2013, it has responded to more than 55,000 requests from the United States government seeking information about more than 208,000 devices, accounts or financial identifiers.Apple probably won\u2019t make it any easier for the police if not forced by Congress, given that it has made the privacy and security of iPhones a central selling point. But the company has complied with local laws that conflict with its privacy push. In China, for instance, Apple recently began storing its Chinese customers\u2019 data on Chinese-run servers because of a new law there.Apple\u2019s latest move is part of a longer cat-and-mouse game between tech companies and law enforcement, said Michelle Richardson, an analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which supports protections for online privacy.\u201cPeople always expected there would be this back-and-forth \u2014 that government would be able to hack into these devices, and then Apple would plug the hole and hackers would find another way in,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

It has become an annoying, often toxic and occasionally unsafe place to hang out. More important, it has become an unfair trade: You give up your privacy online, and what you get in return are somewhat convenient services and hyper-targeted ads.Mozilla recently hit the reset button on Firefox.

With Chrome, you can install a third-party extension to block trackers \u2014 but the fewer add-ons you have to tack onto your browser, the better.Security experts applauded Mozilla for stepping up its efforts on privacy.\u201cFirefox does seem to have positioned itself as the privacy-friendly browser, and they have been doing a fantastic job improving security as well,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights nonprofit. \u201cOn the other hand, Google is fundamentally an advertising company, so it\u2019s unlikely that they will ever have a business interest in making Chrome more privacy friendly.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t have privacy without security on the web,\u201d said Parisa Tabriz, a director of engineering for Google who specializes in security.In fact, both Chrome and Firefox have tough security. Both include sandboxing, which isolates processes of the browser so a harmful website doesn\u2019t infect other parts of your machine. So if you loaded a website with malicious code, it would be contained within the webpage so it couldn\u2019t infect your files, webcam and microphone.Google said there was one thing it could do better on: the inclusion of privacy settings to block tracking technology, similar to the tools that Firefox includes.\u201cI think that\u2019s something that we can improve on,\u201d Ms. Tabriz said. \u201cFirefox has some settings that we\u2019re also exploring.\u201dWhich browser is faster?Mozilla\u2019s promise that Firefox consumes less computer memory raises hopes that it should also use less battery life. Yet in my tests on a laptop running a script that automatically reloaded the top 10 news sites, Firefox lasted only a few minutes longer than Chrome before the battery was depleted. On another test, which involved streaming a Netflix video on a loop on each browser, the battery lasted about 20 minutes longer when the Chrome browser was used.Yet the path forward for Mozilla looks increasingly promising for consumers.In addition to the normal Firefox browser, Mozilla offers Firefox Focus, a privacy-centric mobile browser that blocks trackers by default and purges your web browsing history as soon as you close out of a page.These are privacy-conscious web products that Mozilla is in a position to expand on in the long term. The nonprofit has no direct relationship with advertisers; it gets a small sum from search providers like Google and Bing when a search is conducted through their sites using a Firefox product.For Mozilla, there\u2019s a plus side to being the underdog.\u201cThe advantage of when you get beaten down is you kind of drop some of your own ego around your decisions,\u201d Mr. Mayo said. \u201cWe had a lot less to lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Twitter Save the Dictionary?", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the industry struggles, these thirsty dictionary empires battle peppily for online dominance.Back in February 2016, the Merriam-Webster Twitter account began gunning for the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump.Merriam-Webster had about 80,000 followers on Twitter when Lauren Naturale, now 35, took over the account the month before.She said Ms. Schneider told her multiple times that a change in the direction of the feed was needed and implied that Ms. Naturale was trying to advance her own personal political agenda. She quit in part because, she said, Ms. Schneider was upset by the idea that Merriam-Webster was being seen as a politically progressive dictionary.\u201cEvery time we were in the news it was a new crisis,\u201d Ms. Naturale said. \u201cIt was treated like it was a disaster for the company.\u201dLauren Sliter, who oversees the site\u2019s marketing and content strategy, said the company had not taken social media seriously until about a year and a half ago. She first started to understand how her team could work off the news after President Trump was inaugurated and Dictionary.com saw a spike in searches for the word \u201cmisogynist.\u201d\u201cBeing able to go into a forum like Twitter and tell that story, let people connect those dots, was a really interesting thing,\u201d Ms. Sliter said.Their tweets, which are sourced from Dictionary.com, are not always as reliable as one might hope a dictionary would be. The Ambien tweet relies on an inaccurate supposition. Ambien\u2019s maker, Sanofi, says the name is a combination of \u201ca.m.,\u201d as in morning, and \u201cbien,\u201d from the French word for good.Ms. Sliter acknowledges that her company\u2019s Twitter strategy is similar to Merriam-Webster\u2019s, though she says that Dictionary.com is more self-deprecating, and more focused on talking about the news and trends. So \u2026 do the two dictionaries get along?\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not mortal enemies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re kind of like compatriots in a way. We\u2019re working together, we\u2019re doing very similar things.\u201dMs. Schneider said that while imitation was the sincerest form of flattery, she didn\u2019t think the two accounts were comparable. Merriam-Webster, she said, has \u201cmore rigor.\u201dGrant Barrett, a former lexicographer for the Oxford and Cambridge University presses and a host of the radio show \u201cA Way With Words,\u201d agreed with Ms. Schneider. He said that Ms. Naturale had done a good job of capturing the wry, dry way dictionary editors joke with one another and that, by contrast, Dictionary.com\u2019s tweets were often \u201ctoo on the nose.\u201dJohn Cheney-Lippold, a professor of American culture at the University of Michigan who specializes in digital media, said that dictionaries had a particular interest in promoting their brands since President Trump catalyzed a post-truth news environment. \u201cThey are trying valiantly to reassert themselves as the epistemic chiefs of the world,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019re engaging more people, but is that translating to sales?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

People who value their privacy come from all demographic groups, but the impact of consumer tracking varies greatly by race, class and power. When you\u2019re the \u201cright\u201d race, gender and sexual orientation, when you\u2019ve got the right schools and jobs on your profile, marketers use tracking to flatter and include you. When you\u2019re not, tracking is more likely to be used to exclude or exploit you. This disparate impact is a civil rights issue, and it should be treated like one by Congress.It\u2019s one thing to receive junk mail or phone calls because you\u2019re on one of those lists. But the sophisticated, real-time ad targeting developed by Facebook and other companies takes this marketing to another level. Tech companies can now target \u2014 or exclude \u2014 you entirely in secret, and often at the precise moment when you are most vulnerable.Congress needs to act. In other key areas of American economic life, from employment to housing to credit, Congress has built general protections for everyone \u2014 a minimum wage, mortgage insurance, disclosure rules for loans \u2014 but it has also recognized that those are not enough. Instead, in each of these areas, Congress has also seen it necessary to pass special protections for racial minorities and other vulnerable groups.Federal privacy law is blind to race. Legally, creating a list of Ethnic Second-City Strugglers is as innocuous as creating a list of people who like \u201cPAW Patrol.\u201dThe European law thus implicitly recognizes that privacy is a matter of civil rights.

And they are up 45 percent from the depths of the housing crisis in 2012.The big rebound in home prices and the lure of making a quick buck drew more than 200 people on Tuesday to a MidtownManhattan hotel for a two-hour free class on flipping houses. The lunchtime program I dropped in on was part of a sophisticated come-on for a paid three-day workshop that Nathaniel \u201cThan\u201d Merrill and his FortuneBuilders company plan to hold in the New York metropolitan area. An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience. The instructor at the afternoon session sought to inspire the crowd, saying that if they only had the courage, they could someday quit their day jobs and live the way they always wanted to. Judging by the enthusiastic reaction, many were buying the message.- Matthew GoldsteinThe Chinese market is valuable and distinctive from the rest of the world. Arm believes this joint venture, which will license Arm semiconductor technology to Chinese companies and locally develop Arm technology in China, will expand Arm\u2019s opportunities in the Chinese market.Arm estimates that 95 percent of all advanced chips designed in China last year were based on its technology. With China desperate to make its own chips in volume, and quickly (there\u2019s more on that theme below), the move could prove shrewd.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation is rushing to build semiconductor factories. But reports claiming that the Chinese government is probing chip makers over price-fixing demonstrate that it\u2019s not there yet.Reuters notes that, according to Trendforce, China accounts for 20 percent of all global DRAM memory sales. For now, those purchases must be made almost entirely from Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, at what the Chinese government appears to believe may be inflated prices.China\u2019s own production plants \u2014 and carefully controlled pricing \u2014 clearly can\u2019t come soon enough.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe hire shows Washington is becoming more intertwined with corporate America, as the state intervenes in M.&A. and other business dealings.

GitHub fits that vision neatly.Unless Microsoft treads carefully, some could flee to rival repositories like BitBucket or GitLab, which has seen a big spike in traffic since news of the deal broke.\u201cOf course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Facebook\u2019s two billion monthly active users, and the way those accounts are linked and viewed by users and by third parties, have made it the most powerful communications and media company in the world, even if its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, insists his is a technology business.Throughout its history, Facebook has adamantly argued that it treats our data, and who has access to it, as a sort of sacred trust, with Zuckerberg & Company being the trustees. Yet at the same time, Facebook has continued to undermine privacy by making it cumbersome to opt out of sharing, trying to convince users that we actually do want to share all of our personal information (and some people actually do) and by leaving the door unlocked for its partners and clients to come in and help themselves. Those partners have included 60 device makers that used application programming interfaces, also known as A.P.I.s, so Facebook could run on their gadgets.The European Union has passed such legislation, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., which forces companies such as Facebook to do a better job shielding individual data. Facebook says it is willing to extend the G.D.P.R. to anyone who asks for it.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s WWDC 2018 Live: Apple Still Wants to Be Different", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u25a0 Apple is adding tools to help get your information addiction under control.\u25a0 A new feature in Apple\u2019s web browser will make it harder for sites to track you.\u25a0 The company previewed iOS 12, the new version of the iPhone and iPad operating system, including improved speed, bug fixes and other improvements.\u25a0 Apple revealed Siri and photo updates that catches up to competitors.The most notable new feature in iOS 12 is called Screen Time, a tool to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices.The feature shows you a dashboard of apps you regularly use and the amount of time you tend to spend with them. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps: For example, you can give yourself an hour a day to spend inside Instagram, Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app. Parents will also be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones.Apple\u2019s software chief, Craig Federighi, said Apple felt it was time to address smartphones\u2019 oversize impact on everyday life. \u201cFor some of us, it\u2019s become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we\u2019ve become,\u201d he said.The announcement was a bizarre one: A company using one of its biggest events of the year to showcase new tools that help customers use its products less.But the move is most likely shrewd. Apple depends on customers buying its devices, not spending lots of time on them. Apple is pitching the tools as evidence that it is putting its customers\u2019 interests first \u2014 and that if people are worried they are addicted to their smartphone, the iPhone is the device that will help them.The new tools are also a shot across the bow to Silicon Valley\u2019s other big tech companies, like Google, Twitter and particularly Facebook, that depend on users spending more time with their services.Apple\u2019s move is also not happening in a vacuum. Silicon Valley has faced early signs of a reckoning over tech addiction, including an open letter to Apple from investment firm Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System. The letter urged Apple to research the health effects of its products, particularly on children.Will this be enough to help people curb their addiction? Presumably, if you set a limit for yourself you will be able to easily remove the restriction and continue using an app like Instagram when you run out of time.If anything, the feature will certainly make people more mindful (and perhaps ashamed) of how often they use certain apps and encourage them to put their phones down.\u2014 Brian X. Chen and Jack NicasApple took another swing at its rivals Google and Facebook with tools that sharply diminish their ability to track users as they surf across the web.Apple said that by default its Safari browser would disable tracking software that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users\u2019 activity across the internet. The software is often embedded in tools to share, comment or \u201clike\u201d content on third-party sites.To share an article directly to Facebook from a news site, for instance, users of Safari will need to manually allow the software to track them. Apple said it would also make it more difficult for companies that track users using a different technology, known as fingerprinting.As the world wakes up to the sheer amount of user data tech companies have collected over the years, Apple is doubling down on its bid to be the privacy-focused tech firm. Unlike Google and Facebook, which rely on user data to sell ads, Apple\u2019s main business is selling devices to consumers, so its focus on privacy has become a central selling point.Apple said it would also restrict third-party developers\u2019 access to more data on Mac computers, a nod to the scandal over how a Facebook developer enabled the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly harvest the data of millions of Facebook users.\u2014 Jack NicasThe Apple Watch\u2019s latest operating system has a nifty throwback to an old technology: walkie-talkie. \u201cYou press to talk, and your friend can hear your voice \u2014 just like a walkie-talkie,\u201d said Kevin Lynch, Apple\u2019s head of Watch software.The feature works only with users who opt in \u2014 I need your approval to send you a walkie-talkie message \u2014 but it\u2019s striking for the way it improves the Watch\u2019s best feature, letting users stay in touch without having to use a phone.There were also a few new features for activity monitoring. The new software will automatically start tracking a workout even if you didn\u2019t let tell it you were working out. And it has a new way to let you compete with friends. For instance, you can set up a weeklong exercise-off between you and a friend.But all this requires waiting. The new OS will be available for the Watch later this year, through a software update.\u2014 Farhad ManjooApple\u2019s head of software, Craig Federighi, opened the event with the introduction of a new mobile operating system, iOS 12, an update that he said was focused on speed.\u201cFor iOS 12, we are doubling down on performance,\u201d he said. The update increases the speed for many important features of iOS, like the camera app and keyboard. In Apple\u2019s testing, apps launched two times faster in iOS 12 compared with the last system.The new operating system will work with devices as far back as the iPhone 5S from 2013.Here\u2019s something Apple should fix at the event: its Wi-Fi. None of us are able to get on the internet. I\u2019m barely hanging on to a connection on my iPhone hot spot. Wireless has always been spotty at these events with so many devices in the audience fighting for a connection, but this is exceptionally bad.\u2014 Brian X. ChenIt\u2019s crystal clear that iOS 12 is focused on improving on existing features rather than bombarding users with brand-new features.In addition to updating the Photos app and expanding Siri, Apple made minor updates to its Apple News, Stocks, Messages and FaceTime apps. The Apple News app now lets you discover articles through topics, and the Stocks app now loads Apple News stories that are related to stocks that you follow.The Messages app was updated to let you create some custom emojis with the camera. And the FaceTime app lets you do a video call between multiple people, similar to Google Hangouts.Again, Apple is responding to some negative feedback. Over the last few years, app developers and users have complained that iOS was getting increasingly bloated and confusing to use.This is a good time for Apple to slow down on adding new features, especially after the introduction of the iPhone X, which fundamentally changes how the iPhone works by removing the home button.This software conference illuminates Apple\u2019s revised software strategy. In the past, Apple updated each new version of iOS on an annual basis with a long list of new features.But recently, the company announced to employees that it would revise its strategy to a two-year cycle. In other words, next year, you can expect iOS 13 to have a barrage of new features. In the following year, iOS 14 will focus on improving those features. Rinse and repeat.However, Apple doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down the pace of upgrades for the Apple Watch, a much younger product. Each version of Watch OS has introduced significant changes to the way the watch works. Apple\u2019s allocation of resources to the watch shows that the company is treating the wearable computer as the post-smartphone device.In a decade, will we all be wearing our phones?\u2014 Brian X.

{"Headline": "Facebook Gave Device Makers Deep Access to Data on Users and Friends", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "The company formed data-sharing partnerships with Apple, Samsung and dozens of other device makers, raising new concerns about its privacy protections.As Facebook sought to become the world\u2019s dominant social media service, it struck agreements allowing phone and other device makers access to vast amounts of its users\u2019 personal information.Facebook has reached data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers \u2014 including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung \u2014 over the last decade, starting before Facebook apps were widely available on smartphones, company officials said. The deals allowed Facebook to expand its reach and let device makers offer customers popular features of the social network, such as messaging, \u201clike\u201d buttons and address books.But the partnerships, whose scope has not previously been reported, raise concerns about the company\u2019s privacy protections and compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing, The New York Times found.[Here\u2019s what we know about Facebook\u2019s partnerships with device makers.]In the furor that followed, Facebook\u2019s leaders said that the kind of access exploited by Cambridge in 2014 was cut off by the next year, when Facebook prohibited developers from collecting information from users\u2019 friends. But the company officials did not disclose that Facebook had exempted the makers of cellphones, tablets and other hardware from such restrictions.In interviews, Facebook officials defended the data sharing as consistent with its privacy policies, the F.T.C. agreement and pledges to users. They said its partnerships were governed by contracts that strictly limited use of the data, including any stored on partners\u2019 servers. The officials added that they knew of no cases where the information had been misused.The company views its device partners as extensions of Facebook, serving its more than two billion users, the officials said.\u201cThese partnerships work very differently from the way in which app developers use our platform,\u201d said Ime Archibong, a Facebook vice president. Unlike developers that provide games and services to Facebook users, the device partners can use Facebook data only to provide versions of \u201cthe Facebook experience,\u201d the officials said.Some device partners can retrieve Facebook users\u2019 relationship status, religion, political leaning and upcoming events, among other data. Tests by The Times showed that the partners requested and received data in the same way other third parties did.Facebook\u2019s view that the device makers are not outsiders lets the partners go even further, The Times found: They can obtain data about a user\u2019s Facebook friends, even those who have denied Facebook permission to share information with any third parties.In interviews, several former Facebook software engineers and security experts said they were surprised at the ability to override sharing restrictions.\u201cIt\u2019s like having door locks installed, only to find out that the locksmith also gave keys to all of his friends so they can come in and rifle through your stuff without having to ask you for permission,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a research and privacy consultant who formerly served as the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist.By Rich Harris and Gabriel J.X. DanceDetails of Facebook\u2019s partnerships have emerged amid a reckoning in Silicon Valley over the volume of personal information collected on the internet and monetized by the tech industry. The pervasive collection of data, while largely unregulated in the United States, has come under growing criticism from elected officials at home and overseas and provoked concern among consumers about how freely their information is shared.In a tense appearance before Congress in March, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, emphasized what he said was a company priority for Facebook users.\u201cEvery piece of content that you share on Facebook you own,\u201d he testified. \u201dYou have complete control over who sees it and how you share it.\u201dBut the device partnerships provoked discussion even within Facebook as early as 2012, according to Sandy Parakilas, who at the time led third-party advertising and privacy compliance for Facebook\u2019s platform.\u201cThis was flagged internally as a privacy issue,\u201d said Mr. Parakilas, who left Facebook that year and has recently emerged as a harsh critic of the company. \u201cIt is shocking that this practice may still continue six years later, and it appears to contradict Facebook\u2019s testimony to Congress that all friend permissions were disabled.\u201dThe submission followed testimony by Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, during a closed-door German parliamentary hearing in April. Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, one of the lawmakers who questioned Mr. Kaplan, said in an interview that she believed the data partnerships disclosed by Facebook violated users\u2019 privacy rights.\u201cWhat we have been trying to determine is whether Facebook has knowingly handed over user data elsewhere without explicit consent,\u201d Ms. Winkelmeier-Becker said. \u201cI would never have imagined that this might even be happening secretly via deals with device makers. BlackBerry users seem to have been turned into data dealers, unknowingly and unwillingly.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Samsung declined to respond to questions about whether it had any data-sharing partnerships with Facebook. Amazon also declined to respond to questions.Usher Lieberman, a BlackBerry spokesman, said in a statement that the company used Facebook data only to give its own customers access to their Facebook networks and messages. Mr. Lieberman said that the company \u201cdid not collect or mine the Facebook data of our customers,\u201d adding that \u201cBlackBerry has always been in the business of protecting, not monetizing, customer data.\u201dMicrosoft entered a partnership with Facebook in 2008 that allowed Microsoft-powered devices to do things like add contacts and friends and receive notifications, according to a spokesman. He added that the data was stored locally on the phone and was not synced to Microsoft\u2019s servers.Facebook acknowledged that some partners did store users\u2019 data \u2014 including friends\u2019 data \u2014 on their own servers. A Facebook official said that regardless of where the data was kept, it was governed by strict agreements between the companies.\u201cI am dumbfounded by the attitude that anybody in Facebook\u2019s corporate office would think allowing third parties access to data would be a good idea,\u201d said Henning Schulzrinne, a computer science professor at Columbia University who specializes in network security and mobile systems.The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how loosely Facebook had policed the bustling ecosystem of developers building apps on its platform. They ranged from well-known players like Zynga, the maker of the FarmVille game, to smaller ones, like a Cambridge contractor who used a quiz taken by about 300,000 Facebook users to gain access to the profiles of as many as 87 million of their friends.Those developers relied on Facebook\u2019s public data channels, known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. But starting in 2007, the company also established private data channels for device manufacturers.At the time, mobile phones were less powerful, and relatively few of them could run stand-alone Facebook apps like those now common on smartphones. The company continued to build new private APIs for device makers through 2014, spreading user data through tens of millions of mobile devices, game consoles, televisions and other systems outside Facebook\u2019s direct control.Facebook began moving to wind down the partnerships in April, after assessing its privacy and data practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mr. Archibong said the company had concluded that the partnerships were no longer needed to serve Facebook users. About 22 of them have been shut down.The broad access Facebook provided to device makers raises questions about its compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the F.T.C.After the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the F.T.C. began an investigation into whether Facebook\u2019s continued sharing of data after 2011 violated the decree, potentially exposing the company to fines.Facebook officials said the private data channels did not violate the decree because the company viewed its hardware partners as \u201cservice providers,\u201d akin to a cloud computing service paid to store Facebook data or a company contracted to process credit card transactions. According to the consent decree, Facebook does not need to seek additional permission to share friend data with service providers.\u201cThese contracts and partnerships are entirely consistent with Facebook\u2019s F.T.C. consent decree,\u201d Mr. Archibong, the Facebook official, said.But Jessica Rich, a former F.T.C. official who helped lead the commission\u2019s earlier Facebook investigation, disagreed with that assessment.\u201cUnder Facebook\u2019s interpretation, the exception swallows the rule,\u201d said Ms. Rich, now with the Consumers Union. \u201cThey could argue that any sharing of data with third parties is part of the Facebook experience. And this is not at all how the public interpreted their 2014 announcement that they would limit third-party app access to friend data.\u201dTo test one partner\u2019s access to Facebook\u2019s private data channels, The Times used a reporter\u2019s Facebook account \u2014 with about 550 friends \u2014 and a 2013 BlackBerry device, monitoring what data the device requested and received. (More recent BlackBerry devices, which run Google\u2019s Android operating system, do not use the same private channels, BlackBerry officials said.)Immediately after the reporter connected the device to his Facebook account, it requested some of his profile data, including user ID, name, picture, \u201cabout\u201d information, location, email and cellphone number. The device then retrieved the reporter\u2019s private messages and the responses to them, along with the name and user ID of each person with whom he was communicating.The data flowed to a BlackBerry app known as the Hub, which was designed to let BlackBerry users view all of their messages and social media accounts in one place.The Hub also requested \u2014 and received \u2014 data that Facebook\u2019s policy appears to prohibit. Since 2015, Facebook has said that apps can request only the names of friends using the same app. But the BlackBerry app had access to all of the reporter\u2019s Facebook friends and, for most of them, returned information such as user ID, birthday, work and education history and whether they were currently online.The BlackBerry device was also able to retrieve identifying information for nearly 295,000 Facebook users. Most of them were second-degree Facebook friends of the reporter, or friends of friends.In all, Facebook empowers BlackBerry devices to access more than 50 types of information about users and their friends, The Times found.Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.June 4, 2018April 4, 2018March 20, 2018March 17, 2018Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Tech Companies Met With Intelligence Officials to Discuss Midterms", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Eight of the tech industry\u2019s most influential companies, in anticipation of a repeat of the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, met with United States intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for this year\u2019s midterm elections.The meeting, which took place May 23 at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., was also attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oath, Snap and Twitter, according to three attendees of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because of its sensitive nature.The company officials met with Christopher Krebs, an under secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s newly formed \u201cforeign influence\u201d task force.Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the F.B.I. responded to a request for comment.Companies like Facebook and Twitter have been changing the way they operate to counter the kind of misinformation that plagued the two social services in 2016. But the May meeting was the first significant discussion between a group of tech companies and intelligence officials ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.The meeting, which was initiated by Facebook, was seen as a hopeful first step to ensure that the midterms were not a repeat of the Russian interference in 2016, said the three people who attended the meeting.But the people who attended described a tense atmosphere in which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information, only to be told \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that no specific intelligence would be shared.The tech companies shared details about disinformation campaigns they were witnessing on their platforms, but neither the F.B.I. nor the Department of Homeland Security was willing or able to share specific information about threats the tech companies should anticipate, the people said.One attendee of the meeting said the encounter led the tech companies to believe they would be on their own to counter election interference.Facebook, in particular, has been facing pressure to stem disinformation ahead of the elections. The company has been hit hard by reports that it allowed Russian-backed agents to buy advertisements and manage Facebook pages with one notable goal: influence voters in the United States and stoke conflict on hot-button issues like gun control.In public and behind closed doors, intelligence officials have offered scant details about what Russia is doing, prompting frustration from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill.Officials in Washington have described problems that range from intelligence agencies losing track of Russian targets to the same kind of poor communication between various intelligence-gathering agencies that hampered the response of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency has proved an especially vexing target in recent months, stepping up efforts to mask its activity, said an American official with access to intelligence reporting.Unlike in 2016, when Russian hackers left unmistakable footprints \u2014 posting tweets that identified locations, for instance, or working in Cyrillic language documents \u2014 they are now making much better use of virtual private networks and other tools that can hide their true identities and locations.At times, the official said, intelligence agencies have lost track of specific individuals they were tracking, and could not see what, if anything, the Russians were posting or trying to hack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting so many mixed signals, depending on what the agency is,\u201d Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters last week.He said his committee was planning to bring together intelligence officials next month to figure out what was going on and how the government should handle it. \u201cIt compels us to bring everybody together in the same room and try to figure out whether or not there\u2019s some stovepipe issues,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Part of the problem, officials say, is that the White House has expressed little interest in the problem of Russian interference, and that the apathy has had a trickle-down effect. Without pressure from the top, it can be difficult to bring together all the different strands of intelligence collected across America\u2019s spy agencies, and evaluate how to act on it.\u201cWhat we would normally see in a normal administration is the principals meeting to discuss what are they doing individually, what are they doing jointly, or what they are communicating among themselves, what\u2019s the whole of government plan to protect the midterms,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and the top minority member on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with Politico. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any evidence that\u2019s happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
