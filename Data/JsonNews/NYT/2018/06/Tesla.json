But now he\u2019s turned it into a financial product \u2014 an exchange-traded fund made of a selection of Russell 1000 companies, based on his metrics \u2014 with the help of the Wall Street bank.Only 6 percent of the calculation of the index relates to how well a company provides investor return. Whether the formula is a winning one for investors is a bit of an open question. The fund would have outperformed the Russell 1000 by 3.47 percent over the past two years. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is there is no way to test the formula any further back, and each year, the index changes based on shifts in the polling.Allegations of a visit to a brothel may have been the final straw. More from Madison Marriage and Matthew Garrahan:Interviews with a range of WPP employees, past and present, have now allowed a picture of events to emerge, which centres on an alleged visit to a Mayfair brothel one year ago \u2014 said to have been witnessed by two employees, one of whom later reported it to the company. This alleged incident raised questions about the possible use of company funds and appeared to fit a pattern where personal and company expenses were hard to separate.Much of the information that Facebook included was not new and the social network sidestepped providing detailed answers. In dozens of responses about how Facebook operates and how it deals with its online content, the company referred members of Congress back to its terms of service and community standards. In 224 instances, Facebook simply asked lawmakers to look back at previously answered questions.America\u2019s central bank is expected to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate to somewhere between 1.75 percent and 2 percent tomorrow. But it faces a tricky balancing act, and the wrong choice could lead to a recession.Could a tighter labor market bring in people not already in the job market and raise workforce participation rates? If that happens, the economy will be in a position to draw on those unused resources and keep growing without overheating. That would allow the Fed to raise rates more slowly than it otherwise would. If there aren\u2019t people outside of the labor market ready to enter, the Fed could raise rates more aggressively. Higher inflation requires tighter credit to keep price pressures in check.Advertisement"}

Mr. Yoon, who moved to the United States from South Korea 18 years ago, added that he has little faith that Mr. Kim has good intentions when it comes to nuclear disarmament.\u201cHe\u2019s a terrorist,\u201d said Mr. Yoon, who still has family in South Korea. \u201c I don\u2019t believe Kim Jong-un.\u201dAsked if he had been watching the news coverage, he pointed at the pool hall\u2019s television with a slight shrug; the program on display was a Korean talk show. \u201cKim Jong-un is evil,\u201d he added, and he did not need to watch the news to make up his mind about that. He soon returned to his game.Lee Inho, 20, who moved to the United States when he was 5, said he was not even aware there was a meeting happening. \u201cThat\u2019s something Americans care about,\u201d he said with a smile, before walking back to a pool table to take his turn.Down the street, at a cafe blasting Korean pop music, Oh Sooh-Ah, 21, said that she had followed the coverage of the meeting in Korean newspapers. But Ms. Oh, who left Korea nearly 11 years ago, said she and her family have scarcely discussed the meeting. She added that Korean families are often reluctant to discuss politics.She also said her life here in the United States felt a long way away from the problems facing the Korean Peninsula.\u201cOf course we\u2019re worried, our friends and families are there,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying people don\u2019t care. But people here aren\u2019t feeling the reality of it.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)If you were a fan of the TV show \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d in the early 1990s, a new pop-up restaurant in West Hollywood has emerged to refill your nostalgia reserves. The restaurant, Saved by the Max, meticulously recreates the neon-lit cafe where the kids from Bayside High School in the fictional Los Angeles suburb of Palisades liked to hang out after class, Frank DeCaro says in his review for The Times.\u201cWhen I walked into that place, my knees buckled because it was just perfect,\u201d said Dennis Haskins, the actor who played Principal Richard \u201cThe Big Bopper\u201d Belding on the show. \u201cI was looking around for the crew.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "Three days in Wyoming as the hip-hop firebrand tends to his scars.Supported by\u201cHe could look at me and you know, I don\u2019t know why he mentioned suicide, but he could tell that I was very low,\u201d Kanye recalled in early June over breakfast at the rustic modernist home here that he\u2019s been renting and making music in. \u201cReally medicated, shoulders slumped down, and my confidence was gone, which is a lot of the root of my superpower, because if you truly have self-confidence, no one can say anything to you.\u201dMr. Robbins, who is known for his boisterous seminars that feature hot-coal walking, had been summoned by Kanye\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West, to stage something like an intervention.And so Mr. Robbins looked Kanye in the eyes and started issuing instructions. Made him stand up, get into a warrior pose and scream.\u201cI was so self-conscious about the nanny and the housekeeper that I didn\u2019t want them to hear me screaming in the living room,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI think that that\u2019s such a metaphor of something for the existence of so-called well-off people that they\u2019re not really well-off \u2014 they won\u2019t even scream in their own house.\u201dHe was reluctant. But he screamed.The fix wasn\u2019t instantaneous. \u201cI still felt self-conscious,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my confidence back.\u201d But it was a start.Certainly, casual dismissal of Kanye has always been a built-in feature of his fame, but in terms of public perception, it\u2019s possible he\u2019s never been more radioactive. The world is now more skeptical and less patient. Over the past decade and a half, objection has tended to roll off him; now it\u2019s sticking.But over two days of extended interviews that took place in his rented Amangani Resort home, on long walks through Jackson, and in lengthy car rides spanning eastern Idaho to Yellowstone National Park \u2014 edited excerpts from which are included below \u2014 Kanye was calm, measured, verging on beatific, and also self-aware and willing to reckon with the challenges he\u2019d created for himself.He is, comparatively, pragmatic \u2014 attuned to his own limitations, mindful of the shifting pecking orders in hip-hop and fashion, interested in coexistence rather than conflict. And though it was almost two miles from the restaurant to the Movieworks Cinema 4, where he wanted to see \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story,\u201d he decided to walk.The day was bright, crisp, a little cool, and his step was brisk. He was wearing a black-gray-and-white flannel shirt, black Patagonia fleece pants, unreleased Yeezy 700s and an industrial-orange ski cap. His security was pacing him in a pair of black Suburbans, going slow in the fast lane, or slipping in and out of adjacent parking lots.Kanye barely acknowledged them, though \u2014 instead he focused on the kids. Dozens of them. They ran out of restaurants and asked for pictures, or pulled their cars over to the side of the road, some of them blasting \u201cYe.\u201d The unplanned attention might have unnerved Kanye in the past, but now he looked pleased to be interrupted. And he made sure to ask what every single kid\u2019s favorite song was.\u201cThere were people who said Trump would never win,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the it-will-never-happens of the world, people in high school told you things would never happen.\u201d To his mind, he was supporting a friend and kindred spirit, and also speaking up in a way others wouldn\u2019t \u2014 as is his wont, generally.\u201cI felt that I knew people who voted for Trump that were celebrities that were scared to say that they liked him. But they told me, and I liked him, and I\u2019m not scared to say what I like,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me come over here and get in this fight with you.\u201dIs there anything a person could do that is so beyond the pale that you would not support them, even if you liked them?I wanted to make my album cover the doctor that performed my mom\u2019s last surgery. I think that\u2019s pretty big on the cancel-culture territory. I\u2019m starting saying, \u201cI\u2019m not canceling him,\u201d \u2019cause the world canceled him. I believe in the court of public opinion that that thought has to change. Do you feel there is an expectation of you \u2014 because you\u2019re a successful black man in this country \u2014 to take on certain political or cultural positions?Oh yeah, definitely. When I was in high school, most of my opinions were, like, only me and a couple people who thought like me.But now you feel the pressure to speak for a whole group of people?Nah. It\u2019s a rhetorical dumbass question \u2014 you could just say yes \u2014 but do you think there are a lot of husband-and-wife situations where the husband in the household liked Trump and voted on Trump and maybe the wife didn\u2019t, or vice versa?Of course.Man, I had my [expletive] [expletive] castrated: \u201cYou have to like Hillary. That\u2019s got to be your choice.\u201dThat\u2019s what the family was telling you?When did that change happen?Getting out, learning how to not be highly medicated and, you know, just standing up saying I know I could lose a lot of things, but just standing up and saying what you feel, and not even doing a lot of research on it. Having a political opinion that\u2019s overly informed, it\u2019s like knowing how to dress, as opposed to being a child \u2014 \u201cI like this.\u201d I hear Trump talk and I\u2019m like, I like the way it sounds, knowing that there\u2019s people who like me that don\u2019t like the way it sounds.But if he says something like he doesn\u2019t want to let Muslims into the country, do you like the way that sounds?No, I don\u2019t agree with all of his policies.If he\u2019d come into the public eye via technology, not music \u2014 if he were white, not black \u2014 Kanye might be viewed as a lovable, idiosyncratic futurist, not a perennial agitator.\u201cWe need to be able to be in situations where you can be irresponsible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great privileges of an artist. An artist should be irresponsible in a way \u2014 a 3-year-old.\u201dFully rendering his speech would require something akin to musical notation \u2014 markings to denote speed, spacing, emphasis, even the words\u2019 seriousness or lack thereof, or the percent to which he was certain of what he was saying as opposed to just trying a thought out. (Twitter is in some ways the medium least well suited to his thought process. He isn\u2019t gnomic, or pithy; he\u2019s roundabout, elaborative.)This is, generally speaking, an approach incompatible with a media environment that ruthlessly records, dissects and parses each moment, examining it hard for flaws.Or not. \u201cI felt like it was something missing,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI just had a gut innate feeling to go to TMZ.\u201dBut most crucially, and most alarmingly, he said that 400 years of slavery \u201csound like a choice.\u201dHe continued, delineating the path of many a Kanye West public conflagration. \u201cI think an extreme thing; I adjust it, I adjust it, I adjust it,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I get to it, but I have to push to, you know, the furthest concept possible.\u201dThe TMZ appearance essentially squandered all of the public good will Kanye had accumulated earlier in the day \u2014 except in the view of Kanye, who naturally saw the two media appearances as part of the same continuum.\u201cI think it was totally beautiful, both of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Charlamagne one was like the most beautiful funeral you\u2019ve ever been to, and you close the casket, and say this is done.\u201dAnd the TMZ one?How does it make you feel when you know an experiment didn\u2019t work?Awesome. I learned so much. I learned about the context of the idea of the word slave. I didn\u2019t take it in that context. I think that my personality and energy mirrors Nat Turner, or it had in the past, but that showed me that also that Nat Turner approach would land me in the same place Nat Turner landed, and that I would be legendary but also just a martyr. But I guess we\u2019re all martyrs eventually, and we\u2019re all guaranteed to die. To clarify, do you believe that slavery in this country was a choice?Well, I never said that. If you could say it again how would you frame it?I wouldn\u2019t frame a one-liner or a headline. What I would say is actually it\u2019s literally like I feel like I\u2019m in court having to justify a robbery that I didn\u2019t actually commit, where I\u2019m having to somehow reframe something that I never said. I feel stupid to have to say out loud that I know that being put on the boat was \u2014 but also I\u2019m not backing down, bro. What I will do is I\u2019ll take responsibility for the fact that I allowed my voice to be used back to back in ways that were not protective of it when my voice means too much.Back to back?Wearing the [Trump] hat, because my voice is unprotected, and I believe that the black community wants to protect my voice. By me saying slave in any way at TMZ left my voice unprotected. So it\u2019s not a matter of the facts of if I said that exact line or not, it\u2019s the fact that I put myself in a position to be unprotected by my tribe.Do you feel that if black fans abandon you, that\u2019s something that you could come back from? Do you think that is a death blow?It\u2019s not going to happen.It\u2019s just not going to happen?Within a minute, he was fixated on the store\u2019s offerings: well-worn ski jackets, fleeces, snow pants and more. Nothing fancy or luxury, just styles so mainstream as to be almost vernacular.Kanye pressed Mr. Abloh for more: \u201cI\u2019m not canceled out the culture? People are listening to it?\u201d \u201cYou see me and Virgil\u2019s relationship,\u201d he said in the S.U.V. on the ride back from the secondhand store. \u201cI don\u2019t know what might have been in your mind, but there might have been some place where you wonder if those dudes still talk like that. And you saw, we do.\u201dWhat did you have to cleanse to get to that place, to be back at that rhythm?Jealousy and fear.Fear of what?Losing \u201cruler,\u201d \u201cking,\u201d \u201ccrown.\u201d And it was this thing where it\u2019s like O.K., you\u2019re not the No. 1 rapper, Drake\u2019s the No. 1 rapper, but you\u2019re the No. 1 with shoes, or this or that. And it\u2019s like yo, no more No. 1s. What\u2019s the No. 1 tree over there? Just be one of them. All of them are beautiful. If you cut one of those trees down, what would it be worth? Those look like $400,000 trees, just one of them, and look at how many of them are.Perhaps the most consequential lyrics of this Kanye era are about mental health. On Pusha-T\u2019s \u201cWhat Would Meek Do?\u201d he declaims, \u201cNo more hidin\u2019 the scars/I show \u2019em like Seal, right?\u201d On \u201cYikes,\u201d from \u201cYe,\u201d he announced the bipolar disorder diagnosis. \u201cThat\u2019s my superpower,\u201d he scream-rapped. \u201cAin\u2019t no disability/I\u2019m a superhero! I\u2019m a superhero!\u201dAnd on the \u201cYe\u201d opener, \u201cI Thought About Killing You,\u201d the clouds get darker: \u201cToday I thought about killing you, premeditated murder/I think about killing myself/And I, I love myself way more than I love you.\u201dOh yeah, I\u2019ve thought about killing myself all the time. It\u2019s always a option and [expletive]. Like Louis C.K. said: I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options.Later, he added: \u201cI\u2019m just having this epiphany now, \u2019cause I didn\u2019t do it, but I did think it all the way through. But if I didn\u2019t think it all the way through, then it\u2019s actually maybe more of a chance of it happening.\u201d\u201cDid you see my tweet?\u201d he asked. Overnight, he\u2019d sent out a missive putting an end to the reignited feud between Pusha-T and Drake, in so much as someone who was not one of the primary participants can do that.Friction between Kanye and Drake has replaced friction between Kanye and Jay-Z as hip-hop\u2019s central Oedipal drama even if at this point the two are, for all intents and purposes, peers. (At one point, they were recording music for a possible collaborative album.)Kanye has long worked with songwriters \u2014 something that, because it\u2019s perceived as heterodoxy, is rarely discussed openly. In this moment of increased transparency, though, he\u2019s become Zen about sharing the details.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible how we just sit there and just think and rethink and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite,\u201d he said of his studio sessions. \u201cWe\u2019re not pulling off a magic trick here. We\u2019re like Tesla, we\u2019re not \u2018The Prestige.\u2019\u201dSince leaving the hospital, Kanye had been compiling notes about his experiences and feelings. For \u201cYe,\u201d he turned them over to various writers, so that they might help put structure to the thoughts.Many are people he\u2019s worked with for years and trusts implicitly. CyHi the Prynce is, he said, the best at finding those shapes. The line on \u201cAll Mine\u201d about Stormy Daniels, that came from Consequence. \u201cSometimes I take all the shine/talk like I drank all the wine,\u201d on \u201cGhost Town,\u201d was contributed by Malik Yusef.In the same way the clothes in the secondhand store struck Kanye as very Yeezy, the same goes for other rappers\u2019 words and flows. And like the clothes, he chooses freely among them for inspiration, building his public, creative self from all the parts available to him. He even cited the way Tony Robbins delivers his messages as a songwriting inspiration. \u201cThis is a really interesting moment,\u201d he said of discussing this process openly. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a controversial moment, right?\u201dJumping out of the car at a rest stop, he said, \u201cI hope they got a fresh-ass T-shirt.\u201d They don\u2019t, but he buys some small toys for his children, and stocks up on Doritos and jerky for the road.As the Suburban pushed onward into Yellowstone National Park, he tried to call Kim, but reception was bad and he couldn\u2019t get through. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to tell my girl I\u2019m going to Yellowstone, \u2019cause we never did it,\u201d he said. A few minutes later, he added with a shrug, \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it looks the same as where we stay.\u201dIf there has been a corrective force during this tumultuous period, it\u2019s been Kim, whom Kanye married in 2014. They now have three children: 5-year-old North; 2-year-old Saint and 5-month-old Chicago. Their lives and businesses are symbiotic. She flew to Wyoming to celebrate at the ranch with Kanye, and over the next two days, they checked in regularly by phone. At one point, she sent him a video of North singing the chorus of \u201cNo Mistakes,\u201d and he watched it dozens of times, ignoring everyone in the room.One of the most affecting songs on \u201cYe\u201d is \u201cWouldn\u2019t Leave,\u201d in which Kanye suggests that his TMZ appearance put his marriage at risk.\u201cThere was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, \u2018Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo that was a real conversation.\u201dLike many of the songs on \u201cYe,\u201d this one functions as both personal and professional, micro and macro, individual and universal. Kanye is serenading not just his wife, but also the fans who stuck by him during this most trying period.Or as he put it on \u201cNo Mistakes,\u201d \u201cFor all my dogs that stayed down, we up again.\u201dStaying down, he understands, has not been a given. \u201cHalf that audience that was there last night, half the people that are listening to the album are supposed to not listen to the album right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m canceled. I\u2019m canceled because I didn\u2019t cancel Trump.\u201d (On a call earlier in the day with Khlo\u00e9, he acknowledged the challenge: \u201cI set the video game on the hardest setting possible, the most hate possible.\u201d) Getting comfortable with the dissonance, that\u2019s the thing. For someone who spent the whole of his early career in conquer mode, constantly questioning anyone who doubted him, accepting that you can\u2019t always control your own narrative is a kind of growth. Along the way, there will be missteps, setbacks, even upheavals. The healthiest choice, Kanye has discovered, is to learn from them, accept them and absorb them into who he\u2019s becoming.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a rapper who has worked with Kanye West. He is CyHi the Prynce, not CyHi the Prince.Advertisement"}

For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201cI want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines. For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201dUnder Mr. Schultz\u2019s three decades managing the company, Starbucks grew from a tiny local chain into a global coffee giant, operating 28,000 stores in 75 countries. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Microsoft\u2019s planned acquisition of GitHub, a software development company, is not close to the company\u2019s largest, and it will not have a big, immediate impact on profits.But the deal is a milestone because it reveals the degree to which the rise in Microsoft\u2019s stock has bolstered its heft as an acquirer.Microsoft\u2019s stock has gone up more than 200 percent since Microsoft agreed in 2013 to pay $7.2 billion in cash for Nokia\u2019s handset and services operations. That price tag amounted to 2.6 percent of Microsoft\u2019s total market value back then. The $7.5 billion Microsoft is paying for GitHub is just under 1 percent of Microsoft\u2019s current market capitalization. This lessens the financial hit if the acquisition falls short of expectations, but increases the upside if it outperforms.In recent years, Microsoft\u2019s valuation has also increased, making its stock even more potent as an acquisition currency. Microsoft\u2019s shares currently trade at around 24 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to data from CapitalIQ. That\u2019s far higher than the 15 times it traded at in mid-2013.But it would be a mistake to conclude that Microsoft has not advanced in the market for acquisitions. Its soaring stock has made sure the company has remained a player in the deals game. The jump in its price-to-earnings ratio makes it more likely that a large deal would bolster earnings per share (after factoring in the extra shares issued to do the deal.) With its operations notching up strong organic growth, Microsoft probably does not need to do a big deal anytime soon. But if one were to crop up, shareholders may not balk.- Peter Eavis Satya Nadella happened, for one. (He succeeded Steve Ballmer as C.E.O. of Microsoft in 2014.) And the cloud, for another.Mr. Ballmer tried to target the flashier end of the consumer hardware market, with things like Windows Phone and the Zune music player. It didn\u2019t work. In contrast, Mr. Nadella has focused on enterprise applications \u2014 and in particular, found huge success in cloud computing.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.The company lags only Amazon Web Services as a cloud provider.Preparing for the futureMr. Nadella is also gearing up for the next big thing to be put into the cloud: artificial intelligence.Because such software is computationally demanding, it makes sense to pay for someone else to run programs on huge servers rather than buying one\u2019s own hardware. But it\u2019s also complex, which means that there is going to be a huge market for user-friendly software that can be taken up by regular developers and not just people with A.I. Ph.D.s.That\u2019s why there\u2019s a big race right now \u2014 between the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others \u2014 to offer up tools in the cloud that can process huge data sets and provide useful insights about them.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWhat Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., said of the transaction:\u201cMicrosoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, a senior Microsoft executive, Nat Friedman, will become GitHub\u2019s C.E.O., while the coding hub\u2019s current chief, Chris Wanstrath, will become a Microsoft technical fellow. The acquisition is expected to close by year end.\u2022 GitHub: $7.5 billion\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Gabriel J.X. Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia:Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing.Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, has been adamant that his company stringently protects its customers\u2019 data privacy. Two news stories raise some questions about that categorical claim.The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Not too incriminating. But it\u2019s a reminder that Apple has made use of the data that passes across Facebook\u2019s platform.Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest\u2019s app for \u201cdrapes\u201d might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for \u201cNFL\u201d might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said.None of this is to say that Apple doesn\u2019t act by its word. But it is an important reminder to continue asking whether it really does.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe latest installment in the movie franchise, \u201cSolo,\u201d had its second disappointing weekend, pulling in just $29.3 million in the U.S. (We use \u201cjust\u201d advisedly.) But perhaps more important, it raises questions about the future of what is supposed to be one of Walt Disney\u2019s biggest moneymakers.The trend hasn\u2019t been reassuring, though. Disney likely took about $1 billion from \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d after accounting for production and marketing costs. But \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d the next movie in the main series, showed a marked drop. (To be fair, \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was the first new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie in more than a decade.)But \u201cSolo\u201d may highlight the pitfalls. Disney has said that it plans to release a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie every year, raising the real risk that moviegoers could end up suffering from Force fatigue. Just five months separated \u201cSolo\u201d from \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d Forcing through more movies \u2014 and video content for Disney\u2019s forthcoming streaming service \u2014 could erode the uniqueness that once defined the franchise\u2019s installments.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe automaker will face tough questions and tricky votes Tuesday at its annual shareholder meeting tomorrow.The company doesn\u2019t publish a sustainability report, which investors say makes it hard to keep tabs on workforce issues such as safety. And they are concerned that Tesla can\u2019t manage infrastructure changes ahead involving electric-vehicles and autonomous-driving cars.G.E. could sell assets to raise the cash, but that will be no easy feat. The conglomerate could sell Baker Hughes, but such a deal may only raise $20 billion, Mr. Tusa writes.\u201cThe bottom line is that we see the need to de-risk substantially, which includes the need for cash and a cut to the dividend to help with operational de-levering.\u201dWhile at Kirkland, Mr. Fraidin worked on transactions like 3G Capital\u2019s takeover of H.J. Heinz and Pershing Square and Valeant Pharmaceuticals\u2019 bid for the drug maker Allergan.From a statement by Pat Quinn, Cadwalader\u2019s managing partner:\u201cSteve brings great energy to our team and we look forward to rolling up our sleeves together in the service of our clients. He will significantly enhance our ability to provide market-leading experience and tailored solutions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedOver the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.If that\u2019s accurate, Apple must tread carefully to avoid comparisons to Facebook.One advantage to being retained by lawyers for a client rather than by the client himself is that Mr. Sitrick is technically a member of the legal team, and therefore protected by attorney-client privilege. And though he is not a lawyer, Mr. Sitrick views himself as a litigator in the court of public opinion. He also charges lawyerly rates \u2014 as much as $1,100 an hour.Most of the time, the winner gets to ask Mr. Buffett for investing advice. But lunch has led to a job offer: Mr. Buffett ultimately hired Ted Weschler, who won the auctions in 2010 and 2011, as one of his two investing lieutenants.Advertisement"}

He Does Want to Discuss It.", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe can handle the ball, but can he act? Mr. Irving is about to have a very different skill tested for a mass audience: He is the star of the coming feature film and branding vehicle, \u201cUncle Drew,\u201d based on a series of viral commercials that Pepsi developed in 2012 and that Mr. Irving wrote and directed. He plays a virtually unrecognizable senior citizen who used to be a street basketball legend. Tiffany Haddish, Nick Kroll and Lil Rel Howery also star, along with other basketball luminaries like Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Reggie Miller and Chris Webber. The film is due June 29.\u201cCan you openly admit that you know the Earth is constitutionally round?\u201d he said to me. \u201cLike, you know that for sure? Like, I don\u2019t know.\u201dSpeaking by phone from New Jersey, Mr. Irving, 26, also discussed his interest in acting, his desire to start a television network and the knee injury that kept him sidelined for the N.B.A. playoffs. These are edited excerpts from our conversation.It must have been very difficult watching from the sidelines as the Celtics advanced in the playoffs. How is your knee rehab going? I\u2019m taking it one day at a time. You know it\u2019s just a process, getting back into the swing of things. It\u2019s a different off-season for me. It\u2019s a lot more time focusing on my body and getting mentally prepared for next season. I\u2019m just super proud of the guys and what they accomplished. They really stuck together throughout everything. Obviously Game 7 didn\u2019t necessarily go the way we all planned, but I mean those guys, they gave it all throughout the whole playoff run. You were in a production of \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d at St. Patrick High School. Did you have a solo? I was the basketball player who wanted to become a chef, and I did have a solo, about cooking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and breaking out of my shell. For me, it was just an opportunity to get rid of my public speaking nerves. I knew that if I could sing and act onstage, then I should be able to publicly convey what I was thinking and what was on my mind. You\u2019re very close with your father, Drederick Irving. Did he encourage you to scratch your acting itch when you were young? He\u2019s just proud. He\u2019s known for awhile that I have eclectic tastes in different things. I am more than willing to go into different areas and try it out. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean success or failure \u2014 if it works or not, or if the perception is great or not. It\u2019s just the fact that I\u2019m throwing myself out there and giving myself a chance. That\u2019s how he raised me.It\u2019s one thing to shoot a commercial. It\u2019s another to make a feature film. How did you prepare? Did you take any acting lessons?I just had an acting coach. I [met] with him about being in front of a camera. Just a lot of redundant actions over and over again trying to get one particular shot. How do you convey that in front of a camera? And your voice and playing a character, playing a role.Was that frustrating? No, it wasn\u2019t. There were definitely times on the set where it kind of got maniacal for the amount of hours we worked. I wasn\u2019t used to that, 16-hour shoot days. That was a lot. So it was an adjustment from that aspect. But I enjoyed the acting.You had to train for the season as you were shooting. How did you juggle both?I was also dealing with an in-between stage of getting traded as well. So it was really figuring how best to divide up that time. I think I did a pretty good job of it. Balancing being a professional athlete and your side interests is definitely difficult, but it\u2019s an opportunity that was afforded to me.A lot of N.B.A. players are getting into the film business. Is this something you\u2019re interested in on a long-term basis?I would say so. I think more in a creative aspect, behind the scenes [in] production, ownership, and really just building something that I can be proud of or collaborating with other great people. I\u2019m really a big fan of creative expression, whether it\u2019s acting, music or seeing art.Do you feel you have to find ways to challenge yourself? Do you get bored easily?No, I wouldn\u2019t say that. I just have interests outside the game of basketball and I try to further those by becoming more knowledgeable and turning it into something I can be proud of or be a part of with other great people. I think that being in the N.B.A., it definitely has a tremendous amount of commitment, as well as accessibility to a lot of different avenues.[Laughter] I think trends, they\u2019re great. Sometimes they\u2019re culturally progressive and can breed originality. [But] how I think in terms of who I am as a person \u2014 it\u2019s taking great things that I\u2019ve learned and making them my own and moving on in life. It\u2019s evolution, man.What do you think drives you to be a little bit of a contrarian?I\u2019ve definitely wanted \u2014 well I know I am \u2014 a generational leader. To do that, it takes a long, long time of learning about other human beings, history and incorporating all that into things that I love.Do you have a project that you are interested in trying out?I am more or less trying to start my own production company, trying to collaborate with great influencers, people that inspire me. It\u2019s just the ground level now but that\u2019s the focus, becoming a content creator. That\u2019s the hope of owning my own television network one day. You want to own your own television network?Oh, absolutely.What would be on it?See, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m trying to figure out. I just know that television, where it is now, there\u2019s a certain sense of authenticity that I want to bring to audiences that are representative [of] what is going on in the world and in our culture. I don\u2019t necessarily know how to capture that content as of right now, but I will figure it out.You talked about wanting to be different. I\u2019ve got to ask \u2014 and I know you get asked about this quite often \u2014 is that why you made suggestions about the Earth being flat? Is it a part of you wanting to be different?No, I would say at the time when I was talking about it, I had literally been just given so much flak about what I felt, the way the shape of the Earth is. And it garnered so many different opinions; well, of course, the perception was going to be like, \u201cHey man, you\u2019re just crazy, man, for thinking that.\u201d What I would say is that just exemplified exactly what I meant on the intent of wanting to be different.Because when you think something completely different, science has proven it, everyone has thought and believed this to be true, and then you say something on the opposing side, and it gets a reaction that\u2019s not necessarily authentic at all. There\u2019s just a \u201cHey, let\u2019s get this preconceived notion about who he is as a person,\u201d you have no idea. I really wanted to put that on the biggest stage of \u201cnow it becomes your side vs. my side.\u201d At the end of the day, does it really matter?[Laughter]Are you aware of that? If so, that would be, in theory, a concrete example of where those words might matter, right?Oh yeah, no, and I absolutely agree, which is why research and why history has shown that even having opposing sides \u2014 I mean, history has shown even back then, our biggest scholars did think the Earth was flat. It didn\u2019t just spark out of anywhere and then everyone just goes into their own groups. Definitely different scientists have come along and proved the law of gravity. Everything that science breeds, and you have specific scientists that are giving all this information. I wanted to open up the conversation, like, \u201cHey man, do your own research for what you want to believe in.\u201d Our educational system is flawed. History has been changed throughout so much time. I literally got that from what they did to Nikola Tesla of what he was trying to do for just an incredible world. I could just go on and on about this stuff, man.You\u2019ve been coy about what you really believe so I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll clarify here. Do you or do you not believe the Earth is flat? Or do you not know?That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you. No, no, no. Can you openly admit that you know the Earth is constitutionally round? Like, you know that for sure? Like, I don\u2019t know. I was never trying to convince anyone that the world is flat. I\u2019m not being an advocate for the world being completely flat. No, I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t. It\u2019s fun to think about though. It\u2019s fun to have that conversation. It is absolutely fun because people get so agitated and mad. They\u2019re like, \u201cHey man, you can\u2019t believe that, man. It\u2019s religious, man. It\u2019s just science. You can\u2019t believe anything else. O.K.?\u201d Cool, well, explain to me. Give me what you\u2019ve known about the Earth and your research, and I love it. I love talking about it.Well, I would push back and say that there\u2019s a real picture of the Earth taken by astronauts. Do you not believe that picture is real? No, I\u2019m actually \u2014 yeah. Like I said, I do research on both sides. I\u2019m not against anyone that thinks the Earth is round. I\u2019m not against anyone that thinks it\u2019s flat. I just love hearing the debate. It\u2019s fun to talk about.No, but I\u2019m asking you. Do you believe the pictures that exist, taken by the astronauts? Do you not believe those pictures are real?I feel like now you\u2019re asking me if I am now grouping myself with conspiracy theorists that believe that everything that has come out about the Earth being round is completely fake.No, I don\u2019t know.I don\u2019t limit that to not being real. You know what I\u2019m saying? I haven\u2019t convinced myself all the way like everything that has been given to us is fake. No. But you also know that a lot of history has been distorted over time. That\u2019s something that I\u2019m always aware of. I\u2019m not against it all.I don\u2019t want to misrepresent what you\u2019re saying here. So just to clarify. You don\u2019t know whether the Earth is round. You don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s flat. You\u2019re just open to having the discussion about it.Absolutely. It\u2019s fun for me, man. It\u2019s mentally stimulating to hear because there absolutely are scientists or engineers that have said, \u201cHey man, I believe the Earth is flat.\u201d But then of course, utilizing an exploitation tactic of utilizing my name and who I am, and all of a sudden it turns into a bigger thing. Which is fine. That\u2019s the way our society works. It is what it is. I don\u2019t mind it.Totally. But I guess there are people like me on the outside here, who will say that you are one of the most popular N.B.A. players right now. You\u2019re a star in a feature film. You might very well launch your own television network. So my point is there are concrete examples of kids that believe, because of what you\u2019re saying, the Earth might be flat. Do you not see any downside? Or do you feel by perpetrating the discussion, that you are doing a favor in a sense?Doing a favor?Maybe not doing a favor. Contributing to the public discussion by introducing it as a \u201cdebate\u201d rather than it being science. Does that make sense, what I\u2019m saying?Oh no, for sure. Even when the debate is happening within science, it\u2019s just concrete facts vs. popular opinion or theories. And I\u2019m up for that, man. I\u2019m aware of the responsibility of what my biases and judgments are and of kids being able to connect with that. But I\u2019m also not trying to go against complete science and factual information to the point where it becomes an inner belief. I think that the discussion can happen. Not just over whether the Earth is round or flat. That doesn\u2019t really bring importance, in my book, in terms of doing your own research.I think kids should have the freedom to do that regardless [of] a particular authoritative figure telling you, \u201cDon\u2019t believe anything else.\u201d That\u2019s what our society has come to and then of course, you get separated based upon your other beliefs, which is what you\u2019re aware of or not.Not everyone thinks the same. Not everyone feels the same. Some people openly come out and say things. Other people are afraid because of the common misconception of who you are and who you represent as a person. Your intellectual ability, based upon something you said or did. That holds true in our society, man. I\u2019m just aware of that. Does it really bother you that much that I think something different than you or that I actually want to have that conversation?I could see it bothering \u2014 if there are people genuinely believing this stuff as a result of what you\u2019re saying. Does that make sense?Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I understand that responsibility. I also see it from a different perspective, from a humanity side, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to cap who I am as a person, who I know I am, who I present myself as, based on a belief or something I said or did.Were you frustrated by the reaction after you initially started talking about it? You don\u2019t strike me as someone who cares that much if other people criticize you. Do you care that people think you\u2019re a conspiracy theorist?No. Why would it ever matter? No man, I\u2019m not afraid of that. I used to be afraid of not being able to convey what I feel or what I think and bringing more questions from everyone, and literally, everyone becomes intrigued. People want to know more. People are going to say what they\u2019re going to say. It\u2019s not my job to be in a convincing stance every single day on something that I feel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: 2 Views of the Judge Persky Recall", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Voters in Santa Clara County last week voted to recall Judge Aaron Persky, who sparked national outrage in 2016 while presiding over a high-profile sexual assault case involving a Stanford swimmer. He was the first judge recalled in the state since 1932.We asked two of the main players working for and against the recall their thoughts about what it means: Stanford professor Michele Dauber, who led the recall effort; and Judge LaDoris Cordell, a vocal critic of the campaign to remove Mr. Persky. Their responses have been condensed and lightly edited.The recall effort began years before #MeToo became a national conversation. But do you see this recall as part of that movement? What do you think this recall represents?One of the most unfortunate results of that victim blaming is that women saw virtually the entire legal profession linking arms with a campaign that engaged in this conduct. To women, this reinforced the view that the legal profession itself \u2014 judges, lawyers, and court personnel \u2014 blame victims, excuse perpetrators, and do not take sexual assault seriously.The word \u201clenient\u201d gets used. For me, that means tempering judgment with compassion, with mercy, when it\u2019s appropriate. I\u2019ve sent people to 25 to life, people who did not deserve mercy, but there are some who do. And we now have minimum sentencing requirements and no judge can show mercy.There was a backlash to your efforts, even from within liberal circles. At times they were extremely personal. What do you make of those critiques?This campaign was very tightly messaged and focused on ending impunity for high status offenders like Brock Turner. I think judges are smart enough to be able to distinguish Mr. Turner from poor and black and brown drug and nonviolent offenders.And it\u2019s so reflective of what\u2019s happening right now in our country.

{"Headline": "We Have Reached Peak Screen. Now Revolution Is in the Air.", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut now that smartphones have achieved dominance, revolution is again in the air.There\u2019s a reason tech companies are feeling this tension between making phones better and worrying they are already too addictive. We\u2019ve hit what I call Peak Screen.For much of the last decade, a technology industry ruled by smartphones has pursued a singular goal of completely conquering our eyes. It has given us phones with ever-bigger screens and phones with unbelievable cameras, not to mention virtual reality goggles and several attempts at camera-glasses.So tech giants are building the beginning of something new: a less insistently visual tech world, a digital landscape that relies on voice assistants, headphones, watches and other wearables to take some pressure off our eyes.This could be a nightmare; we may simply add these new devices to our screen-addled lives. But depending on how these technologies develop, a digital ecosystem that demands less of our eyes could be better for everyone \u2014 less immersive, less addictive, more conducive to multitasking, less socially awkward, and perhaps even a salve for our politics and social relations.Who will bring us this future? Amazon and Google are clearly big players, but don\u2019t discount the company that got us to Peak Screen in the first place. With advances to the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, Apple is slowly and almost quietly creating an alternative to its phones.If it works, it could change everything again. As I argue below, there are many ways that screens have become too dominant in our lives. The sooner we find something else, the better.When you do give in, you lose your mind.\u201cWhat you get sucked into is not the one thing that caught your attention \u2014 your text message or tweet or whatever,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at the technology research firm Creative Strategies. Instead, you unlock your phone and instantly, almost unconsciously, descend into the irresistible splendors of the digital world \u2014 emerging 30 minutes later, stupefied and dazed.\u201cYou open this irresistible box, and you can\u2019t fight it,\u201d she said.Tech companies understand this power, of course; our inability to resist screens explains why phone screens keep getting bigger.He was wrong. Rivals, led by Samsung, found that big-screen phones sold very well. The eyes won out over the hands. Eventually Apple joined the party, making iPhones with bigger and then still bigger displays. The largest-screen iPhones now account for half of Apple\u2019s sales and the majority of its profits.But screens have now become a crutch for technologists, a lazy, catchall way to add digital experiences to every product.Or look at augmented reality, the technology that allows you to see digital imagery superimposed on the real world. In a few specific uses \u2014 turning your face into a dog\u2019s on Snapchat \u2014 this can be fun. But too often, A.R. feels gimmicky. Rather than commingling the digital and the real, it simply uses a screen to usurp the world around you.At Apple\u2019s developer conference this month, Martin Sanders, a Lego executive, showed off a new A.R. Lego set. When he pointed his iPad at a Lego structure, his screen filled with digital fireworks, superheros, sports cars \u2014 a whole bustling Lego town that he didn\u2019t have to build with his hands or imagine with his head.\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do here!\u201d Mr. Sanders exclaimed as he and an assistant stood completely still, staring at animated Legos through a piece of digital glass. It was bizarre. The whole point of Lego is physical interaction, but thanks to A.R., he had turned Lego into just another video game.There are two ways we may break our fevered addiction to screens.First, we will need to try to use our phones more mindfully, which requires a combination of willpower and technology.Help is on the way. For the last week, I\u2019ve been using Screen Time, one of the new features in Apple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system. The software gives you valuable information about how much you are using your phone, and it can even block you from using apps that you deem unhealthy. I found Screen Time very well designed, and I suspect it will profoundly change how we use our phones.But in addition to helping us resist phones, the tech industry will need to come up with other, less immersive ways to interact with digital world. Three technologies may help with this: voice assistants, of which Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Assistant are the best, and Apple\u2019s two innovations, AirPods and the Apple Watch.All of these technologies share a common idea. Without big screens, they are far less immersive than a phone, allowing for quick digital hits: You can buy a movie ticket, add a task to a to-do list, glance at a text message or ask about the weather without going anywhere near your Irresistible Screen of Splendors.These are all works in progress. Voice assistants still cannot do everything for you, though Google and Amazon have thousands of engineers working to improve them. AirPods are fantastic \u2014 they have fewer connection issues than any other wireless headphones \u2014 and after years of refinement, the Apple Watch shows you just enough stuff from your phone to make it useful without becoming overbearing.If Apple could only improve Siri, its own voice assistant, the Watch and AirPods could combine to make something new: a mobile computer that is not tied to a huge screen, that lets you get stuff done on the go without the danger of being sucked in. Imagine if, instead of tapping endlessly on apps, you could just tell your AirPods, \u201cMake me dinner reservations at 7\u201d or \u201cCheck with my wife\u2019s calendar to see when we can have a date night this week.\u201dApple has never been scared of disrupting its own best inventions. By rethinking screens, it may have a chance to do that once more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Tesla\u2019s Audacious Push to Reinvent the Way Cars Are Made", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "Scrambling to turn out its first mass-market electric car, the automaker set up multiple assembly lines and is changing production processes on the fly.Supported byFREMONT, Calif. \u2014 Just outside the north wing of Tesla\u2019s sprawling electric-car plant here, an unusual structure has taken shape in the last few weeks: a tent, about 50 feet high and several hundred feet long, its taut gray canvas membrane supported by aluminum columns.Its purpose is as notable as its hasty construction. The semi-permanent structure houses a third assembly line \u2014 part of a desperate effort to speed up production of the Model 3, the car that Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, has said is critical to the company\u2019s financial health and immediate future.Just two years ago, Mr. Musk envisioned 2018 as a breakthrough moment. Having established the brand\u2019s cachet with high-end offerings \u2014 the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X sport-utility vehicle \u2014 Tesla would begin churning out more affordable Model 3 sedans. With a high-speed, high-tech assembly process, the company\u2019s sales would soar more than fivefold, to half a million vehicles.It hasn\u2019t turned out that way. Tesla had trouble mass-producing both battery packs and cars. By the end of nearly three months of production after Tesla started assembling the Model 3 last summer, just 260 had rolled off the line, and Mr. Musk said the company faced a prolonged period of \u201cmanufacturing hell.\u201d He had hoped to produce 20,000 Model 3s a month by December, but a mere 2,425 were completed in the final three months of 2017.Since then, Tesla has raced to iron out kinks in the assembly process, mainly by scrapping some complicated robotic machines that proved ill suited to certain tasks, and hiring hundreds of workers to replace them. On the factory floor, it\u2019s a frantic race to reach Mr. Musk\u2019s goals, one that has taken a toll on some employees. But if the gamble pays off, it will be a big step toward Tesla\u2019s audacious ambitions: not just to be a mass-market automaker, but also to reinvent the way autos are made.\u201cWe believe in rapid evolution,\u201d Mr. Musk said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like, find a way or make a way. If conventional thinking makes your mission impossible, then unconventional thinking is necessary.\u201dAnd indeed, Mr. Musk is trying to do things that have never been done. General Motors, Nissan, BMW, Ford and others have produced electric cars, but have been unable to shrink costs enough to make them both affordable and profitable. Mr. Musk, in contrast, has promised investors and customers that Tesla will be able to produce the Model 3 in high volumes, sell versions for as little as $35,000 and ring up hefty profits.Once the Model 3 is rolling, Mr. Musk sees Tesla moving on to produce electric vehicles of all shapes and sizes \u2014 pickups, semitrailer trucks, and a fast and roomy car for families called the Model Y. The company\u2019s mission, Mr. Musk has said on numerous occasions, is to lead the transition to emissions-free transportation and to change the world.A recent daylong tour of the Fremont plant revealed how Tesla is trying to break with standard auto-industry practices all along the Model 3 assembly lines. It is searching for ways to shorten the time that robots take to weld parts. It is even making seats, a component most car companies leave to specialized suppliers. And it is doing this while trying to root out bottlenecks and glitches in the manufacturing process.In the final assembly area, for example, Tesla originally used robotic arms to install the Model 3 seats. But the machinery was slow and inconsistent in tightening the bolts that secure the seats and connecting the wiring that supplies power to them. About a month ago, company officials said, that work station was modified so that robots move the seats into place and workers handle bolts and the fitting of delicate electronic connectors.Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t have an office at the plant, but Tesla says he has been sleeping there \u2014 on the floor in someone else\u2019s office, or on a couch \u2014 while working to streamline Model 3 production. At 3 a.m. on Thursday, the time Tesla made him available for a telephone interview, he said he was trying to fix a glitch in the part of the plant where the Model 3 is painted. \u201cThe carrier that the car is on is coming out of the paint booth slightly too fast for the sensor to recognize it, and it\u2019s tripping the sensor even though everything is fine,\u201d he explained.Tesla engineers are trying to reprogram the sensor so it can operate at the accelerated pace. For now, he said, \u201cwe have somebody standing there just pressing the \u2018O.K.\u2019 button to restart it.\u201dThe scramble to ramp up quickly has put a strain on the company. Several senior executives, some involved in manufacturing, have left. While investor optimism has remained high \u2014 Tesla\u2019s market capitalization puts it neck and neck with General Motors as the most valuable American car company \u2014 its bonds are rated in junk territory, and the delay in bringing in revenue from Model 3 sales has analysts worried Tesla will continue to use up cash and face the prospect of having to raise additional capital later this year.\u201cAt some point, investors are going to say, \u2018If you don\u2019t have a viable economic model, we\u2019re not going to continue to give you cash,\u2019\u201d Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said in a recent conference call with clients.Having made his fortune as a Silicon Valley entrepreneur \u2014 including a nine-figure sum from his early involvement in the online-payment service PayPal \u2014 Mr. Musk was convinced that technology and vision could together conquer new frontiers, whether in space exploration (with his SpaceX venture) or everyday transportation. Replacing gasoline tanks with batteries was just a start. He was determined to reconceive their production as well, based on 21st-century advances in automation.Established car companies master the process with assembly-line workers, and then find ways for machines to take over some of the work. Tesla did the opposite. It designed a highly automated production line populated by more than a thousand robots and other assembly machines.Ron Harbour, a partner at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, noted that in his annual survey rating auto plants worldwide, the most efficient ones use a lot of manual labor. \u201cThe most automated ones are at the bottom of the list,\u201d he said.In some instances, Tesla\u2019s gamble on automation has paid off. A separate production line that makes the Model S and the Model X has a series of 14 stations, with 17 workers, in the area where battery packs and electric motors are married to the vehicles\u2019 underbodies. For the Model 3, that function involves just five work stations and no workers at all, said Lars Moravy, the company\u2019s director of chassis engineering.For other tasks, the reliance on robots has proved a headache. For months, Tesla engineers struggled to get a robot to guide a bolt through a hole accurately to secure part of the rear brake. They found a maddeningly simple solution: Instead of using a bolt with a flat tip on its threaded end, engineers switched to a bolt with a tapered point, known as a \u201clead-in,\u201d that can be guided through the hole even if the robot is a millimeter off dead center, Mr. Moravy said.In a very tangible sense, Tesla views its production line as a laboratory for untested techniques. In recent weeks, company executives concluded they could produce Model 3 underbodies with fewer spot welds than they had been using. The car is still held together by about 5,000 welds, but engineers concluded that some 300 were unnecessary and reprogrammed robots to assemble the steel underbody without them.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to be doing that at this point in time when the car is already launched,\u201d said Mr. Harbour, a veteran manufacturing expert who has visited most of the world\u2019s major auto plants. \u201cNormally you\u2019d make changes like that in the prototype stage.\u201dIn another bid to push the limits of technology, Tesla at times pulls robots off the line and tests them operating at speeds greater than specified by the supplier, said Charles Mwangi, Tesla\u2019s director of body engineering.\u201cWe are actually breaking them to see what the maximum limit is,\u201d Mr. Mwangi said. The idea is to find ways of accelerating production without spending capital on new machinery. In the future, rather than adding more machines to increase output, \u201cwe can just dial up our equipment,\u201d he said.The willingness to experiment with the production process even as cars are rolling off the line is perhaps the most significant way Tesla is defying the industry\u2019s conventional wisdom. Automakers like Toyota, Honda and G.M. engineer manufacturing lines that can churn out cars or trucks at a rate of about one a minute, and essentially lock in the basic assembly process once they start production. While they make tweaks to improve quality or worker safety, they generally make major changes or introduce new techniques only every few years, when an old model is phased out and before production of a new one begins.\u201cThe first step in auto quality is stability,\u201d Mr. Harbour said. \u201cOnce you get a stable process that works, you can go back and make improvements.\u201dTesla, by contrast, is tinkering with its production lines on the fly, and the tent is a stark illustration of that approach.Beneath the peaked canvas, Tesla has hastily set up a third Model 3 production line. Like the other two, it handles final assembly, when trim and other finishing touches are put on the car. (Tesla did not include the tent on the tour of the plant.)Adding a new assembly line, even temporarily, is a rare and risky move in the auto industry. A line set up hastily, in an untested environment, might not achieve the quality Tesla promises.Two assembly lines inside the plant already exist to handle at least some of those tasks but they have proved troublesome and perform the work more slowly than Mr. Musk had hoped, in part because Tesla used robots for tasks that are better left to human workers.Tesla engineering executives acknowledge that the company overestimated the rate at which it could produce cars, and designed a production system that proved to be too complicated \u2014 a problem that Mr. Musk lamented at the company\u2019s June shareholder meeting.\u201cOne of the biggest mistakes we made was trying to automate things that are super easy for a person to do, but super hard for a robot to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you see it, it looks super dumb. And you are like, wow! Why did we do that?\u201dMost automakers operate a single line to make two, three or sometimes four different vehicles, because using a second line would force them to invest in duplicate tooling and cut into profit margins.And a third assembly line, outside the walls of a plant? \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything like this, ever,\u201d Mr. Harbour said.Mr. Musk said the capital costs of the line in the tent were minimal because the company used equipment it already owned. (On Twitter he had called it \u201cscrap we had in warehouses.\u201d)\u201cIt does everything that the other assembly lines do but with fewer people, lower labor costs and much higher uptime,\u201d he said. \u201cOur unit cost for vehicles is lower on that line than on the other lines, and we\u2019re seeing higher initial quality.\u201dWhether that remains the case as Tesla speeds up production will be revealed in a few months if the company reports a profit, as Mr. Musk has promised.For many years the Fremont plant was a joint venture of Toyota and General Motors known as New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., or Nummi. After G.M.\u2019s bankruptcy, the factory closed in 2010 and the site was acquired by Tesla.Today, the four-million-square-foot plant alongside a busy freeway sees a steady stream of deliveries and tractor-trailers departing with new vehicles. Each afternoon, line workers in matching black pants with a white Tesla logo on one leg stream out of the plant and descend upon packed parking lots in the sprawling, bayside suburb.Workers feel the pressure to speed output. In interviews away from the plant, several said they had been putting in 10- and 12-hour days, sometimes six days a week. They report that turnover among line workers is high, and that sometimes supervisors join the line during extended shifts.Jose Moran, a five-year Tesla veteran who for the last 10 months has worked as a Model 3 quality-team lead, said the already taxing production demands of previous models had intensified. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant \u2018How many cars have we built so far?\u2019 \u2014 a constant pressure to build, especially with the Model 3,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets desperate sometimes, especially right now.\u201dOne challenge that workers see is the rapid influx of new workers. The company aims to hire about 400 employees a week to help accelerate Model 3 production. After Tesla\u2019s most recent earnings announcement in early May, Mr. Musk said he hoped eventually to have three shifts a day, essentially running the assembly line around the clock.\u201cEveryone I talk to has only been here for two weeks, a month, and those people don\u2019t last long,\u201d said Jonathan Galescu, a Model X body repair technician who has worked at the plant for four years.Mr. Harbour, the manufacturing expert, says automakers typically give new workers several weeks of training before putting them into production work. Bringing in large numbers of new workers can hurt quality because they may not perform their work properly or fail to notice when problems crop up.New workers at the Fremont plant get three days of training before going to work on a production line. This includes a day of computerized virtual training on doing their jobs safely, and a day of instruction on the area to which they will be assigned.Michael Catura, a 33-year-old battery-pack line worker who has been with Tesla for four years, said he had suffered hand, shoulder and elbow injuries because the company had sometimes dispensed with rotating workers to different jobs around the factory floor.\u201cWe need to make sure people are thoroughly trained,\u201d he said, and not just getting \u201ccookie-cutter training.\u201dMr. Moran, Mr. Galescu and Mr. Catura are involved in efforts by the United Automobile Workers \u2014 a group reviled by Mr. Musk \u2014 to organize the plant.Asked to comment on the intensity and the safety of Tesla\u2019s workplace, a company spokeswoman said, \u201cWe care deeply about the well-being of our employees.\u201d Tesla\u2019s efforts reduced the injury rate by 25 percent last year, she said, and \u201cwith each passing month, we improve it further.\u201dIn early June, Mr. Musk said Tesla was making 3,500 Model 3 sedans a week, and vowed to reach 5,000 a week by the end of June. In the interview on Thursday, he voiced confidence that it was nearing that elusive goal, the pace he has said is needed for the company to turn a profit.Tesla has already spent heavily on the Model 3 assembly process, and modifications mean machinery purchased for hundreds of millions of dollars is likely to be discarded. Mr. Musk essentially acknowledged this point after the earnings announcement when he said he did not expect the gross margin on the Model 3 \u2014 the share of revenue retained after the cost of goods sold \u2014 to reach the 25 percent target until early next year, six to nine months later than previously forecast.Max Warburton, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, estimates that Tesla spent about $2 billion to set up the Model 3 production line. \u201cThis is vastly more than we\u2019ve seen any other car company spend on new capacity,\u201d he said, adding, \u201c$2 billion is a mind-blowing amount to spend on a second assembly line at an existing plant.\u201dFor now, Tesla generates most of its revenue from the Model S and the Model X, which are priced at about $70,000 and up. Combined, their global sales add up to about 100,000 vehicles a year \u2014 too few to offset the billions Tesla has been spending to build its gigantic battery factory in Nevada, develop new cars and a semi truck, and equip its car plant.That means the company\u2019s future hinges on the assembly lines Tesla has set up to produce the Model 3 \u2014 and whether the company can make them hum.Lauren Hepler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk, in Search of Profit, Cuts Tesla\u2019s Work Force", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla has lost money every year since its founding in 2003. But the automaker\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, is pulling out all the stops to end that streak.In the latest sign, Mr. Musk said Tuesday that Tesla would reduce its work force by about 9 percent, or roughly 3,500 of its 37,500 employees, as part of a companywide restructuring.The cutbacks come in the midst of a challenging and expensive effort to transform Tesla from a niche producer of electric vehicles to a mainstream automaker, an ambition hinging on its first mass-market offering, the Model 3.\u201cWhat drives us is our mission to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable, clean energy,\u201d Mr. Musk said, \u201cbut we will never achieve that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable. That is a valid and fair criticism of Tesla\u2019s history to date.\u201dTesla\u2019s stock ended the day with a gain of more than 3 percent, closing at $342.77, though it had been trading even higher before the announcement.Mr. Musk has attributed the production troubles to excessive use of robots and automated machinery, especially in assembly jobs more easily done by workers. Tesla has been modifying the Model 3 production line to remove robots and has been adding dozens of workers each week to increase output.The job cuts announced on Tuesday \u201cwill not affect our ability to reach Model 3 production targets in the coming month,\u201d he said.Mr. Musk has forecast that Tesla will generate profits in the third and fourth quarters of this year. But if it fails to achieve a breakthrough in Model 3 production and remains unprofitable, it will probably need to turn to investors for more capital.Last week, at Tesla\u2019s annual meeting, Mr. Musk said the company would not need to raise more money.The job cuts indicate that he isn\u2019t willing to rely on rising Model 3 production alone to move Tesla into the black.\u201cNine percent of the work force is a pretty good-sized number,\u201d said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research firm. \u201cAs they\u2019ve been ramping up for the Model 3, as well as maintaining sales of the Model S and Model X, it is expected that payroll may be bloated. This is an attempt to cut costs and contain expenses.\u201dMr. Musk had hinted recently that a thinning of Tesla\u2019s executive ranks was in the works, and in his email he said Tesla had grown rapidly in the last several years, resulting in duplication in some jobs.He also said Tesla was ending an agreement to sell its solar panels in Home Depot stores.Advertisement"}

But the Ad Business Is Still High Stakes.", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Once upon a time, everyday America was fascinated by the advertising business, in somewhat the way that the turkey is fascinated by the ax. It began in the 1930s and \u201940s, when sellers of consumer products and their ad agencies controlled the contents of the radio programming to which the nation listened. Comedians turned advertisers \u2014 and the denizens of Madison Avenue who worked for those brands \u2014 into grist for their mills. In \u201cA Word From Our Sponsor: Admen, Advertising, and the Golden Age of Radio,\u201d Cynthia B. Meyers recalls a joke from a Jack Benny show in 1948, a show sponsored by Lucky Strike: When Benny told his wife, Mary Livingstone, that he was calling the cigarette\u2019s ad agency, Batten Barton Durstine & Osborn, she replied, \u201cSounds like a trunk falling down stairs.\u201dElsewhere in popular culture, there were novels and movies \u2014 and novels made into movies \u2014 about the ad game and those who played it, among them \u201cTake a Letter, Darling,\u201d \u201cLaura,\u201d \u201cThe Hucksters,\u201d \u201cMr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,\u201d \u201cWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter?,\u201d \u201cLover Come Back,\u201d \u201cThe Thrill of It All,\u201d \u201cGood Neighbor Sam\u201d and \u201cThe Arrangement.\u201d On television, there was \u201cBewitched\u201d and, whenever characters in \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d were especially anxious to flee the rat race, Rod Serling made sure, in episodes like \u201cA Stop in Willoughby\u201d and \u201cWalking Distance,\u201d that they worked in advertising.The nonfiction best-seller lists were filled with ad books, from \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders\u201d and \u201cMadison Avenue, U.S.A.\u201d to \u201cConfessions of an Advertising Man\u201d and \u201cFrom Those Wonderful Folks Who Gave You Pearl Harbor: Front Line Dispatches From the Advertising War.\u201d And versions of TV commercial jingles \u2014 for products like Alka-Seltzer, Diet Pepsi and Coca-Cola \u2014 made the pop-music hit parade. (Fun fact: The original \u201cHit Parade\u201d was created by an ad agency, Lord & Thomas, for Lucky Strike.)This widespread infatuation with advertising appears, in retrospect, to have peaked around 1971 with the spot that inspired one of those hits, the \u201cHilltop\u201d commercial for Coke, a.k.a. \u201cI\u2019d Like to Teach the World to Sing.\u201d It\u2019s been downhill from there. For one thing, the process by which the professionals sell us soft drinks, soap and soup ceased to be a novelty. And the switch in the \u201970s from the \u201cbrought to you by\u201d sponsorship model of radio to the magazine-style, multiple-ad format of TV transformed advertisers from benign patrons into interruptive annoyances. Besides, other industries became shinier objects in the public\u2019s eye, particularly Wall Street and Silicon Valley.One could make the case that technology has assumed the place in the zeitgeist that advertising once occupied \u2014 and then some. The most recent TV series set in an ad agency, \u201cThe Crazy Ones,\u201d lasted a season; \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has been renewed for a sixth season. (Yes, there was \u201cMad Men,\u201d from 2007 to 2015, but one of its main accomplishments was to remind us that Madison Avenue meant more then than now.) There have been other efforts to rekindle the American appetite for all things advertising, but none has truly broken through.Now comes another attempt, from Ken Auletta, the prolific media reporter, critic and best-selling author, with \u201cFrenemies: The Epic Disruption of the Ad Business (and Everything Else).\u201d The title comes from a word popularized by Martin Sorrell, formerly the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising and marketing holding company; he started referring to Google as a \u201cfrenemy\u201d of WPP\u2019s in that they do business together (friend) at the same time they compete against each other (enemy). For those who wince at the characterization of the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon as \u201cfrenemies\u201d of the ad industry, be thankful; according to hbr.org, Sorrell also used the word \u201cfroes\u201d to describe that love-hate relationship.Sorrell is a principal figure in \u201cFrenemies,\u201d which seeks to rebuild interest in Madison Avenue by borrowing interest from Silicon Valley. It\u2019s not unlike how advertisers themselves borrow interest, hiring celebrities to endorse products or devoting ads to buzzed-about subjects like a royal wedding. Auletta posits that few industries have been \u201cconvulsed by change\u201d as much as advertising, which, as a result, is \u201cfacing fundamental challenges to its existence.\u201dIt may be a mug\u2019s game to figure out which industry has suffered the deepest damage at the hands of Silicon Valley; if you\u2019re reading this in print, you\u2019re holding another example of a business under siege. But Auletta works hard to get us to care about the fate of ad folks, despite our diminished interest in them or our distaste for what they do, because of their essential role as suppliers of the dollars that fuel the media ecosystem. If you \u201cfollow the money,\u201d he writes, you\u2019ll understand the importance of advertising and the significance of the threats against it, and maybe value it more, or at least disdain it less.Auletta surveys the tumultuous, treacherous ad landscape through the framework of frenemies. Not only are Madison Avenue and Silicon Valley frenemies, but so, too, he declares, are ad agencies and their marketer clients; agencies and media companies; traditional and digital media companies; agencies and consultancies like Accenture and McKinsey; agencies and software firms like Adobe and Salesforce.com; and, perhaps most telling, advertising and consumers. The easier it becomes for the public to zip, zap through and avoid interruptive ads \u2014 through innovative technology like ad blockers and streaming video \u2014 the madder, and more anxious, the mad men (and women) grow.Yet as dire as their fate looks, some flowers bloom amid the gloom, taking the edge off the book\u2019s pessimism. A respected industry strategist, Rishad Tobaccowala, tells Auletta: \u201cPeople say we are dinosaurs. We are not dinosaurs. We are cockroaches. Everybody hates us. Nobody likes to see us. But cockroaches have outlived everyone. We scurry out of corners. We soldier on and hire people with different skill sets.\u201dAuletta details the adaptive behavior \u2014 new types of agencies; reviving the sponsorship model; embracing data-driven, two-way marketing based on individualized relationships \u2014 while suggesting that, at the biggest ad conglomerates like WPP, the money for such substantive changes exists thanks to still-respectable margins (\u201ca relatively robust 15 or so percent\u201d). And he weaves into his narrative evidence of the wealth the business can still produce.For instance, one conglomerate\u2019s chief executive \u201cspends much of the year at his home in Palm Beach.\u201d The leader of a large agency has a \u201cglassed weekend home perched on 200 acres overlooking the Hudson River\u201d along with an \u201c8,000-square-foot Chelsea loft.\u201d And a well-known industry consultant sells his company for potentially as much as $207 million, hosts a $400,000 dinner at Cannes, buys a Tesla, gets rock-star treatment at his favorite restaurants and arrives at a meeting \u201csporting his Christmas tan from Turks and Caicos.\u201d There are martinis aplenty scattered among the pages of \u201cFrenemies,\u201d lending a nostalgic touch to the forward-facing proceedings.Alas, \u201cFrenemies\u201d can\u2019t avoid a pitfall common to such topical books, in that some of what\u2019s chronicled has been overtaken by events between writing and publication. The most notable example: In the book, Sorrell is \u201csecure\u201d in his top role at WPP and \u201cunlikely to step down anytime soon\u201d \u2014 but he did, suddenly, in mid-April, after an internal investigation into alleged misconduct. It\u2019s disconcerting, given how much Sorrell figures in \u201cFrenemies,\u201d to read of him telling Auletta, \u201cI will stay here until they shoot me!\u201d It\u2019s ameliorated, though, by a newsy tidbit: Several years ago he negotiated \u201cto sell WPP to Warren Buffett, but they did not see eye to eye and the discussions amicably collapsed.\u201dThat\u2019s a shame, if only because it\u2019s fun to imagine how Buffett \u2014 whose holdings at Berkshire Hathaway include Geico \u2014 might have approached the ad business: \u201cMarketers, save 15 percent on your campaigns with Geico WPP.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.\u201dAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington. And some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., publicly promoted its work with ICE in January in a blog post, citing it as an example of the success of its technology.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d Mr. Nadella said at Microsoft\u2019s developer conference last month.Yet criticism of Microsoft\u2019s work with ICE began to grow. One Microsoft engineer, Larry Osterman, tweeted on Monday to ask how working with ICE matched with the company\u2019s \u201cethical stances.\u201dBut for many Microsoft employees, that was not satisfactory. A group of about a dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter, in which they said the company\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not go far enough.\u201dThe employees continued, \u201cWe are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy.\u201dThe letter added that Microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ICE but be open to a review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally, and that it should create a policy stating it would not work with those \u201cwho violate international human rights law.\u201dMicrosoft declined to comment on the employee letter, which was posted internally on Tuesday afternoon.

{"Headline": "Tesla Is Coming to Its Financial Senses. That Has Its Own Risks.", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla, the electric car company defined by the moonshot mentality of its chief executive, Elon Musk, has started to act with apparent caution.Still, sizable layoffs and moves to conserve cash typically are not the acts of growth companies that are having just a little trouble achieving their goals.And there is a danger for Tesla if it starts to behave like a normal company: Investors may start to value it as one, and its high-flying stock may tumble.For most of Tesla\u2019s history, Mr. Musk has proposed groundbreaking new products and convinced investors to finance them. The challenges of this approach became clear with the Model 3, a sedan aimed at a broader customer base than its previous cars. Its production problems have weighed on Tesla\u2019s cash flows, leading some analysts to predict that the company will have to raise more money in the markets.Mr. Musk has said that he does not plan to ask investors for more money in the coming months, and Tesla\u2019s reduced capital expenditure forecast and the new push for profitability appear to be part of his efforts to avoid that. But even if this rough patch passes, and the company makes it through it without raising significant amounts of new capital, investors may be less willing to believe in the next grand vision.That may force the company to take a more circumspect approach to growth and how it communicates its dreams.Of course, a more conservative approach would reduce the chance that Tesla will face cash shortages. And shareholders would get a more dependable grasp of Tesla\u2019s future profitability.But investors would probably then value the company much more on its core current earnings and place much less emphasis on products that are years from production. That could weigh heavily on its shares. Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Cowen, forecasts that Tesla will make $8.73 per share in 2020. If Tesla traded at 20 times those earnings \u2014 a multiple well above that of the wider stock market \u2014 the company\u2019s stock would change hands at $175, roughly half the level of where it closed on Tuesday.Becoming sensible may save Tesla. But perhaps not its stock price.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buses, Delivery Vans and Garbage Trucks Are the Electric Vehicles Next Door", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsLow-speed torque and whisper-quiet operation make electric vehicles an attractive alternative for commercial uses, and the incognito answer to Teslas and Bolts.As American car buyers cautiously dip their toes into the world of electric vehicles, pondering issues such as cost, charging times and driving range, big businesses and some government agencies are going in headfirst.The Antelope Valley Transit Authority, which serves some 450,000 residents in parts of Los Angeles County, wants to be the first transit agency with an all-electric bus fleet. It hopes to ditch all its diesel vehicles by the end of the year and replace them with 80 fully electric versions.The same factors that appeal to consumers make an electric vehicle a good fit for commercial applications. Electric motors offer the low-speed torque such vehicles need, without the roar or exhaust of their diesel counterparts. And while range anxiety could be a concern for the typical car buyer, operators of buses and similar vehicles tend to stay close to home, needing a range of 100 miles or less.Even as Tesla has promised to apply its passenger-car experience to long-haul trucking, a host of companies are already offering fully electric commercial vehicles to governments and private industries that are looking to turn mail trucks and garbage haulers into vehicles of the future.\u201cOur latest perspective is that U.S. break-even for long haul could be between 2025 and 2030,\u201d said Russell Hensley, one of the report\u2019s authors. Mr. Hensley said two factors were holding back the commercial electric market: a limited number of models and the relative infancy of fast-charging technology.The Workhorse Group, based in Cincinnati, has signed a letter of intent to sell 500 electric pickup trucks to Duke Energy, with delivery starting this summer. The $52,000 vehicles, made in the company\u2019s plant in Union City, Ind., \u201cwill do anything a conventional pickup will do, including towing and hauling,\u201d said Steve Burns, Workhorse\u2019s chief executive.Duke Energy is committed to making 5 percent of its fleet nonpolluting, said Randy Wheeless, a company spokesman. It plans to distribute its electric pickups \u2014 which will have a gasoline backup engine to charge the batteries, a similar system to the one in the Chevrolet Volt passenger car \u2014 across the six states it serves.Workhorse has just concluded a deal with UPS to sell the company 950 electric delivery vans, adding to the 50 that UPS has been testing. And a joint venture of Workhorse and the truck builder VT Hackney is one of five finalists in the United States Postal Service\u2019s bid to replace its fleet of mail delivery vehicles. The Postal Service is also evaluating gasoline and hybrid vehicles, but typical mail delivery route distances make an electric vehicle a viable proposition, Mr. Burns said.The company is building the buses in Lancaster, and has also supplied electric buses to the University of California; Eugene, Ore.; and more. Low operating costs are a main selling point.\u201cFuel and maintenance are one-third that of typical equivalent diesel vehicles,\u201d said George Miller, BYD America\u2019s senior sales manager for fleets. The company has demonstrated its electric garbage trucks to City of Los Angeles sanitation officials and has a deal to sell 20 articulated buses to the operator of Los Angeles International Airport, Mr. Miller said.While maintenance and energy costs are lower, initial purchase prices are not. BYD\u2019s garbage truck costs $300,000, while its 40-foot bus is about $150,000 more than its diesel equivalent.BYD is counting on rebates to cut those costs. In California, that could amount to a price reduction between $50,000 and $75,000, thanks to money available from the state\u2019s Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project. The Antelope Valley Transit Authority is receiving $46 million in state and federal funding to help buy its 80 electric buses. While some of its buses run consecutive multiple routes as far as 558 miles a day, they can be charged wirelessly whenever a route is finished, adding 20 miles of range every 10 minutes. Mr. Engel said he expected the authority to save $1 million per year in fuel costs alone. Other companies are running commercial electric vehicle demonstration projects and gearing up for production.Tesla says it will make its Tesla Semi electric truck next year, with prices beginning at $150,000. And Thor Trucks, based in Los Angeles, also plans to offer an electric semi truck next year. It expects to charge $150,000 for a version with a 100-mile range, and $250,000 for a 300-mile version. Thor is aiming for customers seeking short-haul heavy vehicles, such as trucks that might need to drive from a port to a warehouse. Those kinds of short-haul trips generate a great deal of air pollution when diesel trucks are used. But big batteries aren\u2019t the only solution.Siemens, the German technology company, recently conducted a one-mile eHighway demonstration at the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports using trucks that drew power from overhead wires, much the way trains and streetcars are powered.Overhead power eliminates the need for huge batteries and recharging time. When a truck must pass another vehicle, it disconnects from the wiring system, temporarily using a small battery before reconnecting to the wires.The company is proposing to bring such a system to the entire length of the 710 Freeway, a major corridor jammed with trucks between the bustling Los Angeles ports to the city\u2019s rail yards and beyond. It is a stretch of highway that has been called the \u201cdiesel death zone.\u201dMatt Miyasato, deputy executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the public agency in charge of controlling air pollution for that area, said there were \u201ctoo many variables\u201d for such an approach to be viable at the moment. But the idea is promising.\u201cIf the Siemens test could be scaled up,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019d have a zero-emissions corridor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Though that case concluded with a \u20ac2.4bn fine, it has not led to significant changes to Google\u2019s business.The issue with AndroidAs the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android.The bigger picture\u2014 Michael de la MercedAthenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday:To ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership.The context Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealth\u2019s co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home.In an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit:\u201cI believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country \u2013 these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, it\u2019s easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.\u201dWhat happens nowAthenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale.Elliott\u2019s response to the newsFrom a spokesman:\u201cElliott welcomes the Board\u2019s decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth\u2019s shareholders, employees and customers.

He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide \u201cfew clarifications\u201d about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasn\u2019t.Here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing:\u201cThe allegation is false, the facts are not correct.\u201d\u201cThose boxes were not ours. As far as I\u2019m aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t represent the company properly, I didn\u2019t represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.\u201dDid Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users.\u201cIt was my firm impression that Mr. Collins\u2019 questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data\u2026 so I answered no.\u201d\u201cWhen I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.\u201d\u201cI also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebook\u2019s request.\u201dHow useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the company\u2019s work in the U.S.?\u201cThat data was less useful than simply using Facebook\u2019s own advertising algorithms.\u201d\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMore from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance:Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends \u2014 including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.According to Facebook, the user data stayed on phones and never reached those companies\u2019 servers. Lawmakers are irate anyway: Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that he will \u201clook forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that.\u201dMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced that he was dismissing the bureau\u2019s consumer advisory board, which provides feedback on its rules and policies.By law, the bureau must convene the advisory board and hold an in-person meeting with its members at least twice a year. The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week.Anthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group.The consumer advisory board\u2019s members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard.The White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly.\u201cAnything that we can do to unlock government data, we\u2019re committed to. We\u2019d love to hear from any academic that has any insights.\u201dSo far, a big part of the administration\u2019s approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly.

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and the Feud Over Killer Robots", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "As the tech moguls disagree over the risks presented by something that doesn\u2019t exist yet, all of Silicon Valley is learning about unintended consequences of A.I.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg thought his fellow Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk was behaving like an alarmist.So, on Nov. 19, 2014, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, invited Mr. Musk to dinner at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. Two top researchers from Facebook\u2019s new artificial intelligence lab and two other Facebook executives joined them.As they ate, the Facebook contingent tried to convince Mr. Musk that he was wrong. But he wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cI genuinely believe this is dangerous,\u201d Mr. Musk told the table, according to one of the dinner\u2019s attendees, Yann LeCun, the researcher who led Facebook\u2019s A.I. lab.Mr. Musk\u2019s fears of A.I., distilled to their essence, were simple: If we create machines that are smarter than humans, they could turn against us. (See: \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d) Let\u2019s for once, he was saying to the rest of the tech industry, consider the unintended consequences of what we are creating before we unleash it on the world.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Zuckerberg would talk in detail about the dinner, which has not been reported before, or their long-running A.I. debate.The creation of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 the name for the supersmart technological breakthrough that takes A.I. to the next level and creates machines that not only perform narrow tasks that typically require human intelligence (like self-driving cars) but can actually outthink humans \u2014 still feels like science fiction. But the fight over the future of A.I. has spread across the tech industry.Artificial intelligence research has enormous potential and enormous implications, both as an economic engine and a source of military superiority. The Chinese government has said it is willing to spend billions in the coming years to make the country the world\u2019s leader in A.I., while the Pentagon is aggressively courting the tech industry for help. A new breed of autonomous weapons can\u2019t be far away.\u201cYou can now talk about the risks of A.I. without seeming like you are lost in science fiction,\u201d said Allan Dafoe, a director of the governance of A.I. program at the Future of Humanity Institute, a research center at the University of Oxford that explores the risks and opportunities of advanced technology.In April, Mr. Zuckerberg spent two days answering questions from members of Congress about data privacy and Facebook\u2019s role in the spread of misinformation before the 2016 election. He faced a similar grilling in Europe last month.Facebook\u2019s recognition that it was slow to understand what was going on has led to a rare moment of self-reflection in an industry that has long believed it is making the world a better place, whether the world likes it or not.Even such influential figures as the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the late Stephen Hawking have expressed concern about creating machines that are more intelligent than we are. Even though superintelligence seems decades away, they and others have said, shouldn\u2019t we consider the consequences before it\u2019s too late?\u201cThe kind of systems we are creating are very powerful,\u201d said Bart Selman, a Cornell University computer science professor and former Bell Labs researcher. \u201cAnd we cannot understand their impact.\u201dPacific Grove is a tiny town on the central coast of California. A group of geneticists gathered there, in the winter of 1975 to discuss whether their work \u2014 gene editing \u2014 would end up harming the world. In January 2017, the A.I. community held a similar discussion in the beachside grove.The heavy hitters of A.I. were in the room \u2014 among them Mr. LeCun, the Facebook A.I. lab boss who was at the dinner in Palo Alto, and who had helped develop a neural network, one of the most important tools in artificial intelligence today. Also in attendance was Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book, \u201cSuperintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\u201d had an outsized \u2014 some would argue fear-mongering \u2014 effect on the A.I. discussion; Oren Etzioni, a former computer science professor at the University of Washington who had taken over the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle; and Demis Hassabis, who heads DeepMind, an influential Google-owned A.I. research lab in London.And so was Mr. Musk, who in 2015 had donated $10 million to the Cambridge, Mass., institute. That same year, he also helped create an independent artificial intelligence lab, OpenAI, with an explicit goal: create superintelligence with safeguards meant to ensure it won\u2019t get out of control. It was a message that clearly aligned him with Mr. Bostrom.On the second day of the retreat, Mr. Musk took part in a nine-person panel dedicated to the superintelligence question. Each panelist was asked if superintelligence was possible. As they passed the microphone down the line, each said \u201cYes,\u201d until the microphone reached Mr. Musk. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. The small auditorium rippled with knowing laughter. Everyone understood that Mr. Musk thought superintelligence was not only possible, but very dangerous.Mr. Musk later added: \u201cWe are headed toward either superintelligence or civilization ending.\u201dWarnings about the risks of artificial intelligence have been around for years, of course. But few of those Cassandras have the tech cred of Mr. Musk. Few, if any, have spent as much time and money on it. And perhaps none has had as complicated a history with the technology.Just a few weeks after Mr. Musk talked about his A.I. concerns at the dinner in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s house, Mr. Musk phoned Mr. LeCun, asking for the names of top A.I. researchers who could work on his self-driving car project at Tesla. (That autonomous technology was in use at the time of two fatal Tesla car crashes, one in Florida in May 2016 and the other in March of this year.)During a recent Tesla earnings call, Mr. Musk, who has struggled with questions about his company\u2019s financial losses and concerns about the quality of its vehicles, chastised the news media for not focusing on the deaths that autonomous technology could prevent \u2014 a remarkable stance from someone who has repeatedly warned the world that A.I. is a danger to humanity.There is a saying in Silicon Valley: We overestimate what can be done in three years and underestimate what can be done in 10.On Jan. 27, 2016, Google\u2019s DeepMind lab unveiled a machine that could beat a professional player at the ancient board game Go. In a match played a few months earlier, the machine, called AlphaGo, had defeated the European champion Fan Hui \u2014 five games to none.Even top A.I. researchers had assumed it would be another decade before a machine could solve the game. Go is complex \u2014 there are more possible board positions than atoms in the universe \u2014 and the best players win not with sheer calculation, but through intuition. Two weeks before AlphaGo was revealed, Mr. LeCun said the existence of such a machine was unlikely.A few months later, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, the best Go player of the last decade. The machine made moves that baffled human experts but ultimately led to victory.Many researchers, including the leaders of DeepMind and OpenAI, believe the kind of self-learning technology that underpins AlphaGo provided a path to \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d And they believe progress in this area will significantly accelerate in the coming years.It\u2019s the kind of unpredictability that raise grave concerns about the rise of A.I., including superintelligence.But the deep opposition to these concerns was on display in March at an exclusive conference organized by Amazon and Mr. Bezos in Palm Springs.One evening, Rodney Brooks, a roboticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, debated the potential dangers of A.I. with the neuroscientist, philosopher and podcaster Sam Harris, a prominent voice of caution on the issue. The debate got personal, according to a recording obtained by The Times.Mr. Harris warned that because the world was in an arms race toward A.I., researchers may not have the time needed to ensure superintelligence is built in a safe way.\u201cThis is something you have made up,\u201d Mr. Brooks responded. He implied that Mr. Harris\u2019s argument was based on unscientific reasoning. It couldn\u2019t be proven right or wrong \u2014 a real insult among scientists.\u201cI would take this personally, if it actually made sense.\u201d Mr. Harris said.A moderator finally ended the tussle and asked for questions from the audience. Mr. Etzioni, the head of the Allen Institute, took the microphone. \u201cI am not going to grandstand,\u201d he said. But urged on by Mr. Brooks, he walked onto the stage and laid into Mr. Harris for three minutes, saying that today\u2019s A.I. systems are so limited, spending so much time worrying about superintelligence just doesn\u2019t make sense.The people who take Mr. Musk\u2019s side are philosophers, social scientists, writers \u2014 not the researchers who are working on A.I., he said. Among A.I. scientists, the notion that we should start worrying about superintelligence is \u201cvery much a fringe argument.\u201dPanicking about A.I. now, so early in its development, could threaten the many benefits that come from things like self-driving cars and A.I. health care, he said.\u201cWith A.I. especially, I\u2019m really optimistic,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cPeople who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios \u2014 I just, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201dIn other words: You\u2019re getting ahead of reality, Elon. Relax.\u201cThis is going to be a very central question for how we think about A.I. systems over the next decade and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, a lot of our A.I. systems make decisions in ways that people don\u2019t really understand.\u201dMr. Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind, still thinks Mr. Musk\u2019s views are extreme. But he said the same about the views of Mr. Zuckerberg. The threat is not here, he said. Not yet. But Facebook\u2019s problems are a warning.\u201cWe need to use the downtime, when things are calm, to prepare for when things get serious in the decades to come,\u201d said Mr. Hassabis. \u201cThe time we have now is valuable, and we need to make use of it.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Porsche Mission E Cross Turismo Review: \u2018Silence Is the New Power\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsMALIBU, Calif. \u2014 The stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway that slices through Malibu is America\u2019s premier automotive fashion catwalk. Gaggles of exotics \u2014 Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bentleys \u2014 regularly strut this pavement. Now, electric cars have become a new kind of status symbol on the highway.Few on this car-crazed strip seemed to realize the white Porsche motoring silently between two Los Angeles County Sheriff cruisers last week. Maybe it\u2019s because 911s outnumber palm trees here, or wary drivers were focused on law enforcement. Pity. There\u2019s only one of its kind on the planet. To see the Porsche Mission E Cross Turismo concept driving in the wild is the equivalent of catching Bigfoot riding a unicorn at an In-N-Out Burger drive-through.Porsche airfreighted its fully electric concept vehicle from Stuttgart, Germany, to Malibu for four American automotive journalists to experience on a cloudless California day. I drew a long straw. It is not a production car, although the production sport sedan version will arrive in late 2019. But driving the crossover-like Cross Turismo offers a chance to read the tea leaves, and perhaps get an idea if the Mission E program will spawn true Porsches \u2014 or merely Tesla wannabes.It is worth wondering about. Tesla\u2019s Model S sedan was introduced almost six years ago, and now with a fleet of models, the company will sell its 200,000th vehicle this year. When Porsche showed off the Mission E sport sedan concept at the 2015 Frankfurt auto show, it stunned the crowd, and the automotive press quickly called it \u201cthe Tesla slayer.\u201dTo that, Porsche\u2019s Stefan Weckbach simply says \u201cNo.\u201dMr. Weckbach, the vice president of Porsche\u2019s battery electric vehicle program, is adamant that the Mission E \u201cmust be a Porsche first.\u201d\u201cIt must have repeatable and sustained performance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cannot sacrifice performance.\u201dFor me, there would not be much time to test that performance. The ground rules said I would have no more than two hours, and the distance would be capped at 12 miles. And no damage could be done to the car. Fair enough.The equipment powering the Cross Turismo is certainly Porsche. Most concept cars have meager power sources to crawl across auto show stages, but the Cross Turismo\u2019s drivetrain employs early Mission E prototype motors and batteries, although they are governed by software to produce less than the production car\u2019s anticipated 600 horsepower. (Torque inquiries are politely \u2014 but firmly \u2014 dismissed, though Mr. Weckbach said, \u201cYou will be happy.\u201d) Charging ports grace both front fenders, and wireless charging is being discussed. Because Porsche built the concept without lightweight materials, it is about 1,100 pounds heavier than the undisclosed production weight of the Mission E sport sedan. The back seat is \u201coptical\u201d \u2014 which is to say, it just looks like a seat, but isn\u2019t one yet.Its graceful front passenger space certainly seems production ready. The instrument cluster \u2014 a thin, curved LCD panel \u2014 replaces the usual gauge binnacle. Multiple touch screens mean the passenger seat gets its own infotainment controls. (Porsche engineers find this setup ergonomically superior to a single large screen.)The 90 kWh lithium-ion battery \u2014 bigger than the base 75 kWh batteries in Tesla\u2019s Model S and Model X S.U.V., but smaller than their available 100 kWh options \u2014 lies flat beneath the passenger compartment, yet a high console with storage divides the seats, front and rear. Porsche says it will be good for more than 300 miles of range. I would have only 12 to try it out.I have driven many deliriously expensive cars. Nothing is more exciting \u2014 yet terrifying \u2014 than driving a one-off concept. My first task was backing up in tight quarters, with no rearview camera and fixed mirrors that were set poorly for me. Gulp.Fortunately, the deputies\u2019 cruisers (they would accompany me on my test drive, since the car wasn\u2019t licensed and met no safety regulations) brought traffic to a halt so I could glide silently onto the highway. There was no rock star reaction. Maybe the Cross Turismo looks too much like the offspring of Porsche\u2019s Panamera sport sedan and a Macan crossover. Or maybe the annoyed motorist in the Nissan Rogue was just late for brunch.Performance is often equated to sound, but of course the Mission E produces precious little noise. Stab the throttle and the dual-motor system sings a lower note than a Tesla. Accelerating quietly into the hills above Malibu, Mr. Weckbach, riding shotgun, smiled. \u201cSilence,\u201d he said, \u201cis the new power.\u201dThe car was electronically limited to 50 miles an hour, but I repeatedly dropped away from the lead patrol car and mashed the go pedal to assess power delivery. Despite the concept\u2019s porky build weight and the software leash on the powertrain, it pulled hard in the soul satisfying, torquey way of electric cars. The conclusion? The concept felt heavy, but minus 1,100 pounds, the production car should be lithe and wickedly fast.For optimal cornering, the all-wheel-drive system has the ability to vector torque to the wheel that needs it. Rear-wheel steering is planned. Plenty of tight turns offered the chance to assess handling, though I\u2019d be lying if I claimed to have four-wheel-drifted through them. (Who wants to be famous for wrecking a priceless automobile?) The battery pack under the floor provides a low center of gravity common to such electrics, even though the Cross Turismo rides a touch high, in proper crossover fashion. With less weight to carry into corners, the production car should always bring a smile. One request to the development team: Keep the hefty steering weight as is.Considering the concept was hand-built, the level of refinement was remarkable. There were precious few squeaks or rattles. Diamond patterns painted on the enormous glass roof cast distracting shadows and probably wouldn\u2019t see production. The concept\u2019s exterior shape looks 95 percent complete, and while the Cross Turismo model hasn\u2019t been officially greenlighted for production, the Macan crossover\u2019s status as Porsche\u2019s best-selling vehicle virtually guarantees the Cross Turismo will be. Another request: Lose the front marker lights between the headlights.I asked Mr. Weckbach if the electric lineup will maintain the Mission E name. \u201cWe are not discussing that right now,\u201d he said.I pressed him on pricing. It has been widely expected to run close to the Panamera, which begins at $85,000 \u2014 about $10,000 more than the base price of a Tesla Model S 75D. \u201cWe are not discussing that now,\u201d he said.Whether Porsche likes to admit it, Tesla will be its measuring stick.Mr. Weckbach\u2019s team bought electric cars, including a Model S, to drive and study, even if the Porsche\u2019s particulars will differ from the Tesla\u2019s. Mission E models lack a third row of seating, something Model S and X offer. And semiautonomous driving technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot appears to be a lower priority, perhaps not surprising given Porsche\u2019s emphasis on the driving experience.And keeping that experience going over road-trip distances will be another way that Porsche must contend with Tesla.Many Tesla owners enjoy free access to Supercharger charging stations, the most powerful of which offer 480-volt chargers. Porsche has developed its own 800-volt fast-charging system. Klaus Zellmer, the chief executive of Porsche Cars North America, said the system will be able to add 250 miles of range in about 15 minutes.But Tesla\u2019s Supercharger system is far larger. It has 1,255 stations, most with multiple Superchargers. Porsche plans to have 300 stations in the United States by the end of 2019, two-thirds of them being 800-volt systems.Mr. Zellmer said that they have yet to decide whether Porsche owners will have to pay for charging.Whether Porsche will take on that financial commitment, it has already decided to pour money into the Mission E project. Mr. Zellmer said Porsche was doubling its spending on electric vehicles to more than 6 billion euros, he said.Tesla has the head start, but Porsche, with its emphasis on performance and racing heritage, appears to be taking a different route. Perhaps it was no mistake Mr. Weckbach would name-drop a certain famed 13-mile German track that has quickly sent Teslas into a performance-sapping safe mode. Asked if a hard-driven Mission E can avoid such a difficulty, he simply said, \u201cOur cars are testing on the N\u00fcrburgring.\u201dSilence \u2014 or at least brevity \u2014 is powerful indeed.Advertisement"}

Proposed targets from the European Commission, for example, sharply reduce the average allowed level of carbon emissions for cars and trucks in the region.\u201cWe see evolving needs of customers globally, and those needs are in the areas of connected services and powertrain choices,\u201d said Michael Baumann, a spokesman for Ford in Europe, referring to cars\u2019 energy sources.

{"Headline": "Tesla Turns Back Rare Challenge From Shareholders", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla Inc. and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have become accustomed to adoration from customers and shareholders alike. But at this year\u2019s annual meeting came a rare challenge from investors who sought to shake up the board and force Mr. Musk to give up one of his two top positions.Tesla announced that the proposals had been rejected by \u201ca wide margin.\u201d And Tesla has a supermajority voting structure that requires a two-thirds majority for major changes \u2014 a high hurdle given that Mr. Musk himself holds about one-fifth of the shares.Mr. Musk said Tesla is now capable of producing 3,500 Model 3s a week \u2014 up from about 2,000 a week in May \u2014 and called it \u201cquite likely\u201d that the company could exceed 5,000 by the end of June. \u201cIt\u2019s been the most excruciating, hellish months I\u2019ve maybe ever had, but I think we\u2019re getting there,\u201d he said.In May, the Model 3 outsold all other luxury midsize cars, such as the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Mr. Musk said.Mr. Musk has said Tesla can become profitable if it makes about 5,000 Model 3s a week. He told shareholders that he expected the company to have positive net income in the next quarter, as well as positive net cash flow in the third and fourth quarters.He added that he did not expect Tesla to have to raise additional capital later this year, as some analysts have suspected.Still, many investors remain wildly supportive of Mr. Musk and Tesla \u2014 the company\u2019s stock has rallied in recent weeks after tumbling sharply in late March and early April after news of the California accident, and was up about 1 percent in aftermarket trading on Tuesday. And the shareholder challenges were quickly disposed of at the start of the meeting, but not before dissident voices were heard.\u201cUsually it\u2019s like a cult meeting because of the way so many shareholders are such fans of Elon,\u201d said David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar.The investment group wanted to remove directors Kimbal Musk, who is Mr. Musk\u2019s brother and a food entrepreneur; James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox; and Antonio Gracias, a venture capital investor who is Tesla\u2019s lead outside director.CtW said Kimbal Musk and Mr. Gracias were too close to Elon Musk to be independent voices on the board, and asserted that Mr. Murdoch did not have any business experience relevant to the auto industry.The proposed measure to split the chairman and chief executive positions came from an individual investor. Some shareholder advisory firms supported splitting the two posts as a general principle.Mr. Whiston, however, said doing so would have had little effect at Tesla because the company is so dominated by Mr. Musk.\u201cIf Elon is not chairman, that\u2019s not going to speed up Model 3 production,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

DirecTV has steadily lost customers in this age of cord-cutting, dragging down AT&T\u2019s financial health.\u201cI think he deserves a lot of credit for avoiding some of the traps that some of his peers have fallen into,\u201d Mr. Moffett said of Mr. McAdam.As for the fear underpinning many telecom companies\u2019 deal-making \u2014 that sticking to basic internet and phone service is boring \u2014 Mr. Moffett said Verizon has shown that worry to be unfounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about being a distribution channel?\u201d he told me. \u201cVerizon fully understood and embraced that there will always be a place for an advantaged network \u2014 and people will pay a premium for it.\u201dAmy Yong, MacquarieMr. McAdam\u2019s relentless focus on making Verizon\u2019s network the best in the U.S. has paid off handsomely, with the company earning a premium from investors based on the strength of its core business.The big question is whether that will be enough going forward, as rivals AT&T and T-Mobile pursue bold moves.Verizon\u2019s cautious strategy may ending up costing the company. Though AT&T\u2019s bet on wireless video streaming hasn\u2019t paid off yet, if it works, it will make that company a formidable creator and distributor of content. And T-Mobile and Sprint could prove to be a strong new rival if their proposed union works out.\u201cThe future is looking very different,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat worked in the past may not be what works in the future.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedA new report suggests that Apple is preparing to sell fewer phones later this year. It may sound worrying. But we\u2019ve seen similar news before, and the fallout is unlikely to be all that bad.But Apple\u2019s phones are getting more expensive, so every sale counts for more. And its services businesses \u2014 things like Music and Pay \u2014 are becoming an increasingly valuable revenue stream, meaning that the company can make more money off existing users even if they don\u2019t upgrade to the latest device.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe job faced by investigators of car collisions is getting more difficult as autonomous car features become more advanced, and the way they do their jobs might need to change to accommodate that.In March, a Tesla Model X collided with a concrete lane divider as it was driven down a highway in Mountain View, Calif. A new report by National Transportation Safety Board investigators suggested that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology played a role in the death of a Tesla owner.The driver was using the advanced driver assistance features traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer lane-keeping assistance, which Tesla refers to as \u201cautopilot.\u201d As the Tesla approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of US-101 from the SH-85 exit ramp, it moved to the left and entered the gore area. The Tesla continued traveling through the gore area and struck a previously damaged crash attenuator at a speed of about 71 mph.Information isn\u2019t recorded in most cars\u2019 event data recorders, the automotive equivalent of airplane black boxes. Instead, the boxes show more basic information such as steering-wheel input and throttle.While automakers commonly provide the information if it is requested by the vehicle owner, accident investigators\u2014typically contractors hired by insurance companies\u2014say they sometimes have to seek a court order to obtain crash data.An update to the rules published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could change that situation, by demanding that automakers log more details about the vehicle\u2019s behavior.The complexity of the mathematical calculations involved means it\u2019s not straightforward to take the network apart to understand how it makes its decisions. This can make unintended behavior hard to predict; and if failure does occur, it can be difficult to explain why. If a system misrecognizes an object in a photo, for instance, it may be hard (though not impossible) to know what feature of the image led to the error.Many artificial intelligence researchers are trying to develop ways to make it easier to understand the inner working of A.I. systems. But for now, that\u2019s likely to involve looking at complex computer code. That suggests that crash investigation teams, as well as the regulations that are applied to automakers, might require an update in the near future, too.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeComcast is threatening to challenge Walt Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox. Behind the scenes, it\u2019s playing down investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 fears of an antitrust response. We may have just gotten a clue about whether it\u2019s right.The head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, appears unruffled about a Disney-Fox deal, at least. From an interview at The Deal\u2019s conference yesterday:\u201cThey had good advice and carved out surgically what a transaction is that might be doable and who knows where that transaction leads.\u201dBut Mr. Delrahim also defended his team\u2019s effort to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, saying it was a merger of a kind that federal regulators had sought to block for decades. (A federal judge is expected to rule on the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against the deal on Tuesday.)Mr. Trump is the black sheep of this family, the estranged sibling who decided to pick fights with his relatives just before arriving to dinner. The dispute, Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, acknowledges, is \u201cmuch like a family quarrel.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 any of that will affect America\u2019s trade policies. But diplomatic tensions look set to rise, and economic uncertainty would rise with them.Elsewhere in trade:The Trump administration removed crippling penalties on the ailing Chinese telecom company in exchange for $1.4 billion in fines and other measures. But did some other big gain drive the deal?Getting Beijing to approve Qualcomm\u2019s takeover of another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors? Maybe. China\u2019s latest trade concessions, which were linked to the Trump administration not imposing certain tariffs? Unlikely.More from Jane Mayer:A business associate who declined to be identified, in order not to jeopardize his ties to the family, told me, \u201cCharles pushed David out. It was done with a wink, and a nod, and a nudge.\u201dSF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group, a company controlled by top executives at the billionaire\u2019s investment firm, has a 15 percent stake in the horse, which is the heavy favorite to win tomorrow\u2019s Belmont Stakes.SF Bloodstock, which according to court filings is owned by SF Agricultural Holdings L.L.C., employs a for-profit model and focuses on the breeding side of the industry, purchasing stallions, or shares in them, and broodmares while selling yearlings at auction. In 2015, it entered into a three-year partnership with WinStar Farm and China Horse Club that allowed them to spend big while spreading risk at yearling and 2-year-old sales. That is how the group partly acquired Justify.Elsewhere in business and sports: An earlier version of this briefing misstated the name of the race that Justify is the heavy favorite to win.

But it will continue to work with governments and the military.The new rules were part of a set of principles Google unveiled relating to the use of artificial intelligence. In a company blog post, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, laid out seven objectives for its A.I. technology, including \u201cavoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias\u201d and \u201cbe socially beneficial.\u201dGoogle also detailed applications of the technology that the company will not pursue, including A.I. for \u201cweapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people\u201d and \u201ctechnologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms of human rights.\u201dBut Google said it would continue to work with governments and military using A.I. in areas including cybersecurity, training and military recruitment.\u201cWe recognize that such powerful technology raises equally powerful questions about its use. How A.I. is developed and used will have a significant impact on society for many years to come,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote.Mr. Pichai did not address the Maven program or the pressure from employees.

I do think that one of the things that happened in California demographically, was that the G.O.P. hitched its wagon so much to anti-immigrant sentiment in the 1990s that where they had a big inroad with the Latino population they very much lost that.\u201dThere were other parallels, he said. A loss of manufacturing jobs led to a sense of dislocation among the white working class. Rush Limbaugh began his career in Sacramento in the 1980s, just before conservative talk radio played a big role in immigrant bashing in the 1990s, similar to the role Fox News has played today in fanning anti-immigrant sentiment.But California\u2019s rise in the years since, Mr. Pastor says, offers at least some hope that American will overcome its own toxic political environment.\u201cThe serious discussion we have to have about California\u2019s future is not climate change versus no climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cNot about whether we will be a sanctuary state or not, but the nuances of this. Having a big symbolic battle about Trump, as interesting as it will be for the rest of the country, is quite a bit of a distraction from what the state itself needs to do, particularly in a gubernatorial campaign.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)If there is nothing in life better than carving open a perfectly ripe avocado \u2014 and truly, what could be better? \u2014 there is nothing more disappointing than discovering that one has gone bad.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

And they are up 45 percent from the depths of the housing crisis in 2012.The big rebound in home prices and the lure of making a quick buck drew more than 200 people on Tuesday to a MidtownManhattan hotel for a two-hour free class on flipping houses. The lunchtime program I dropped in on was part of a sophisticated come-on for a paid three-day workshop that Nathaniel \u201cThan\u201d Merrill and his FortuneBuilders company plan to hold in the New York metropolitan area. An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience. The instructor at the afternoon session sought to inspire the crowd, saying that if they only had the courage, they could someday quit their day jobs and live the way they always wanted to. Judging by the enthusiastic reaction, many were buying the message.- Matthew GoldsteinThe Chinese market is valuable and distinctive from the rest of the world. Arm believes this joint venture, which will license Arm semiconductor technology to Chinese companies and locally develop Arm technology in China, will expand Arm\u2019s opportunities in the Chinese market.Arm estimates that 95 percent of all advanced chips designed in China last year were based on its technology. With China desperate to make its own chips in volume, and quickly (there\u2019s more on that theme below), the move could prove shrewd.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation is rushing to build semiconductor factories. But reports claiming that the Chinese government is probing chip makers over price-fixing demonstrate that it\u2019s not there yet.Reuters notes that, according to Trendforce, China accounts for 20 percent of all global DRAM memory sales. For now, those purchases must be made almost entirely from Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, at what the Chinese government appears to believe may be inflated prices.China\u2019s own production plants \u2014 and carefully controlled pricing \u2014 clearly can\u2019t come soon enough.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe hire shows Washington is becoming more intertwined with corporate America, as the state intervenes in M.&A. and other business dealings. George Sard, the firm\u2019s C.E.O., told Michael de la Merced that the government \u201cis pretty central to everything we\u2019re doing.\u201dJames Davis, the executive vice president of Freedom Partners, said the campaign was \u201ca demonstration of our long-term commitment to advance common-sense trade policies that will ensure America\u2019s brightest days are ahead, and to directly confront the protectionist ideas that would hold us back.\u201dSome highlights from Apple\u2019s annual developer conference yesterday:For Microsoft, the deal continues its break with the past.

But under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft is transforming itself into a cloud provider for businesses \u2014 and even adopting open-source technology. GitHub fits that vision neatly.Unless Microsoft treads carefully, some could flee to rival repositories like BitBucket or GitLab, which has seen a big spike in traffic since news of the deal broke.\u201cOf course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk Accuses Tesla Employee of Sabotage", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn scrambling to ramp up production of its Model 3 electric car, Tesla has run into trouble with robots and automated machinery, a need for more workers and a shortage of battery packs.Now Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, suspects his company might have a more unusual problem: sabotage.In an email sent to employees late Sunday night, Mr. Musk said a disgruntled worker had broken into the company\u2019s computer systems in an attempt to disrupt manufacturing.\u201cI was dismayed to learn this weekend about a Tesla employee who had conducted quite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis included making direct code changes to the Tesla Manufacturing Operating System under false usernames and exporting large amounts of highly sensitive Tesla data to unknown third parties.\u201dTesla seemingly has no shortage of customers ready to buy the car. It took $1,000 deposits from nearly 400,000 people even before it began making the Model 3 last summer. A large portion of those customers, however, were expecting to buy a basic version that is priced at $35,000 but has not yet gone into production. For now, the company is making versions that sell for $50,000 and more.\u201cWhat versions they are producing are almost as important as how many they are producing a week,\u201d said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research firm. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about a mainstream car that anybody can afford but what they\u2019re making are still luxury cars that most buyers can\u2019t afford.\u201dMs. Lindland said that she had sent a deposit for a base-price Model 3, but that she asked for a refund earlier this year when she realized that only the higher-priced versions would be available.The specter of industrial sabotage adds a strange chapter to the extraordinary, if relatively short, history of Tesla. Defying critics, the company has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download operating systems. Taking an approach never tried before, Mr. Musk also built a gigantic factory in Nevada to reduce the costs of battery packs through vast scale.At the same time, Tesla and its chief have experienced setbacks. At least three fatal accidents have occurred in the United States involving Tesla vehicles that were operating with the company\u2019s Autopilot driver-assistance system engaged, drawing scrutiny from federal safety officials and raising questions about the system\u2019s reliability. Mr. Musk also overestimated Tesla\u2019s ability to mass-produce the Model 3; he once expected the company to churn out several hundred thousand in 2018.While Tesla\u2019s share price has made it more valuable than Ford and close behind General Motors, its shares were down almost 5 percent on Tuesday.One constant since Tesla was founded in 2003: the company has lost money every year. Tesla has several times raised money from investors to develop its cars and put them into production, and some analysts are concerned because the company must begin paying back some debt later this year.In his email reporting sabotage, Mr. Musk seemed to stoke the notion that enemies of Tesla were working against it.\u201cAs you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese include Wall Street short-sellers, who have already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more.\u201d He also pointed to oil and gas companies, which, he said, \u201cdon\u2019t love the idea of Tesla advancing progress of solar power & electric cars.\u201d Of rival automakers, he added that \u201cif they\u2019re willing to cheat so much about emissions, maybe they\u2019re willing to cheat in other ways?\u201dThe employee thought to have harmed Tesla\u2019s manufacturing system was not identified in the email, but Mr. Musk said the worker had admitted trying to damage the manufacturing system and was unhappy with the company after being passed over for a promotion.\u201cThis is when outside forces have the strongest motivation to stop us,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.Advertisement"}
