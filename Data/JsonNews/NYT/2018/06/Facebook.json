{"Headline": "Facebook Back on the Defensive, Now Over Data Deals With Device Makers", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook endured a new wave of criticism from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe on Monday after disclosures that the social media giant had allowed dozens of hardware manufacturers access to its trove of personal user data.The European authorities who last month enacted the world\u2019s strictest data privacy law said Facebook\u2019s sharing of personal information with cellphone makers and other manufacturers deserved further investigation. Germany\u2019s top privacy regulator, Johannes Caspar, called Facebook\u2019s partnerships \u201can unprecedented violation of privacy laws and user trust.\u201dAnd New York\u2019s attorney general, Barbara Underwood, said her office would expand its investigation of Facebook\u2019s data practices to include Facebook\u2019s sharing with hardware manufacturers.Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have repeatedly cited the 2015 restrictions to assure policymakers that no outside company could again harvest swaths of personal information without the explicit consent of users, as a contractor for Cambridge Analytica did in 2014. But Facebook officials said this week that they did not consider hardware partners to be outside companies, under the terms of Facebook\u2019s privacy policies and a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cFriends\u2019 information, like photos, was only accessible on devices when people made a decision to share their information with those friends,\u201d said the executive, Ime Archibong. \u201cWe are not aware of any abuse by these companies.\u201dBut some American lawmakers criticized Facebook\u2019s rationale and urged the F.T.C. to review whether the partnerships violated Facebook\u2019s promises to the regulator.\u201cI think this explanation is completely inadequate and potentially disingenuous,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee charged with consumer protection. \u201cI think Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony raises very serious and severe questions about Facebook\u2019s credibility.\u201dDavid Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House antitrust subcommittee, responded even more harshly.Senior Republicans also said the partnerships merited further review.Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said in a statement that The Times\u2019s reporting \u201craises important questions about transparency and potential privacy risks for Facebook users.\u201d Mr. Thune said the Senate Commerce Committee, of which he is chairman, would seek more information from Facebook.The F.T.C. is already investigating whether the access to friends\u2019 data that Facebook allowed until 2015 violated the terms of its earlier consent decree with the regulator. Rohit Chopra, a current F.T.C. commissioner, declined to comment on any specific company or investigation, but said he believed that the commission would act to enforce any agreements it had with companies.\u201cToo often, sensitive consumer data gets shared and copied over and over again to a point of no return,\u201d Mr. Chopra said. \u201cF.T.C. orders are not suggestions. When companies violate them, there can be serious consequences.\u201dDuring the event\u2019s keynote address, Craig Federighi, an Apple senior vice president, unveiled a new feature that will let Apple users more easily control what sort of information is shared with Facebook and other social media companies.Mr. Federighi chose to demonstrate the new feature onstage by showing Apple\u2019s Safari browser open to a webpage.

I would pop the kernels in oil, slather them in butter and salt, and gobble them while watching old slapstick comedies on the couch, battling husband and child for that last craggy crumb.Then I tasted Jessica Koslow\u2019s recipe, and my popcorn world exploded.Her snow-white kernels were impeccably crunchy, glistening with fat and seasoned with just enough salt to stick to my fingers. Their initial crackle melted into a corn-flavored fluff on the tongue before completely disappearing. I yearned for more and didn\u2019t stop until I hit the bottom of the bowl, which was blissfully free of any unpopped tooth-breakers. My lovingly tended version just couldn\u2019t compare.She gives popcorn the same thoughtful makeover. Her tweaks? Using two to three times the amount of oil called for in most recipes, then tossing the extra-crisp kernels in dry seasonings so as not to soften the crunch. \u201cThe large amount of oil kind of snuck up on me,\u201d she said.When she started developing her recipe, she eyeballed it, aiming to cover the surface of her Dutch oven before adding the kernels.\u201cOnce I measured everything, I thought, wow, that\u2019s a lot more oil than I thought.\u201dHer recommended proportions are a half-cup oil to one-third cup popcorn kernels. That\u2019s more oil than corn. But after testing of all of these methods (except the sand), I can tell you: They\u2019re not nearly as good as Ms. Koslow\u2019s exuberantly oily, salty kernels.As for the type of oil, Ms. Koslow prefers grapeseed for its high smoke point and clean flavor, but sunflower, safflower, vegetable, canola and corn oils also work, as does ghee if you have it on hand.Similarly, I\u2019ve had great success using a quarter-cup grapeseed oil mixed with a quarter-cup of another flavorful fat with a lower smoke point \u2014 coconut oil, olive oil, bacon grease, duck fat. While you can use fats with lower smoke points by themselves, I\u2019ve found they work best when mixed with more refined oils. The mix makes the popcorn slightly crunchier and helps ensure that every kernel is popped.No matter which fat you use, these shiny kernels hold their seasonings well. Stick to dry toppings like ground spices, seeds, chiles, nutritional yeast, vegetable powders, seasoned salts and dehydrated herbs. Anything with a high moisture content (grated Parmesan, lemon zest, fresh herbs) will wilt your crunchy corn like water on a Cheeto.But, then again, when the popcorn itself is this crisp, even plain sea salt tastes amazing. \u201cGreat popcorn is surprising to people; they\u2019re not used to it,\u201d Ms. Koslow said. Until, like me, they get hooked. Then there\u2019s no going back.Advertisement"}

This observation isn\u2019t revolutionary; you\u2019ve known to be on the lookout for internet scams since the first time you made friends with a Nigerian prince. The internet is a global gathering of strangers and money, which means that a fraud, a trick, a swindle, a grift or a graft is obviously never far.And yet it is surprising how often, and how completely, many of us can be deluded into letting our guard down, thinking that what we see online really is on the up and up.Bitcoin, you\u2019ll recall, is the decentralized cryptocurrency whose proponents argue that it represents the future of currency. Its key innovation, they say, is radical transparency that ensures trust among strangers. In other words, the point of Bitcoin and its underlying technology is to eliminate the kind of fraud alleged here. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded in a ledger, called a \u201cblockchain,\u201d that is maintained by a network of computers rather than by a central institution, like a bank or an accounting firm. Proponents of Bitcoin and blockchains argue that centralized ledgers are inherently prone to trickery and fraud; look at Bernie Madoff or Enron.The fraud alleged by Mr. Griffin does not suggest any flaw in the blockchain itself, but it does go far in undercutting the high-flying rhetoric about how blockchains might usher in a new era of far-flung trust. Even though all of Bitcoin\u2019s transactions are recorded on a blockchain, the transparency didn\u2019t seem to inhibit trickery here.Mr. Griffin spotted patterns that suggested manipulators were using another virtual currency, Tether, which was issued by Bitfinex, to prop up the price of Bitcoin when it sagged. These apparent manipulations were recorded on the blockchain \u2014 that record is how Mr. Griffin\u2019s team came to its conclusions. But even though the possibility of manipulation was mentioned often last year, it took months to put together detailed evidence that it had happened.And in that time, the whole world \u2014 the financial press, ordinary investors, anyone looking for the next windfall \u2014 put more money into Bitcoin. Even though lots of people should have known better \u2014 even though we all know the internet is lousy with scams \u2014 Bitcoin, we were told, was different.Nope, it wasn\u2019t.

Then they transplanted the colonies to 38 different sites \u2014 from London\u2019s city center to surrounding villages, suburbs and farms. Then they monitored how they were doing.The country bees did not do so well. Compared to those placed in cities and villages, colonies placed in agricultural fields produced fewer reproductive offspring and fewer workers, and their queens died sooner. Their colonies, which broke down faster than city and village colonies, also had fewer nutrient reserves. It surprised Ms. Samuelson how big this difference was. But even more remarkable was that suburban colonies were no better off than city colonies: \u201cThe bees did really, really well, even in the absolute center of London.\u201d In bumblebee colonies, sterile female offspring forage, bring in food for the nest, clean and help rear the brood. Once a colony makes enough of these workers, they start making bees capable of reproducing and carrying on the genetic line. Perhaps modern farm life \u2014 with fewer floral resources and potentially more pesticides \u2014 may be too stressful for the bees, preventing them from growing big colonies and making babies that make babies.\u201cIt\u2019s really starting to become quite clear that agricultural areas are generally quite bad for wildlife,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really need to focus on improving agricultural areas for bees.\u201d We\u2019re taking you on a journey to help you understand how bees, while hunting for pollen, use all of their senses \u2014 taste, touch, smell and more \u2014 to decide what to pick up and bring home.Advertisement"}

It has a nice rhythm and alliteration. I have red hair and my mom was inspired by Vanessa Redgrave. Her second choice was Bridget, which I also really like. I\u2019m nicknamed V. V. for my initials and it always makes me smile. Let me say that with a name like mine, there is ambivalence. I love it now, but as a child I was mercilessly teased for having the same name as a cheap brand of soda. I had the Shasta Cola jingle sung to me countless times; I had people ask me what flavor I was; others wanted to know if I had siblings named Coke and Pepsi. And my mother, bless her heart, would buy Shasta for my birthday parties because it was cheaper! I would beg her to spend the extra few cents for one of the better brands, but no dice. I joke now that she owes me money for therapy bills! Of course, those with geographic knowledge have heard of Mt. Shasta, which I don\u2019t mind being associated with at all. But the thing is, my name came from neither the cola nor the mountain, but from a bad John Wayne movie my parents saw at the drive-in when my mom was pregnant with me. The main female character\u2019s name was Shasta, and she loved it!I once had a clerk write \u201cChesty\u201d on a receipt for my name. My solution?

I often wondered why my parents would give me a name they knew no one could pronounce.

Once I did, he said to me, of course I know that name and we proceeded to have a great conversation about our backgrounds as he was from the Middle East. It was sort of a turning point for me.

Things, sadly, have changed.It was the sweet siren song of the milk bar that led me, at 7 years old, to run away from school. The milk bar provided that first to many Australian children, as well as others: the first taste of consumer lust; the first place a parent might send you alone to buy milk or eggs; the first place you were likely to blow your first tiny paycheck, otherwise known as an allowance. The stores were instantly recognizable by their familiar architecture and distinctive signage \u2014 they were as much a part of Melbourne as the pubs or the trams or the Victorian rowhouses. Seven years after my milk-bar-seeking jailbreak, I moved to the United States. A quarter of a century later I moved back to Melbourne, and they were \u2026 gone. In many ways, \u201cmilk bar\u201d is just another term for a corner store. But there are aspects of its history and demise that make it uniquely Australian. The Black and White 4d was such a success that it soon spawned many imitators, particularly Greek-owned businesses. The name milk bar was applied to any general local store, whether it served milkshakes or not. By the time I was a kid, there was a milk bar within a block or two of almost any house in any neighborhood in Melbourne. What happened to the Australian milk bar? A perfect storm. Rapidly rising property values in the cities pushed out small businesses like milk bars, greengrocers and butchers. But as early as the 1970s, the milk bar was taking hits that had little to do with real estate. In that decade, supermarkets proliferated and became more accessible. Australian retail laws used to forbid most supermarkets and food shops to open on Sundays or after noon on Saturdays, making milk bars the only grocery shopping option for much of the weekend. (Gas stations were not permitted to sell food.) Those laws also began to change in the \u201970s. Back then, before the supermarkets arrived, most of their business was in groceries. Today, Mountain View\u2019s business is mostly in prepared food to-go: pies, sausage rolls and egg salad sandwiches. \u201cI get so many people coming in and asking these things,\u201d said Ms. Constantinou, indicating that I wasn\u2019t the only person who had come poking around with a wistful look in my eyes, searching for my childhood in her shop. \u201cThey take pictures. They say, \u2018Don\u2019t change anything!\u2019 We want to paint, but they say, \u2018No!\u2019\u201d Slowly, the cities and towns of Australia will start to blend together, a sea of 7-Elevens and Starbucks and BP stations. I can\u2019t imagine any of those inspiring the type of grand jailbreak that 7-year-old me undertook in pursuit of the milk bar and its riches. Advertisement"}

It was always a long shot, but now the dream of an African team holding this trophy aloft seems further away than ever. I was born and raised in Britain but I\u2019ve often shared that dream. Whenever England is eliminated from the World Cup, my affections go next to the best African team. That\u2019s not just because my parents moved to England from Uganda. It\u2019s also because Africa, having suffered centuries of colonization and exploitation, has so long been denied an equal place on the global stage.

Let\u2019s remember world history: Most of Africa was at some point colonized by Europe\u2019s empires, which subjugated these societies and stripped them of their resources. Naturally, there are contemporary problems, too. Some of Africa\u2019s leading football nations have, I\u2019m sorry to say, compounded historical setbacks with modern-day mismanagement of their players and resources. (I\u2019m thinking of Nigeria and Ghana especially.) But as France, Germany and Spain have recently shown, the path to World Cup victory these days relies on patient investment in the national team over the course of several decades, and then a substantial helping of luck. Maybe someday. Sports can be a powerful symbol of progress. Remember when Muhammad Ali\u2019s fast fists and swifter tongue ruled the world? On some level, I can\u2019t wait for the day an African country lands a knockout blow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Miss America Ends Swimsuit Competition, Aiming to Evolve in \u2018This Cultural Revolution\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time in nearly a century, Miss America contestants will not strut onstage in swimsuits this year, the organizers announced on Tuesday, as the pageant tries to redefine its role in an era of female empowerment and gender equality.Miss America and swimsuits have been synonymous since its first contest in 1921 on the Atlantic City boardwalk. But what started as contestants wearing one-piece bathing suits, conservative by today\u2019s standards, became women in revealing bikinis and high heels parading around for a leering television audience.Now under mostly female leadership, the Miss America Organization said Tuesday that it was scrapping the swimsuit competition, starting at the national contest in September, in a sweeping change that will also reshape local and state contests.The organization, confronting its own harassment scandal and searching for its place in the #MeToo era, had worked on the new format for several months. The nine members of the board of directors \u2014 seven are now women \u2014 unanimously approved the change in March. It was kept a secret until two days ago, when state directors and former Miss Americas were informed.\u201cWe are not going to judge you on your outward appearance,\u201d Ms. Carlson, who was Miss America in 1989, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cWe are moving it forward and evolving it in this cultural revolution.\u201dThe changes will be immediate for Miss America, but will take longer to arrive at local and state events, Ms. Carlson confirmed. Since state contests are currently underway, they will not adopt the new format until after the national competition in September.Earlier this year, the Miss America Organization brought in the advertising agency Young & Rubicam to help with its branding. Y&R conducted interviews with several past pageant winners, state volunteers, board members, and other stakeholders. The message from Y&R was clear: Miss America needed to modernize to relate to younger women today. Their recommendations included focusing on the career achievements of past winners, and suggested that the swimsuit competition could distract from that message.\u201cThis will be more inclusive,\u201d said Jennifer Vaden-Barth, a Miss America board member, who was also Miss North Carolina 1991. \u201cIt\u2019ll allow us to put the ownership of a woman\u2019s presence and beauty in her hands.\u201dMiss America started as a beachside beauty pageant in 1921 in an effort by Atlantic City to extend the summer vacation season. At the first competition, the top finisher was crowned Miss America and a runner-up received the swimsuit trophy.Over the decades, the Miss America Organization struggled to reconcile its stated mission \u2014 empowering women and handing out millions of dollars in scholarships \u2014 with requiring contestants to wear revealing attire.\u201cIt\u2019s discouraging to hear, I was definitely a proponent of it,\u201d said Chaz Ellis, the interim executive director of the Miss South Carolina Scholarship Organization, adding that he supported the national group despite the changes. \u201cIt\u2019s about physical fitness, it\u2019s about a healthy lifestyle.\u201dNot everyone in the pageant world, however, agreed that the swimsuit portion was entirely about judging fitness. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s completely honest or accurate,\u201d said Leah Summers, the executive director of the Miss West Virginia Scholarship Organization, who won that state\u2019s title in 1991.Ms. Summers said she anticipated \u201cpretty dramatic changes\u201d from the national organization after the appointment of a new chairwoman and new female board members. She said the new leaders are trying to keep Miss America relevant.And, she noted, the news would no doubt bring contestants a measure of relief. \u201cThere\u2019s something to be said about not having to think about walking across a stage in a bikini,\u201d she said.Beth Knox, executive director of the Miss North Carolina Scholarship Pageant, said that she was thrilled at the development: A woman\u2019s goals and aspirations were far more important than how she looked in a swimsuit.\u201cIf people really listen with an open mind to the reason this change is being implemented, I just do not see how anyone could not support this improvement,\u201d Ms. Knox wrote in an email.Miss America is one of two major pageants in the United States. The other, Miss USA, was founded in the early 1950s by a swimsuit company after Miss America would not allow the company to use pictures of its contestants for advertising. Miss USA also operates Miss Teen USA and is part of Miss Universe, the international pageant that Donald J. Trump owned from 1996 to 2015.Officials at the Miss Universe Organization did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment on Tuesday about whether they would also end the swimsuit competition.Miss America and Miss USA have long positioned themselves as different pageants. Miss USA is a for-profit show-business enterprise focused on beauty and whose contestants typically reveal more skin and do not have to perform a talent. Miss America is a nonprofit, volunteer-run organization with affiliates in 50 states and in the District of Columbia.\u201cWe are not stupid,\u201d Leonard Horn, the organization\u2019s chief executive, said in 1993. \u201cWe are very sensitive to the fact that the swimsuit competition has always been our Achilles\u2019 heel. The swimsuit competition has been controversial since the early 1920s, but it\u2019s been retained because the majority of the people like it.\u201d\u201cWe firmly support this change,\u201d said Stephen Quinn, the chairman of the initiative and the former marketing chief of Walmart. \u201cIt is important and consistent with #SeeHer\u2019s mission to increase the accurate portrayal of women in media.\u201dLast year, 5.6 million viewers watched \u201cThe Miss America Competition\u201d on ABC, down 10 percent from 6.2 million in 2016 and seven million in 2015. But many live shows have experienced similar ratings declines, including \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d the Olympics, the Oscars and the Grammys.Ms. Carlson said Tuesday that viewers\u2019 opinions had changed. The swimsuit portion of the competition was \u201cnot a highly rated part,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople actually like the talent part of the competition,\u201d she said.Get what you need to start your day.

{"Headline": "Chardonnay, the Oregon Way", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of the TimesAfter years of focusing primarily on pinot noir, winemakers in the Willamette Valley have turned their attention to chardonnay with excellent results.Last summer in the Willamette Valley, I had the chance to ask a renowned Burgundy producer, whose Meursaults are some of the greatest wines made of chardonnay in the world, why Oregon\u2019s chardonnays had improved so dramatically over the last decade or so.While it may not be possible to quantify the effect that Mr. Lafon and other Burgundian winemakers have had on Willamette wine production, the question remains: Why have Oregon chardonnays improved so much?One reason is that Willamette producers have taken chardonnay increasingly seriously on its own terms.Since Oregon emerged as an important wine producer in the 1970s, pinot noir has been the dominant narrative in the Willamette Valley. All else was an afterthought.But the region needed a white. Some tried pinot gris, but few took it very seriously. Chardonnay was grown as well, but it never made much of a positive impression. Growers planted it in land that remained after planting pinot noir, or in places that were good for pinot noir but not necessarily for chardonnay. Winemakers tried to imitate the oaky, florid style then popular in California, or they tried to make Burgundy.Mr. Bergstr\u00f6m\u2019s assessment was borne out in our tasting. Acidity in all its guises was the dominant impression of these wines, mostly for better but occasionally for worse.In the best versions, acidity was felt as a sense of liveliness, energy, tension or thrust. It gave the wine momentum and vibrancy, allowing it to refresh, while showing other characteristics like flavors of herbs and flowers or discernible minerality.In some cases, as Jason pointed out, the wines seemed to have too much acidity, as if the grapes had been harvested too early. It was a sign, perhaps, that as Americans over the last decade have gravitated to leaner, less flamboyant wines with greater acidity, some producers might be trying a little too hard to give them what they want.The most successful wines seemed rich enough to accommodate the natural acidity without being dominated by it, Christy said. They were also marked by the graceful integration of oak flavors. Some of the wines that did not make our top 10 were clumsily oaky.Our second pick was the 2015 Willamette Valley from Adelsheim, one of the pioneers of the modern Oregon wine industry. The chardonnay was tense, well-balanced and savory \u2014 not a complicated wine, but a satisfying one. And, at $22, it was also our best value. Rounding out the top echelon was the 2015 Ribbon Ridge Cascadia from Brick House, lively and stony, with flavors of herbs and lemon.In the fourth spot was the 2015 Cuv\u00e9e Lunatique from J. Christopher, a producer whose main focus is on single-vineyard pinot noirs. As the name indicates, it is an unpretentious wine, just $17 and intended to be fresh, vibrant and uncomplicated. Needless to say, it succeeds quite well.We also very much liked the tightly coiled, herbal 2016 Stoller from the Dundee Hills, the floral 2014 Lemelson Reserve and the rich, well-textured 2015 Morgen Long Yamhill Vineyards from the Yamhill-Carlton district.We also did not have bottles from some of Oregon\u2019s earliest and still best producers, like Eyrie and Bethel Heights. Several, though not all, of our top 10 wines were entry-level bottles. The point is that our list does not suggest that our favorites are the best Oregon chardonnays. They were simply our favorite bottles in a representative tasting, indicating Oregon\u2019s direction with the grape.In our estimation, this is a direction worth following. The best wines we tasted were still tightly wrapped, as if they were keeping something in reserve that would be revealed with time. I feel that same sense of anticipation with Oregon chardonnay in general. Lively and energetic, rich but nimble, with flavors of herbs, nuts and citrus.Tense, deep and well balanced, with lingering, savory, saline flavors.Lively and well integrated, with flavors of herbs, lemon and stony minerality.Lively, yet subtle and textured, with aromas of flowers and apples.Fresh, lean and lip-smacking, with tightly coiled minerality and flavors of herbs and citrus.Rich and well balanced, with floral aromas and flavors of herbs and citrus.A touch of oak, but rich, deep and well textured.Rich and energetic, with depth and presence, but a bit straightforward.Floral and lemony, with rippling acidity.Lively and floral, with modest mineral and citrus flavors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Harpoon-Like Appendages, Bacteria \u2018Fish\u2019 for New DNA", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeeing how microbes snatch new genetic material from their environment could help in the fight against antibiotic resistance.Two bacteria are sitting near free-floating DNA. Suddenly, one bacterium shoots out a long appendage, latches onto a DNA fragment and reels in its catch. It happens fast, but it\u2019s clear: this organism had just gone fishing. Biologists at Indiana University recently captured this maneuver on camera for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to actually see this in action,\u201d she said.Natural transformation is one example, and it\u2019s an important way in which bacteria, which typically reproduce asexually, introduce variation and new traits into their genetic code, said Ankur Dalia, an assistant professor of biology and an author of the new paper.The process has mesmerized biologists since 1928, when a British bacteriologist named Frederick Griffith stumbled across it while searching for a pneumonia vaccine.To his amazement, he discovered that if he injected a heat-killed, virulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by a live, nonvirulent strain, bacteria that were normally innocuous would somehow become pathogenic. A \u201ctransforming principle\u201d had to be at play, he declared. When bacteria die, their DNA becomes up for grabs by other microbes. Often, this process is bad news for humans. Through natural transformation, bacteria can gain the ability to degrade compounds like pesticides, become better at infecting hosts and evolve antibiotic resistance.In the wild, V. cholerae engage in natural transformation when they land on a piece of chitin, a major ingredient in insect and crustacean shells, and a rich source of nutrients.\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the kind of environment other bacteria would be latching onto,\u201d and therefore a good site for DNA swapping, Dr. Dalia said. When the researchers induced this behavior in the lab, they were able to discern new details about how V. cholerae latch onto DNA at the tip of their pili, fold and thread the DNA through a tiny surface pore and then pull it into their bodies using a special ratcheting mechanism.Pili in V. cholerae can stretch about as far as the length of the bacteria. The organisms make one or two pili a minute, extending and retracting the appendages with proteins that quickly build the pili up and then tear them back down. The study is a reminder that even single-celled organisms can operate in sophisticated ways.These bacteria are actually acting \u201clike fishermen,\u201d Ms. Ellison said.Her team believes many aspects of this maneuver are shared among other microbes, though more studies are needed. Eventually, the work could lead to new strategies for fighting antibiotic resistance. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Still the Boss of Le Bernardin, Maguy Le Coze Strides On", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "Five decades after her first restaurant in Paris, she has retreated from the dining room but remains a fast-moving force, worrying every detail.Supported byShe grew up in a modest hotel run by her parents in a French seaport village, sharing a room with her younger brother. Her father cooked, her mother oversaw the dining room, and Maguy Le Coze was waiting tables by the time she was 12, a serious child who forever remained that way.The two children attended separate elementary schools in Port Navalo \u2014 Gilbert the one for boys, Maguy the one for girls. There was another difference: \u201cI would do my homework,\u201d she said. \u201cMy brother never did his. I always tried to do the right thing, to learn.\u201dHer career path, as a woman born into an unassuming French restaurant family, seemed predestined: tending to customers while her man cooked for them. The chef, even behind kitchen doors, was the face of the restaurant. The dutiful woman rarely looked beyond the front door.Secure in her position and her accomplishments, she is hesitant only to admit her age, worried about the reaction of the staff. \u201cWhen they see I am 73, they will say the boss is old,\u201d Ms. Le Coze said.They will not, of course, say anything of the sort, not to a woman so regal, so formidable, so unbending \u2014 and so charming when she chooses to be. If Eric Ripert, the chef and other owner of Le Bernardin, is the face of the restaurant and its ambassador, she is its queen. Decades ago her role was to pamper guests; these days she is more often laboring over ledgers in the underground offices.Mr. Ripert calls her \u201cthe soul, the spirit and\u201d \u2014 he smiled \u2014 \u201cthe boss of Le Bernardin.\u201dYet Ms. Le Coze\u2019s name is not widely known, except among her peers. Mr. Ripert calls her \u201cthe most underrated, ultrasuccessful woman in the restaurant world.\u201dIf fame has eluded her, the rewards of her success have been numerous: a L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur from France, the home on Mustique, apartments in New York and Paris, the house where she grew up in Brittany.She met this boyfriend 35 years ago in Saint-Tropez, but had no further contact until he phoned her at Le Bernardin 10 years ago. She wasn\u2019t there. They met shortly afterward for dinner in Paris. She didn\u2019t see him for another two years, when they happened to be waiting at adjoining gates at Newark Liberty International Airport. They reconnected. Who says flying has lost its romance?\u201cMy life has been strange,\u201d Ms. Le Coze allowed.When she was 15 and brought boyfriends home to meet her parents, \u201cI told them I have a boyfriend and that\u2019s it. At 18 I said to them, \u2018I will not get married, I will not have children, I will have lovers.\u2019 My parents thought they had a very unusual daughter.\u201dThe reason, she says, was the infidelities of the men in her life: \u201cMy father cheated on my mother. My brother had so many women.\u201dHer lifelong passion, it would seem, was none of the men in her life, but her beloved restaurant.She thinks it\u2019s more than that. \u201cIt is not possible to have passion for 30 or 40 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is something you have for four or five years. It is the same with the restaurant as it is with a man you meet. After passion comes love.\u201dShe never aspired to be a cook, and could not have become one even if that had been her dream. \u201cI am a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only thing I can do is steam vegetables.\u201dMs. Le Coze was, in the early years of Le Bernardin, a constant and striking presence in the dining room, poised and perfect, attired in Chanel outfits, earrings, bracelets and necklaces. She daringly broke with the prescribed dining room etiquette of the era by perching on the arm of a chair across from her customers, extolling sea-urchin butter poured over raw sea urchins, or sea scallops still alive in their shell, awaiting the stove.These days she prefers to remain in the background. She is primarily the financial overseer of the restaurant and, as always, remains obsessed with orderliness and quality control. She often works from her home office on Mustique, but when she is in New York she is known to spend 18 hours a day at her desk.Ms. Le Coze said running a restaurant is two-thirds about business, one-third about the kitchen. Then she reconsidered, conceding that the kitchen of a culinary landmark like Le Bernardin deserves more credit. Surprisingly, Mr. Ripert agreed with this uneven division: \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s 60-40, and she gets the 60. An expensive restaurant is very complex to run. If it is only about the food, you can go to a food truck.\u201dHaving said that, Mr. Ripert happily proceeded to catalog his partner\u2019s idiosyncrasies. He walked around the conference room of Le Bernardin, pointing out untidy piles of books, guides and plaques that had accumulated while she was in Mustique.He shook his head. \u201cI guarantee this is not going to fly,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s very particular about how she wants Le Bernardin to be run. When she\u2019s been traveling for a week, she comes into the office, looks for shoes under desks, plastic knives and forks in drawers. It drives her crazy. She\u2019s very neat. Everything has to be a certain way.\u201dSomewhat in admiration but more in wonder, he praised her uncanny ability to stumble upon the unseemly or inappropriate. \u201cShe sees everything,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, she has a sixth sense. If we are at a meeting, looking at a contract, she for some reason will open to the right page, see when something is wrong. If there is a mistake, she finds it.\u201cIf she is eating, she will always choose the dish that is not the best. Bingo, she orders it. If she goes into the bathroom, it will be right after a client throws paper on the floor. She always arrives at the moment when something is wrong. I don\u2019t know how she does it.\u201dMs. Le Coze is also a woman of rigorous self-discipline, dedicated to physical fitness. She keeps dumbbells in her office on Mustique, and works out every day, there or in a local gym. She walks daily for at least an hour, except in New York, where she never has enough time, so she compensates with two-hour strolls through Central Park on spring and summer weekends. She does not suffer the slow-footed gladly.\u201cWhen we walk, I am always slowing to look at things,\u201d said one of her best friends, Marianne Tesler, who runs marathons. \u201cShe walks with determination, says to me, \u2018Ahh, you\u2019re too slow.\u2019\u201dMr. Ripert claims to be a faster walker, but concedes he cannot swim with her. \u201cIn 10 minutes she is so far ahead I give up and go on the beach,\u201d he said. Trying to walk to an airport gate with her is futile: \u201cIn an airport she walks at the speed of light.\u201dBorn 18 months before her brother, Ms. Le Coze was the boss of an inseparable childhood partnership, until he turned 14 and took over. They left for Paris in 1964, after high school. \u201cWhen I was 21 I had just one thing in mind, having fun,\u201d she said. \u201cI left Brittany for the life I didn\u2019t have with my parents.\u201dIn Paris she worked as a model at a fashion house, posing in the latest designs for customers. She was tall enough at 5-foot-7 to become a runway model, but lacked the self-confidence.\u201cI was beautiful,\u201d Ms. Le Coze recalled. \u201cbut I was too shy to go to the big names in the fashion industry, intending to do the big shows.\u201d Gilbert worked for a hairdresser, fetching sandwiches, moving cars and making more money in tips than she made modeling.They returned to Brittany in summers to help their parents operate the hotel. Asked what she learned about business from them, she emphatically replied, \u201cNothing! My brother and I learned nothing from our parents.\u201cWhen we opened our first Le Bernardin in Paris in 1972, we did not even know how to count. We had no education in how to run a restaurant. You do not learn from cooking in the kitchen with your father, as Gilbert did, or working in the dining room with your mother, as I did. After two years, we were almost bankrupt.\u201dThe place received a fine review from Minute, a weekly newspaper with a circulation of 250,000. Believing that this guaranteed success, the Le Cozes started having the fun they had promised themselves. Soon they got a second review, \u201ca disaster,\u201d she said, from the influential Le Monde.What made it worse, she recalled, was that the critic republished his views under different names in six or seven other newspapers and magazines. The Gault & Millau guide added to the onslaught, awarding them a score of eight out of 20, a devastatingly poor rating. She recalls one line in that review: \u201cSend them back to the end of the quai.\u201dThe Le Cozes returned from the fish market one morning and saw a sign on the restaurant window offering the contents for sale: They had failed to pay their taxes, and the government stepped in.\u201cWe used the money we made in the summer working for our parents to pay the taxes, little by little,\u201d Ms. Le Coze said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when we started to change.\u201dMr. Le Coze redid the menu, his uncomplicated but thoughtful cooking aided by the growing popularity of nouvelle cuisine. A consultant taught Ms. Le Coze how to control costs. They began weighing the fish that arrived from the market rather than simply paying whatever was asked.Ms. Le Coze claims to have been entirely different during those Paris days \u2014 going out to nightclubs, dancing on tables and banquettes. Her lifestyle would have stunned the staff of today\u2019s Le Bernardin, she said. \u201cThis is the Maguy you do not know.\u201dIn August, when the restaurant and the rest of Paris closed, she would go to Saint-Tropez while her brother went home to Brittany. She dressed in cowboy boots and short shorts. \u201cThat was my license one month a year to go crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I came back to Paris in September and a customer would say to me, \u2018We saw you in Saint-Tropez,\u2019 I would say, \u2018No, you must be wrong.\u2019 When I am back in Paris, I am running the restaurant and I am different.\u201dEventually, she and her brother moved Le Bernardin to a bigger space near the Arc de Triomphe and earned two Michelin stars. Yet Ms. Le Coze remained fascinated by the idea of a restaurant in New York, which she had visited twice in the 1970s. \u201cTo me it was a vision, a spiritual thing, if you believe in those things,\u201d she said.Mr. Le Coze died in an ambulance of a heart attack suffered while working out at a health club. He was 49.Getting Ms. Le Coze to speak about him is difficult; getting her to express her feelings after his death is impossible. Friends say she never totally recovered from the shock.She recalled, more sad than angry, \u201cAfter Gilbert died, every other restaurant tried to take people from us.

That\u2019s understandable: The change brings together issues of segregation, inequality, class and privilege \u2014 not to mention the future of our city\u2019s children.But as important as this story is, it\u2019s also complicated. Here\u2019s a quick explanation of the proposed changes and the controversy surrounding them.What\u2019s the new plan?Why is he doing this?So what\u2019s the problem with the plan?Some say the plan to add more diversity would actually discriminate against a minority group: Asian-Americans. By adding more black and Hispanic students to the schools, the number of Asian-American students would necessarily decrease. Kenneth Chiu, president of the New York City Asian-American Democratic Club, called the plan discriminatory. And Peter Koo, a city councilman, said the test, as it exists now, is \u201cthe most unbiased way to get into a school.\u201dIs there more to the plan?Yes. While the admissions test remains, Mr. de Blasio has set aside 20 percent of the seats at the specialized schools for low-income students who score just below the cutoff.What does the research say about the plan?It\u2019s mixed. A study at New York University examined six plans to diversify the schools. Taking students from all middle schools was the only plan that had a big effect on demographics. It also found that it would lower academic performance among admitted students. Another study by the Community Service Society did not find a drop in performance.What\u2019s next?The first part of the mayor\u2019s plan, reserving seats for low-income students, has been put in place and will affect students applying for fall 2019. Eliminating the test entirely would require approval from the State Legislature and, so far, they haven\u2019t budged.Here\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019re looking forward to recess today.Arts and crafts should be held inside this afternoon \u2014 it\u2019s looking gusty.The Bronx has the Yankees, Queens has the Mets and Staten Island has \u2026 the Pizza Rats.Two years ago, the Staten Island Yankees asked fans to pick a new name for the team.The voting was done online, and the Yankees learned the hard way what happens when you crowdsource names on the internet.Still, two years after his fair-and-square victory, we\u2019re glad Pizza Rat is finally getting his piece of the pie.Advertisement"}

So this month we will drink a red that enjoys a light chill, a necessity perhaps in July.Reds like frappato have gained popularity in recent years as consumers have come to appreciate wines that rely on freshness rather than power. Twenty-five years ago it was an entirely different story, as producers in Sicily were betting on international varieties like merlot and cabernet, but tastes have evolved. Nowadays, consumers are far more interested in indigenous grapes like frappato than those grown everywhere else in the world.The three wines I recommend are:As is so often the case, you may not be able to find these wines, which are made in limited quantities. It\u2019s a small region, so the selection is not vast, but here are some alternatives: Tami, Manenti, Planeta, Vino Lauria, Bellus, Biscaris and Lamoresca, which is technically not within the confines of Vittoria but is close enough.I realize that looking for small-production wines can be frustrating, yet they are almost always worth seeking out. The alternative \u2014 recommending mass-produced bottles \u2014 results in either a limited number of subjects endlessly repeated or wines that generally do not show a genre\u2019s potential.Don\u2019t worry about the vintage. Both 2015s and \u201916s will be good choices.Advertisement"}

(Unless it stinks.)But on a recent drizzly morning in City Hall Park, inhaling, exhaling, wheezing, huffing and hissing could be heard, even over the clamor of construction and traffic that swirled around the park.The amplified sounds of respiration were being pumped through six speakers installed on lampposts by the artist Sari Carel, 43, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.Ms. Carel\u2019s art generally explores extinct sounds \u2014 she recently dug through archives looking for the calls of vanished animals like the Kauai oo (\u201ca bird with the most beautiful, plaintive song\u201d) and the golden toad (with its \u201cresonant click\u201d), and for recordings of bygone technologies like the phonautograph (the earliest device for recording sound). But for this installation, she captured sounds of life: the breathing of 24 New Yorkers.\u201cThere\u2019s such a variety of breaths; no two are the same,\u201d said Ms. Carel, whose artwork highlights respiratory diseases brought on by poor air quality. \u201cWe incorporated a lot of sounds of people who have serious lung illnesses, and you can hear them clearly \u2014 they sound very different.\u201dWe listened together.\u201cThat\u2019s C.O.P.D.,\u201d Ms. Carel said, referring to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, when a wheezing sound came over the speakers. \u201cEmphysema,\u201d she said, when we heard what sounded like Darth Vader. (The sounds, she added, were altered and edited.)To find living, breathing New Yorkers, Ms. Carel asked for volunteers from respiratory wellness support groups, health programs and yoga classes. She had an instructor give a group class on optimal breathing techniques before recording her subjects at Concord Music in Greenwich Village.\u201cI now notice when people are not exhaling completely,\u201d said Jo Ann Wasserman, 49, of Downtown Brooklyn, who heard about the project in her Pilates class.

{"Headline": "A Small Slice of Versailles", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe culture of the French court inspires two apricot desserts: one elaborate, the other more attainable. People tend to belong to one of two opposite camps: those who like their food to impress and surprise and those who want it to comfort and delight. These days, I find myself steadily drifting from the contrived faction to the comfort camp. This, I suspect, has to do with age and a certain wish to reconnect with my childhood.These elaborate edifices, and the popular association of pre-Revolution decadence with Marie Antoinette and her famous cakes, made it almost inevitable that I should choose confections to capture the spirit of Versailles. Now, as it was back then, it is often the p\u00e2tissiers who push the boundaries of cooking through all kinds of technical and artistic inventions.The two desserts featured here are loosely inspired by that period. Apricots, and stone fruit in general, were highly regarded and often set into those impressive pyramids. Poaching and cooking down fruit was particularly popular, as was combining it with nuts \u2014 almonds and pistachios are prominent \u2014 and orange blossom water.The tart, which is as far as I could have taken the spirit of Versailles and still expect mere mortals to actually make, also features marzipan, both a luxury then and a staple in the hands of high-end pastry chefs. On top of the tart there is a layer of cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, one of a variety of cooked creams that were gaining popularity in the 18th century.For those who prefer more casual comfort, my pared-back dessert \u2014 poached apricots with pistachio and amaretto mascarpone \u2014 echoes all these flavors, but without all the hard work.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We Cover High Fashion", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Times\u2019s fashion director and chief fashion critic reflects on what makes haute couture relevant.When people ask me why I like covering fashion, one of my answers (and I have a couple) is always that clothes are one of the very few universal subjects: Everyone has to think about food, shelter and what they put on their bodies. Even nudists think about what they wear \u2014 they just reject the idea of wearing anything.That\u2019s why, as Harold Koda, the former curator of the Met\u2019s Costume Institute once told me, the decibel levels are measurably higher at a fashion exhibition than at any other show the museum puts on. Everyone feels entitled to have an opinion.But there are, unquestionably, parts of the clothes conversation that are less accessible than others. Most notably, the haute couture. The what?Exactly.To qualify as a couture house, which is an official designation like champagne, a brand must maintain an atelier of a certain number of artisans full time and produce a specific number of garments twice a year for a show. There are only a very few that can fulfill the requirements, including Chanel, Dior and Valentino. A lot have dropped out over the years (Balmain, Versace, Saint Laurent), and the governing organization that adjudicates this has relaxed some of its rules to admit younger, less resourced or guest designers, like Iris van Herpen and Guo Pei, who made Rihanna\u2019s Met Gala sunny-side-up egg cape.Sounds like the ultimate let-them-eat-cake event, right? In a world struggling with income inequality, riven by tides of immigration and deep social divisions, where streetwear is on the rise, why cover it at all?The usual answer from most fashion people, and brands, for that matter, is it\u2019s \u201cthe dream\u201d: the ultimate escapist fantasy. But that always struck me as weird, especially now. Don\u2019t know about you, but it was never my dream to wear a giant ball gown and run through the Hall of Mirrors.And it\u2019s not the \u201cDevil Wears Prada\u201d argument, though that does hold true: In a world where everything goes into the Instagram soup and from there seeps into the cultural digestive system, what might appear on a runway in the Mus\u00e9e Rodin (where Dior holds its shows) in July will affect what H&M does in August.For me, it\u2019s never been about imagining myself in the clothes, or even being able to buy the clothes, any more than watching great sports is about being able to play soccer like Lionel Messi.It\u2019s about using this particular craft form as a wormhole into what\u2019s going on in the world. The gowns themselves may not seem that relevant (especially when they reimagine a woman as, say, a lavender bush). But the issues they raise are.Like, for example, the fact that to a certain extent any women\u2019s wear collection, at any level, should be a treatise on female identity at that particular moment in time. At least if it\u2019s any good. That\u2019s why Karl Lagerfeld made his Chanel bride wear the pants last January, not the corseted meringue; why at Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri paid homage to Leonor Fini, an early 20th century Surrealist (I don\u2019t think anyone would dispute the surreal nature of our current era); why at Givenchy, Clare Waight Keller protected gowns dripping in silver fringe with military greatcoats.Like the fact that the mostly French gatekeepers of couture, the most rigid of fashion sectors, have increasingly lowered barriers to entry to woo and admit designers from China, Lebanon and Russia. Fashion is acknowledging the value of porous borders, even as its Western European home grows more skittish about them.Like the fact that this is as good a way as any to talk about the current tension between the handmade and human (and historical) and the technological. It\u2019s the fashion equivalent of reading books versus watching YouTube.After all, these are all garments created entirely by hand (except in the case of Iris van Herpen, who tends to 3D print a lot of her materials), as part of a long tradition. Last season at Valentino, the designer Pierpaolo Piccioli named every dress after the person who made it, practically fetishizing the artisan in the face of \u2026 well, Facebook.Sound familiar? Though if you\u2019re still wondering what this has to do with you, I\u2019ll leave you with two words: Melania Trump.She wore Chanel couture to the French state dinner. And all those gilded pigeons suddenly came home to roost.Advertisement"}

New Caledonian crows are known for their toolmaking, but Alex Taylor and his colleagues wanted to understand just how advanced they could be.\u201cThey are head and shoulders above almost every other avian subjects\u201d at toolmaking, said Irene Pepperberg, an avian cognition expert and research associate in Harvard University\u2019s department of psychology. \u201cThese crows are just amazing.\u201d \u201cCould they look at a tool and just based on mental image of the tool \u2014 can they recreate that tool design?\u201d Dr. Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we set out to test, and that\u2019s what our results show.\u201d  In a series of steps, the researchers taught the birds to feed pieces of paper into a mock vending machine to earn food rewards. The scientists chose a task that was similar enough to something the animals do in the wild \u2014 while also brand new. The birds had never seen card stock before, but learned how to rip it into big or little shapes after being shown they would get a reward for the appropriate size. The template used to show the birds the right size of paper was not available to them when they made their \u201ctools,\u201d yet the crows were able to use their beaks to tear off bits of paper, which they sometimes held between their feet for leverage. \u201cThis would seem to be experiment one in a series of other experiments,\u201d she said. \u201cThe birds really did show an interesting inference, but they were led down the garden path.\u201d Just before asking the crows to rip the paper into the right size, the researchers showed them exactly what size paper would earn them a reward. \u201cThe fact that they choose to make a small piece of paper, for example, is interesting,\u201d Dr. Pepperberg said. \u201cBut it would be a lot more interesting if they hadn\u2019t seen it and been rewarded 30 seconds before they had to do it.\u201d Dr. Marzluff said that there was always more research to be done, but that he was comfortable with the group\u2019s conclusions that such thinking occurs.

Within hours the road was reopened to traffic.Mr. Parr had been buried alive.His performance, \u201cUnderneath the Bitumen The Artist,\u201d is part of Dark Mofo, an annual arts festival in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania. Mr. Parr will remain underground for 72 hours, and if all goes according to plan he will emerge on Sunday night.Mr. Parr, 73, is no stranger to extreme acts. He has sewn his lips together to highlight Australia\u2019s treatment of asylum seekers, nailed his arm to a wall and spent 10 days in a glass cage with only water for sustenance.This week\u2019s performance also carries a political message, honoring the hardships of the early convicts brought to Tasmania and the Indigenous people slaughtered here. It symbolizes, too, the burying of Aboriginal history, particularly the Black War, a 19th-century conflict fought between British settlers and Indigenous Tasmanians, who were virtually wiped out.The stunt has stirred debate, but not the expected one. The island\u2019s Aboriginal residents are divided on whether a white artist, like Mr. Parr, has the right to co-opt Aboriginal history and tell their stories.Michael Mansell, 67, a Tasmanian Aboriginal activist, came with his daughter and granddaughter to see Mr. Parr being buried and lend his support.\u201cFor 200 years the majority of the population buried the truth,\u201d Mr. Mansell said. \u201cThis man is only being buried for three days.\u201d\u201cWe support this bloke,\u201d he said of Mr. Parr, calling him a \u201ccourageous man.\u201dBut others were not as encouraging.Heather Sculthorpe, chief executive of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Center, called the work an \u201cinsult.\u201d\u201cThe idea of our Aboriginal history being hidden from most of Tasmania is a valid point,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most effective way of bringing it out is not climbing under the road. It doesn\u2019t do anything to promote understanding of Aboriginal history.\u201dFurthermore, she said, Mr. Parr did not consult with Aboriginal Tasmanians about the performance. \u201cIt\u2019s when people feel used as objects and not part of the venture that people get annoyed \u2014 as in this case,\u201d she said. \u201cNo attempt was made to discuss it.\u201dMr. Parr said last week in an interview at his studio that he could not be an independent artist if he needed to always ask permission for his work.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to start consulting with people in order to do an artwork, how does that end?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s not responsible political art. It\u2019s populist. You\u2019re trying to be all things for all people.\u201dMr. Parr\u2019s said his vanishing act was designed to tap into our deepest anxieties. Inspired by Kazimir Malevich\u2019s painting \u201cBlack Square,\u201d the performance, Mr. Parr said, was about \u201cthe null of the image.\u201dOn Thursday night, a palpable tension filled the crowd of more than 3,000 people. \u201cI feel sick,\u201d whispered one man as Mr. Parr prepared to be entombed. \u201cI wonder what insurance company he\u2019s with,\u201d another joked nervously.Inside the box, which Leigh Carmichael, Dark Mofo\u2019s creative director, called a \u201ctorture pen,\u201d Mr. Parr has a bed, waste bucket, sketch pad, pencils and a copy of \u201cThe Fatal Shore,\u201d a history of Australia.Fresh air is being pumped in from the surface, and a microphone in the box allows Mr. Parr\u2019s team to track his breathing.\u201cThis is not a magic trick,\u201d said the work\u2019s curator, Jarrod Rawlins. \u201cThere is no trap door ready for him to slide out when he\u2019d had enough.\u201dWith next to no marketing and no sign on the site, the road was reopened to traffic within hours of the burial. Many will drive along Macquarie Street past Hobart\u2019s colonial-era Town Hall, oblivious to the fact that Mr. Parr is interred alive beneath them.\u201cUnderneath the Bitumen,\u201d an Australian term for asphalt, was primarily funded by David Walsh, the millionaire founder of Hobart\u2019s avant-garde Museum of Old and New Art. The arts organization Detached also contributed.When Mr. Parr is exhumed on Sunday evening, his steel prison will be filled with concrete and the road resealed.\u201cEveryone goes back to driving in oblivion while talking on their iPhones, and underneath the bitumen there\u2019s this block,\u201d Mr. Parr said Wednesday, standing on the roadside before his burial.And if he doesn\u2019t make it out? \u201cI haven\u2019t thought of that,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cNo, no, no, I\u2019m coming out definitely.

We started dating in high school and have been together, through college, for seven years. We never dated anyone else. Lately, she (but usually her parents) hints about taking things to \u201cthe next level.\u201d I love her, but I\u2019m not ready to live together or get married. And to be totally honest, what I\u2019d really like is more experience with life and dating other women before committing to anyone. But I don\u2019t see how I can do that without hurting her and wrecking our relationship. Do you?ANONYMOUSIt\u2019s such a drag when good relationships hit the brick wall of bad timing. You and your girlfriend were just kids when you met, and you\u2019re still very young. It\u2019s a credit to you both that you worked through all the issues from junior prom to young adulthood. That\u2019s commitment! I find myself wishing that you\u2019d taken a break during college, or met five years later, because I hate to give you the advice I\u2019m about to give: You have to be honest with your girlfriend about your misgivings.My reticence comes with a gut feeling that honesty may spell the end of your relationship. Your desire for more life experience is totally reasonable. It\u2019s a part of growing up! And feeling trapped at 23 is not a good look. True freedom to explore probably rules out a separation of agreed duration or opening your relationship to other partners. Free means free \u2014 which may have sad consequences here.But the only way to figure this out is to discuss it with your girlfriend: \u201cHoney, I love you, but I think we need time to be adults on our own \u2014 and possibly see other people.\u201d She may be extremely hurt or angry. Be patient. Remember: You\u2019ve been grappling with this question; perhaps she hasn\u2019t. You may come to an understanding or decide to call it quits (for now). But don\u2019t prolong your discomfort. Handle this as directly and lovingly as you\u2019ve cared for each other over the past seven years.I have lunch with a group of ladies once a month. The last time, I said jokingly: \u201cMy husband doesn\u2019t think I look a day over 55.\u201d (I\u2019m 88.) To which one of the women replied: \u201cYour husband must be blind!\u201d I was so taken aback that I will never return to the group. What do you make of this?ANONYMOUSI think you and your pal were reaching for the same joke: that 88 might somehow look like 55 \u2014 only yours was sly, and hers was blunt. Still, I get your umbrage. It\u2019s one thing to be self-deprecating and another to feel deprecated. But why rob yourself of the pleasure of these lunch parties over one bum joke? Life is long, as you know. So, shrug this off or take your revenge in good time (over a nice Cobb salad).My husband\u2019s niece asked him to officiate at her marriage a year ago. It\u2019s being held at a popular tourist destination. We told her we\u2019d be delighted to fly out and that we were renting a house with our adult children and grandchildren (ages 10, 12 and 14). The kids even told our niece they were coaching their grandfather on what to say at the wedding. When the invitations came, no children were invited! The bride said they couldn\u2019t accommodate them. So, we canceled the rental house at a loss of $1,600. The children\u2019s father will stay home with them; his wife will go to the wedding, as will my husband (reluctantly). But I refuse to go. We should have been told about the children much sooner. Thoughts?ANONYMOUSThe din of your foot stomping and harrumphing has caused you to miscalculate: You are throwing away a lovely family vacation at a \u201cpopular tourist destination\u201d \u2014 I see an ocean or the Grand Canyon \u2014 in a fit of pique over your grandkids\u2019 exclusion from a rubber chicken dinner they probably wouldn\u2019t enjoy anyway. (Their father could splash in the pool with them at the rental house during the wedding.)This was just a misunderstanding. Brides have more on their minds than other people\u2019s grandchildren. And making an exception for yours would probably rub other guests with children the wrong way. So, now you\u2019re losing out on $1,600 and, more important, the fun and memories of a vacation with your young grandchildren. If there\u2019s time to retrench, do it!I\u2019ve lost 66 pounds on a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that requires me to eat several small meals during the day. Often, I go to McDonald\u2019s and order a burger. I don\u2019t eat the buns, but hate to throw them away. So I toss them onto grassy areas along the road for birds to feast on. My friend objects. You?ERICCongratulations on your weight loss! But bun tossing is littering, and more likely to attract rodents than feed birds. Try ordering your burgers without buns. If McDonald\u2019s won\u2019t accommodate you, I bet one of its competitors will. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is America Ready to Love Cottage Cheese Again?", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "After languishing in yogurt\u2019s shadow for decades, cottage cheese is back, sporting new flavors and small-batch appeal.Supported byAmerica loves a comeback, though, and there are plenty of people who are betting that cottage cheese is primed for one.This time, with help from both big food companies and small-batch cheese makers, it might actually work.On the mass-market side of the equation, the nation\u2019s largest dairy producers are targeting younger people looking for a protein-rich, natural snack they can eat instead of a meal. (Cottage cheese can have twice the protein of some yogurts, though it has a lot more sodium.)The goal, according to industry analysts, is to \u201cuncottage\u201d cottage cheese \u2014 or, as one dairy executive put it, \u201cChobani it.\u201dBut the road back is not going to be easy. Yogurt outsells cottage cheese by roughly eight to one, said John Owen, a senior food and drink analyst who prepared the annual cheese report for Mintel, a market research company. Even though yogurt sales have started to flatten, American shoppers still bought $8.5 billion worth in 2017. \u201cYogurt got adopted by big food in the way cottage cheese never did,\u201d he said.Mr. Kauffman, like many people, has let cottage cheese fall out of rotation: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those foods I don\u2019t eat, but I feel like I should.\u201dBy the mid-1970s, the golden era of cottage cheese, producers in every state were pumping out more than a billion pounds a year. Yogurt was still considered a weird, sour interloper reserved for European expatriates and health nuts.Mr. Potter thinks salvation won\u2019t come at the hands of Big Cottage Cheese. Mass production, he said, is part of what killed it in the first place.By the 1980s, large corporations had absorbed most regional dairies, and much of the nation\u2019s cottage cheese had become a flat-tasting, low-fat commodity with rubbery curds stabilized with starches and gums.\u201cReally good cottage cheese is a hard product to make that doesn\u2019t take well to automation,\u201d Mr. Potter said. Unlike yogurt, which is a matter of adding a culture to milk and waiting for it to thicken up, cottage cheese is one of those foods that is deceptively simple to produce but difficult to do well. It\u2019s like making really good scrambled eggs, but takes hours. You have to take it low and slow.\u201cGood cottage cheese takes a little craftsmanship,\u201d said Mr. Potter, of the Dairy Connection.In the 1990s, Ms. Conley learned to make cottage cheese from Mr. Potter. It was the one of the first cheeses she and Ms. Smith produced when they opened their original creamery in Point Reyes Station, Calif., in 1997.Overnight, luscious, tender curds slowly form. In the morning, cheese makers cut them into pieces no bigger than peas. They cook and stir the curds for about an hour and a half to release some of their acidity. Then the cheese makers drain the whey and wash the curds three times.The last step is the dressing, which is the term for milk or cream that is added to the curds to make them creamy. The dressing determines the fat content of cottage cheese, and is where most of the flavor lies. Ms. Conley suggests eating it the way cheese makers do after they finish a batch: Rip open a bag of barbecue-flavored potato chips and use it like a dip.\u201cI abandoned cottage cheese when I left home,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTasting Cowgirl Creamery\u2019s superb product made me want to welcome cottage cheese back into my life.\u201dWhen cottage cheese is good, it\u2019s delicious, something the cheesemonger Kate Arding found when she tasted Cowgirl Creamery\u2019s version before production stopped. Ms. Arding, who grew up eating (and not really liking) cottage cheese in Britain, began a quest to persuade skeptical customers. \u201cThey\u2019d taste it and get this glassy-eyed look,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could see their faces just change.\u201dRekindling the love affair may be wishful thinking. There are a lot people who just are never going to like cottage cheese.\u201cThere\u2019s something about its connotation with cellulite,\u201d he said in an interview. And then there\u2019s the texture.\u201cUs Chinese, we love the slippery and the slimy, like tendon and jelly fish,\u201d he said. \u201cBut cottage cheese, man. I just can\u2019t do it. And I\u2019ve eaten horse.\u201d Like Mr. Pang, he singled out texture. Perhaps cottage cheese could be whipped to smooth it out, or made more spreadable, like ricotta cheese, he said. And then there is the name.\u201cIt conjures up this old-fashioned image where you think of a cottage,\u201d he said. \u201cBottom line, it\u2019s not sexy. A very clever Turkish name or something would go along way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Black Dolls Found in Nooses at San Francisco Construction Site, Workers Say", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree African-American construction workers said this week that they were targeted by racial slurs and death threats, including black dolls hanging from nooses in the bathroom, while working on the site of a San Francisco high-rise.The workers, Craig Ogans, Douglas Russell and Don\u2019ta Laury, filed complaints Thursday with the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment against Clark Construction, based in Maryland. The company is building the 43-story tower where the men worked. Facebook is expected to be its major tenant.The three men were elevator operators on the site in the city\u2019s financial district. Their complaints said they were repeatedly harassed and discriminated against by co-workers, including a threat with a knife, as part of a concerted campaign to drive them off the project.\u201cIt made me feel hurt, angry, scared, fearing for my safety,\u201d Mr. Ogans said in a phone interview. \u201cIt was an emotional roller coaster for me.\u201dIn an emailed statement, Clark Construction said it \u201cdoes not tolerate harassment or discriminatory behavior\u201d and had notified law enforcement officials about the racial harassment when it received complaints.Grace Gatpandan, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Police Department, said that nooses found at the site in April were being investigated by the police as a possible hate crime, though no one had been arrested yet. She said that was the only time the police were called to the work site.The company said it held anti-harassment and discrimination training at the site after the complaints and installed security cameras to \u201cdeter individuals from acts that are not permitted by policy or law.\u201dThe three men were employed by a subcontractor of Clark Construction, Bigge Crane and Rigging, which was not named in their complaints. A Bigge spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.The men are being represented by John Burris, an Oakland civil rights lawyer. Mr. Ogans and Mr. Russell said they were reassigned to different work sites after they reported the incidents. Mr. Laury could not be reached for comment, but Mr. Burris said that he was still working at the high-rise site where the harassment was alleged to have occurred.Clark representatives said the company would install signs on the project site \u2014 reading \u201cGive Respect. Get Respect.\u201d \u2014 as a reminder to workers that they are entitled to a \u201csafe and peaceful work environment.\u201d\u201cWe are committed to addressing reported instances of harassment and discrimination,\u201d read the statement from the company, which has 4,200 employees across the United States, according to its website.Mr. Burris said that the complaints filed this week were a precursor to a lawsuit the men intend to file against the company. They must first receive a \u201cright to sue\u201d notice from the California agency, which Mr. Burris said he expects within a week.At a news conference on Thursday, he displayed photos that show racial slurs and death threats scrawled in dark ink, as well as dolls dangling from nooses.\u201cI\u2019m hopeful,\u201d he said, \u201cthat this case sends a message to all construction owners at various construction sites, particularly in San Francisco, showing that they have some kind of responsibility to provide a safe working environment free of hostility.\u201dKristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonprofit group, said that race-based discrimination and harassment have increased in recent years. Ms. Clarke said nearly identical instances of harassment, including nooses and racial slurs, have been reported recently nationwide.\u201cIt aligns with a significant increase in hate crimes and racially motivated hate activity across the country,\u201d she said.The number of complaints received by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has steadily risen to about 9,000 in 2017 from about 6,000 in 1998.Mr. Ogans wrote in his complaint that shortly after he started working as an elevator operator at the construction site in March, co-workers told him to enter a sixth-floor bathroom, where he saw words using a racial slur that encouraged the killing of African-Americans.In April, Mr. Ogans said he found two black dolls hanging by nooses in a bathroom with references to killing him and Mr. Russell.\u201cI saw this horrific sight,\u201d Mr. Ogans said. \u201cI would like some major reforms put in place to ensure this stuff never happens ever again.\u201dMr. Russell said in his complaint that after he started working on the site in February, he saw a Clark Construction employee carrying a noose.Mr. Laury\u2019s complaint said that between August 2017 and February 2018, he was the only African-American elevator operator on site. Co-workers repeatedly asked him, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d and \u201cHow did you get a job here?\u201d and said African-American workers don\u2019t \u201cbelong\u201d on the site, his complaint said.\u201cThroughout my time working at this Clark Construction site,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit felt like there was a concerted effort to drive out the black workers.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "All the Photos From the 2018 CFDA Fashion Awards and What\u2019s New This Year", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEverything you need to know about the CFDA Awards tonight \u2014 how much it costs to go, who picks the winners and what Kim Kardashian West may wear.54 PhotosAnother month, another awards drum roll. But while you may know all about the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards and the Emmy Awards and the Tony Awards and the Grammy Awards and the MTV Video Awards and the Country Music Awards (more awards than there are spangles on a Britney Spears Vegas outfit), do you know about the CFDA Awards? They take place Monday night \u2014 they are always the first Monday in June \u2014 and you should, because they are nominally the biggest night in American fashion.Then there are also six special honorees, for lifetime achievement, media, good works (officially known as the Swarovski Award for Positive Change), contributions to the industry (the Founder\u2019s Award), international designer (Donatella Versace is getting it this year), and \u2014 most exciting of all \u2014 Fashion Icon. The evening is underwritten partly by Swarovski (which also has the new designer award named after it) and is a fund-raiser for the CFDA, which is the trade and lobbying organization for the fashion industry, and its various programs. Tickets cost $10,000 and tables about $70,000; last year the event was attended by 600 industry members and 400 students (they go free), and raised $4 million. That\u2019s nowhere near the Met Gala, which clocks in at about $13 million, but in line with many cultural fund-raisers in New York. Designers, of course, and all the folk that love them (or depend on them for their livelihood), including retailers, stylists, photographers, fashion magazine editors and \u2026 celebrities! The awards show has turned into a mutual back-scratching publicity opportunity thanks to a glitzy red carpet and presenter gigs. As at the Met Gala, nominees are expected to come with starry escorts, dressed in their fashion, the better to grab attention and get photographed. So far, for example, we know that Cate Blanchett (star of the coming fashion heist film \u201cOcean\u2019s 8\u201d), Trevor Noah (occasional front row guest at Calvin Klein and star of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d), Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Claire Danes and Busy Phillips are all presenting. And Kim Kardashian West is getting the Fashion Influencer award, which could mean very interesting things in the nude dressing category. In 2014, Rihanna got the same award and owned the night in sheer rhinestone-speckled Adam Selman and a white fur boa. Ms. Kardashian West could also shock everyone and demonstrate how seriously she takes this honor by wearing a black pantsuit, as she did on Wednesday during her White House visit. We will see! We will see if Kanye comes as her date. If he does, who knows what he will say?Also represented: Caroline Kennedy (who will give a Founder\u2019s Award to Carolina Herrera, and wore Herrera to her wedding) and the Parkland student Delaney Tarr, who is presenting Diane von Furstenberg with the award for Positive Change. As for watching, the CFDA will stream the red carpet and the awards on its Facebook page.Also, the awards are at the Brooklyn Museum, yet more proof that the borough, already home to numerous designers, is having a real fashion moment.It\u2019s kind of like the Oscars. Ballots go out to everyone the industry considers stakeholders: not just CFDA members but also people in related industries. They get to nominate anyone for the big awards (the criteria are a little vague, especially when it comes to defining the difference between \u201cemerging designer\u201d and \u201cdesigner of the year\u201d). (In case you are wondering, The New York Times does not participate because it is against our rules to choose sides.)Marc Jacobs has won women\u2019s wear designer of the year four times, accessory designer two times, men\u2019s wear once, plus the new talent award, the international award for Louis Vuitton and the lifetime achievement award \u2014 and he\u2019s nominated again for his women\u2019s wear. Tom Ford has won the international award, the women\u2019s wear award, the men\u2019s wear award (twice), the accessories award (when he was at Yves Saint Laurent), a special tribute award and the lifetime achievement award \u2014 and is nominated again for men\u2019s wear. You get the idea. It\u2019s not ideal because it does make American fashion vulnerable to charges of being a tiny clique with a favored few (told you: high school!), but the problem is the reality gap between the fact that fashion is a global industry with global talent, and the fact that these are essentially local awards.France and Italy do not, in part for the exact reason the United States and Britain have run into problems: the risk of too much sameness on display. There is a whole school of thought that says everyone should just get together and have a single awards show for the fashion circuit and forget national identity. Because who in the world even knows how to define that anymore \u2014 not when British designers run French houses, and Belgian designers run American brands, and Italian designers run British houses, and everyone seems to show wherever they want to. So far it hasn\u2019t worked, though. Maybe Jared Kushner can add that negotiation to his portfolio.An earlier version of this article misstated the award Kim Kardashian West will receive at the CFDA awards. It is the Influencer Award, not the Icon Award.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Caution Over Cryptocurrency, Investors Are Bullish", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the path to success for start-ups was clear: raise money from venture capitalists, and either start trading in the public markets or sell to a bigger competitor.These days, however, there\u2019s a buzzy alternative that carries ever-growing promises: the initial coin offering, or I.C.O.No longer do companies have to sell shares in themselves to big investment firms. Coin offerings let start-ups go directly to individual investors over the internet, selling digital currencies akin to Bitcoin that can be used for some service that the companies build.The pitch for such offerings: eliminating the hassle of dealing with venture capitalists and investment bankers, while also avoiding the thicket of regulations that accompany traditional initial public offerings. In the best-case scenario, proponents say, coin offerings are far more democratic than what came before.But many entrepreneurs say they believe that, at least for them, coin offerings make more sense as a way to raise money than the old ways of Wall Street and Silicon Valley.The attraction for some companies is simple: It\u2019s a potentially bigger version of a Kickstarter campaign, raising money from backers without giving up any voting control by selling stock. The tokens that investors receive differ from traditional company shares in that they offer no say in how the company is run, so buyers are betting that their value will rise as the digital currencies get used more.And the process of selling a coin offering is relatively simple, where companies create their own cryptocurrency, write a document known as a white paper to describe the service that they\u2019re building and hope enough people are interested in buying into the sale.Still, other entrepreneurs saw something much more interesting in I.C.O.s.Trying to sell that to public investors seems fruitless. But a coin offering could allow Kik to create its own token and sell it to backers, who would find and create uses for it in the company\u2019s own ecosystem.Mr. Livingston said that the hope was to create an entire digital economy based on Kin, with his company betting on its own holdings of the cryptocurrency eventually swelling in value.\u201cYour value at the end of the day is how valuable the asset is multiplied by the amount of the asset you own,\u201d he said in an interview.Still, the ease with which companies have been able to raise money has worried critics, who say that too many coin offerings are essentially scams. Many of these offerings, skeptics say, offer so little documentation as to throw up a host of red flags.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of comical how poor the disclosure is,\u201d said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital. \u201cIt says you can\u2019t trust anything in this prospectus to the full extent of the law.\u201dEven offerings from well-known companies like Telegram are for services that are years away from completion, leaving many participants in these offerings essentially serving as speculators \u2014 and losing out if the products promised by sellers fail.When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.It is that sort of behavior that prompted Ms. Friedman, the Nasdaq chief executive, to say that coin offerings pose real issues, particularly to the average investor who tends to participate in them.\u201cTo make it no rules at all, when companies can just willy-nilly take people\u2019s money and offer no information at all, with no governance, that sounds to me like you\u2019re taking advantage of people,\u201d she said last week.And some skeptics say that traditional fund-raising methods for companies will endure. Neil Rimer, a co-founder of the investment firm Index Ventures, argued that traditional venture capital backers could give entrepreneurs experience and business connections. The biggest technology darlings, including Uber and Airbnb, are still planning to hold mammoth initial public offerings as soon as next year.There is one other potential issue for initial coin offerings: Through more regulations and the entrance of established investment giants, such deals look less and less like the democratic offerings their biggest fans say they are.Nevertheless, Ms. Friedman hasn\u2019t ruled out having Nasdaq host trading of cryptocurrencies, such as those sold in coin offerings, someday. And even investors who have looked critically at these kinds of deals acknowledge that there is some use for them.\u201cOur feeling is that this is too powerful an idea and a technology to try to quash,\u201d Mr. Rimer said. But, he added, \u201cRegulators do need to find a way to live with it and to put a framework around it to avoid egregious blowups.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With no time to make a roast or stew, the legend goes, the Great Khan\u2019s chef carved very thin slices of raw mutton and plunged them into hot broth for a few seconds. Besides serving as an inspiration to those of us who believe there is always time to eat, the chef\u2019s impromptu recipe is said to have given China its ancient and delicious hot pot tradition.Hot pots did not jump to Japan until shortly after World War II, when kelp joined the broth and the name was changed, onomatopoetically, to shabu shabu. But like hot pots in China, shabu shabu is a do-it-yourself bash where everybody around the table gets to dunk and swish the ingredients they like best. Chefs are not required.Usually backed up by two other women, but occasionally working solo, Ms. Okano moves deliberately. She will gesture to the place mat, where the night\u2019s eight or 10 courses are written out in Japanese, right to left, and then to another slip of paper with the same courses printed in English, again right to left. The price is $128. There are no choices to be made. Ms. Okano has modeled her restaurant on omakase sushi bars, where the chef calls the tune.When I first arrived, I admit that I couldn\u2019t see the point of having a chef do the cooking when I was perfectly able to do my own dunking and swishing. Ms. Okano quickly poured two or three mouthfuls of yeasty, warm unfiltered sake into a little saucer. This arrived with a snack \u2014 cured salmon and salmon roe seasoned with fermented rice \u2014 that artfully underscored the sake\u2019s flavor.Then she turned and quietly addressed a saut\u00e9 pan over the stove. When she turned around again she had cooked an omelet and flicked it into a roll in the Japanese style. Served in a bowl of hot, clear dashi, the egg was as tender and delicate as its garnish, a tiny piece of mitsuba stem tied into a knot.Next she poached two pieces of abalone for a few seconds each in abalone broth. One she dabbed with a small, intense blip of the Japanese spice paste yuzu kosho. Over the other she spooned a sauce made from the abalone\u2019s liver. I ate them both, and was flooded first with pleasure then with embarrassment that I\u2019d thought simmered food wasn\u2019t worth a chef\u2019s time.By the time I\u2019d eaten a small tongue of sea urchin combined with silky rags of yuba still dripping with soy milk, I was on board for anything Ms. Okano wanted to cook.For some time the bubbles in an iron pot of dashi set over a countertop burner had been getting bigger and faster. Thin strips of Wagyu beef, streaked with so much fat they looked like stained glass, were stretched out on black slate with pinkish bands of pork belly. Raw vegetables \u2014 cabbage, lettuce, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, half a brussels sprout and a cherry tomato on a wooden spear \u2014 waited on a nearby plate.Before I knew it she had cooked the first piece of beef \u2014 was it the A5 from Miyazaki or the A4 from Kagoshima? The flesh had twisted itself around, and now dusk-gray outer curls hid inner curves of faded pink. The flavors moved in rapid waves: first a few clinging, savory drops of dashi, then some already-melted beef fat, followed by the flavor of the lean meat itself, sweet and refined. Finally came a second helping of fat, freshly melted now.When Ms. Okano fished out a piece of beef, she would suggest seasoning it with one or more of an almost comically large assortment of condiments and pur\u00e9es that she makes herself. She seemed to favor her ponzu, and so do I; it\u2019s more radiant with yuzu than any I\u2019ve had before. I also liked the sweet soy once I learned to doctor it with a few drops of what Ms. Okano calls \u201cgravy sauce,\u201d a dark liquid that makes meat taste meatier. Many dismal meals would be saved if I carried an eyedropper of gravy sauce around with me.Swabbing the pork belly in the sticky, thick sesame paste with toasted sesame seeds produces an effect similar to, but more subtle than, the combination of peanut butter and bacon. It\u2019s even better with a smear of salted plum, or a few drops of the yuzu-olive oil sauce that seems to have jetted in from Italy.The vegetables were spotless and fresh. A meal without them would be off kilter, perhaps to a degree that would cause grumbling from the digestive system, but on their own they are not a reason to go to Shabushabu Macoron.At times, it seems as if Ms. Okano can\u2019t believe it all worked out. After she\u2019d cooked me three nearly identical meals, I wondered if she\u2019d still be as giddy a year from now. Will she be able to change the menu with the seasons to keep things interesting? Can she stash surprise ingredients below the counter for repeat customers, the way sushi chefs do?None of these questions occurred to me the first two times I ate at her restaurant. I just sat there in something like a state of wonder while she cooked for me. This is, bizarrely, a rare experience at tasting counters, where chefs are often intent on intricacies of plating.The physical setting of Shabushabu Macoron strongly suggests a shoestring budget \u2014 the paper towel roll in the restroom hangs from what may be an actual shoestring \u2014 but sitting there while Ms. Okano stands a few inches away and makes your dinner is one of the most luxurious experiences this city currently offers.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Device Partnerships Explained", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the debate about Facebook\u2019s privacy practices unfolds, here is what we know about the company\u2019s partnerships with makers of phones, game consoles and other hardware:Facebook officials said the company began forming device partnerships in 2007. The social network wanted to ensure that its services were available to Facebook users not only on desktop computers, but also anywhere else people used the internet: mobile phones, smart TVs, game consoles and other devices.At the time, many phones could not run full-fledged Facebook apps. So Facebook allowed manufacturers to integrate elements of the social network \u2014 \u201clike\u201d buttons, photo sharing, friends lists \u2014 into their devices.Facebook has said in recent months that a Cambridge-like abuse could not have happened after 2015, when it imposed restrictions so users could choose which of their data their Facebook friends could share with third parties.But The Times\u2019s reporting shows that Facebook continued to allow that kind of access to dozens of the world\u2019s biggest tech and hardware companies \u2014 and only began shutting down the data-sharing partnerships after the Cambridge Analytica scandal erupted in March.Unless you keep close track of which devices all of your Facebook friends are using at any given time, you won\u2019t know which manufacturers have access to your data. You could adjust your settings to bar all outside apps from retrieving your data, but some device makers, including BlackBerry, can override even that restriction. Short of deleting your account, the only way you can be sure your data is not shared with device makers is to set all of your sharing settings to private \u2014 which would also prevent your friends from seeing the information.Facebook has said that some of the device partners store Facebook users\u2019 \u2014 and their friends\u2019 \u2014 data on their own servers. But Facebook has also said that regardless of where the information is stored, its partners are bound by strict contracts regarding the use of the data. But that doesn\u2019t mean the data is necessarily safe. One of the lessons of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is just how hard it is to control what happens to user data once it has left Facebook\u2019s system.Facebook also said that it periodically audits partners\u2019 use of the data. Some partners store Facebook data on their own servers, while others have said that the data is sent directly to each device. But Facebook, as well as some device partners contacted by The Times, acknowledged that there are several ways Facebook information could leave those devices, including when a device backs up its own data to cloud services or syncs with third-party apps.A third-party app is any app that is not made by the device maker itself: Think games, messaging or banking apps. Every time a newly downloaded game or other app requests access to your address book, information in the address book can be shared.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Discovering the Art of Craft", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind every great restaurant is a finely tuned team \u2014 and hours and hours and hours of work. A New York Times photographer shadowed the staff at the chef Tom Colicchio\u2019s Manhattan flagship.Dinner at Craft is not always eaten in the dining room. In late afternoon, Michal Shelkowitz, the pastry chef, has hers standing up at her station with her pastry cooks, Nicholas Antonelli and Kimberly Limoncelli.The boosting of workplace morale requires doughnuts as often in luxe restaurants as anywhere else. Mia Mignot, the assistant general manager, and Cesar Caicedo, a captain, share the treats. The hierarchy of the dining room and bar, which restaurant people call \u201cthe front of the house,\u201d mirrors the one in the kitchen. The general manager is at the top, followed by assistant G.M.s and captains, who manage the business of each table of guests, taking their orders for food and wine, interacting with them, making things nice. Front waiters serve food and refill water glasses; back waiters clear plates and crumbs; runners run food from the kitchen up to the dining room. The staff is close. Eating dinner in the stairwell, clockwise from top left: Hector Salguero, a night porter and dishwasher; Joel Puntiel-Polanco, a bartender; and Nelson Matias, a runner.The kitchen runs like a brigade, and Kyle Koenig, center, the chef de cuisine, occupies the top position \u2014 save for Mr. Colicchio\u2019s as chef and owner. Miguel Fajardo, a cook on the fish station, stands to his left. Another cook, Leksi Bunnell, works on the meat-roast station; her tattoo depicts a skyline on the blade of a chef\u2019s knife. Mr. Koenig arrives around noon, leaves around midnight, and examines every plate of food served.Tom Colicchio, Craft\u2019s owner and founding chef, no longer cooks regularly at the restaurant. He has other kitchens to tend to, along with events and a television career. But he keeps his hand in with private dinners and special events in the restaurant\u2019s private dining room.The wineglasses at Craft are wiped and polished many times before a customer ever sees them. Kelvin Puello, a front waiter, tends to a spot late in the evening, as dinner service winds down. Each night ends with accounting and garbage. Edward Farley, a captain, counts tips. Then, at 12:59 a.m., the last of the trash is taken out to the street by Rick Taveras, a night porter. The restaurant is locked until Mr. Ramirez, the head porter, returns a few hours later to start a new day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Is a Win for Consumers", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moore is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation.The Justice Department must now decide whether to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling, a move that would be sheer folly and a waste of taxpayer money, given the firm rejection of every argument the government\u2019s lawyers made. Hopefully, this decision will also clear the path for other planned cost-cutting mergers in the media and telecommunications industries.The government\u2019s antitrust challenge to this $85 billion deal was one of the flimsiest assaults against a corporate merger in recent memory. These two companies don\u2019t even directly compete with each other. Normally, antitrust cases are brought to block so-called \u201chorizontal\u201d mergers, in which companies in the same line of business \u2014 two airlines, for example \u2014 want to combine forces. Even in such instances, the antitrust laws are antiquated, given that globalized competition and the speed of technological change continually knock down industry leaders.The core argument brought by the Justice Department, in an antitrust action championed by President Trump, was that AT&T could use its new market power to raise prices exorbitantly on cable and satellite operators that want to run Time Warner TV programs \u2014 such as CNN broadcasts or HBO shows. The government\u2019s lawyers argued that consumers\u2019 cable bills would go up if the merger went through.The absurdity of this argument is that the Justice lawyers seemed to be stuck in the 1980s. In 2018, the number of American households getting their television or video entertainment from traditional cable providers is declining. The very notion of \u201cwatching TV\u201d is becoming as obsolete as listening to music on a turntable. My teenage kids and their friends don\u2019t even own TVs. They watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on their computers or smartphones, and one of their favorite \u201cchannels\u201d is YouTube. They can choose from thousands of programs at a very low cost. Today, any hotshot with a camera and a Facebook page can be a media company. Is that enough competition for the Justice Department?In short, there is probably no area in today\u2019s economy where there is less threat of monopolistic power than in media and entertainment. The proliferation of video content and ways to get it means that these companies must stay innovative and affordable, or they are gone as fast as you can say Blockbuster Video.In this cutthroat environment, the AT&T and Time Warner merger is better described as a survival strategy, not a market domination plot. The companies hope to lower costs by merging AT&T\u2019s transmission of video content with the entertainment products that Time Warner offers.This merger could bring welcome competition to Google and Facebook, which have captured about two-thirds of the online advertising market, a point that the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers ignored. Combining AT&T\u2019s mobile, broadband, and DirecTV platforms with Time Warner\u2019s movies, TV shows, music and sporting events could turn them into a serious rival to the tech behemoths.Businesses and families may also benefit from the merger if it accelerates the development of 5G wireless networks. The merged company could use its vast spectrum of resources to jump-start the delivery of Time Warner content through AT&T\u2019s wireless network. This will mean new competition for residential broadband from cable companies such as Comcast.The days when companies like U.S. Steel or General Motors or Microsoft could accumulate the market power to dominate an industry and gouge consumers with higher prices are long gone. Some of the most powerful companies in the world \u2014 Amazon and Walmart, for example \u2014 do just the opposite: they are constantly lowering, not raising their prices.It is too early to know whether this mega-deal will turn out well for shareholders and consumers. But the Justice Department should not be standing in the way. Its goal, instead, should be to allow made-in-America companies like AT&T and Time Warner to do what it takes to become global competitors, not global dinosaurs.The Trump administration should be thankful that, in this merger, it isn\u2019t China buying up America\u2019s strategic companies or assets. These are two American companies merging to gain profitability and global market share. In this way, the merger helps put America first. Someone, please tell the lawyers.Stephen Moore is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project for Economic Growth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mo Salah, Now Starring in Chechnya", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe was apparently roused from sleep by the Chechen strongman Ramzan A. Kadyrov. Egypt\u2019s World Cup training camp has begun. GROZNY, Russia \u2014 Ramzan A. Kadyrov did not sustain himself as the autocratic leader of the Chechen republic by failing to understand the value of propaganda and spectacle.So he was not to be deterred when Egypt\u2019s national soccer team arrived here at its World Cup training camp on Sunday, and the whole squad showed up for an evening workout \u2014 except for the star forward Mohamed Salah.The bearded Mr. Kadyrov, 41, left the field in his turquoise and white track suit. Soon, he returned, this time making a grand entrance with Mr. Salah before about 8,000 fans, posing for photographers and television cameras, even grabbing the Liverpool star\u2019s arm and raising it as if crowning a boxing champion.Turko Daudov, a prominent adviser to Mr. Kadyrov, said Mr. Salah had been napping at the nearby team hotel and had been awakened and driven to the stadium in Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s car.Both the soccer star and the regional leader are in urgent need of their own forms of rehabilitation. Mr. Salah is attempting to heal his injured shoulder in time for Egypt\u2019s opening World Cup match on Friday against Uruguay in Yekaterinburg.Mr. Kadyrov is seeking a more elusive kind of rehab: repairing an image of ruthlessness and oppression as he seeks to draw more investors and tourists to this formerly war-ravaged capital in the North Caucasus region.\u201cIt\u2019s all about a positive image of the Chechen Republic,\u201d Jambulat Umarov, Chechnya\u2019s minister of national policy, press and information, said of hosting Egypt\u2019s training camp. \u201cIt\u2019s about dispelling myths.\u201dSo far, Mr. Kadyrov has struggled to burnish that image.Chechnya was involved in two brutal separatist wars in the 1990s and early 2000s. Since then, Mr. Kadyrov, a former rebel whose powerful family aligned in 1999 with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has aggressively suppressed dissent.Unable to persuade Egypt to train elsewhere, Human Rights Watch has been urging FIFA, soccer\u2019s world governing body, to attempt to get Mr. Titiev freed. Otherwise, anyone with a complaint regarding a FIFA-related activity here \u2014 a stadium worker, hotel worker or a protester \u2014 will have no place to turn for redress, said Rachel Denber, deputy director for the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch.\u201cFIFA really needs to step up and lean on Putin,\u201d Ms. Denber said.Mr. Umarov, the minister, bristled that Human Rights Watch should decide which team trains where, and he said FIFA could ask for Mr. Titiev\u2019s release, but \u201cwe have a constitution and laws that are higher than FIFA.\u201dLast year, when informed about the detention and torture of about 100 gay men and continued harassment of journalists in Chechnya, FIFA noted that its policy on human rights \u201cprohibited discrimination of any kind\u201d and said of the abuses, \u201cwe firmly condemn them.\u201dAsked recently about the propriety of a World Cup team training in Chechnya, a FIFA communications representative said in an email, \u201cThrough its activities, FIFA does not legitimize any regimes.\u201dAs Egypt\u2019s team arrived near the end of the holy month of Ramadan, it found in Grozny comfort in a fellow Sunni Muslim region, convenient access to one of the largest mosques in Europe and halal food. But there are practical reasons for the team\u2019s choice of a base, too: the players are staying in a new, five-star hotel with no other guests, and the stadium they are using for practices is only a five-minute walk from the hotel.Ihab Leheta, the general manager of Egypt\u2019s national team, declined to comment on the objections by Human Rights Watch, saying recently in Cairo: \u201cWe chose from the list FIFA gave us. If people have a problem with Grozny, they should speak to FIFA.\u201dThe Pharaohs, as Egypt\u2019s team is known, have qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 28 years. Their hopes depend largely on Mr. Salah, who scored 44 goals for Liverpool during the 2017-18 season and was named the top player in England\u2019s Premier League. He led his team to the Champions League final last month before injuring his shoulder early in that match against eventual champion Real Madrid.If Mr. Salah can recover sufficiently, Egypt holds reasonable hope of advancing beyond the group stage of the World Cup after round-robin matches against Uruguay, Russia and Saudi Arabia.This week, Egyptian national flags line the road from the airport to central Grozny. Billboards depict its players in celebration. The managers at the team hotel speak Arabic and English. Security, medical and firefighting personnel are on duty around the clock. Even traffic patterns have been adjusted to accommodate the team.This lavish welcome is an attempt to show outsiders that Chechnya is politically and economically stable, Mr. Umarov, the minister, said, adding, \u201cIt shows that big stars who are famous worldwide feel safe in Chechnya.\u201dThis is hardly the first time Mr. Kadyrov is making a theatrical attempt to ingratiate himself with the international sports world. In 2011, he coaxed the retired Argentine great Diego Maradona to play an exhibition match here in an effort to show that Chechnya had recovered from its wars.According to various accounts, Mr. Kadyrov captained the other team and either scored a hat trick or assisted on numerous goals in a 5-2 victory against a defense that was generous to the point of deferential.Mr. Kadyrov will seek similar public-relations benefits from Mr. Salah\u2019s presence and will be thrilled if Mr. Salah expresses that Grozny is safe, developed and culturally pleasing, said Karim Zidan, a Canadian-based journalist who has written extensively about sports and politics in Chechnya.At times when Mr. Kadyrov faces harsh criticism, Mr. Zidan said, \u201cYou can believe he\u2019ll have some celebrities in or football matches or fights going on to distract his citizens and people around the world from taking notice.\u201dThe outreach to the Muslim world is also an attempt by Mr. Kadyrov to make himself the leader of all of Russia\u2019s estimated 20 million Muslims, to mixed results. His forays into soccer, for example, have been both ambitious and clumsy. He is a former president of the local soccer team, then known as F.C. Terek and, since last year, as F.C. Akhmad in honor of his father, Akhmad H. Kadyrov, a previous president of Chechnya who was assassinated in 2004.Mr. Gullit\u2019s tenure was short and strange. He complained to The Daily Mail of London about training conditions, broken promises about player acquisitions and the inability to get a drink. After six months, he was gone.The team posted on its website an excoriating note: \u201cGullit must know that he was invited not to nightclubs and discos to disappear, but to work in a football club, in this case to achieve a result. Yes, we have no drugs, no indecent night life, which in the Netherlands and in Europe there is lots.\u201dThe strange events did not stop after Mr. Gullit departed.What happened next in the stadium tunnel, according to a complaint filed by the Russian players\u2019 union, was that Mr. Gogniev \u201cwas apprehended by a group of men dressed in police uniforms.\u201cThey grabbed him and dragged him aside,\u201d the report said, \u201cwhere they proceeded to beat him with batons\u201d and left him with \u201cbroken ribs, a broken nose, severe bruising and a concussion.\u201dIn 2013, Mr. Kadyrov, upset at the referee in a match against FC Rubin Kazan, admitted that it was he who shouted over the stadium loudspeaker, \u201cThe ref\u2019s been bought off! You\u2019re an ass!\u201d He later apologized.During the World Cup, Egyptian soccer players will be the most high profile athletes in the region. Of particular interest will be a match against Russia on June 19, and the possibility that Egypt could advance while knocking Russia out of the tournament.There are political angles to this story as well as sporting ones. Mr. Kadyrov has served as an emissary for Mr. Putin while forging relationships with Middle Eastern countries like the United Arab Emirates, which financed the Egyptian team\u2019s hotel here. And now Mr. Kadyrov has an opportunity to seek closer ties to the authoritarian Egyptian leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who would surely be elated if the Pharaohs advanced.But that could leave Mr. Kadyrov in a somewhat awkward position if Egypt\u2019s success came at the expense of Russia, and by extension, Mr. Putin. His advisers said this week that, were that to occur, he would feel disappointed for Russia but joyful for Egypt.Mr. Zidan, the journalist, said: \u201cKadyrov walks a fine line, presenting himself as an ethnic Chechen and a loyalist of Putin and Russia. I wonder how he really views this, if he would be so upset if Russia was knocked out. It\u2019s a little complicated.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}

He wanted to be buried there. With Amy. But not scattered. The field still existed, but the area was no longer so rural, and John didn\u2019t want to end up blanketing a local parking lot.So I was to take his box of ashes and Amy\u2019s, get a shovel and probably a flashlight, because this was illegal so we\u2019d need to do it at night, the funereal equivalent of a dine-and-dash. Joining me would be John\u2019s 90-year-old sister and his nephew, along with our sons, Henry and Gus, who were currently far more focused on the adventure of the illicit burial than on what it all meant.\u201cI\u2019d always been sure you\u2019d go first,\u201d John added, sadly.The fact that I am 30 years younger had in no way deterred him from this thought. John seemed the grumpiest of men, but in key ways he was an optimist.\u201cAnd of course I would have followed your instructions for your own burial,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have cremated you and placed you in the mausoleum with your parents. I know you wanted nothing more.\u201dThis didn\u2019t seem the time to point out that for at least 10 years I had been telling him that I loathed the mausoleum, that I had arranged for my body to be donated to a medical school, and that I had put aside money for a big party afterward.John never listened. That, combined with his almost comical frugality (I already had been warned I would need to find the cheapest cremation place in New York) had often threatened to sink our marriage. But I guess I could save that conversation to have with myself, late at night. Plenty of time for that. Not much time for anything else.We talked and talked. \u201cI was a good husband, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d he said. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t chase after girls.\u201d (No, I thought a little churlishly. Because then you would have had to pay for them.) \u201cYou were wonderful,\u201d I said. Both thoughts were true.He wanted to make sure I understood his plan. But about 30 minutes into this conversation, he suddenly looked sheepish, as if it had just occurred to him that his wife of 25 years may not actually be on board to carry out this promise he had made to his former wife more than three decades earlier.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this right away,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, you could wait until you go, and then have the boys take all three of us. That would be fine too.\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d I said.Amy was Midwestern, blond, aristocratic and gracious, an accomplished equestrian and mezzo-soprano 17 years older than John. Before she got sick, they had worked their way across Europe, singing at all the big opera houses. She was everything I am not.John and I used to joke that the only thing he and I had in common was a mutual antipathy for fish. Amy and John shared everything. He loved us both, and he made a family with me. But I never kid myself.I explained the situation to my friend Hilary over lunch, including the part where I could hold off on the burial until my own demise. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to be their ashy third wheel,\u201d I groused.\u201cHere\u2019s what you do,\u201d Hilary said. \u201cYou put Amy in some sort of suspicious container \u2014 something metal that the T.S.A. people can\u2019t see through in the screening. Amy looks like a bomb. Oops! The T.S.A. will just have to keep her. Oh well! You tried.\u201dI could have explained instead of laughing, I suppose. But it\u2019s hard, without sounding saccharine. One of the things I loved about my husband was that he kept his promises \u2014 even stupid ones that made no difference to anyone but himself. You wanted a light bulb changed? It was going to be changed, exactly at the time he said, and it would be with the 60-watt bulb, not the 100, because \u2026 who the hell knows, he had his reasons.This punctiliousness and attention to detail meant he didn\u2019t make promises freely, and he said \u201cNo\u201d to life far more often than he said \u201cYes.\u201d But also, this reliability was at the center of his John-ness. He lived small. But he loved deep.John couldn\u2019t quite remember where Amy\u2019s papers were, but he knew they were in his apartment, and I did too, since he threw out nothing. During the search I found other things I wanted to ask him about. Why did my peace-loving husband have a police summons for disorderly conduct in 2002 that he never mentioned to me? Why were there photos of him happily rowing a woman I had never heard about in a pond in Central Park, and why was she dressed as a mime?By the time I decided to ask, he could no longer speak. He had the most beautiful voice, a basso profundo, and I am glad our last conversations did not involve the police or mysterious mimes.I found the papers in about 30 seconds. He didn\u2019t even need to tell me where he put them. I knew my husband.John died three days later, on his 86th birthday, which, since he was a fan of order and symmetry, seemed purposeful. My son Henry\u2019s response, when I broke the news: \u201cWell, the good news is, now you get to be the favorite parent.\u201dIn August, Henry, Gus and I will be headed to England. The cremation was super-cheap, and the container is plastic. I have gotten four Newcastle United stickers so that Henry can decorate it with his favorite team. Amy and her papers are with us, too. I will let my sons carry John, and I will carry Amy. I want her to get there safely.She has been waiting to join John for a long time, though I doubt he ever said to her, \u201cHey, do you want to be secretly buried in an English field in the middle of nowhere?\u201dIn my life, I have been so lucky. Though I do wonder: Is this my love story? Is it theirs?Maybe it\u2019s ours.Advertisement"}

What she was most giddy about, however, was a 41-page list of all the people who had done the test and were genetically related to her: 1,200 in all. (Customers can choose whether their information is shared with others.)\u201cI had the names of everyone from my immediate family members to my first cousins, second cousins, third. Once I got past fourth cousins, it went to my fifth cousins, and beyond,\u201d said Ms. deNapoli, who lives in Georgetown, Mass. \u201cIt started me down this genealogical rabbit hole.\u201d Using the website\u2019s internal messaging system supplemented with Facebook, she connected with three second cousins, who were in neighboring towns. She met each one for breakfast in a local diner, where they spent hours drinking coffee and poring over family trees and photos, marveling at various resemblances.\u201cJorge is an older cousin, a very young 90,\u201d Ms. deNapoli said. \u201cEverybody agreed he looks just like my dad.\u201d The companies use their large databases to match willing participants with others who share their DNA. In many cases, long-lost relatives are reuniting, becoming best friends, travel partners, genealogical resources or confidantes. The result is a more layered version of what happened when Facebook first emerged and out-of-touch friends and family members found one another. Children of long-ago casual sperm donors are finding their fathers. Adoptees are bonding to biological family members they\u2019ve been searching for their entire lives. Sherri Tredway, 55, is a marketing and development director for a social service agency based in Washington, Ind. She was adopted as a baby, and in January she drove two and a half hours to Bowling Green, Ky., to meet her biological half sister, Patty Roberts-Freeman, 60, with whom she connected through AncestryDNA. Ms. Roberts-Freeman needed an outfit for a wedding, so they arranged to meet at a shopping mall to find one together. They started in the food court, where they bought sodas and talked for over an hour about their mother, their current lives, their upbringings. They then went to a Belk department store, where they tried on outfits. \u201cI was looking at some dressy dresses and showed her a few, and she said, \u2018No, no dresses for me!\u2019\u201d Ms. Tredway recalled. \u201cI remember saying, \u2018O.K., are you sure you are my sister?\u2019 which we both laughed about. She found a silky floral shell and a beautiful sweater in rose, pink and cream to wear with some slacks. It was very classy.\u2019\u201d The half sisters have since seen each other several times, meeting in restaurants between their homes. They also see other relatives including two more half siblings, Sissy Bonham, 51, and Michael Clavette, 54, as well as their biological mother\u2019s sister, Nancy Kalman Bell. \u201cNot a day goes by when I don\u2019t talk to Aunt Nan,\u201d Ms. Tredway said. \u201cI call her to talk, when I\u2019m upset, anything. She\u2019s my family now.\u201d Josh Broadwater, 44, a deputy sheriff in California, was abandoned when he was 1 day old in a gas station bathroom in California. When he was in his 30s, he implored the agency that placed him with adoptive parents to give him whatever information they had about his biological ones but ran into constant dead ends. In July 2015 he sent a kit to AncestryDNA and found a cousin who shared DNA with him. That led to him discovering his biological father: a man who had had a one-night stand in the front seat of a \u201969 pickup truck and never knew he existed. They connected over the phone, and soon Mr. Broadwater was driving 500 miles to go elk hunting on his father\u2019s farm in Kingston, Utah.The two got along so well that they now talk on the phone once a week about the weather, what is going on with the children, about the hunting season. \u201cI never thought finding my biological dad, he would be the one calling me,\u201d Mr. Broadwater said. Others who have their DNA tested are forming relationships not with specific people, but with their family\u2019s places of origin.Over the winter she and her father went to the Iberian Peninsula for two weeks. She felt an ineluctable connection to the people as she ate their bread masterpieces, toured buildings by Antoni Gaud\u00ed and danced to flamenco music. \u201cI had a piece of paper that tells me I\u2019m from Spain,\u201d Ms. Madison said. \u201cBut then I went there and I noticed all these people have curly hair, and maybe that is where mine comes from?\u201d Now she feels compelled to visit the other places as well. But other testers have found their results more alienating.In February 2016 Christine Carter, a marketing strategist, was on a business trip to London when she decided to open her 23andMe dossier. She was in her hotel room, rushing to dinner. \u201cI thought it would be a quick reveal,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going to learn that I was Native American and black, and maybe learn a little bit more about the stories I heard as a child.\u201d Ms. Carter was shocked when the results showed she was 31.5 percent white or European. She struggled through dinner, keeping this revelation mostly to herself, until she got back to her home in Baltimore and contended with her feelings.\u201cIt took me less than 30 minutes to write the post, it was like journaling, something to get it off my chest,\u201d said Ms. Carter, 32. \u201cSo to have that reaction was insane.\u201d Even for those privy to rich data, using a genetic-testing service as social network poses challenges. Ms. deNapoli has written to 25 people related to her and has heard back from only nine. \u201cI guess a lot of people aren\u2019t doing the tests to connect with family,\u201d she said. But as much as Mr. Hughes wants to explore the different regions he comes from and meet the family members whom he got that DNA from, he hasn\u2019t matched with anyone through the genetic testing service. \u201cMy biological dad is 50 percent Native American Indian, so I eventually hope to find which tribe I am from,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have nothing yet.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hot Heads: Why Mammals Need R.E.M. Sleep", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySleeping fur seals toggle between two brain patterns: one while at sea, the other on land. Researchers suggest that R.E.M. sleep serves to warm the brain. Hours later, the pens started to swing wildly. To judge from the chart, it seemed as if Armond were awake, his eyes darting about the room. But when Aserinsky looked in on him, his son was fast asleep.Aserinsky had discovered R.E.M. sleep.Eventually he and other researchers learned that during this state, the brain shifts from low-frequency to high-frequency electrical waves, like those produced in waking hours. When Aserinsky woke his subjects from R.E.M. sleep, they often reported vivid dreams.Almost all mammals experience R.E.M. sleep, but even today researchers debate why it exists. On Thursday, a team of American and Russian researchers reported that fur seals may provide an important clue.While they swim, fur seals switch off R.E.M. sleep entirely. It returns when they come back to land \u2014 a pattern never seen before.\u201cR.E.M. sleep is like shivering for the brain,\u201d he said.Many scientists have argued that our brains require R.E.M. sleep each night to function properly. One clue comes from experiments in which researchers deprive rats of R.E.M. sleep for a few days.As soon as the rats can sleep normally again, they experience a \u201crebound,\u201d spending more time each night in R.E.M. \u2014 as if they need to catch up.Some studies have suggested that the brain needs R.E.M. sleep to keep its metabolism in balance. Rats deprived of R.E.M. will eat more, and yet they also will lose weight.This disruption can be lethal. \u201cIf you deprive rats of R.E.M. sleep, they\u2019ll die in two weeks,\u201d said Dr. Siegel.But other findings have raised doubts about the importance of R.E.M. Certain types of antidepressant drugs reduce R.E.M. sleep in users, for example, without evidence of harm.R.E.M. isn\u2019t even essential for dreaming. Researchers have found that people also dream during periods of so-called slow-wave sleep.Some of the most puzzling evidence about R.E.M. sleep has come from the sea.In the 1970s, a Russian biologist named Lev M. Mukhametov placed electrodes on the heads of dolphins. He discovered that they can put one side of the brain to sleep as they swim while the other side remains alert. Then they can switch, putting the other hemisphere to sleep.But as hard as Dr. Mukhametov and his colleagues looked, they never found a dolphin in R.E.M. sleep.In the 1990s, Dr. Siegel and Dr. Mukhametov started collaborating on studies of relatives of dolphins and found the hemisphere-switching sleep pattern in other species, such as gray whales.More recently, the scientists wondered what they might find if they looked at a species between the two ends of the spectrum: a mammal that regularly slept both at sea and on land.The researchers decided to study four fur seals. The animals spend weeks or months swimming in the ocean, but they come on land to mate and rear their young.Oleg I. Lyamin, a neuroscientist who splits his time between U.C.L.A. and the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution in Moscow, implanted electrodes in the seals and strapped data recorders to their backs.The fur seals lived in a pool where they could swim around or haul themselves onto a dry platform. After two days of recordings, the researchers took away the platform.For up to two weeks, the seals could only swim in the pool. Then the researchers put the platform back, allowing the fur seals to doze out of the water again.On the platform, the researchers found, the fur seals slept much as land mammals do. Their entire brains slipped into slow-wave sleep, interrupted from time to time by periods of R.E.M.But when the seals had to sleep in the water, the brain patterns resembled those of dolphins. Only one hemisphere of their brain slept at a time. What\u2019s more, the fur seals experienced almost no R.E.M. sleep.\u201cThe R.E.M. sleep pretty much goes to zero and stays there as long as they\u2019re in the water,\u201d said Dr. Siegel.When the seals got back on the platform, ordinary R.E.M. sleep returned. Their long spell of R.E.M.-free sleep did them no apparent harm, and they didn\u2019t experience any R.E.M.-sleep rebound.The results undermine the idea that R.E.M. sleep is essential to mammals, like food and water, Dr. Siegel said. In fact, the earlier studies on R.E.M. deprivation might not have been as compelling as they once seemed.In those earlier studies, researchers kept animals from going into R.E.M. sleep by waking them up. \u201cIn some experiments, they wake up the animals a thousand times a day,\u201d Dr. Siegel said.The stress of being awakened over and over could have done the animals harm, rather than just the lack of R.E.M. sleep in particular.A more telling clue about R.E.M. sleep can be found in human behavior, Dr. Siegel thinks. When people wake up on their own, they tend to move out of R.E.M. sleep and become alert. Those awakened from slow-wave sleep are groggy and disoriented.Dr. Siegel and his colleagues propose that the brain cools during slow-wave sleep. To keep the brain from getting too cold, however, the brain periodically unleashes a torrent of activity. Oxygen-rich blood flows into the brain to fuel the activity, warming the brain in the process.\u201cIt keeps the brain temperature within a functional limit by cycling on and off the same way your heater in your house might do at night,\u201d Dr. Siegel said.This explanation could also account for why dolphins don\u2019t experience R.E.M. sleep \u2014 and why seals don\u2019t as they swim.These marine mammals have evolved a half-brain style of sleeping, perhaps as a way to remain alert enough to avoid predators and drowning.Because part of the brain is always active, it\u2019s always warm. As a result, it never triggers R.E.M. sleep. Only when fur seals return to land and switch to sleeping with their entire brains do the organs cool enough to flip the switch.Niels C. Rattenborg, a sleep expert at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen, Germany, said the new study is \u201canother compelling piece of evidence questioning the importance of R.E.M. sleep.\u201dHe found Dr. Siegel\u2019s brain-shiver theory intriguing. But he wanted to see it put to the test.Neuroscientists have identified a clump of neurons in the brain stem as the switch that turns on R.E.M. sleep. Dr. Siegel\u2019s theory predicts that in fur seals the brain stem stays warm at sea but cools on land.\u201cUntil we have that test, it\u2019s an interesting idea but remains unproven,\u201d Dr. Rattenborg said.Advertisement"}

I was the artsy one and he the practical one as we went along, and I learned much about running this little farm. The horse, donkey, barn cats and two dogs are up with me right at sunrise. The primary change I\u2019ve made over the past year to my morning routine is having fewer breakfasts (though still some) of eggs. I mostly break the fast with cereal \u2014 resulting in a 20-point drop in my cholesterol from last year! There\u2019s often a surprise for me in the morning. Sometimes, it\u2019s just the mystical Blue Ridge mist lifting through the mountains. Other days, it\u2019s like this one from last weekend, when Catelyn the Aussie greeted me after she had a run-in with a skunk.I\u2019m usually awake by 5 a.m. I should make coffee and sit down to write for an hour. But lately the birds have been calling, and I\u2019ve been taking my coffee out to the front pond where I perch on the fence and watch the birds wake up the day.My cats won\u2019t let me sleep in, so one of the first things I have to do in the morning is fill their food bowls. I don\u2019t want to leave extra food out for them overnight because they will stuff themselves. Once they eat, they go into a food coma and snooze while I\u2019m getting ready for work. This is Billi (her name means \u201ckitty\u201d in Punjabi, which is what I speak with my parents).My morning routine varies. I have two small children and a husband who travels for work. If he is here, we all get up, and I take the dog for a walk while he takes our oldest to school. I am definitely a morning person, and morning is when I have my most energy, so I try to get as much done as possible before the afternoon school pickup. I always have my 3-year-old with me. Central Daylight TimeI\u2019m more of a late-night dance-party person than a morning person, so once I wake up I usually throw on a robe and make a pot of coffee, and feed Coco. I love sitting quietly for an hour and drinking that cup of coffee.Twice a week I go to a heated therapy pool in the morning to do physical therapy, including strength training and aqua jogging. I love it there because there is lots of sunlight in the pool.Sometimes my Uber goes the wrong way. A block past the hospital where the pool is, there is a little farm that has a bison at it. It\u2019s such a funny sight: being in the city one moment and staring at a bison another.Mountain Daylight TimeI like to set my alarm to some awkward time (7:04 a.m., say), rest for 10 minutes, and then \u2026 I am not one for routine. As soon as I get into one, I break it. Go on a hike, bike to work, write, talk with my dad. Pacific Daylight TimeI\u2019m retired, and typically wake at 2 a.m. for online typing to various groups I frequent. Sometimes I fall back to sleep until 7 a.m.; other times I just stay awake. Our (surfing) season started May 1 and we have a big swell going right now.Nepal TimeI wake up around 5:30-6 a.m. I am addicted to listening to local radio programs: The national newspapers recitation from 6 to 6:30 a.m., news from 6:30 to 7 a.m. and an interview about the latest political development with a prominent person from 7 to 7:30 a.m. I listen through a loudspeaker.While listening, I cook for myself. I am a true believer in breakfast. For breakfast, I always have toast with honey or butter, cornflakes or oats, eggs, coffee and milk.Eastern Africa TimeI normally wake up at 6:30 a.m. and observe the morning prayer. What happens next depends on the day\u2019s schedule. Early breakfast is not my thing. I live in a remote part of Uganda so my next activity is to go digging (using a hand hoe to prepare a garden for cultivation or remove unwanted grass from cultivated crops). Central European Summer TimeBear and I head out for his morning walk along the Rhine, and once we\u2019re back, I make a cup of tea, spend about 30 minutes on a German lesson, do some routine tidying and then start my writing day.Follow the Reader Center on Twitter: @ReaderCenter.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Ann Arbor, Mich., and Columbus, Ohio, are in the Eastern time zone.

{"Headline": "The Grape From Manchuela", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourWinemakers find a new appreciation for bobal, an obscure red grape from southeastern Spain, left behind as others from the region gained global fame.CASAS-IB\u00c1\u00d1EZ, Spain \u2014 For as long as history has paid attention to matters of wine, three red grapes have dominated production in southeastern Spain: garnacha, monastrell and bobal. Outside this small city and throughout the region of Manchuela, old vineyards of bobal (pronounced boh-BAHL) grow resolutely in sandy limestone soils, recognizable by their thick gnarled vines, trained for decades into free-standing goblet shapes. They stand in sharp contrast to neat rows of vines on wire trellises, evidence of efforts to modernize the region with international grapes like merlot, tempranillo or cabernet sauvignon. For the last decade or so, a handful of producers has striven to demonstrate the pleasures of bobal. They believe that Manchuela, written off for so long, has the capacity to make wines as fine as anywhere else. Working primarily in Manchuela, southeast of Madrid and inland from the coastal city of Valencia, and spilling over into the region of Utiel-Requena just to the east, these small producers, with little guidance from tradition or inspiration from great bobal wines elsewhere in the world, have resurrected old bobal vineyards and made wines that are both distinctive and delicious. It would be wrong to call Manchuela God-forsaken, but it seems to have been forsaken by most everybody else. Once the region was known for its saffron production. But, as with much of rural Europe, many residents in the mid-20th century fled agricultural work for the cities, leaving many small towns barren. Mr. de la Serna is from Madrid, but his wife\u2019s family is from Manchuela, which drew him to the area. In 1998, he bought land in Manchuela and started Finca Sandoval. He rented old vineyards of bobal, but on his own land he planted syrah and touriga nacional, a leading port grape. His 2016 Cuv\u00e9e TNS, a blend of touriga nacional with syrah, is deep and dark, fresh and complex. The flagship wine, Finca Sandoval, made of 70 percent syrah and the rest monastrell and bobal, smells like syrah but has an unusual flavor of exotic fruits and flowers.\u201cManchuela is like most southern European regions,\u201d he told me as we walked through a bobal vineyard planted in 1939 by the grandfather of his winemaker, Rafael Orozco. \u201cLet\u2019s not depend on a single variety, it\u2019s a trap.\u201d \u201cI think I was more right in introducing syrah than people who introduced cabernet sauvignon,\u201d he said. \u201cMy biggest responsibility is not to bobal, it\u2019s to Manchuela.\u201d Still, bobal is the most distinctive variety the region has to offer, and in the right hands, as at Bodegas Ponce, the wines can be fascinating. The tannins are firm, yes, but the grape also has great acidity and freshness and can transmit the nuances of terroir.\u201cSerious bobal has been made only over the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. de la Serna said. \u201cDoes it age? It\u2019s not yet clear.\u201dMr. Ponce manages a network of old vineyards, which he farms biodynamically, each of which shows a different perspective on bobal. La Casilla, from limestone, is supremely mineral yet light and elegant. La Estrecha, which comes from granite soils, is more savory and powerful, while Pino, named for a lone pine tree in the middle of a limestone vineyard about 2,500 feet in elevation, is the most complex.Perhaps his favorite vineyard is the 90-year-old P.F., for pie franco, meaning that the vines are ungrafted, a rarity in most of the fine-wine world. Since the 19th century, when a plague of phylloxera ravaged most of Europe\u2019s grapevines, the solution was to graft the European vines onto American roots, which are immune to the aphid. This vineyard, though, is on sandy soils, in which phylloxera cannot survive. The wine is stony, floral, herbal and fine.\u201cThis vineyard is the museum of the region,\u201d he said as we walked through it. \u201cIt is my identity: P.F., Pie Franco, Ponce Family.\u201dHe loves bobal, which he calls \u201cunique and mystical,\u201d yet as with Mr. de la Serna, the grape is not the crucial element.Mr. Ponce also makes Las Ca\u00f1adas, an exceptional ros\u00e9 of bobal; Reto, a lively, citrus-tinged white from the albillo de Albacete grape; and Depaula, a structured, deep red from monastrell grown south of Manchuela. In the hillier north of Manchuela, at an elevation of almost 3,500 feet, bobal is just one of many grapes grown by Rosal\u00eda Molina and Manolo Garrote at Altolandon. The husband-and-wife team work in the town of Landete near where three provinces, Cuenca, Teruel and Valencia meet. The wind blows constantly, hence the big wind turbines on a ridgeline nearby, and it is easy to be organic as the wind keeps things dry and fresh. Mr. Garrote manages the vineyards, and Ms. Molina makes the wines. They include the excellent white Do\u00f1a Leo, made of muscat, and another white, a spicy and unusual blend of chardonnay and petit manseng. Rayuelo is her bobal, citrus-edged and smelling like violets, with exotic fruit flavors and fine tannins. She also makes a savory cabernet franc and dense, floral garnacha, fermented and aged partly in amphora. Ms. Molina said she tries to make the wines as naturally as possible, without filtering and with a bare minimum of sulfur dioxide as a stabilizer. They are not typical in the region, which she said was a problem. \u201cDo we make everything good or do we make wines that will be commercial?\u201d she said. \u201cWe keep making the wines we want to make and try to explain why our wines are different, but it\u2019s difficult to explain our wines in Spain.\u201dPerhaps as a result, 90 percent of their wines are exported. They will soon be sold in New York through Skurnik Wines.If bobal\u2019s charms are not immediately obvious to everybody, they make themselves felt over time. When Toni Sarri\u00f3n first started making wines at Mustiguillo in Utiel in 1999, he was experimenting with tempranillo, cabernet sauvignon and merlot as well. But for his reds, he has settled on bobal, with a little garnacha and syrah, all grown organically in stony limestone vineyards. His first bobals were dense, tannic and oaky, but he learned over time that finesse brought out the best in bobal.\u201cNow I prefer elegance over power,\u201d he said. \u201cBobal keeps that edge of freshness, an advantage that neither garnacha nor monastrell have.\u201dHis best reds, largely bobal with perhaps some garnacha and syrah as well, are labeled either Finca Terrerazo or Quincha Corral, depending on the vineyard. They are bright and lively, though still tannic. His most unusual wine, however, is the Finca Calvestra white, made of the obscure merseguera grape and aged in acacia barrels. It tastes of apples, flowers and herbs.Bobal and merseguera. It may not have the ring of pinot noir and chardonnay, but nobody else has it except this part of Spain.  Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In China Trade War, Apple Worries It Will Be Collateral Damage", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, may be the leader of the world\u2019s most valuable public company, but lately he has had to act a lot like the tech industry\u2019s top diplomat.Last month he visited the Oval Office to warn President Trump that tough talk on China could threaten Apple\u2019s position in the country. In March, at a major summit meeting in Beijing, he called for \u201ccalmer heads\u201d to prevail between the world\u2019s two most powerful countries.Since he took over Apple from its co-founder Steve Jobs, in 2011, questions about whether Mr. Cook, 57, could recreate the magic that led to the iPod and iPhone have persisted. For Mr. Cook, the analogous breakthrough \u2014 and potentially his legacy as the heir to Mr. Jobs \u2014 has come not from a gadget, but from a geography: China.Under Mr. Cook\u2019s leadership, Apple\u2019s business in China grew from a fledgling success to an empire with annual revenues of around $50 billion \u2014 just a bit under a quarter of what the company takes in worldwide. He did this while China was tightening internet controls and shutting out other American tech giants.The Trump administration has told Mr. Cook that it would not place tariffs on iPhones, which are assembled in China, according to a person familiar with the talks who declined to speak on the record for fear of upsetting negotiations. But Apple is worried China will retaliate in ways that hamstring its business, according to three people close to Apple who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.There is also concern that Apple could face reprisals for legal and regulatory efforts in Washington that have made it difficult for the Chinese tech giant Huawei to sell its phones and telecom equipment in the United States.Apple executives and lobbyists in Beijing and Washington, led by Mr. Cook, have been trying to work both sides. They have fostered close ties to the administration of the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, an effort called Red Apple by employees at Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, after the official color of the Chinese Communist Party.At the same time, Mr. Cook has been pleading with the Trump White House to understand that a trade war is bad for the economy \u2014 and bad for Apple.Mr. Cook, who knows a bit of Mandarin, has attended China\u2019s most important political events in a critical year for Mr. Xi. Days after a Chinese Communist Party congress wrote Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas and name into the constitution, elevating him to the same status as Mao Zedong, Mr. Cook joined a small group of American and Chinese executives for a meeting where Mr. Xi lectured about innovation and reform.Later, Mr. Cook attended China\u2019s World Internet Conference, an effort by Beijing to create a Davos-like conference for technology. There he met Wang Huning, a new member of China\u2019s standing committee \u2014 the party\u2019s top leadership group \u2014 and an ideological force behind China\u2019s deepening authoritarianism.In March, just after an annual meeting of China\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament formally abolished presidential term limits, Mr. Cook attended a major summit meeting that brings together Chinese policymakers and corporate leaders.Then Mr. Cook switched to explaining why he thought a trade war would reverse the new tax law\u2019s progress, the people said. Mr. Cook told the president that tariffs were effectively a tax on consumers and that the trade deficit with China is inflated because of flaws in how it is calculated, one of the people said.\u201cHe was very helpful in making some suggestions, and I might also add he loves the tax cut and tax reform,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC shortly after the meeting. \u201cHe says Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.\u201dMr. Trump has also told crowds this year that Apple planned to build multiple factories in the United States. Apple has no plans to do so and has not publicly corrected him.He has met with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, but they tend to disagree on trade issues, this person said, and he has avoided engaging with perhaps the administration\u2019s most hawkish member on trade, Peter Navarro, a top adviser to the president.Mr. Cook still sees an opening to engage on the trade issue because of disagreement inside the White House, and he doubts that a trade war \u2014 or Chinese retaliation against Apple \u2014 ultimately will happen, this person said.\u201cHe\u2019s willing to put a brave face on and work with the Trump administration because they probably have more at stake than any other tech company when it comes to China and the tariffs,\u201d said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and partner at the investment firm Loup Ventures.The specter of Chinese retaliation against Apple has increased since the administration targeted the Chinese tech company ZTE for breaking American sanctions against Iran and North Korea. But the administration backed away from stiffer penalties this month and said it would fine ZTE $1 billion and install a compliance team picked by the United States.Apple, meanwhile, has a deal with China\u2019s biggest telecom company, China Mobile, giving it a direct channel to nearly 900 million subscribers in China. The competition to sell smartphones in the country has become increasingly intense, with a number of other Chinese companies also offering high-end \u2014 but usually lower-priced \u2014 phones.Mr. Cook\u2019s frequent visits to China are part of Apple\u2019s increased efforts to court China\u2019s leadership, started in 2016 after the country suddenly removed Apple\u2019s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store there.The company has reason to fear retaliation. In 2014, the Obama administration indicted five Chinese military hackers, stoking tensions already high from leaks about American surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.Apple\u2019s primary leverage with the Chinese government is Chinese consumers\u2019 love for Apple products, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents Apple and other tech companies.However, Mr. Garfield added, Chinese consumers would also love Facebook and Google, two products blocked in China. \u201cThere are limits,\u201d he said. \u201cXi and the national party will do what\u2019s in their interest.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco and Washington, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

He was pronounced dead at the scene. His daughters were not injured, Lieutenant Moore said.The autopsy report is pending, he added.Lieutenant Moore said there had been \u201cseveral shootings\u201d in the general area of Malibu Creek State Park in the past, none of which resulted in a fatality.\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that those past shootings are related to this shooting,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "The Trump Trade Slump May Yet Happen: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump broke with protocol by tweeting about jobs report\u2022 Investors have compared Facebook\u2019s actions to human rights violations\u2022 Deutsche Bank can\u2019t catch a break\u2022 Goldman\u2019s consumer finance plans are bigger than you thoughtBefore Donald Trump became president, many feared that the combative trade policies he was proposing would sock the U.S. economy and send unemployment higher.Is this unexpected state of affairs sustainable?If anything, the strength of the economy might persuade Mr. Trump that he can pursue his trade agenda without causing too much collateral damage at home. That could mean following through on his threats to impose tariffs on Chinese products totaling as much as $150 billion.Whether Mr. Trump does so should become clear soon. On June 15, the administration is scheduled to release a final list of $50 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs, which would then be imposed shortly thereafter.Some in the administration have warned that a protectionist trade policy could drag the economy and the stock market. But the longer the economy keeps churning out jobs, and the longer the stock market remains resilient, the harder it will be for those advisers to make their case. Indeed, the U.S. may be less sensitive to trade frictions than economists and investors previously believed.But that is a very optimistic scenario, and much could still go wrong.The metals tariffs, alone, are unlikely to crater the markets or hammer the economy. But a full-blown trade war with China, involving $150 billion of tariffs and everything China has promised in retaliation, would almost certainly shake the confidence of investors and businesses. Tomasz Wieladek, an economist at Barclays, in a report on Friday said the metals tariffs and those against China, along with retaliatory actions, could knock nearly a full percentage point off global growth.The fact that the stock market hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since mid-February,when the trade rhetoric heated up, suggests investors never really shrugged off the prospect of trade wars. Now, as a confrontation with China approaches, markets may become volatile as investors prepare for the fallout.It\u2019s also important to remember that the strength of the economy is not an unalloyed positive. If the buoyant conditions, and the impact of new tariffs, produce higher inflation, the Federal Reserve will have less leeway to relax monetary policy in response to a big trade shock or a stock market plunge. In other words, investors would have no protection from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.One way to view the current situation is that Mr. Trump is an opportunist who has astutely ridden an economic expansion that had long been underway \u2013 and is now hoping it will carry him through a drawn-out trade battle.It\u2019s a bold, far from certain, bet.\u2014Peter EavisThe Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month. The night before, under longstanding tradition, the president and several senior administration officials \u2014 including the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 are briefed on the numbers, which they are not supposed to disclose until the report is made public at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning.But Mr. Trump, who was briefed on the numbers Thursday evening, appeared to foreshadow the strength of the latest report on Friday morning on Twitter.Market watchers saw evidence that the tweet was moving markets.Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, pushed back on whether Mr. Trump broke with protocol.President Trump tweeted earlier this morning that he was looking forward to the jobs report. We now know why.Drew Armstrong, a reporter at Bloomberg, tweeted the strong reaction of the dollar after the report\u2019s release:SoftBank\u2019s investment in G.M.\u2019s driverless car division and Waymo\u2019s move to create a huge fleet of robot-taxis suggest maybe not.G.M. CruiseWaymoThose numbers don\u2019t bode well for Uber\u2019s autonomous car technology. SoftBank\u2019s investment only serves to reinforce that ill feeling.What\u2019s next for Uber\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWall Street profit forecasts follow a typical trajectory: Start high and steadily decline until the company reports and usually beats that lowered bar.Through the first two months of the second quarter, that\u2019s not happening. Analysts have raised second-quarter earnings estimates for S.&P. 500 companies 0.2 percent during April and May, according to FactSet.That might not seem like much, but over the past 10 years, quarterly earnings estimates have declined, on average, 3.7 percent during the first two months of that quarter.The gain so far this quarter falls well short of the record set during the first two months of the first quarter of this year. As analysts factored in tax cuts signed into law in late 2017, they raised profit expectations 5.7 percent in January and February.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the centrist Democrat from North Dakota who is fighting a pitched battle to save her seat, has gotten a lift from an unlikely source: the conservative billionaire Koch brothers.The ad is the latest evidence that the brothers, often at odds with President Trump, may be moving away from strictly partisan work on behalf of Republicans in favor of initiatives that will advance their libertarian-leaning legislative priorities, including free trade, immigration legislation and access to medicines, regardless of party affiliation.Ms. Heitkamp is one of 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump in 2016, but unlike other Democrats, she has drawn a top-flight challenger in Kevin Cramer, North Dakota\u2019s lone House member and a close ally of the president\u2019s. Her seat is one of the keys to Republican efforts to hold on to or expand the party\u2019s one-seat Senate majority.The former Treasury secretary has joined the board of the Financial Services Volunteer Corps, an organization that helps build up the banking systems in developing countries, the group announced on Friday.Founded in 1990 at the behest of President George H.

{"Headline": "Mesa Police Officers Who Beat Unarmed Man on Video Are Put on Leave", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour police officers in Mesa, Ariz., have been placed on administrative leave after a surveillance video showed some of them repeatedly punching an unarmed black man and pushing him to the ground during an arrest.Footage of last month\u2019s arrest shows a man, Robert Johnson, 35, speaking on a cellphone on what looks like a balcony of an apartment building before officers emerged from an elevator shortly before midnight on May 23. They were apparently responding to a domestic disturbance call.The officers then told Mr. Johnson, who was leaning against a railing, to sit down, Chief Batista said. The video, which did not have sound, showed officers struggling with him and trying to force him to sit. Then they punched, kicked and pushed him to the ground, where he was handcuffed.Mr. Johnson was then asked to move away from the railing and given an instruction, Chief Batista said, narrating the video. \u201cWhen the person didn\u2019t sit down, our officers then engaged in use of force to make him sit down,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t feel that our officers were at their best,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that this situation needed to go in the way that it went.\u201dHe said the officers were taken off active service while the department investigates.Mr. Johnson was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and hindering prosecution, according to jail records. He was released on his own recognizance on May 24 and is scheduled to be arraigned in Mesa Municipal Court on June 19, court and jail records show.Messages and emails left at the Mesa Police Department on Wednesday were not answered. The officers involved were not identified.Andre Miller, the pastor at New Beginnings Christian Church in Mesa, which Mr. Johnson attends, said in an interview on Wednesday that Mr. Johnson had gone to the apartment complex to help a friend retrieve belongings from a residence.He said Mr. Johnson had seen a doctor for head and chest injuries after the episode. \u201cThis is a culture that we are trying to combat which is bigger than Mr. Johnson,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt is not a race issue but it is a policing culture.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Johnson, Benjamin Taylor, said on Wednesday: \u201cThat was excessive force. To have all these officers attack him and punch him in the head was uncalled-for, and they should be prosecuted.\u201dMr. Kirkpatrick said at the news conference that he had called the police about an intruder and then fell asleep on his couch while officers were still on the scene.

{"Headline": "N\u00eddia Is Bringing the Sound of Lisbon\u2019s Ghettos to the World", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQUINTA DO ANJO, Portugal \u2014 Across the River Tagus from central Lisbon, at a venue surrounded by fruit warehouses and storage units, one of Portugal\u2019s most exciting dance music producers was deep in concentration behind the decks. She was not banging out electronic beats at a sold-out club, however. A crowd jostled around a buffet table. In the corner stood a tiered cake. And the producer\u2019s mother was busy pouring glasses of sparkling melon wine and showing guests family photographs on her phone.It was unusual to see the music producer, N\u00eddia Borges, 21, in this setting, playing wedding D.J. for a cousin, but this afternoon was the only time she had to meet before setting off on tour across the United States. Ms. Borges is known onstage as \u201cN\u00eddia,\u201d though she used to call herself \u201cN\u00eddia Minaj\u201d in tribute to her favorite rapper, Nicki Minaj. She dropped the last name because, she said later in an interview, \u201cToday I have my own identity. I\u2019m not going to imitate something that someone has done already.\u201dMs. Borges\u2019s music brings together a host of genres from across Portuguese-speaking Africa, including kizomba, funan\u00e1, tarraxinha and the popular electro bounce of kuduro. At the wedding disco, the playlist was heavy on traditional sounds for an older audience. But for her own productions, Ms. Borges mixes these childhood influences with polyrhythms, frantic beats, air horns and elements of genres like trance, European techno, Afro-house and American R&B. Her drums thwack like a bucking bronco. The result is as dizzying as it is danceable.\u201cCalm music is for couples,\u201d said Ms. Borges, whose mother is from Guinea-Bissau and whose father comes from Cape Verde. \u201cHere, it has to be like an explosion in your face.\u201d She said this confrontational sound was partly a result of a Portuguese music industry that had ignored the African diaspora. \u201cWhen something comes out of the ghetto, it can\u2019t come softly,\u201d she added. \u201cIt has to have strength.\u201dThere are hundreds of producers making experimental dance music of this kind. Many, with family backgrounds in former Portuguese colonies like Angola, Mozambique and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, can be found in the housing projects around the Lisbon area. Each producer has a distinct take on the African-Portuguese sound, and it is constantly mutating from neighborhood to neighborhood. As a result, it doesn\u2019t have a fixed name, but it is often referred to in Portuguese simply as \u201cbatida,\u201d or \u201cbeats\u201d.In France, Ms. Borges said, she would skip classes to play shows: Her teachers were powerless. (\u201cThey\u2019re not my parents, they can\u2019t keep me at home,\u201d she said.) That combative attitude offers one explanation for why she never felt daunted by trying to break into a male-dominated scene.People \u201cthink I\u2019m going to sing, they never think that I\u2019m a D.J.,\u201d Ms. Borges said, but, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t have to prove anything to anyone.\u201dHer music is agitated, but in person she\u2019s relaxed \u2014 almost to the point of being unreadable. Her unwillingness to show vulnerability \u201ccomes from our African community, because we suffer racism,\u201d she said. When someone sees you are shy, she continued, \u201cThey will bully you like in school. You have to be tough.\u201dThe Vale da Amoreira district, where Ms. Borges grew up, is notable for its high proportion of housing projects, though Ms. Borges\u2019s family home is privately owned. A year ago, she moved back from Bordeaux to the apartment where she spent her childhood. In one room, she has built a music studio with stretches of foam soundproofing clinging to the walls. Becoming a D.J. changed her life, she said, because she was able to buy music equipment and a car, things that were out of reach to most young people in the neighborhood.Backstage, Mr. Silva \u2014 D.J. Marfox \u2014 explained that batida was \u201cthe identity of the ghettos.\u201d He said Noite Pr\u00edncipe was \u201cthe first night where 100 percent of the music is made in Portugal by African descendants.\u201d Ms. Borges\u2019s music, he added, has a \u201cvery particular sound,\u201d and there was \u201ca certain firmness in what she does.\u201dJo\u00e3o Branko of the Portuguese band Buraka Som Sistema, said in an email that it was the contrast between harshness and light that made Ms. Borges\u2019s music so compelling. \u201cThe most striking sonic differences for me,\u201d he said, \u201care the softer, nonobvious musical textures that she fuses with the more aggressive, and \u2014 most of the time \u2014 more creative, rhythm patterns.\u201d He summed up her sound as \u201cspiky and dissonant,\u201d adding that her breakthrough was just the start of wider recognition. \u201cIt feels like the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cLisbon\u2019s club culture has hacked the music industry, and there\u2019s no turning back.\u201dBut Ms. Borges was reluctant about leading the charge. While she would be gratified if her sound galvanized the next generation of local D.J.s, she \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be an example,\u201d she said.\u201cMarfox was the one who started it all, and he opened doors,\u201d Ms. Borges said. \u201cMaybe we will open doors for others to come after us, too.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Ms. Borges\u2019s connection to a wedding party at which she performed. It was a cousin\u2018s wedding, not a family friend\u2019s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Group of 7 Looks for Relevance as It Gathers in Canada", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeven nations are getting together to discuss gender equality with a leader who once bragged about grabbing women\u2019s genitals, pluralism and tolerance with politicians who have promised to turn away refugees, and economic cooperation with a country severing ties with its neighbors.What could go wrong?Welcome to the Group of 7 Summit in Charlevoix, Quebec, a gathering of the leaders of seven countries that once dominated the world economy, but now struggle with the forces of globalization they helped to unleash.The members of the Group of 7 \u2014 the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan \u2014 once stood together against communism. But now they are often in conflict with each other and struggling to prove their relevance amid China\u2019s growing power.The agenda put together by Canada, this year\u2019s host, would not have provoked much controversy a few years ago. Women\u2019s empowerment. Climate change. Adapting to the changing nature of work.But the old assumptions about shared values no longer apply. This is the era of a president who is reputed to have had an affair with a pornographic film actress and left the Paris climate accord. It is a time of surging populism in Europe.President Trump did not do much to promote a feel-good atmosphere in Charlevoix with his plans to impose punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the other six Group of 7 members. Late in May, Mr. Trump went even further, taking steps to impose tariffs on imported automobiles, a measure that would strike Germany especially hard.In Italy, the two strongest parties in recent elections were a protest party and hard-right nationalists who promised to crack down on illegal immigration and end sanctions against Russia. They, too, were on a collision course with the European Union after threatening to violate its budget rules to fulfill populist campaign promises.Even without those tensions, the group\u2019s relevance has been declining. The members of the club once ruled the world stage. But their share of the global economy has fallen from more than two thirds in the early 1990s to less than half. The group accounts for only about 10 percent of the world\u2019s population, and many Group of 7 societies are aging.The diminished stature of the Group of 7 countries raises questions about their claim to make decisions on global issues. The Group of 7 has already largely been eclipsed by the Group of 20, which includes China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, and more closely represents the way that wealth and people are distributed.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, did not even mention the Charlevoix meeting at a conference organized by Mr. Snower\u2019s group on May 28.\u201cGlobal issues can only be solved globally,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, adding that her view \u201cis not shared by everyone.\u201dIn an obvious reference to Mr. Trump, Ms. Merkel said: \u201cMultilateral action is currently under pressure, indeed in crisis. It is challenged by protectionism and isolationist thinking.\u201dIs there any point in getting together at all?The Canadians, who last hosted the Group of 7 summit meeting in 2010, will try to find enough common ground to reach agreement on enough issues to claim success. The themes of the meeting, which Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, announced on Facebook in December, are vague enough to leave some leeway. Who could possibly be against \u201cbuilding a more peaceful and secure world\u201d?According to Mr. Kirton, there may even be progress on gender issues, despite the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to deny funding for birth control programs. Last year\u2019s summit meeting in Taormina, Sicily, last year, may serve as a guide.Afterward, the leaders, including Mr. Trump, issued a communiqu\u00e9 in favor of promoting more women to leadership positions in government and business, and promoting entrepreneurship by women. The Taormina communiqu\u00e9 avoided terms like \u201creproductive rights\u201d that would rile Mr. Trump\u2019s right-wing base.\u201cOne can think of it as the Ivanka Trump agenda,\u201d Mr. Kirton said, referring to the president\u2019s daughter. \u201cThere is more to be done,\u201d he said, including promoting better education for girls.Mr. Kirton, who takes an optimistic view of the summit meeting, even sees potential in its goal of \u201cgrowth that works for everyone,\u201d a slogan that can be given a Trumpian, populist spin.\u201cThere Trudeau and Trump are very much aligned \u2014 bringing economic benefits to the working class,\u201d Mr. Kirton said.Even when they dislike each other, the group\u2019s leaders usually manage to issue communiqu\u00e9s that gloss over their differences. It may help that, except for a limited number of pool reporters, the news media will be in Quebec City, about 50 miles from Charlevoix.The meeting\u2019s venue is so rural that much of the surrounding region had little or no cellphone coverage or broadband internet until local infrastructure was upgraded for the event. The distance between the leaders and the media may make it harder for journalists to report on points of conflict and harder for political leaders to grandstand.But some leaders have signaled that they do not plan to avoid sensitive topics like trade or the Paris accord. In a statement for the G-7 Research Group\u2019s report, the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, did not mention Mr. Trump by name, but alluded to areas where Europe and Mr. Trump disagree sharply.Mr. Macron said the Paris agreement was \u201ca vital necessity,\u201d that \u201cwe must have free and fair trade,\u201d and that the leaders should \u201cdefend the achievements of multilateralism.\u201d\u201cA century after the end of the Great War, let us not repeat the errors of the past,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cLet us remain vigilant, moved by a desire to take collective, pragmatic and effective action.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They weren\u2019t supposed to be on the same flight, but their chance encounter came to be widely known and celebrated.The girl, Clara Daly, 15, and her mother were traveling home to Calabasas, Calif., and had planned to fly nonstop from Boston to Los Angeles. Their flight was canceled, so Alaska Airlines booked them on another flight with a layover in Portland, Ore.That\u2019s how Clara ended up meeting Tim Cook, 64. Mr. Cook, who is deaf and blind, wasn\u2019t able to communicate easily with the flight attendants.\u201cThe flight attendants sincerely wanted to assist him, but had no way to communicate,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI watched as they didn\u2019t flinch when he reached out to touch their faces and arms. They took his hand and tried so hard to communicate with him, to no avail.\u201dThe attendants asked if anyone onboard knew American Sign Language. Clara, who had taken sign language classes for a year, pressed the call button.The attendants asked her to sign letters into Mr. Cook\u2019s hand, so she knelt in front of him and began spelling out words.\u201cHow are you?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you O.K.?\u201dThey chatted a few times during the flight, once for about 30 minutes. She told him where she went to school and about her grandmother in Boston. He told her about his childhood and about his sister, who also lives in Boston.\u201cIt seems like such a lonely life to be deaf and blind \u2014 to not be able to see and hear,\u201d Clara said on Sunday.Ms. Scribner, 56, who was traveling to Seaside, Ore., and sitting in the same row as Mr. Cook, took a picture of the two of them: Clara looking intently at Mr. Cook\u2019s face as she signed into his hands, which were clasped around hers.Ms. Scribner said she is in the habit of posting one positive thing on Facebook every day, so she wrote about the pair and attached the picture.\u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve ever seen so many people rally to take care of another human being,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAll of us in the immediate rows were laughing and smiling and enjoying his obvious delight in having someone to talk to.\u201dAt various points during the conversation \u201cthey were both laughing,\u201d she said on Sunday. \u201cHis frustration was greatly reduced. You could just see him lighten up.\u201dA friend asked her to make the post public so it could be shared, and shared it was.

Made him stand up, get into a warrior pose and scream.\u201cI was so self-conscious about the nanny and the housekeeper that I didn\u2019t want them to hear me screaming in the living room,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI think that that\u2019s such a metaphor of something for the existence of so-called well-off people that they\u2019re not really well-off \u2014 they won\u2019t even scream in their own house.\u201dHe was reluctant. But he screamed.The fix wasn\u2019t instantaneous. \u201cI still felt self-conscious,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my confidence back.\u201d But it was a start.Certainly, casual dismissal of Kanye has always been a built-in feature of his fame, but in terms of public perception, it\u2019s possible he\u2019s never been more radioactive. The world is now more skeptical and less patient. Over the past decade and a half, objection has tended to roll off him; now it\u2019s sticking.But over two days of extended interviews that took place in his rented Amangani Resort home, on long walks through Jackson, and in lengthy car rides spanning eastern Idaho to Yellowstone National Park \u2014 edited excerpts from which are included below \u2014 Kanye was calm, measured, verging on beatific, and also self-aware and willing to reckon with the challenges he\u2019d created for himself.He is, comparatively, pragmatic \u2014 attuned to his own limitations, mindful of the shifting pecking orders in hip-hop and fashion, interested in coexistence rather than conflict. And though it was almost two miles from the restaurant to the Movieworks Cinema 4, where he wanted to see \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story,\u201d he decided to walk.The day was bright, crisp, a little cool, and his step was brisk. He was wearing a black-gray-and-white flannel shirt, black Patagonia fleece pants, unreleased Yeezy 700s and an industrial-orange ski cap. His security was pacing him in a pair of black Suburbans, going slow in the fast lane, or slipping in and out of adjacent parking lots.Kanye barely acknowledged them, though \u2014 instead he focused on the kids. Dozens of them. They ran out of restaurants and asked for pictures, or pulled their cars over to the side of the road, some of them blasting \u201cYe.\u201d The unplanned attention might have unnerved Kanye in the past, but now he looked pleased to be interrupted. And he made sure to ask what every single kid\u2019s favorite song was.\u201cThere were people who said Trump would never win,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the it-will-never-happens of the world, people in high school told you things would never happen.\u201d To his mind, he was supporting a friend and kindred spirit, and also speaking up in a way others wouldn\u2019t \u2014 as is his wont, generally.\u201cI felt that I knew people who voted for Trump that were celebrities that were scared to say that they liked him. But they told me, and I liked him, and I\u2019m not scared to say what I like,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me come over here and get in this fight with you.\u201dIs there anything a person could do that is so beyond the pale that you would not support them, even if you liked them?I wanted to make my album cover the doctor that performed my mom\u2019s last surgery. I think that\u2019s pretty big on the cancel-culture territory. I\u2019m starting saying, \u201cI\u2019m not canceling him,\u201d \u2019cause the world canceled him. I believe in the court of public opinion that that thought has to change. Do you feel there is an expectation of you \u2014 because you\u2019re a successful black man in this country \u2014 to take on certain political or cultural positions?Oh yeah, definitely. When I was in high school, most of my opinions were, like, only me and a couple people who thought like me.But now you feel the pressure to speak for a whole group of people?Nah. It\u2019s a rhetorical dumbass question \u2014 you could just say yes \u2014 but do you think there are a lot of husband-and-wife situations where the husband in the household liked Trump and voted on Trump and maybe the wife didn\u2019t, or vice versa?Of course.Man, I had my [expletive] [expletive] castrated: \u201cYou have to like Hillary. That\u2019s got to be your choice.\u201dThat\u2019s what the family was telling you?When did that change happen?Getting out, learning how to not be highly medicated and, you know, just standing up saying I know I could lose a lot of things, but just standing up and saying what you feel, and not even doing a lot of research on it. Having a political opinion that\u2019s overly informed, it\u2019s like knowing how to dress, as opposed to being a child \u2014 \u201cI like this.\u201d I hear Trump talk and I\u2019m like, I like the way it sounds, knowing that there\u2019s people who like me that don\u2019t like the way it sounds.But if he says something like he doesn\u2019t want to let Muslims into the country, do you like the way that sounds?No, I don\u2019t agree with all of his policies.If he\u2019d come into the public eye via technology, not music \u2014 if he were white, not black \u2014 Kanye might be viewed as a lovable, idiosyncratic futurist, not a perennial agitator.\u201cWe need to be able to be in situations where you can be irresponsible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great privileges of an artist. An artist should be irresponsible in a way \u2014 a 3-year-old.\u201dFully rendering his speech would require something akin to musical notation \u2014 markings to denote speed, spacing, emphasis, even the words\u2019 seriousness or lack thereof, or the percent to which he was certain of what he was saying as opposed to just trying a thought out. (Twitter is in some ways the medium least well suited to his thought process. He isn\u2019t gnomic, or pithy; he\u2019s roundabout, elaborative.)This is, generally speaking, an approach incompatible with a media environment that ruthlessly records, dissects and parses each moment, examining it hard for flaws.Or not. \u201cI felt like it was something missing,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI just had a gut innate feeling to go to TMZ.\u201dBut most crucially, and most alarmingly, he said that 400 years of slavery \u201csound like a choice.\u201dHe continued, delineating the path of many a Kanye West public conflagration. \u201cI think an extreme thing; I adjust it, I adjust it, I adjust it,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I get to it, but I have to push to, you know, the furthest concept possible.\u201dThe TMZ appearance essentially squandered all of the public good will Kanye had accumulated earlier in the day \u2014 except in the view of Kanye, who naturally saw the two media appearances as part of the same continuum.\u201cI think it was totally beautiful, both of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Charlamagne one was like the most beautiful funeral you\u2019ve ever been to, and you close the casket, and say this is done.\u201dAnd the TMZ one?How does it make you feel when you know an experiment didn\u2019t work?Awesome. I learned so much. I learned about the context of the idea of the word slave. I didn\u2019t take it in that context. I think that my personality and energy mirrors Nat Turner, or it had in the past, but that showed me that also that Nat Turner approach would land me in the same place Nat Turner landed, and that I would be legendary but also just a martyr. But I guess we\u2019re all martyrs eventually, and we\u2019re all guaranteed to die. To clarify, do you believe that slavery in this country was a choice?Well, I never said that. If you could say it again how would you frame it?I wouldn\u2019t frame a one-liner or a headline. What I would say is actually it\u2019s literally like I feel like I\u2019m in court having to justify a robbery that I didn\u2019t actually commit, where I\u2019m having to somehow reframe something that I never said. I feel stupid to have to say out loud that I know that being put on the boat was \u2014 but also I\u2019m not backing down, bro. What I will do is I\u2019ll take responsibility for the fact that I allowed my voice to be used back to back in ways that were not protective of it when my voice means too much.Back to back?Wearing the [Trump] hat, because my voice is unprotected, and I believe that the black community wants to protect my voice. By me saying slave in any way at TMZ left my voice unprotected. So it\u2019s not a matter of the facts of if I said that exact line or not, it\u2019s the fact that I put myself in a position to be unprotected by my tribe.Do you feel that if black fans abandon you, that\u2019s something that you could come back from? Do you think that is a death blow?It\u2019s not going to happen.It\u2019s just not going to happen?Within a minute, he was fixated on the store\u2019s offerings: well-worn ski jackets, fleeces, snow pants and more. Nothing fancy or luxury, just styles so mainstream as to be almost vernacular.Kanye pressed Mr. Abloh for more: \u201cI\u2019m not canceled out the culture? People are listening to it?\u201d \u201cYou see me and Virgil\u2019s relationship,\u201d he said in the S.U.V. on the ride back from the secondhand store. \u201cI don\u2019t know what might have been in your mind, but there might have been some place where you wonder if those dudes still talk like that. And you saw, we do.\u201dWhat did you have to cleanse to get to that place, to be back at that rhythm?Jealousy and fear.Fear of what?Losing \u201cruler,\u201d \u201cking,\u201d \u201ccrown.\u201d And it was this thing where it\u2019s like O.K., you\u2019re not the No. 1 rapper, Drake\u2019s the No. 1 rapper, but you\u2019re the No. 1 with shoes, or this or that. And it\u2019s like yo, no more No. 1s. What\u2019s the No. 1 tree over there? Just be one of them. All of them are beautiful. If you cut one of those trees down, what would it be worth? Those look like $400,000 trees, just one of them, and look at how many of them are.Perhaps the most consequential lyrics of this Kanye era are about mental health. On Pusha-T\u2019s \u201cWhat Would Meek Do?\u201d he declaims, \u201cNo more hidin\u2019 the scars/I show \u2019em like Seal, right?\u201d On \u201cYikes,\u201d from \u201cYe,\u201d he announced the bipolar disorder diagnosis. \u201cThat\u2019s my superpower,\u201d he scream-rapped. \u201cAin\u2019t no disability/I\u2019m a superhero! I\u2019m a superhero!\u201dAnd on the \u201cYe\u201d opener, \u201cI Thought About Killing You,\u201d the clouds get darker: \u201cToday I thought about killing you, premeditated murder/I think about killing myself/And I, I love myself way more than I love you.\u201dOh yeah, I\u2019ve thought about killing myself all the time. It\u2019s always a option and [expletive]. Like Louis C.K. said: I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options.Later, he added: \u201cI\u2019m just having this epiphany now, \u2019cause I didn\u2019t do it, but I did think it all the way through. But if I didn\u2019t think it all the way through, then it\u2019s actually maybe more of a chance of it happening.\u201d\u201cDid you see my tweet?\u201d he asked. Overnight, he\u2019d sent out a missive putting an end to the reignited feud between Pusha-T and Drake, in so much as someone who was not one of the primary participants can do that.Friction between Kanye and Drake has replaced friction between Kanye and Jay-Z as hip-hop\u2019s central Oedipal drama even if at this point the two are, for all intents and purposes, peers. (At one point, they were recording music for a possible collaborative album.)Kanye has long worked with songwriters \u2014 something that, because it\u2019s perceived as heterodoxy, is rarely discussed openly. In this moment of increased transparency, though, he\u2019s become Zen about sharing the details.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible how we just sit there and just think and rethink and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite,\u201d he said of his studio sessions. \u201cWe\u2019re not pulling off a magic trick here. We\u2019re like Tesla, we\u2019re not \u2018The Prestige.\u2019\u201dSince leaving the hospital, Kanye had been compiling notes about his experiences and feelings. For \u201cYe,\u201d he turned them over to various writers, so that they might help put structure to the thoughts.Many are people he\u2019s worked with for years and trusts implicitly. CyHi the Prynce is, he said, the best at finding those shapes. The line on \u201cAll Mine\u201d about Stormy Daniels, that came from Consequence. \u201cSometimes I take all the shine/talk like I drank all the wine,\u201d on \u201cGhost Town,\u201d was contributed by Malik Yusef.In the same way the clothes in the secondhand store struck Kanye as very Yeezy, the same goes for other rappers\u2019 words and flows. And like the clothes, he chooses freely among them for inspiration, building his public, creative self from all the parts available to him. He even cited the way Tony Robbins delivers his messages as a songwriting inspiration. \u201cThis is a really interesting moment,\u201d he said of discussing this process openly. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a controversial moment, right?\u201dJumping out of the car at a rest stop, he said, \u201cI hope they got a fresh-ass T-shirt.\u201d They don\u2019t, but he buys some small toys for his children, and stocks up on Doritos and jerky for the road.As the Suburban pushed onward into Yellowstone National Park, he tried to call Kim, but reception was bad and he couldn\u2019t get through. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to tell my girl I\u2019m going to Yellowstone, \u2019cause we never did it,\u201d he said. A few minutes later, he added with a shrug, \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it looks the same as where we stay.\u201dIf there has been a corrective force during this tumultuous period, it\u2019s been Kim, whom Kanye married in 2014. They now have three children: 5-year-old North; 2-year-old Saint and 5-month-old Chicago. Their lives and businesses are symbiotic. She flew to Wyoming to celebrate at the ranch with Kanye, and over the next two days, they checked in regularly by phone. At one point, she sent him a video of North singing the chorus of \u201cNo Mistakes,\u201d and he watched it dozens of times, ignoring everyone in the room.One of the most affecting songs on \u201cYe\u201d is \u201cWouldn\u2019t Leave,\u201d in which Kanye suggests that his TMZ appearance put his marriage at risk.\u201cThere was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, \u2018Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo that was a real conversation.\u201dLike many of the songs on \u201cYe,\u201d this one functions as both personal and professional, micro and macro, individual and universal. Kanye is serenading not just his wife, but also the fans who stuck by him during this most trying period.Or as he put it on \u201cNo Mistakes,\u201d \u201cFor all my dogs that stayed down, we up again.\u201dStaying down, he understands, has not been a given. \u201cHalf that audience that was there last night, half the people that are listening to the album are supposed to not listen to the album right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m canceled. I\u2019m canceled because I didn\u2019t cancel Trump.\u201d (On a call earlier in the day with Khlo\u00e9, he acknowledged the challenge: \u201cI set the video game on the hardest setting possible, the most hate possible.\u201d) Getting comfortable with the dissonance, that\u2019s the thing. For someone who spent the whole of his early career in conquer mode, constantly questioning anyone who doubted him, accepting that you can\u2019t always control your own narrative is a kind of growth. Along the way, there will be missteps, setbacks, even upheavals. The healthiest choice, Kanye has discovered, is to learn from them, accept them and absorb them into who he\u2019s becoming.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a rapper who has worked with Kanye West. He is CyHi the Prynce, not CyHi the Prince.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Killing of Antwon Rose, 17, in East Pittsburgh Prompts Protests", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fatal shooting this week by an East Pittsburgh, Pa., police officer of an unarmed teenager who was attempting to flee prompted more protests on Thursday and calls for answers from law enforcement officials.The authorities confirmed on Thursday that Antwon was struck three times but did not specify where.\u201cWhy are they shooting?\u201d the woman recording the video says. \u201cAll they did was run and they\u2019re shooting at them!\u201dThe Allegheny County Police Department, which is investigating the encounter, said that two firearms were found on the floor of the car. When asked if the 17-year-old was found with a weapon on him, Coleman McDonough, the department\u2019s superintendent, said he was not.On Thursday, Mike Manko, a spokesman for the Allegheny County District Attorney\u2019s Office, confirmed reports that Antwon, while unarmed, had an empty clip of a handgun in his pants pocket at the time he was shot.In a statements on Thursday, the authorities identified the East Pittsburgh officer who fired as Michael H. Rosfeld.Attempts to reach Officer Rosfeld, 30, by phone were unsuccessful. The law firm of Marshall Dennehey Warner Coleman & Goggin confirmed that it was representing the officer, but a lawyer for the firm did not immediately return requests for comment Thursday night.Officials said Officer Rosfeld had worked for the Oakmont Borough Police Department, which is about 15 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, as a part-time patrol officer from 2011 to 2013. Jason Domaratz, the police chief in Harmar Township, said Officer Rosfeld joined the Harmar Township Police Department, just across the Allegheny River, in February 2012 as a part-time patrol officer. Officer Rosfeld stayed there for less than a year before he accepted a full-time position with the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Police Department, Chief Domaratz said.Chief Domaratz said it was common for officers to apply to both the Harmar Township and Oakmont Borough departments because of their proximity to each another and to change jobs frequently while they try to secure a full-time position with benefits.\u201cI don\u2019t remember anything out of the ordinary,\u201d Chief Domaratz said on Thursday, adding that the officer did not get in trouble while he was part of his department and never fired his weapon.Joseph Miksch, a University of Pittsburgh spokesman, said Officer Rosfeld was employed as a full-time police officer at the university from October 2012 to Jan. 18 of this year. Citing confidential personnel records, he said he could not comment on the officer\u2019s performance or say why he left the department.In a statement on Wednesday night, S. Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing Antwon\u2019s family, said: \u201cWe know very little about the circumstances surrounding his death at this early stage. We must emphasize that rumors of him being involved in a separate shooting are unsubstantiated. We know that he was not armed at the time he was shot down, that he posed no immediate threat to anyone, and that, significantly, the driver of the vehicle he occupied was released from police custody.\u201dOn Wednesday evening, dozens of people gathered outside the East Pittsburgh Police Department to protest the black teenager\u2019s death. \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d they chanted. Some carried signs that said, \u201cJustice4Antwon\u201d and \u201c#BlackLivesMatter.\u201d Then on Thursday, hundreds of people rallied outside of the Allegheny County Courthouse; later Thursday evening, protesters poured onto Interstate 376, blocking it.\u201cHe was an excellent student,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, adding that Antwon was taking Advanced Placement classes.Kim Ransom, the owner of the Pittsburgh Gymnastics Club, where Antwon worked for about a year, recalled the sweltering day in 2015 that he interviewed to work at the club as an instructor.\u201cHe brought his typed-up r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and he was wearing a full three-piece suit with his shiny shoes and he was sweating profusely,\u201d she said.\u201cI just thought it was very cute. I think he was 14 at the time,\u201d she continued. \u201cSomeone in his life must have been guiding him in the right direction.\u201dHe got the job and began coaching children in an after-school program and other classes.\u201cEverybody loved him here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very mature.\u201dThe traffic stop on Tuesday that led to the deadly shooting occurred after multiple 911 calls earlier in the night reported a shooting in North Braddock, Pa., that had wounded a 22-year-old man in the abdomen, the police said. He was treated at a trauma center and later released.Investigators said a gunman in a passing vehicle had fired nine .40-caliber rounds at the 22-year-old, who returned fire.The 911 callers described a vehicle they saw fleeing the scene, the police said, and Officer Rosfeld saw a similar vehicle \u2014 a silver Chevrolet Cruze that appeared to have ballistics damage to its rear window.\u201cI\u2019m very confident that that was the vehicle involved in the shooting,\u201d Superintendent McDonough said.Officer Rosfeld stopped the car at 8:40 p.m. and took the driver into custody, the authorities said.\u201cWhile he was putting the driver into handcuffs, two other occupants ran from the car,\u201d the Allegheny County police said. Officer Rosfeld started shooting, striking the 17-year-old, department officials said.The 17-year-old was taken to U.P.M.C. McKeesport hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:19 p.m., Superintendent McDonough said.The driver of the car was later released after being interviewed.\u201cAt the time we did not feel that charging was called for,\u201d Superintendent McDonough said.The police are still searching for the second person who ran from the officers. Superintendent McDonough asked that he turn himself in \u201cso that he can give a comprehensive description of what occurred this evening,\u201d the police statement said.Officer Rosfeld has been placed on administrative leave, officials added.In statement on Thursday, officials from the borough of East Pittsburgh said they were \u201cprofoundly saddened by the death of Antwon Rose\u201d and offered sympathy and condolences to his family.\u201cWe have confidence in the Allegheny County Police and District Attorney\u2019s Office and we will be transparent with any and all information that they need during the investigation,\u201d the statement said.On Wednesday, Ms. Fetterman recalled Antwon\u2019s politeness when he would stop by to help on Saturday mornings. \u201cHe would always call me Ms. G or Ma\u2019am,\u201d she said.Raemon Prunty, 18, a childhood friend of Antwon\u2019s who also volunteered at the Free Store, said he last spoke with him three days ago.Mr. Prunty said that as an African-American, he, too, would have acted as Antwon did.\u201cIf I was in Antwon\u2019s shoes,\u201d he said, \u201cI would have ran.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s out of fear,\u201d Mr. Prunty said.Matthew Haag contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

There was no justification for any force.\u201dMatthew Johnson, Ms. Sorace\u2019s chief of staff, said Friday that there is an \u201congoing internal police investigation\u201d into the encounter that will determine whether department policies were violated.

Its residents are about 60 percent white and 17 percent African-American, according to the most recent estimates from the United States Census Bureau.Tasers, said Mr. Alpert, the criminologist, are often used by the police more freely than firearms when officers are seeking to get someone to comply with orders. But, Mr. Alpert said, Tasers themselves can be deadly.Officer Bernot asked Mr. Williams to sit down on the curb, the police report said \u2014 an interaction which is shown on the video \u2014 and then directed Mr. Williams several times to straighten his legs. Mr. Williams was then shot with the Taser.The Police Bureau said in its report that directing suspects to straighten their legs helps prevent them from running away or fighting with police. \u201cNoncompliance is often a precursor to someone that is preparing to flee or fight,\u201d the report states.Mr. Williams was taken to the police station for a previous arrest warrant and checked by emergency medical workers before being released on $5,000 bail, the police said. He could not be reached for comment Friday.Ms. Sorace, the town\u2019s mayor, said the encounter underscored the need for police body cameras in Lancaster. Her chief of staff said Lancaster and several other small Pennsylvania cities had applied for funding from a state commission that would allow them to start a body camera program. The goal is to have officers using them by next year.Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Passes Sweeping Law to Protect Online Privacy", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California has passed a digital privacy law granting consumers more control over and insight into the spread of their personal information online, creating one of the most significant regulations overseeing the data-collection practices of technology companies in the United States.The bill raced through the State Legislature without opposition on Thursday and was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, just hours before a deadline to pull from the November ballot an initiative seeking even tougher oversight over technology companies.The new law grants consumers the right to know what information companies are collecting about them, why they are collecting that data and with whom they are sharing it. It gives consumers the right to tell companies to delete their information as well as to not sell or share their data. Businesses must still give consumers who opt out the same quality of service.It also makes it more difficult to share or sell data on children younger than 16.The legislation, which goes into effect in January 2020, makes it easier for consumers to sue companies after a data breach. And it gives the state\u2019s attorney general more authority to fine companies that don\u2019t adhere to the new regulations.But Aleecia M. McDonald, an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in privacy policy, said California\u2019s privacy measure was one of the most comprehensive in the United States, since most existing laws \u2014 and there are not many \u2014 do little to limit what companies can do with consumer information.\u201cIt\u2019s a step forward, and it should be appreciated as a step forward when it\u2019s been a long time since there were any steps,\u201d Ms. McDonald said.If the bill had failed to pass before the deadline, the proponents of the ballot initiative would have taken their case straight to voters in November, they said.The state\u2019s technology and business lobbies were opposed to the measure that was passed on Thursday, but they didn\u2019t try to derail it because they thought the ballot initiative was worse.Even legislators who voted for the bill complained that they had little choice because a ballot measure would provide less flexibility to make changes in the future. And some privacy advocates said the bill did not go as far as the ballot initiative in allowing individuals to sue for not complying.Mr. Mactaggart said he wanted a sensible privacy law, whether through a ballot measure or the legislative process. He said that the Legislature was the right place to debate such a policy, but that it had been hard to get legislators to address privacy.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the initiative process in California, we wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart said in an interview.One of the authors of the new law, Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat, tried last year to pass a bill that would have required internet service providers to seek permission from customers before accessing, selling or sharing their browser activity. The bill never made it out of committee \u2014 an example of the influence of telecommunications and technology companies in California.\u201cThis is a huge step forward to people all across the country dealing with this very challenging issue,\u201d State Senator Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat and a co-author of the bill, said at a news conference after it was signed.The ballot initiative, which would have made it easier for private individuals to sue companies for not adhering to its privacy requirements, had drawn vocal opposition from industry groups that worried about the potential liability risk.The measure included a provision that would have required a 70 percent majority in both houses of the Legislature to approve any changes after it became law.Google, Facebook, Verizon, Comcast and AT&T each contributed $200,000 to a committee opposing the proposed ballot measure, and lobbyists had estimated that businesses would spend $100 million to campaign against it before the November election.Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association, an industry group that includes Google, Facebook and Amazon, said in a statement that the new law contained many \u201cproblematic provisions.\u201d But the group did not try to obstruct it, he added, because \u201cit prevents the even worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201dMr. Callahan said the group would \u201cwork to correct the inevitable, negative policy and compliance ramifications this last-minute deal will create.\u201dLegislators said they expected to pass \u201ccleanup bills\u201d to make any fixes to the law in the 18 months before it takes effect. Some privacy advocates are worried that lobbyists for business and technology groups will use that time to water it down.Mr. Mactaggart said those concerns are \u201coverblown.\u201d\u201cHaving gotten this right, it\u2019ll be very hard to take it away,\u201d he said, noting that the ballot measure had been polling at around 80 percent approval. \u201cThey can\u2019t rewrite the law.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airlines Ask Government Not to Use Their Flights to Carry Children Separated at the Border", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican Airlines asked the federal government on Wednesday to stop using its commercial planes for \u201ctransporting children who have been separated from their families due to the current immigration policy.\u201dA press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tyler Q. Houlton, said it was unfortunate that airlines \u201cno longer want to partner with the brave men and women of D.H.S. to protect the traveling public, combat human trafficking, and to swiftly reunite unaccompanied illegal immigrant children with their families.\u201d\u201cDespite being provided facts on this issue, these airlines clearly do not understand our immigration laws and the longstanding devastating loopholes that have caused the crisis at our southern border,\u201d Mr. Houlton said.It is difficult to discern whether the children seen by the American Airlines flight crews were those who had been separated from their parents under the administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy. Indeed, the airline, in its statement, said that it \u201chas no way to know what kinds of government passengers it transports.\u201d\u201cWhile we have carried refugees for nonprofits and the government, many of whom are being reunited with family or friends, we have no knowledge that the federal government has used American to transport children who have been separated from their parents due to the recent immigration policy, but we would be extremely disappointed to learn that is the case,\u201d the statement said.It continued: \u201cWe have therefore requested the federal government to immediately refrain from using American for the purpose of transporting children who have been separated from their families due to the current immigration policy. We have no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it.\u201dThe number of children being moved on domestic flights is unclear. The New York Times contacted media offices of both the Department of Homeland Security and the agency under its jurisdiction, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but only received the statement from Mr. Houlton in response.The Times also talked to several flight attendants who said they had been disturbed by seeing Latino children on American Airlines flights, accompanied by government agents. But they declined to give their names, for fear of retaliation.The topic has been a searing one for flight attendants. Sara Nelson is the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines (American\u2019s flight attendants are represented by a different union). In a statement, Ms. Nelson acknowledged that the topic was a heated one among members.\u201cThis national discussion and response is being felt on the planes and discussed among crews,\u201d Ms. Nelson said in a statement. \u201cSome are struggling with the question of participating in a process that they feel deeply is immoral.\u201dFor flight attendants, the mere possibility that they could be involved in a process that is increasing, rather than ameliorating, children\u2019s fears runs counter to one of their core missions. They are regularly entrusted with the care of unaccompanied minors, and take pride in making them feel welcome, many say. Jill Sanders, 51, an American Airlines flight attendant with three decades of experience, said that they were also trained to recognize and report cases of children who might be victims of human trafficking.\u201cWe all can tell at least one story of holding a child while their mother goes to the bathroom on the airplane,\u201d she said, \u201cand know what it\u2019s like when their mother is gone for one minute and 30 seconds.\u201dMs. Sanders said she had not personally seen any children who appeared to be migrants separated from their families. But she said she had read several accounts from her colleagues that had been posted on a private Facebook page.She said that she deemed a number of the posts on the private Facebook page to be \u201ccredible and verifiable,\u201d given her personal knowledge of the writers and the details of the flights they described.\u201cPersonally, I cannot imagine how I would justify, in my own mind, my decades-long experience of giving comfort to a child who is upset with being required to participate in the transport of a child away from its mother,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.\u201cSeveral weeks ago, I worked two flights (one to San Antonio and the other to McAllen) which proved to be two of the most disturbing flights I\u2019ve ever experienced in my career,\u201d wrote Mr. Palmquist, who did not disclose which airline he worked for. \u201cOn board these particular flights were ICE agents and migrant children (approximately four to eleven years old) who had been separated from their families and were being flown to a \u2018relocation\u2019 site.\u201dIt was not clear how Mr. Palmquist determined that the children were ones who had been separated from their families by the \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy.

{"Headline": "Daredevil Raccoon Climbs Minnesota Skyscraper and Becomes a Sensation", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first, it looked so defeated: Its head buried between its front paws and its body curled up on a ledge 20 feet above a street in downtown St. Paul.But this was a raccoon, after all \u2014 part of a deceptive and unpredictable family of nocturnal mammals whose panda-like looks lull humans into forgetting they can carry multiple diseases. Nonetheless, three maintenance workers shortly before noon on Tuesday thought they could rouse the raccoon from its stupor and offered it a ladder to climb down from the ledge.The raccoon, clearly not ready to give up and not a fan of ladders, jolted from the recess of the building, dug its long fingernails into the tan exterior and scurried over to another side. It started to climb and climb and climb.Raccoons are skilled climbers with strong claws and will rapidly scurry up trees to escape danger. By rotating their hind feet, they can descend from trees headfirst, according to the book \u201cAdirondack Mammals.\u201dThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources estimates that between 800,000 and one million raccoons live throughout the state.The St. Paul raccoon scaled the two-story building with ease. But there was a bigger challenge ahead: the UBS Plaza, a 25-story office tower and St. Paul\u2019s 15th-tallest building. Within minutes, the raccoon had ascended five stories.About 10 minutes later, the raccoon was pressed against the 12th floor, now a mere dark spot between two windows more than 100 feet above the street. Then the raccoon reached the 15th floor and then the 20th.While it\u2019s normal for raccoons to climb 20 or 30 feet, scaling a large building is very unusual, said Russell L. Burke, a biology professor at Hofstra University.\u201cThat kind of height is extraordinary,\u201d he added.By the time the raccoon reached the upper stories, it had an audience.Gawkers flooded the streets below UBS Plaza. Some brought binoculars. A girl clutched a raccoon stuffed animal. A marquee on Minnesota Public Radio\u2019s building across the street flashed the breaking news: \u201cSt. Paul\u2019s downtown raccoon reaches new heights.\u201dInside the tower, employees pressed their faces against the windows hoping to catch a glimpse of it. On the 23rd floor of UBS Plaza, Sheila Donnelly-Coyne, a partner at Paige J. Donnelly, a St. Paul law firm, huddled with her co-workers and started to chronicle the raccoon\u2019s journey.Their thoughts raced. Who will rescue it? Will it fall?It showed up around 3 p.m. and started pacing on a thin window ledge outside Ms. Donnelly-Coyne\u2019s office. \u201cHe just seemed sweet and cute and very mellow,\u201d she said in an interview on Wednesday.Breaking out a window or sending down window cleaners would have been too risky, Ms. Donnelly-Coyne said, so officials baited live traps with cat food and placed them on the roof. They hoped the smell would lure the animal up another two floors.Ms. Donnelly-Coyne stayed in the office until 9 p.m., taking breaks from her work to check on the raccoon. When she left, she said, the animal was curled up sleeping. \u201cAll they could do was put enough stinky food up there to encourage him to go up the last two floors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were all kind of worried he might be too tired to do so but thankfully the little guy kept going.\u201dThe raccoon awoke around 10:30 p.m. and apparently had a change of heart. It started to descend, down to the 18th floor and then the 17th, before stopping on another ledge.It surpassed the 18th floor and then 19th and kept going and going. Around 2:45 a.m., according to Mr. Nelson, it scaled the top and hopped onto the roof. It also found the cat food inside the trap.Wildlife Management Services, the company that set the traps, retrieved the raccoon on Wednesday morning, said Laurie Brickley, a spokeswoman for the city\u2019s Department of Safety and Inspections.The raccoon was a female about 2 years old, Ms. Brickley said. \u201cShe was a little skinny but in good shape,\u201d she added.By the time the team reached the animal, it was \u201cincredibly tired,\u201d had eaten all that was in the live trap and had drunk a lot of water, Ms. Brickley said.Later, the company said on Facebook that the raccoon had been released on private residential property in the suburbs of the Twin Cities with permission from the owner, and after consultation with the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Minnesota.Ms. Donnelly-Coyne arrived at work on Wednesday to hear the good news. \u201cEverybody was very, very relieved this morning,\u201d she said, \u201cthat this story had a happy ending.\u201dAlso relieved was her 14-year-old daughter, a vegetarian and animal rights advocate who would have been heartbroken if anything had happened to the raccoon, she said. \u201cI was very happy I was able to tell her the little guy is fine.\u201dBut not everyone was rooting for a peaceful end. Raccoons can be vicious creatures, many people noted online. They attack pets and eat trash. They also carry rabies (though the disease is \u201cquite rare\u201d among Minnesota raccoons, the state says) and a deadly parasite they pass through their feces.Advertisement"}

It was Thursday at Mekelburg\u2019s, a busy Brooklyn grocery with a cafe and bar in the back and picnic tables on the patio, with locals tucking into sandwiches and sipping craft beers.Everything changed at 7 p.m., when someone noticed a news story online. Word spread through the place like a rotten odor. Customers scanned their phones, looked up and signaled for the check.\u201cBy 8:15, we were completely empty,\u201d said Alicia Guevara, who owns Mekelburg\u2019s with her husband, Daniel Mekelburg.Slowly, she pieced together what had happened.The story revealed her full name, Amy Mekelburg, offered details about her family and mentioned a brother who \u201cruns a popular restaurant and craft beer bar in Brooklyn that also bears the family name.\u201dThe backlash to the story was instantaneous and widespread, rattling even veterans of the high-volume, high-vitriol, endless shouting match that plays out on the fringes of ideological dividing lines in this country.Mr. O\u2019Brien, a HuffPost senior reporter who covers political extremism and propaganda, is familiar with doxxing tactics and vitriolic responses. But newcomers to the world, like Ms. Guevara and her husband, were unaccustomed and ill-prepared to deal with the fallout.On the ground that night, the story\u2019s repercussions could be seen in real time with the stampede for the door, Ms. Guevara said. \u201cNo one really asking for information,\u201d she said on Monday. \u201cJust accusing us.\u201d Someone asked her, \u201cHow much of my money has gone to your sister\u2019s cause?\u201d she said.She had no idea the story was in the works, she said. She and her husband have little contact with Ms. Mekelburg, seeing one another a few times a year at family gatherings in New Jersey and even then keeping their distance, she said. Ms. Guevara said she was unaware of the @AmyMek account until the story broke.Alone in Brooklyn while her husband was traveling overseas, she hastily published a statement on social media the following day.\u201cAmy has never been linked to or involved with our business in any capacity whatsoever,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis revelation of her Twitter account has, frankly, thrown our family into chaos. We are disturbed, revolted and humiliated.\u201dThe couple was planning on expanding to a second location in Brooklyn, but now she was consumed with one thought: \u201cWe\u2019re over,\u201d she said three days later. \u201cThis is over.\u201dMr. O\u2019Brien said he only became aware of @AmyMek on Twitter a month ago, and learned her identity from a source. After he tried to contact Ms. Mekelburg for the story, she wrote about him on Twitter and asked her followers for help.\u201cHe has threatened to reveal my identity putting me and my family at great personal risk,\u201d @AmyMek tweeted on Thursday. \u201cBut it\u2019s MUCH worse than you can imagine \u2026\u201dMr. O\u2019Brien, whose phone number is listed in his Twitter profile, heard from her supporters immediately, he said. \u201cI was getting threatening calls as I was finishing my story,\u201d he said.Ms. Mekelburg attacked Mr. O\u2019Brien in a series of 20 posts to Twitter on Thursday, asking for prayers for her family and expressing gratitude to President Trump, who she said has retweeted her in the past, and his attacks on \u201cfake news.\u201d\u201cThis actually does lead to real violence \u2014 that\u2019s my real fear,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said Monday. \u201cSomeone just shows up with an AR-15 and thinks they\u2019re doing God\u2019s work.\u201dHe responded to attacks on Twitter, telling one user upset about the WWE detail to \u201cGo DDT himself,\u201d a reference to a wrestling move. Twitter suspended his account for several hours, viewing the language as a threat, he said.Lydia Polgreen, the editor in chief of HuffPost and a former reporter and editor at The New York Times, said she also received personal attacks after the article, as did three other journalists at the organization. \u201cIt takes real courage to work this beat,\u201d she said.Ms. Mekelburg could not be reached for comment by telephone or with a message on Twitter.At Mekelburg\u2019s, in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, the phones rang so incessantly \u2014 mostly out-of-state callers, Ms. Guevara said \u2014 that they were briefly shut off. She added a security detail at the store over the weekend, and shut down the bar\u2019s Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. By Monday afternoon when a reporter visited, the restaurant was half full, and a customer interrupted at one point to hug Ms. Guevara. She said customers are returning.Ms. Guevara said the notion of the bar endorsing Ms. Mekelburg\u2019s Twitter activity is laughable. \u201cHave you seen my staff?\u201d she said. \u201cWhite, black, Hispanic. Straight, gay, transgender. Catholic, Jewish, Baptist, agnostic. Everything.\u201dShe said she does not know how to reach Ms. Mekelburg and has no reason to believe her sister-in-law will stop using Twitter anytime soon. \u201cI think what she does is dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cShe speaks to people with words that frighten them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In This Exhibition, You Walk Through Excrement", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROTTERDAM, the Netherlands \u2014 When I entered the exhibition, I was invited to get nude. I searched a clothes rack filled with skin-toned \u201cnaked costumes\u201d featuring all shapes and sizes of male and female genitalia, and chose a peach-color hermaphroditic garment, with teddy-bear fur, a male member between its legs and wide-set breasts. I pulled it on over my clothes.Then I walked into the excrement.There were four giant turds inside the 16,000 square feet of museum space. One mammoth piece of feces was reminiscent of a long, winding steel sculpture by Richard Serra. One was a brown spiral. Another resembled an enormous chocolate chip. Yet another featured intertwined layers with a gap in between that I could have crawled through, if I had been brave enough.All four sculptures of fecal matter sat on elegant Persian rugs, like welcome-home gifts left by a huge, vengeful dog.The four artists who make up the collective, Wolfgang Gantner, Ali Janka, Florian Reither and Tobias Urban, spent two weeks building up the sculptures in situ in the large contemporary galleries at the Boijmans before the opening on May 19. A team of helpers first constructed enormous plaster casts and then covered them by hand with thick brown clay.It was, all told, \u201cabout three or four elephants\u2019 worth of clay,\u201d said Mr. Janka in a group interview with the artists in the museum\u2019s staff canteen. Mr. Urban chimed in to correct him, suggesting that each sculpture was actually as heavy as \u201can elephant and a hippopotamus.\u201dAny museum show that presents excrement to its visitors as art has to expect at least a little scandal. Sjarel Ex, director of the Boijmans, said he had no problem with that.\u201cIt could be the first time that all art enemies and art lovers can agree about one thing,\u201d he said, with a smile. They could all say that it\u2019s poop, he said, though he used a more colorful word.Mr. Ex said that he had no hesitation about commissioning the work. He said the show had many possible interpretations.\u201cYou can approach it from the field of sculpture, you can approach it as an installation that was tailor-made for these big rooms,\u201d he said, \u201cand you can see it as a provocation and then explore what side of you is provoked. That\u2019s also very interesting. You can also see it as an intimate experience you keep only for yourself.\u201d\u201cThey tend to use two powerful tools: humor and simplification,\u201d said Mr. Stocchi, who is the Boijman\u2019s curator of modern and contemporary art. \u201cSimple doesn\u2019t mean to make it easy but to have a clarity of intentions. The intention is confronting ourselves with our own fears, or our own preconceived notions or taboos, which we can also call prejudices. When we have prejudices, what can we do? We can discuss. So the exhibition is an arena for discussion.\u201dMr. Stocchi invited Gelatin to create a piece for the museum\u2019s contemporary Bodon Wing, which was built in the 1970s to accommodate land art pieces, minimalist installations and monumental art.In the interview, however, Mr. Janka challenged the use of \u201cmonumental\u201d to describe the turd sculptures. \u201cMonumental is the wrong word because what we\u2019re really interested in is the un-monumental,\u201d he said.\u201cFor me, they are monumental,\u201d Mr. Urban said.\u201cBut if they\u2019re monumental, what is the monument for?\u201d Mr. Gantner asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a monument for inclusiveness,\u201d Mr. Urban replied, \u201cbecause everyone can relate to it.\u201dThat short exchange gives a glimpse of how the four artists work together, discussing and debating the terms of their work even when it is already on show.And why the naked suits? Is the idea to make visitors feel more vulnerable to the experience?\u201cIt\u2019s a way of getting them out of their clothes without undressing them,\u201d Mr. Urban said. \u201cWith clothes, you know immediately that someone is a banker or something else and when you get them out of their own clothes they can be anybody.\u201dThe Boijmans van Beuningen is probably best known for its large collection of early Dutch and Flemish paintings, which include works by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Hieronymus Bosch, Renaissance artists who explored drolleries, grotesque hybrid beings, and people and animals engaged in all kinds of coarse behavior. The museum also has a collection of surrealist art.\u201cIf you look into the work of Gelatin, you see that they very often refer to those artists,\u201d Mr. Ex said. \u201cThe strange performances that they do and even the costumes \u2014 you put on one of their costumes and look like you come from one of those paintings. It\u2019s not a re-enactment of Bosch or Bruegel, but it\u2019s a kind of mentality that belongs to this museum.\u201d\u201cWe are a free space, so we can do things that are silly and also maybe a sign of bad taste,\u201d Mr. Ex said. \u201cThis is a museum, here is a place where artists work and we have to defend the freedom of showing things, so there\u2019s a bigger side to it.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cso far, my experience is that people just enjoyed it and had fun with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But it was pivotal to the recognition of photography as a valid and viable art form, Mr. Jacob said. She died two months later.For Mr. Jacob, the experience of working with Ms. Arbus\u2019s edition of the portfolio \u2014 which is in the museum\u2019s permanent collection \u2014 was \u201clike coming home to something I knew really well\u201d and an opportunity to tell a new story about the portfolio.\u201cThe photographs are no less stunning and moving and shocking than the first time I saw them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe photographs are still incredibly powerful documents of a moment.\u201dHe knows her negatives better than anyone and he said they provide important insights about her intent. \u201cShe had a staggering independence from all the conventions and was oblivious to everything that the vast majority of photographers took for granted,\u201d he explained. By using contrast she \u201cgleefully\u201d suppressed details in pictures that most photographers struggled to show, he added.Mr. Selkirk painstakingly reproduced her complicated developing and printing methods, including her different ways of presenting the border of her images. While she pioneered the use of irregular black borders around the edges of images, for the box of 10 photographs she placed cardboard pieces over the negative in the enlarger to make fuzzy borders that seemed to dissolve into the paper\u2019s white areas.

Liebling\u2019s \u201cBetween Meals,\u201d a \u201cmemoir of meals in Paris before and after the war. He described Liebling as \u201can enthusiastic lover of food and wine, very knowledgeable but never a snob.\u201d And he called the book \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cthe benchmark for great food writing.\u201dRead \u201cAnthony Bourdain: By the Book\u201dIn a lengthy 2017 profile of Bourdain in The New Yorker, fellow chef Eric Ripert told the magazine that he thought Bourdain was driven, at least in part, \u201c\u2018by a fear of what he might get up to if he ever stopped working.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a guy who needs a lot of projects,\u2019 Bourdain acknowledged. \u2018I would probably have been happy as an air-traffic controller.\u2019\u201dRead \u201cAnthony Bourdain\u2019s Moveable Feast\u201dIn her review of \u201cBone in the Throat,\u201d Bourdain\u2019s first novel, The Times crime columnist Marilyn Stasio, wrote, \u201cThe author\u2019s comic vision goes beyond original.

I mean, she\u2019s who I need to please, and if she\u2019s not happy, I\u2019m not happy.\u201dListen to the interview.Bourdain, fellow chef Danny Bowien and The Times\u2019s Kim Severson spent a lively hour discussing global food waste in a Times Talk.Watch the interview.Bourdain\u2019s travel and food show, currently in its 11th season on CNN, has been a cultural force since its inception, winning five Emmys and a Peabody Award so far. (Eight seasons are available right now on Netflix.) The series uses food as an entryway to nuanced conversations with people across the world about their politics, their daily lives, their hopes and fears, and there is seemingly nowhere \u201cParts\u201d hasn\u2019t explored \u2014 including Myanmar in the early 2010s, as well as countries and regions like Gaza and the West Bank and Iran, offering local perspectives rarely seen on Western TV. The show\u2019s punk stylings, the obvious delight Bourdain takes in eating with Michelin star chefs and roadside food vendors alike, and the show\u2019s diverse array of special guests (President Barack Obama, Iggy Pop and the director Darren Aronofsky are just a few) combine to make \u201cParts\u201d a thoughtful and exciting world tour.\u201cNo Reservations\u201d is where Bourdain\u2019s TV career really took off. The show debuted on the Travel Channel in 2005, showcasing Bourdain\u2019s signature curiosity, swagger and lyricism. As food- and travel-blogging exploded, \u201cNo Reservations\u201d became the gold standard for thoughtful adventure \u2014 and because the Travel Channel felt awfully obscure, the show sometimes felt like a hip secret. That secret got out in 2006, when Bourdain and his crew got stuck in Beirut during an armed conflict; that episode is among the show\u2019s most interesting because it\u2019s the exact opposite of other lifestyle shows. \u201cNo Reservations\u201d went on to 12 Emmy nominations (and two wins). The show is available for purchase on Amazon.Bourdain produced and narrated this brainier, more personal approach to the shameless pleasures of food porn. Still, he kept himself mostly out of the spotlight, training it instead on a rotating cast of Michelin-approved chefs and restaurateurs as they explained their relationships to specific foods or regions. In one installment, the Momofuku mastermind David Chang effuses about his lifelong passion for ramen; in another, the British virtuoso April Bloomfield gives a survey of bangers and mash. It\u2019s a light and positive celebration of food and culture \u2014 a departure from the quick-cut chaos of such crowd-pleasers as \u201cIron Chef\u201d or \u201cChopped\u201d \u2014 with fresh insights from authoritative and camera-friendly personalities. The show ran for five seasons on BBC and PBS, which are all available on Netflix. (A sixth aired last year on Facebook Watch.)Bourdain was someone everyone wanted to eat with \u2014 knowing his enthusiasm could get them into restaurants, and to experience food, they otherwise never would. This was best shown in 2016, when the White House asked if President Barack Obama could eat with him during an official visit to Vietnam.Bourdain was candid about past drug use, which included cocaine and heroin. He was also unafraid to discuss drugs in his TV show. In this clip from an episode of \u201cParts Unknown\u201d in Morocco he learned Moroccans make hashish-containing sweets.\u201cOf course network standards and practices prohibit me from even tasting this delicious and reportedly mind-altering treat,\u201d he said.\u201cAn irony free zone where everything is beautiful and nothing hurts,\u201d is how Mr. Bourdain describes the Waffle House. \u201cWhere everybody regardless of race, creed, color or degree of inebriation is welcome.\u201dBourdain was so associated with globe-trotting it is easy to forget his love of the United States\u2019 own cuisine, and it comes across fully in this ode to a waffle house. It is \u201ca beacon of hope and salvation inviting the hungry, the lost, the seriously hammered, all across the South to come inside,\u201d he added.\u201cParts Unknown\u201d often felt like a commentary on foreign policy. In this episode in Iran, for instance, Bourdain experiences the country\u2019s hospitality in full force by eating in a family home.It is \u201ca very hopeful place, filled with yearning, where people every day, particularly women I think, are in very small ways testing the limits of what is permissible, trying to define in fits and starts who they want to be as a country,\u201d he said.Charles Bramesco, Margaret Lyons, Alex Marshall and Eleanor Stanford contributed reporting.An earlier version incorrectly referred to Charleston, S.C. as what Mr. Bourdain called \"an irony free zone.\" He was referring to the Waffle House.Advertisement"}

It provides, as the court majority recognized, \u201ca comprehensive chronicle of the user\u2019s past movements.\u201d Yet, before this decision, law enforcement agencies were gathering this data on countless people without even showing that the person whose information they collected had done anything wrong.But the 5-4 decision in the case, Carpenter v. the United States, should give you little comfort. The growing use of technology by law enforcement agencies to monitor or target people \u2014 particularly people and communities of color \u2014 is expanding at head-spinning speed, and nothing the courts do is going to stop that.This decision, written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., only confirms that. His opinion didn\u2019t overturn the rule that says that any time the government wants information on you that you\u2019ve provided to a third party, the government can get it, even though in the digital age most of your information is now in the hands of third parties like cellphone companies, internet providers and social-media giants like Facebook. He stressed how \u201cnarrow\u201d the decision was and didn\u2019t rule out giving the government freedom to track you for up to six days.Worse yet, if the court loses one of its liberal justices, this decision could be reeled back in an instant, since it was the court\u2019s four liberals who joined with the chief justice for the majority. Three of the four dissenting conservative justices, in an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, even opined, remarkably, that \u201ca person\u2019s movements are not particularly private.\u201dAnd two of them would even have wound back the law by more than 50 years to say the Fourth Amendment no longer protects \u201creasonable expectations of privacy\u201d but only property rights, leaving us without constitutional recourse for all of our digital information.What we need is regulation, and fast, and it is going to have to come from the local, state and federal governments, not the courts. Even Justice Samuel Alito, in his dissent, understood that \u201clegislation is much preferable.\u201d He said that was \u201cfor many reasons, including the enormous complexity of the subject, the need to respond to rapidly changing technology, and the Fourth Amendment\u2019s scope.\u201dAlmost every day brings another story of how policing technology is chiseling away at our civil rights and liberties. License plate readers already record our movements on the ground; drones will soon peer down at us from the skies. Artificial intelligence will power facial recognition tools in CCTV and police body cameras to identify us as we move about. Algorithms will target where crime will supposedly occur next, and who might commit it. All of these technologies will be in the hands of government agencies that have the power to keep us under watch, to handcuff us, to lock us up.There is promise in these technologies, to be sure. Drones can locate a missing child or map a traffic accident from the sky so that cars and trucks aren\u2019t stuck for hours. Pod cameras \u2014 short for police observation devices, affixed to utility or traffic poles or buildings \u2014 can catch criminals in the act in violence-torn neighborhoods. Location tracking of cellphones can identify serial armed robbers.For all of its benefits, however, policing technology can also do unfathomable damage.Let\u2019s start with the obvious: It will cut deeply into our privacy. It was designed to do just that. We\u2019re told technology will pick out the bad guy from a crowd, but if you\u2019re in the crowd too, you\u2019ll be observed. We\u2019ll all be under the government\u2019s watchful eye.But the impact inevitably is going to fall most heavily on minorities and marginalized communities.Some of the technology has racial injustice baked into it. Algorithms don\u2019t have to look at race to be racist. Whether written by humans or a product of machine learning, algorithms take past facts and magnify them into future police actions. They rely heavily on criminal records. Much of street policing in recent years \u2014 stop and frisk, marijuana enforcement, catching fare-beaters \u2014 has been deployed disproportionately against minorities and in poor neighborhoods. Police may \u201cgo where the crime is,\u201d but because so much focus has been on low-level offenses in disadvantaged areas that are ignored elsewhere, these algorithms make it inevitable that the police will return to these places time and again.So what\u2019s to be done?As Carpenter makes clear, looking to the courts won\u2019t be helpful. With rare exception, the courts have waved a green flag at police surveillance. The Fourth Amendment prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d but if a government action is not considered a search or seizure, there is no protection at all. The fight in Carpenter took place because the use of most of these new technologies isn\u2019t considered a search. That\u2019s because you have no \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in public places. This makes you fair game for all kinds of surveillance, from facial recognition to CCTV cameras. And warrants and probable cause \u2014 the usual tools of courts \u2014 won\u2019t work anyway when the goal is to keep us all under watch.We need rules that maximize the use of the technology of which we approve but that sharply curtail the risks. In some cases, we may want to rule out the technology for law enforcement use altogether. But for technologies we might allow, here are some basic guidelines:First, no policing technology should be used unless the public has a voice in the decision to authorize it.Second, citizens can\u2019t make intelligent decisions about policing technology unless they understand what the technology does and how it works. Police buy technology from private vendors that want to keep its details secret for proprietary reasons. That won\u2019t fly when the technology is being used by our government on us.Third, we need clear rules about deploying policing technology: when it can and can\u2019t be used, how each use is authorized and by whom. Drones to map traffic accidents? Sure. To peer into windows of homes? No way. Surveillance devices to locate cellphones? Yes, but only with the appropriate court orders. Predictive policing to identify places where crime might occur next? Perhaps, but not if there\u2019s a chance these algorithms will perpetuate the racially disparate impact of policing.Officers using these technologies need proper training, and law enforcement agencies should not be allowed to use them unless they can show they understand what they are buying.Fourth, if data is being collected, sharp, clear limits on its use must be defined. How long can this data be retained? Can it be shared with other agencies? Or combined with other data purchased from private vendors?Finally, strong oversight is critical. The police must be closely monitored in their use of these technologies, and data on their performance must be disclosed regularly.There are powerfully hard questions here. But courts aren\u2019t going to answer them, and we can\u2019t continue to duck them. We need to act now, because the technology is getting away from us, fast, and the unregulated harms could be devastating.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the State-of-the-Art Wedding Feast, \u2018Look Is Everything\u2019 ", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig-city reception planners say couples are demanding food, tableware and service that dazzles visually, and even moves: \u201cThe camera eats first.\u201dAll the tasting-menu options that Susan Shek and Noah Sexton have sampled for their August wedding are delicious, but they want food that makes a visual statement.They\u2019re leaning toward caviar on a buckwheat blini that bears no resemblance to a blini; it\u2019s a squat little tower made of reconfigured blini ingredients. The caterer has also suggested the steak frites, a slender rectangle of beef encircled by a flat ribbon of fried potato that floats inches above it, anchored at the base.Expectations for wedding meals have been rising for years. Couples raised on food television have a palpable disdain for the old formula of fish, chicken or beef accompanied by a vegetable and a starch. And it\u2019s not uncommon for a bride and groom to ask how and where the components of their meal were grown, raised or slaughtered. But big-city wedding planners and designers say a new criterion is coming into play: The food has to have a distinctive, if not downright startling, look. It has to grab the eye as much as the palate, and should be displayed on something more exciting than standard banquet tableware. If there\u2019s a performance element to the presentation, as with the traveling chocolate bark, so much the better.\u201cThe camera eats first,\u201d Ms. Shek said. She is a wedding photographer and Mr. Sexton is a private chef, and they are determined to create a dinner with a memorable look.The Goodriches married at the Wythe in May, and dinner for 130 included a pork shoulder dish \u2014 in part because \u201cthe Swiss chard just popped,\u201d Mrs. Goodrich said. It did not include the vegetable curry the couple tried at their tasting, because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t visualize how it would come out on a platter with all that rice underneath.\u201d\u201cLook is everything,\u201d said Mrs. Goodrich, an interior designer who has worked on restaurants and hotels. \u201cI\u2019ve been to countless banquet hall, hotel-off-the-freeway weddings where the presentation\u2019s the same whether it\u2019s the fish or the rib-eye.\u201dMs. Girard has designed 3D-printed trays with spikes that hold small bites, and a wall hanging of science-lab pipettes, each one filled with just enough wine to accompany a cheese and charcuterie display. The company\u2019s signature appetizer plate is grooved on one side to hold a fork, and its bottom fits snugly over the top of a cocktail glass, so guests can keep a hand free without spilling. Ms. Ruben oversees a 10,000-square-foot design studio in New Jersey where she employs ironworkers, woodworkers and other artisans to construct everything down to the tables, if need be. If that\u2019s not enough to satisfy the client, caterers can set the meal in motion. Ms. Shek and Mr. Sexton opted for what the Pinch planners call a roaming dinner, in which guests can wander from one specially designed mobile unit to another for entrees like the Jackson Pollock tartare, or single-portion sous vide preparations served in glass jars.The movable feast is taken a step further by what the designers call \u201cpop-up food\u201d: Servers appear with enough food for about 40 lucky guests, and those who don\u2019t make the cutoff have to hope they\u2019re in the right place at the right time when the next batch of 40 servings appears somewhere else in the room \u2014 assuming that the bride and groom have ordered enough rounds to feed everyone.Mr. Spiegel refers to pop-ups, with their note of urgency, as \u201ca happening designed to create a buzz in the corner of the room.\u201d Ms. Girard calls them a \u201cflash mob of food.\u201d \u201cWhen I present my food, I don\u2019t want my guests to immediately know what it is,\u201d he said. Beef tartare usually involves a mound of chopped meat with an egg in the middle. His arrives as \u201ca bouquet of flowers with the tartare underneath,\u201d to make it seem more celebratory.\u201cYou have to ask, what\u2019ll give it impact, provide the thrill,\u201d said Mr. Sax, who had cupcakes at his 2010 wedding instead of a more expensive cake. \u201cIn order for someone\u2019s wedding to stand out even for a few days, it has to move beyond what everyone else has done. Caterers are selling pyrotechnics.\u201dThey want to stand out. As Mr. Sax put it: \u201cWhat do they serve the desserts in? The carved-out shell of a monkey\u2019s head.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s the cake.She got so many special requests that she created the Milk ID program, which allows customers to mix and match fillings, frosting layers and crumbs with two basic cakes. Or they can order tiered cakes using any of the company\u2019s standard cake-and-filling combinations \u2014 often to achieve a visual effect. The favored style this season is the ombre cake, six layers stacked from the darkest to the lightest, that serves just over 200 people at $12 per serving. Couples who choose to have a black-and-white wedding often opt for alternating layers of Ms. Tosi\u2019s darkest and lightest cakes.Some couples forgo cake altogether. Ms. Shek and Mr. Sexton discussed having a small one to please her mother, but were drawn instead to an array of candy bars designed to look like childhood favorites, and tiny ice cream cones, and a custom-built display of vegan doughnuts hung on hooks.But a trend isn\u2019t a trend if it hangs around. It gains momentum, peaks and gets pushed aside by the next trend, which is why purveyors of wedding food have an eye on the horizon. Ms. Ruben wonders if the next new thing will in fact be an old thing: Tomorrow\u2019s innovators, she said, may well circle back to the traditional dinner, which is so out that it could be in again. The old-school choice of three entrees, complete with hashtag grill marks, may be about to stage a comeback.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Pity the Tech B-List", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsI spent most of the week at the Code Conference, where the tech world\u2019s elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry. It was a fascinating event, less in the sense of newsy product announcements (which there weren\u2019t many of) and more in the general finger-in-the-wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself.Notable at this year\u2019s Code was that there seems to be a growing rift between the largest tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 and the rest of the industry.The shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference, even if their presence was minimal. No executives from Apple, Amazon or Google spoke at Code, and when executives from Microsoft and Facebook did take the stage, they mostly talked about the past. (Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, offered some historical perspective on the company\u2019s antitrust woes from the late 1990s; Sheryl Sandberg and Mike Schroepfer from Facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company\u2019s post-Cambridge Analytica \u201cwe\u2019ll do better\u201d script.)Instead, much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech A-list \u2014 large, popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories, but that have spent years locked in a fight for survival against their bigger, more entrenched rivals.From the perspective of the tech B-list, there are two huge fights to be won. First, you need to establish a foothold in a market, either by out-innovating old-line incumbents \u2014 taxis, hotels, music labels \u2014 or by creating a new market altogether. Then, once you\u2019re established and growing, a bigger worry emerges: What if one of the Big Five squashes you?A good example of a tech B-lister is Spotify, which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers \u2014 the three labels that provide the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s music \u2014 but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by a tech giant. Onstage at Code, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek, fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like Apple, Amazon and Google, all of which have their own music streaming services and, more important, control the hardware platforms (iOS, Android, Alexa) on which people consume music.Mr. Ek mostly deflected, saying that there are \u201cvery, very few opportunities that a billion-plus people around the world care about,\u201d and that the giants\u2019 interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category.Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, sounded a similar note at the conference when asked about Facebook\u2019s habit of blatantly copying Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive product features. (Mr. Spiegel\u2019s sassy comeback \u2014 \u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also\u201d \u2014 was the best line there.)\u201cWell, I believe if you don\u2019t create a pure, vertical, integrated capability, vertically integrated capability \u2014 from distribution all the way through content creation and advertising models \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a hard time competing with these guys. And the statistic we throw out, and since we announced this deal in November of 2016, the FANG market caps have gone up over $1 trillion. You better figure out how to vertically integrate here if you want to compete with those players.\u201dIt\u2019s not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets. It\u2019s more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of a $200 billion telecom giant. And it shows just how dominant the tech A-list has become, and how difficult overcoming its concentration of market power is proving to be.Here are a few other tech stories of note this past week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I, Sy: Seymour Hersh\u2019s Memoir of a Life Making the Mighty Sweat", "Date": "2018-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Seymour M. Hersh didn\u2019t even want to write a memoir.He had been on contract for a book about Dick Cheney, the former vice president. He had spent four years reporting it, amassing dozens of files of what he called explosive material, only to find that his sources had gone jittery amid a government crackdown on leakers. He went to his publishers at Alfred A. Knopf, \u201chat in hand,\u201d and said he couldn\u2019t go through with it. He offered to mortgage his Manhattan pied-\u00e0-terre to repay the advance.\u201cThey said, \u2018Write a memoir,\u2019 and I said, \u2018No way,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hersh, 81, recalled the other day. \u201cI don\u2019t write about my family, and I never do.\u201dPlus, the Sy Hersh story \u2014 the story of a working-class Jewish kid from the South Side of Chicago, who through serendipity and toil had exposed the horror of the My Lai massacre, revealed domestic and foreign abuses by the C.I.A. and harried Washington\u2019s elite for a half-century \u2014 was not finished.\u201cI\u2019m still doing it,\u201d Mr. Hersh said, sounding both matter-of-fact and defiant.He remembers a night in San Francisco during the 1968 presidential campaign, when he was working as the press secretary for Eugene McCarthy. (Yes, Mr. Hersh, the reporter\u2019s reporter, had a stint on the public-relations side of the game.) Mr. McCarthy had never smoked pot, so Mr. Hersh produced a joint; joining the group was Jerry Brown, the future governor of California. \u201cThe stuff did little for McCarthy, so he said, but it did much more for Brown,\u201d Mr. Hersh writes.A spokesman for Mr. Brown, contacted for this article, called the anecdote \u201ca complete and total fabrication.\u201d Mr. Hersh shrugged off the denial. \u201comg \u2026 why is he making a big deal of it?\u201d Mr. Hersh wrote in an email. \u201cit was the 60s, was it not?\u201dIn athletic shoes and a V-neck sweater, he bounced from topic to topic. He offered measured support for Gina Haspel, the new director of the C.I.A., and recalled the time he and Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon Papers leaker, watched \u201cPlatoon.\u201d (Mr. Ellsberg cried, he said.) A framed photograph of Mr. Kissinger, the subject of one of his books, hangs above his desk; in it, Mr. Kissinger is stuffing his face with cake.Mr. Hersh\u2019s place in the pantheon of reporters is secure, but his current status is ambiguous. In arguably the most fertile moment for investigative reporting since Watergate, he has been on the sidelines. By choice, he said.\u201cI\u2019m not going to write anything about the whole last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story\u2019s fixed now. \u2018Trump bad, Democrats good.\u2019 It\u2019s a fixed story. And, of course, it\u2019s a little more muddled than that. A lot more muddled than that.\u201d He added, \u201cI doubt if I went to The Washington Post or The New York Times with a story, they\u2019d run it. Doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201dOther reporters criticized the article, and his subsequent reporting on Syria, which questioned whether President Bashar al-Assad had gassed his own people, was similarly derided. But Mr. Hersh is unrepentant.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear now; nobody disputes it anymore,\u201d he said, in an asked-and-answered tone, when I brought up the Bin Laden piece. (In fact, many reporters and former White House officials still dismiss his version of events as fantasy.) \u201cWhen I wrote it, there was just hell to pay.\u201d In his memoir, which refers to \u201cthe American murder of Osama bin Laden,\u201d he writes: \u201cI will happily permit history to be the judge of my recent work.\u201dIn the book he also writes that David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, had grown too chummy with President Barack Obama, the subject of Mr. Remnick\u2019s 2010 biography \u2014 an assertion the editor, in an interview, called \u201cnonsense.\u201d But Mr. Remnick took a warm tone toward his former star reporter, whose New Yorker scoops included the Abu Ghraib prison abuse story.\u201cI think that Sy \u2014 and I say this with great respect \u2014 psychologically needs to feel that editors are \u2018The Man,\u2019 capital T, capital M, and I mean that in a non-gendered way,\u201d Mr. Remnick said. \u201cThey are the authority figures who need to be pushed back against, and so I don\u2019t take that personally.\u201dHe added: \u201cWhen all was said and done, his achievements are enormous.\u201d\u201cThere have been social science studies of the impact of any particular thing on Facebook, and it\u2019s, like, zippo!\u201d Mr. Hersh went on. \u201cWe have a divided America, a really bitterly divided America. Do we really need the Russians to tell us we\u2019re a troubled country?\u201dHe called the president an unserious man surrounded by \u201cterrible people.\u201d But he has reported on unscrupulous leaders before. \u201cWe will survive Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica will go on.\u201dThese days, his main concern is the 24-hour, Twitter-driven news cycle, which he denounces in his memoir as \u201csodden with fake news, hyped-up and incomplete information.\u201d In his office, he brought up unprompted the manifesto of Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber.\u201cI hate to say it \u2014 if he hadn\u2019t killed people, if he hadn\u2019t been a psychotic who thought it was O.K. to mail bombs to people, if you went and reread it, he\u2019s talking about machines taking over our life,\u201d Mr. Hersh said. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to be beholden to machines, and here we are, you know: Facebook and Instagram. I mean \u2014 it\u2019s happened!\u201dIt was a funny thing to say for a man whose critics accuse him of being a conspiracist and an obsessive \u2014 though Mr. Hersh takes those complaints in stride. He has faced skeptics throughout his career: from his junior college days working at his family\u2019s dry cleaning business to a brief stint running a weekly paper in suburban Illinois where Mr. Hersh sold ads and sometimes delivered the papers himself. Later, he carried out a nationwide hunt for William Calley, the soldier whose interview with Mr. Hersh would unlock the grim secrets of My Lai.\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of monomaniacal gene that you have to have, a sense of single-minded pursuit, that Sy at his best exemplified,\u201d Mr. Remnick said. \u201cHe never stopped being hungry. The hunger, the sense of skepticism about power, is always characteristic of Sy.\u201dMr. Hersh has been going to physical therapy lately to treat a torn rotator cuff. He had ignored a pain in his shoulder so he could keep up his usual tennis game. \u201cI realized when I hit a ball, I couldn\u2019t move my arm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I kept on playing until one day, by mistake, I pulled my arm too high.\u201d\u201cAll I had to do,\u201d he added, \u201cwas stop playing. All I had to was stop playing! And everything in me said, \u2018Stop playing.\u2019\u201dDamn the consequences. Mr. Hersh kept playing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Counter Loneliness, Find Ways to Connect", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthMuch of modern life, though seeming to promote connectivity, has had the opposite effect of fostering social isolation and loneliness, experts say. It reminded me of a distressing time I had as an 18-year-old college sophomore \u2014 feeling friendless, unhappy and desperate to get out of there. Fortunately, I visited the university health clinic where an astute psychologist examined my high school records, including a long list of extracurricular activities, and noted that I had done only schoolwork during my first year in college.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing the matter with you that wouldn\u2019t be fixed by your becoming more integrated into the college community,\u201d she said. She urged me to get involved with something that would connect me to students with similar interests.I protested that as a biochemistry major with classes six mornings a week and four afternoon labs, I had no time for extracurricular activities. And she countered: \u201cYou have to find time. It\u2019s essential to your health and a successful college experience.\u201dHaving no better option, I joined a monthly student-run magazine that fit into my demanding academic schedule. I soon fell in love with interviewing researchers and writing up their work. I also befriended a faculty adviser to the magazine, a grandfatherly professor who encouraged me to expand my horizons and follow my heart.Two years later as a college senior and the magazine\u2019s editor, I traded courses in physical chemistry and advanced biochemistry for news reporting and magazine writing.The rest is history. Armed with a master\u2019s degree in science writing and two years as a general assignment reporter, at 24 I was hired by The New York Times as a science writer, a job I have loved for 53 years. In making rewarding social connections in college, I not only conquered loneliness, I found a path to a marvelous career.They urged that social relationships be considered a national public health priority \u201cto roll back those heartbreaking, preventable deaths of despair.\u201dThe rate of persistent loneliness is also high among older adults, who, in addition to limitations imposed by chronic illness, may suffer the isolating effects of mobility issues, lack of transportation and untreated hearing loss. However, Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a psychology professor at Brigham Young University, told the UnLonely conference that no one is immune to the toxic effects of social isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s so distressing, it\u2019s been used as a form of punishment and torture,\u201d Dr. Holt-Lunstad said.\u201cLoneliness saps vitality, impairs productivity and diminishes enjoyment of life,\u201d Drs. Nobel and Williams wrote. Its effects on health match that of obesity, alcohol abuse and smoking 15 cigarettes a day, increasing the risk of an early death by 30 percent. The aim of the UnLonely Project, Dr. Nobel said, is to raise awareness of its increasing incidence and harmful effects and reduce the stigma \u2014 the feelings of embarrassment \u2014 related to it. In Augusta, Ga., in partnership with AARP, a program of painting together, as well as music and dance, was created for caregivers who often have little opportunity to connect with others and reap the benefits of mutual support and friendship. Doing something creative and nurturing helps both caregivers and people struggling with serious chronic illness get outside themselves and feel more connected, Dr. Ruth Oratz, medical oncologist at New York University Langone Medical Center, told the conference, convened by the Foundation for Art and Healing.The foundation\u2019s goal, Dr. Nobel said, is to promote the use of creative arts to bring people together and foster health and healing through activities like writing, music, visual arts, gardening, textile arts like knitting, crocheting and needlework, and even culinary arts.\u201cLoneliness won\u2019t just make you miserable \u2014 it will kill you,\u201d Dr. Nobel said. \u201cCreative arts expression has the power to connect you to yourself and others. How about a monthly potluck supper? It\u2019s so simple, such a great way to be connected as well as eat good food.\u201dMuch of modern life, though seeming to promote connectivity, has had the opposite effect of fostering social isolation and loneliness, experts say. According to the foundation, \u201cInternet and social media engagement exacerbates feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety.\u201d People rarely relate intimate tales of misery and isolation on Facebook. Rather, social media postings typically feature fun and friendship, and people who lack them are likely to feel left out and bereft. Electronic communications often replace personal, face-to-face interactions and the subtle signals of distress and messages of warmth and caring such interactions can convey.  Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Potent Acquisition Currency: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Microsoft\u2019s surging shares keep it in the deal game.\u2022 Microsoft is acquiring the popular computer code repository GitHub.\u2022 A trade war could put millions of jobs on the line.\u2022 Facebook gave hardware firms deep access to your information\u2022 What to expect from today\u2019s Apple developer conference.Mr. Schultz\u2019s decision to retire will most likely stoke speculation that he is considering a run for president in 2020. On Monday, he acknowledged for the first time that it is something he may consider:\u201cI want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines. For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201cI want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines. For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country \u2014 the growing division at home and our standing in the world.\u201dUnder Mr. Schultz\u2019s three decades managing the company, Starbucks grew from a tiny local chain into a global coffee giant, operating 28,000 stores in 75 countries. Shares of Starbucks have risen 21,000 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering in 1992; an investor who had put in $10,000 then would have more than $2 million today.Microsoft\u2019s planned acquisition of GitHub, a software development company, is not close to the company\u2019s largest, and it will not have a big, immediate impact on profits.But the deal is a milestone because it reveals the degree to which the rise in Microsoft\u2019s stock has bolstered its heft as an acquirer.Microsoft\u2019s stock has gone up more than 200 percent since Microsoft agreed in 2013 to pay $7.2 billion in cash for Nokia\u2019s handset and services operations. That price tag amounted to 2.6 percent of Microsoft\u2019s total market value back then. The $7.5 billion Microsoft is paying for GitHub is just under 1 percent of Microsoft\u2019s current market capitalization. This lessens the financial hit if the acquisition falls short of expectations, but increases the upside if it outperforms.In recent years, Microsoft\u2019s valuation has also increased, making its stock even more potent as an acquisition currency. Microsoft\u2019s shares currently trade at around 24 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to data from CapitalIQ. That\u2019s far higher than the 15 times it traded at in mid-2013.But it would be a mistake to conclude that Microsoft has not advanced in the market for acquisitions. Its soaring stock has made sure the company has remained a player in the deals game. The jump in its price-to-earnings ratio makes it more likely that a large deal would bolster earnings per share (after factoring in the extra shares issued to do the deal.) With its operations notching up strong organic growth, Microsoft probably does not need to do a big deal anytime soon. But if one were to crop up, shareholders may not balk.- Peter Eavis Satya Nadella happened, for one. (He succeeded Steve Ballmer as C.E.O. of Microsoft in 2014.) And the cloud, for another.Mr. Ballmer tried to target the flashier end of the consumer hardware market, with things like Windows Phone and the Zune music player. It didn\u2019t work. In contrast, Mr. Nadella has focused on enterprise applications \u2014 and in particular, found huge success in cloud computing.Since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, the cloud portion of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has soared from 3 percent to more than 21 percent this year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. Microsoft finished 2017 with 13 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group, a gain of three percentage points during the year.The company lags only Amazon Web Services as a cloud provider.Preparing for the futureMr. Nadella is also gearing up for the next big thing to be put into the cloud: artificial intelligence.Because such software is computationally demanding, it makes sense to pay for someone else to run programs on huge servers rather than buying one\u2019s own hardware. But it\u2019s also complex, which means that there is going to be a huge market for user-friendly software that can be taken up by regular developers and not just people with A.I. Ph.D.s.That\u2019s why there\u2019s a big race right now \u2014 between the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others \u2014 to offer up tools in the cloud that can process huge data sets and provide useful insights about them.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeWhat Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., said of the transaction:\u201cMicrosoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, a senior Microsoft executive, Nat Friedman, will become GitHub\u2019s C.E.O., while the coding hub\u2019s current chief, Chris Wanstrath, will become a Microsoft technical fellow. The acquisition is expected to close by year end.\u2022 GitHub: $7.5 billion\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Gabriel J.X. Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia:Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing.Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, has been adamant that his company stringently protects its customers\u2019 data privacy. Two news stories raise some questions about that categorical claim.The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Not too incriminating. But it\u2019s a reminder that Apple has made use of the data that passes across Facebook\u2019s platform.Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest\u2019s app for \u201cdrapes\u201d might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for \u201cNFL\u201d might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said.None of this is to say that Apple doesn\u2019t act by its word. But it is an important reminder to continue asking whether it really does.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe latest installment in the movie franchise, \u201cSolo,\u201d had its second disappointing weekend, pulling in just $29.3 million in the U.S. (We use \u201cjust\u201d advisedly.) But perhaps more important, it raises questions about the future of what is supposed to be one of Walt Disney\u2019s biggest moneymakers.The trend hasn\u2019t been reassuring, though. Disney likely took about $1 billion from \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d after accounting for production and marketing costs. But \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d the next movie in the main series, showed a marked drop. (To be fair, \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was the first new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie in more than a decade.)But \u201cSolo\u201d may highlight the pitfalls. Disney has said that it plans to release a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie every year, raising the real risk that moviegoers could end up suffering from Force fatigue. Just five months separated \u201cSolo\u201d from \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d Forcing through more movies \u2014 and video content for Disney\u2019s forthcoming streaming service \u2014 could erode the uniqueness that once defined the franchise\u2019s installments.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe automaker will face tough questions and tricky votes Tuesday at its annual shareholder meeting tomorrow.The company doesn\u2019t publish a sustainability report, which investors say makes it hard to keep tabs on workforce issues such as safety. And they are concerned that Tesla can\u2019t manage infrastructure changes ahead involving electric-vehicles and autonomous-driving cars.G.E. could sell assets to raise the cash, but that will be no easy feat. The conglomerate could sell Baker Hughes, but such a deal may only raise $20 billion, Mr. Tusa writes.\u201cThe bottom line is that we see the need to de-risk substantially, which includes the need for cash and a cut to the dividend to help with operational de-levering.\u201dWhile at Kirkland, Mr. Fraidin worked on transactions like 3G Capital\u2019s takeover of H.J. Heinz and Pershing Square and Valeant Pharmaceuticals\u2019 bid for the drug maker Allergan.From a statement by Pat Quinn, Cadwalader\u2019s managing partner:\u201cSteve brings great energy to our team and we look forward to rolling up our sleeves together in the service of our clients. He will significantly enhance our ability to provide market-leading experience and tailored solutions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedOver the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said.If that\u2019s accurate, Apple must tread carefully to avoid comparisons to Facebook.One advantage to being retained by lawyers for a client rather than by the client himself is that Mr. Sitrick is technically a member of the legal team, and therefore protected by attorney-client privilege. And though he is not a lawyer, Mr. Sitrick views himself as a litigator in the court of public opinion. He also charges lawyerly rates \u2014 as much as $1,100 an hour.Most of the time, the winner gets to ask Mr. Buffett for investing advice.

And lawmakers and independent researchers have questioned why the companies have been slow to respond to the problem.Twitter\u2019s archive of ads was made public on Thursday, but the company has said that finding an ad requires knowing what to look for. The archive allows users to see advertisements distributed for specific buyers, but it doesn\u2019t allow a broader search around terms to reveal, for instance, any advertisement run in support of President Trump, or political issue ads that mention immigration or gun control.Twitter has said it hopes to make it possible to search the archive by terms. The current version is just a first step toward improving transparency, the company said.Facebook has promised a wide range of efforts, which include verifying the identity of any person running a campaign ad on the platform. Facebook is also working with independent fact-checking teams, like PolitiFact, and starting a news literacy campaign to help teach the American public how to spot disinformation.Twitter, in addition to the new ad disclosure rules, said recently that it would start labeling tweets from people running for office \u2014 but only with the candidates\u2019 permission. A label on the biography page of a candidate would indicate that the person was running for office and the seat being pursued. The label would follow each tweet sent or retweeted from that account.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Diversity Efforts, Charted", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour years ago, Google became one of the first technology companies to release a race and gender breakdown of its work force.DealBook decided to chart some of the data to see how things are changing \u2014 or not, as the case may be.Google has a lower percentage of white employees than the national average, and a much bigger share of Asian workers. Latinos and black people are underrepresented in Google\u2019s work force. Facebook has a similar dynamic. By comparison, General Motors is more representative of the makeup of the United States.The percentage of Asian workers at Google has increased over the past four years \u2014 from 30 percent in 2014 to 36.3 percent this year. The proportion of white workers fell by 8 percentage points over the same period.Over the past four years, the percentage of black and Latino employees is up 0.7 and 0.6 percentage point. Over the past year, they are both up 0.1 percentage point, to 2.5 percent and 3.6 percent.The problem isn\u2019t just in hiring. For the first time, Google has released attrition rates for it work force. Attrition is highest among black and Latino staff and lowest among Asian employees. To that point, Google said in a statement that \u201cto improve work force representation we must focus not only on hiring, but also on developing, progressing, and retaining members of underrepresented employees, and creating an inclusive culture.\u201dCompared with the entire United States population, which skews slightly female, Google is much more male: Over two-thirds of its staff in 2018 are men.The percentage of women on Google\u2019s staff rose to 30.9 percent this year from 30.6 in 2014 \u2014 suggesting that the company is still finding it hard to reach gender parity.The percentage of technical roles at Google held by women has risen to 21.4 percent in 2018 from 16.6 percent in 2014, but, again, it still has a long way to achieve gender parity.\u201cDespite significant effort, and some pockets of success, we need to do more to achieve our desired diversity and inclusion outcomes,\u201d wrote Danielle Brown, Google\u2019s chief diversity and inclusion officer, in a statement issued along with the report. \u201cIf we want a better outcome, we need to evolve our approach.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Girl\u2019s Killing Shakes Germany\u2019s Migration Debate", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a gruesome murder: A 14-year-old girl was raped and strangled, her body buried under brushwood in a secluded area near the railway tracks near her hometown in western Germany.But the fact that the chief suspect is an Iraqi asylum seeker has turned a terrible crime into political dynamite.On Friday, the case dominated the German news media and became the latest cudgel for Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s opponents and, some predicted, a potential turning point in the migration debate in a country where some 10,000 asylum seekers still enter every month.There is no doubt the murder has given ammunition to those who want to get tougher, led by the far right, who are waging a widening challenge to what they contend is the government\u2019s botched handling of asylum cases.The killing comes on top of a deepening scandal and calls for a full-blown parliamentary investigation over allegations that civil servants may have granted asylum to as many as 1,000 migrants in exchange for money \u2014 and that some of those migrants may have been criminals or even terrorism suspects.The murder suspect, identified as Ali Bashar, a 20-year-old Iraqi, arrived in Germany in October 2015, shortly after Ms. Merkel opened the borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. He was rejected in late 2016, but was allowed to stay in the country while his appeal was pending.\u201cIf he had been deported, she would still be alive,\u201d read a headline in the country\u2019s largest tabloid, Bild, which devoted two pages to the case.He came to the attention of the police several times, involving allegations of jostling a police officer, robbing a passer-by and carrying a knife.Last Saturday, he and seven other members of his family managed to flee the country, boarding a plane in D\u00fcsseldorf with papers apparently issued by the Iraqi Consulate but featuring false names, after paying cash for a one-way fare to Istanbul and then on to Iraq, where he has since been arrested.The case is not linked to the scandal at the German migration agency, but together they have played into fears that Ms. Merkel\u2019s government is not in control of the migrant situation.The scandal at the migration agency has been building for weeks since state prosecutors began a criminal investigation into alleged corruption at a regional office in Bremen, in northern Germany. The investigation was recently broadened to include at least 10 other offices with above-average rates of granting asylum.Critics of Ms. Merkel, led by the nativist Alternative for Germany party, now the largest opposition party, have been calling for a parliamentary inquiry into her migration policy. The proposal is gaining traction with other parties, too, and could threaten Ms. Merkel\u2019s uneasy coalition with the Social Democrats.On Thursday night, after reports of the killing, Alice Weidel, the deputy leader of the AfD, accused Ms. Merkel of sharing responsibility in the death of the girl, who has been identified by the authorities as Susanna Feldmann, and called for her entire cabinet to step down.\u201cMake way for an asylum policy that is built around law and order, so fathers and mothers in our country no longer need to be afraid for their children,\u201d Ms. Weidel said in a video posted on Twitter.But there was plenty of outrage among centrist politicians, too. \u201cWhy was the perpetrator able to leave the country apparently under a false name?\u201d asked Christian Lindner, the leader of the liberal Free Democrats, who has also expressed support for a parliamentary inquiry.Karl Lauterbach, a politician of the center-left Social Democrats, put it this way: \u201cHow can a suspect get on a plane, even though his identity is unclear and cannot be established beyond doubt?\u201dRainer Wendt, head of one of Germany\u2019s biggest police unions, said the murder was emblematic of something larger.\u201cPeople feel that the state has lost control,\u201d Mr. Wendt said. \u201cThere are thousands of people in the country and we don\u2019t know who they are. That is an enormous security risk.\u201d\u201cA weak state no longer has the structure to quickly produce the right decisions,\u201d he said, adding that police, courts and migration officials had too few resources.In 2017, the number of registered criminal acts in Germany declined by nearly 10 percent, the steepest fall since the police first published the statistic 25 years ago. But violent crimes like murder and sexual assault have recorded a slight increase, the figures also show, which some attribute to the arrival of migrants.Over all, though, violent crime has been trending downward for the last decade in Germany, which remains one of the safest countries in Europe.Susanna was not the first German teenager to be murdered by an asylum seeker in recent years. In March, an Afghan man was sentenced to life in prison for raping and murdering a university student. In January, a 17-year-old high school student was stabbed to death by another Afghan teenager.\u201cThese cases seem to be adding up,\u201d the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said.This latest case comes as Horst Seehofer, the interior minister, is moving ahead with plans to concentrate asylum seekers in so-called anchor centers until their status is decided. Mr. Seehofer wants to speed up deportations.Like Mr. Bashar, over half a million people whose asylum applications were turned down remain in Germany, with about half of them due for deportation. But the authorities have had trouble keeping up, in part because of a lack of resources.For example, only one in two agents responsible for assessing migrants has access to fingerprint scanners, officials say.Trouble has been brewing at the migration agency since the summer of 2015, when Ms. Merkel first opened Germany\u2019s borders to more than 1.4 million migrants.Early on, images of overflowing asylum centers and anecdotal reports of migrants learning the Syrian national anthem and boasting of fake Syrian papers, hinted at a system overwhelmed by the numbers.Some spectacular failures followed: attacks by asylum seekers, including one by a young man already known to the police who killed 12 people at the Berlin Christmas market in 2016; and the discovery in 2017 that a German soldier with far-right sympathies had successfully registered as a Syrian refugee in 2015.Ms. Merkel, who was questioned by lawmakers on Wednesday, had to field multiple questions on migration. Leaving the demand for her resignation unanswered, the chancellor calmly cast Germany\u2019s decision in 2015 as a \u201chumanitarian response.\u201dFew expect that this will silence her critics.Susanna\u2019s mother has been chronicling her daily anguish on Facebook since her daughter went missing on May 22.The entry on June 1, a week after her daughter had disappeared, directly addressed Ms. Merkel.\u201cI turn to you with this cry for help because I feel abandoned by the German state as well as by our friend and helper (Police!!!),\u201d the mother wrote.The last text message she received from her daughter\u2019s cellphone on May 23 was written in bad German. \u201cDon\u2019t look for me,\u201d it said. \u201cI come in 2 or 3 weeks.\u201dAt that point Susanna was already dead.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Legacy Records Looks for History in a Brand New Neighborhood", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review8 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I don\u2019t know for sure whether Ryan Hardy, the chef and one of the three partners, has upgraded to better purveyors, but I do know I was taken aback, often, by the quality of the raw ingredients at Legacy Records.There was the raw sea scallop, so intensely fresh that its slices clung together stickily; Mr. Hardy had dressed it with dots of yogurt, tiny oval basil leaves, toasted almonds and tart little pink cells of finger lime. There was chilled Dungeness crab, a few pristine white chunks under sea urchin foam, to be spooned from a shot glass. And tiles of yellowfin tuna belly, not as fatty as bluefin but very rich all the same, under bits of salted lemon peel and a splash of colatura, the Italian fish sauce.Again with the main courses, I stopped and wondered: Where did Mr. Hardy find lamb (with snap peas and smoked cream) that tasted as if it had never eaten anything but fresh herbs? How did he find a rib-eye that\u2019s so tender and deeply flavorful without being flabby?Mr. Hardy has been quick to make the most of what the market says is the first month of spring and the calendar says is the last. Creamy new-crop potatoes deserve a little appreciation before they\u2019re sent off to root cellars, and Mr. Hardy built a fine appetizer around them with leggy broccoli sprouts and melting chunks of fresh mozzarella spiked with anchovy.Charred snap peas made a tangy salad together with ramps in a peppery buttermilk dressing. But sweet English peas were swallowed up by a too-sharp risotto; seasoned with prosciutto, the rice took on more of the ham\u2019s saltiness than its sweetness.Legacy Records doesn\u2019t say anything particularly original, but it has a finesse that\u2019s new for this restaurant group. There\u2019s an exceptional plate of grilled pigeon, neatly carved and served with swooshes of nettle pur\u00e9e. It is at least as impressive as the dish that\u2019s becoming a breakout star for the restaurant: a duck breast, its skin rubbed with pepper, chiles, honey and fennel and then roasted until it has a deep, crusty bark that a Texas pitmaster would be proud of.Ordering wine is an event in itself. Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, who are Mr. Hardy\u2019s partners and the resident wine soothsayers, have seen to it that cultists can rub elbows with the Agraparts, Raveneaus and Gajas, while the rest of us will still find a few bottles under $100 from some of the most expensive arable land on earth.Oddly enough, the wine list makes less of an impression than the ones at Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, simply because you\u2019d expect an ambitious cellar in a restaurant this expensive.Then again you might also expect a smart, artful dessert menu; if so, you\u2019re out of luck. There is ice cream with strawberries, a dark chocolate meringue and a selection of gelati, served in a cone; all perfectly pleasant, but there\u2019s more wit and creativity in the excellent cocktail roster administered by Jeff Bell.I\u2019m sure there are people who are reluctant to go to Legacy Records because of how relentlessly noisy this team\u2019s downtown restaurants are. But they seem to have sent the acoustics to obedience school, because all the sound waves do what they\u2019re told: Conversations stay at their own tables, while the music stays in the background.Ken Fulk, who designed all the public spaces in the building, covered some wall panels with grasscloth, put glove-soft leather on the tabletops, and found other ways to dampen the noise. Legacy Records certainly doesn\u2019t look like any other restaurant; Mr. Fulk went to extremes, using some motifs from the 1980s \u2014 emphatic grids, metallic finishes, whites and country-club greens \u2014 that not everybody is ready to see resurrected.If Legacy Recording Studios had been used by Mr. Gaye, Mr. Wonder and Ms. Ross, that homage might make sense. But it didn\u2019t. Lasting just from 2001 to 2009, the studio was built for and mostly used by orchestras, Broadway cast recordings and commercials. Legacy Records has taken this shred of history and turned it into a fantasy of black American music.Exhibited in a museum or gallery, Ms. Thomas\u2019s photo might be taken as a comment on the different postures and personas available to black women. Hanging it next to the counter where pastries and coffee are sold by day strips out some of its meaning; it looks like an attempt to buy a personality for a restaurant that doesn\u2019t have one of its own.If anyone gets to decide who can use black culture for what purposes, it surely isn\u2019t me.

Probably the biggest culprit is the ever-increasing price for media rights, particularly as digital players like Facebook and Twitter bid against traditional TV networks.As that money flows down to sports teams, their own valuations are going up. And that means, as the sports investment banker John Moag told Institutional Investor, having even $1 billion won\u2019t be enough to afford a franchise:\u201cOne person may be willing to put in $300 million to $500 million, but where will the remainder of the money come from?

Whether private equity firms would be willing to hold onto sports teams long enough to recoup their investments and make big profits, while avoiding the kinds of financial meddling that could destroy even championship franchises.\u2014 Michael de la MercedHow do you raise a fund that\u2019s as large as your two previous biggest combined?

Instagram has been meeting with popular social media stars and content publishers to find out how their video channels elsewhere would work within its app.Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, points out that in layering on new features, the photo-sharing service could turn itself into two distinct products:It\u2019s plausible that Instagram could break itself up into two apps.

{"Headline": "Schultz 2020? Other C.E.O.s Will Be Watching Closely", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince Donald Trump was unexpectedly elected president on Nov. 8, 2016, speculation has swirled about whether another well-known business leader might make a bid for the White House in 2020.Could that person be Howard Schultz?Mr. Schultz, the chairman and former chief executive of Starbucks, said on Monday that he was stepping down from the company\u2019s board. Though he did not announce a presidential bid, he acknowledged that he was considering entering politics.\u201cI intend to think about a range of options, and that could include public service,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a long way from making any decisions about the future.\u201dYet for executives who harbor presidential ambitions, there are few role models.\u201cThe history of business leaders in the White House has not been good,\u201d said Prof. Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University and a CNN contributor. \u201cYou basically have Herbert Hoover and Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Hoover, a mining executive who later served as commerce secretary under Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, presided over the start of the Great Depression. And Mr. Trump is among the most divisive presidents in American history.\u201cBecause we had the Great Depression on Hoover\u2019s watch, the feeling was that a businessperson in the White House was a disaster,\u201d said Mr. Brinkley, who has written books about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and others. \u201cAnd Trump was really a midlevel, self-employed C.E.O., not a real businessperson with a board of directors he was beholden to.\u201dToday, several factors are adding to speculation that someone from the upper ranks of corporate America might make a credible leader of the free world.The election of Mr. Trump, a real estate developer and reality television personality, certainly opened that door of opportunity, making it clear that American voters were willing to elect a president with no prior government experience. (The last businessman without government experience to make a serious run at the presidency, Ross Perot, finished third in a three-man race in 1992 with 19 percent of the vote.)And at a moment when many voters say they are frustrated with partisan gridlock and ineffective government programs, some believe that an efficiency-minded business executive might bring some discipline and pragmatism to the Oval Office.\u201cThere\u2019s this notion that government is less effective than it should be, and that the cure could be a modern American business leader,\u201d said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at the Duke University Fuqua School of Business. \u201cThere\u2019s room for a natural outsider who is seen as making decisions based on benefits and costs, and less on ideology. That\u2019s the theory at least.\u201dMr. Schultz\u2019s political aspirations are regarded with some skepticism among national Democrats, and it is unclear whether there is any popular constituency in the party for a wealthy white businessman who lacks government experience. But Mr. Schultz has repeatedly expressed interest in the presidency to his associates, and of the numerous political outsiders flirting with a 2020 campaign, he is seen as being among the more serious in his ambitions.And Mr. Schultz, 64, has another thing going for him: money. He is worth an estimated $2.8 billion, according to Forbes.\u201cIt costs a billion dollars to run for president today,\u201d said Mr. Brinkley, adding that Mr. Perot proved in 1992 that \u201cyou don\u2019t even have to campaign very hard, you just had to spend money.\u201dMr. Schultz is not alone in having deep pockets, of course. Mr. Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and a co-host of \u201cShark Tank,\u201d is another outspoken critic of President Trump who has flirted with a presidential run.When asked on Monday if he had given any more thought to a presidential bid, Mr. Cuban emailed, \u201cYes. But not willing to discuss at this point.\u201dAnd Ms. Winfrey, who is worth an estimated $2.9 billion, created a stir in January after she delivered a stirring speech at the Golden Globes that sounded to many like a presidential trial balloon.Since then, Ms. Winfrey\u2019s camp has offered mixed signals about her intentions. A representative for Ms. Winfrey declined to comment on Monday.Other big-name executives have effectively taken themselves out of the running.Mr. Iger seemed to be seriously entertaining the notion. But Disney\u2019s pending acquisition of a number of 21st Century Fox assets is contingent on his remaining chief executive for several more years, and he has signaled that he plans to remain at the company.Jamie Dimon, the chief of JPMorgan Chase, has been put forward as another potential presidential candidate who could appeal to voters with a mix of pragmatism, business success and charm. But in recent months Mr. Dimon has ruled out a presidential run, according to a person familiar with his thinking.In recent years, other prominent business leaders have fallen short in their efforts to reach the White House. Mitt Romney came from a political family and served as governor of Massachusetts. Running largely on his experience as a private equity executive, he won the Republican nomination in 2012, but lost to President Barack Obama.And Mr. Bloomberg, who built a successful company and was a popular mayor of New York City, deliberated for years, yet he never mounted a presidential campaign.But in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, business leaders may be emboldened to mount their own campaigns.Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School, said that experience running a company could translate on the campaign trail and in the Oval Office, where presidents must absorb huge amounts of new information and deal with a diverse audience of colleagues, lawmakers and citizens.\u201cA huge part to the presidency is learning,\u201d Ms. Koehn said. \u201cThe best C.E.O.s are great synthesizers, integrators and communicators, and most importantly they are great learners.\u201dUltimately, however, it takes more than success running a public company and a billion dollars to win over American voters.\u201cHoward Schultz could get some traction in the Democratic Party because Starbucks is seen as a way station of liberalism,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not a particularly charismatic person.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the date of the 2016 presidential election. It was Nov. 8, not Nov. 7.Alexander Burns contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And San Francisco is now the largest American city with a female mayor.\u201cWe were fast becoming an invisible people in this city,\u201d said the Rev.

Kennedy had just entered the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after celebrating his victory in California\u2019s Democratic presidential primary with supporters in the hotel\u2019s ballroom. Mr. Eppridge, who had covered conflict in Vietnam, Panama and Santo Domingo, instinctively moved closer to the source of the gunshots.\u201cI remember saying to myself as soon as I saw the senator on the floor, \u2018O.K., you\u2019ve had 10 year\u2019s training for a moment like this \u2026 now go to work,\u2019\u201d he wrote.Beside Kennedy knelt Juan Romero, a 17-year-old busboy who had been shaking the senator\u2019s hand moments before Sirhan B. Sirhan shot him. Behind Mr. Romero, a CBS cameraman, Jimmy Wilson, stood filming, his camera\u2019s light bathing the scene in an eerie glow. Mr. Eppridge positioned himself at Kennedy\u2019s feet and snapped two photos as Mr. Romero cradled the wounded senator\u2019s head. When Mr. Romero briefly looked up from Kennedy, Mr. Eppridge took a third photo. Fifty years later, that image \u2014 which Mr. Eppridge told NPR makes Kennedy\u2019s death look \u201calmost like a crucifixion\u201d \u2014 is arguably the one Americans most frequently remember when they think of Kennedy\u2019s assassination. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I had to make the picture,\u201d Mr. Eppridge, who died in 2013 at 75, told Hunger magazine, \u201cbut it had to be made.\u201d\u201cYou could see wealth, you could see poverty, old, young, women, men, black, white \u2014 I just remember the grief, and the sadness on everyone\u2019s face,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was an unbelievable scene.\u201d That evening, Mr. Eppridge went to Kennedy\u2019s burial site at Arlington National Cemetery, but he didn\u2019t photograph it, choosing instead to hold a candle and watch the proceedings \u201cas the campaign finally ended.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no question Bill developed a great admiration for Bobby and for the message he was spreading,\u201d said Sidney Monroe, co-owner of Monroe Gallery, which represents Mr. Eppridge\u2019s work.Mr. Eppridge\u2019s career continued to flourish after the campaign\u2019s end.

I tried to make myself quiet. If my sister and I laughed, it could make him angry, which would then make him sad. Did I want to laugh more than I wanted my father to stay alive? I learned not to ask for things, either, like money to get pizza with friends after school. If he didn\u2019t have the extra money, he\u2019d feel guilty, which would make him depressed. Did I want a slice of pizza more than I wanted my father to stay alive?The reasoning was as reductive as it was delusional.As it happened, after all of his efforts to end his life, my father died last July when he was hit by two cars as he walked with a friend on the side of a road in a thick, early morning fog. The police investigation confirmed it was an accident. When I woke up Friday to the news that Anthony Bourdain had ended his life on the heels of the news that Kate Spade had ended hers, I felt a tremendous sense of sadness, both because they were gone and because they had been in so much pain. But I cried for their loved ones and friends, who I imagined might be replaying their last interactions, trying to find the sign they had missed, the opportunity they should have taken, the point in the timeline at which they could have saved him. Could have rescued her.But the messages urging people to reach out to help loved ones and strangers carry an unspoken and unintended flip side: That if a person succeeds in ending his life, the people around him might not have been paying enough attention, or trying hard enough. I worry about the effect these messages have on those who have lost someone to suicide, deepening their grief with an extra layer of guilt. \u201cRather than thinking, \u2018I wish I could\u2019ve fixed this,\u2019 if we can use these moments as a wake up call to think, \u2018I want to be more present and aware and connected and empathetic in general,\u2019 \u2014 that would be so much more productive,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Dillon, assistant professor of medicine and psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College. \u201cAnd perhaps if all of us did that \u2014 and if communication, understanding and empathy were generally better \u2014 maybe fewer of these situations would come to a head.\u201d But I could no more have saved my dad from the tons of metal that hurtled toward him when he was hit by those cars than I could save him from the pills he swallowed, the razor he wielded or the carbon monoxide he inhaled. It is imperative that we try to help people find a way out of their pain that doesn\u2019t end in death, but we need to recognize that if their attempt is a success, it is not because our love was a failure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Went Wrong for Villaraigosa: A California Stalwart Ponders His Loss for Governor", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "The former Los Angeles mayor said wealthy voters rejected his message \u2014 and working class voters failed to turn out.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Antonio R. Villaraigosa was the high-riding mayor of this city for eight years. His election as its first Latino chief executive in modern times was an electrifying moment. Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat, has over the years expressed high ambitions for his future: a cabinet secretary in a Hillary Clinton White House. Governor of California. A next-generation leader for Latinos across the nation.He drew just 13 percent of the vote after a campaign calling for California to confront an economic divide that he warned threatened its future. It was a stunningly poor showing given the arc of his career: City Council, State Assembly, Assembly speaker, mayor, chairman of the 2012 Democratic National Convention. And it came even after charter school advocates financed a $23 million independent campaign on his behalf.\u201cMy message resonated in areas where people are struggling \u2014 it didn\u2019t resonate where people are doing well,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said, sitting at a dining room table in his home, near wraparound windows that offered views of the Hollywood sign, downtown Los Angeles, the Pacific Ocean and Griffith Park. \u201cI understand Latinos voted two to one for me. They just didn\u2019t come out in big numbers.\u201d\u201cLook, I\u2019ve been out of office for five years,\u201d he said, after using his phone to adjust the volume of the jazzy music coming from hidden speakers scattered around the sprawling top floor of the house. \u201cI had never run for statewide office before. I had started at a big disadvantage.\u201dHis third-place finish suggested to some that Latino voters have yet to become the major political force in this state that their numbers would suggest. Or perhaps Mr. Villaraigosa, who left City Hall an unpopular figure after a tenure that included a high-profile affair with a television reporter, was not the man they wanted to be the symbol of modern-day Latino power.Mr. Villaraigosa lost to Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican businessman who won the endorsement of Mr. Trump: Those two will face each other on the November ballot. Mr. Villaraigosa said he and his aides saw his own prospects wane as support for Mr. Cox rose after the Trump endorsement.Over the course of a 45-minute interview \u2014 a break, he said, from writing thank-you letters to supporters \u2014 Mr. Villaraigosa said he took responsibility for his own loss.He acknowledged that he left City Hall a decidedly unpopular figure, as many in the city turned against him \u2014 viewing him more as a showman than as a chief executive, particularly after the affair. And his life today, as a wealthy businessman living in the Hollywood Hills, is a long way from his roots \u2014 growing up in a working-class family in East Los Angeles \u2014 which some analysts suggested might have contributed to any weak showing among Latino voters.Roberto Suro, professor of public policy and journalism at the University of Southern California, said that Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s campaign for governor never matched the excitement of his races for mayor, or for that matter, his early years in City Hall, when he was often seen with celebrities and presidents, showing up at the Oscars, Dodger games and glamorous Hollywood events.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any of the buzz he did in the first two mayoral elections,\u201d said Mr. Suro, who has studied Latino political power in California. \u201cWe had people on the West Side then who said, \u2018We have to show what kind of city we are by electing a Latino mayor.\u2019 I didn\u2019t sense any of that. It wasn\u2019t there.\u201dMr. Villaraigosa drew a somber contrast between what he found when he ran for mayor \u2014 crowds waiting to greet him, banks of television cameras at every news conference \u2014 and this relatively desultory campaign. \u201cEvery time we had a press conference we had multiple cameras,\u201d he said, recalling the highlights of his mayoral race. \u201cHere we had to do Facebook Live. Facebook Live! Nobody came to the press conferences.\u201dA key question going forward is whether Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s collapse offered a verdict on the power of the Latino vote. But it is difficult to measure because there were no exit polls \u2014 which gives researchers valuable information on who turned out and why \u2014 and the vote tally is not complete.\u201cThere is no question that there was a lack of turnout and a lack of enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Suro said. \u201cThis guy was a two-term mayor of Los Angeles running to be the first Latino governor since the 1800s and nobody stood up to salute?\u201dBut Matt A. Barreto, the head of the Latino Policy and Politics Initiative at the University of California, Los Angeles, said an early review of some vote totals \u2014 in heavily Latino districts in Orange County and Los Angeles County \u2014 suggested that those voters had turned out to a considerable extent, and voted for Latino candidates on the ballot, such as Xavier Becerra, a Democrat and the attorney general, and Alex Padilla, the secretary of state. He said that Mr. Villaraigosa had trailed behind them.\u201cI think it\u2019s more a function of him being out of politics longer and Newsom being a good candidate,\u201d Mr. Barreto said. \u201cIt was hard to attack Newsom for being bad for the Latino community. That made it difficult for Villaraigosa.\u201dThe former mayor has spent the past few days with his family and aides, thinking, he said, more about what to do next than what went wrong. Retirement, he said, glancing around his opulent home, its walls covered with art, and a sprawling deck outside the third-floor kitchen, is not an option. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to get some work,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably business.\u201dMr. Villaraigosa said he has made a point of trying not to read accounts of his loss, or pore over the data of what went wrong. But he noticed when Mayor Eric M. Garcetti, his successor at City Hall, offered criticism of his campaign, suggesting that money had been wasted and that his message had been muddled.\u201cI heard that he did that,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cIt\u2019s just noise. People say stuff off the cuff. If I don\u2019t know what happened, how does anyone else know?\u201dMr. Garcetti is now actively exploring a race for president. Asked if he had any advice to give back to the current mayor, the former mayor paused.\u201cWell after losing the election by the margin I did,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said, \u201cI think I\u2019m humble enough to reserve any advice I have to a one-on-one conversation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Californians Go to Polls With High Stakes and Some High Anxiety", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOLANA BEACH, Calif. \u2014 Candidates from governor and senator to county assessor and city councilor used the final hours before Tuesday\u2019s primary to campaign across California, but state and national Democrats were anxiously watching three Orange County House districts where they fear their glut of contenders could lock them out of the general election.After pouring millions into television commercials, digital advertising and mailers in side-by-side districts held by Representatives Dana Rohrabacher, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce, all Republicans, Democrats remained uncertain that one of their own would emerge as one of the two leaders. Under California\u2019s so-called top-two system, only the two top vote-getters, regardless of party, make it to the November ballot.With seven Republican-held seats that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, California is a linchpin to Democratic hopes for taking back control of the House. But the liberal backlash to President Trump here has prompted so many to pursue office that Democrats fear their candidates will divide the vote and leave the party that has won every statewide election for a decade without a general election candidate, in what should be winnable races.\u201cI try not to worry about what I can\u2019t control,\u201d said Gil Cisneros, the Navy veteran and lottery jackpot winner whom national Democrats have rallied behind in the campaign to replace Mr. Royce, who is retiring. Standing in his Brea, Calif., campaign office before heading out for an 11th hour round of door-knocking, his 4-year-old twins running between his legs, Mr. Cisneros added: \u201cWe knew with so many people in the race we would need to focus on getting our name out there, our message out there early on.\u201dThe race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown and the question of whether veteran moderate Senator Dianne Feinstein would be vulnerable to a challenge from the left were once thought to be the most high-profile 2018 California races.But Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has emerged as the clear favorite in the governor\u2019s race, with a Trump-endorsed Republican, John Cox, seemingly well positioned to finish second on Tuesday. Antonio Villaraigosa, a former Los Angeles mayor, was far outraised by Mr. Newsom, and the likely Republican nominee got a lift when Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, encouraged Mr. Trump to tweet his support for Mr. Cox.And in the Senate race, Ms. Feinstein has overwhelmed her leading Democratic opponent, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the State Senate president, with money \u2014 some of which she gave herself.For much of this spring, Democrats were most uneasy about not getting a candidate through in Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s seat and one farther south along the Pacific that is currently represented by Mr. Issa, who is retiring. But in the last week, they have grown more alarmed by early voting trends in the seat held by Mr. Royce that show a more Republican-leaning electorate.Assemblywoman Young Kim, a Republican, is virtually certain to emerge as the leading vote-getter overall in the district, but Democrats are concerned that Mr. Cisneros\u2019s vote may be diluted by three others in his own party \u2014 hopefuls like Mai Khanh Tran, a first-time candidate.Braving the blistering Southern California sun Monday morning, Patti Adams and her daughter, Olivia, set out to erect signs for Ms. Tran, a Vietnamese refugee and physician.Ms. Adams, a 53-year-old educator, typifies the newly engaged Californian Democrats: She watched elections from the sidelines all her life, she said. Then Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential victory and his policies on health care, education, immigration and the environment compelled her to change from an informed voter to a campaign activist.\u201cIt has been so empowering for me,\u201d she said, as she drove around with a stash of signs in her silver Dodge Caravan. \u201cIt\u2019s better than typing my thoughts on Facebook.\u201dA similar dynamic is playing out in Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s district, which hugs the Pacific from Seal Beach south to Laguna Beach, where 15 candidates are seeking his job.National Democrats have rallied behind Harley Rouda, a wealthy business executive. But they have been battling a remaining handful of Democrats still in the race and confronting an even thornier challenge: five Democrats who are not in the race but whose names are still on the ballot.Alarmed about these \u201cghost candidates,\u201d the House Democratic campaign arm printed pamphlets indicating who had dropped out of the race. But some internal polling still showed at least one of the former candidates still drawing votes.The other challenge for Democrats in the district is the vulnerability of the incumbent: The Russia-friendly Mr. Rohrabacher has turned off some Republicans and cleared a path for Scott Baugh, a former assemblyman, to mount a formidable campaign. Democrats have responded by unleashing a barrage of ads aimed at driving down Mr. Baugh\u2019s vote share and propping up a little-known, third Republican in the race, but it is unclear if that will be enough to get Mr. Rouda into the top two.Democrats were, however, feeling more optimistic about their prospects in Mr. Issa\u2019s district, where a negative campaign against one of the Republican contenders, Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, appeared to have been effective.Less clear, though, is which Democrat out of 16 candidates would emerge against the likely Republican standard-bearer, former Assemblywoman Diane Harkey, in a district that stretches from Camp Pendleton south to La Jolla.Polling is difficult among so many contenders, especially when few are very well known, but the three leading Democratic candidates appeared to be Sara Jacobs, the only woman in the Democratic field; Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel; and Mike Levin, a lawyer.A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.Ms. Jacobs, 29, was encouraged to enter the race by Emily\u2019s List, a fund-raising organization devoted to electing women who support abortion rights. She said she sees her age and gender as strengths, though she said both have made it easier for people to question her qualifications.\u201cVoters really are looking for a change, for something different,\u201d Ms. Jacobs said. \u201cAnd I provide the best, clearest example of what different looks like.\u201dWhile the three Southern California districts could offer Democrats some unwanted drama Tuesday, party officials felt broadly optimistic about their prospects in a state where undeclared voters now outnumber Republicans.And perhaps nowhere are they more confident than in Representative Steve Knight\u2019s seat, one of the few bastions of conservatism in Los Angeles County.Younger, more left-leaning families who were priced out of the housing market closer to the city of Los Angeles have moved into the district, diversifying the population, which is now nearly 40 percent Latino.\u201cThis is the Democratic stronghold,\u201d said Bryan Caforio, one of the leading Democratic candidates in the race. \u201cThere are more Democrats in the Antelope Valley than anywhere else.\u201dNot everyone agrees that the Democrats are in such a strong position. Patricia Garcia, 49, a registered Republican from Simi Valley, said she was not happy with how blue California had become. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a little bit too liberal for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see California moving too far to the left.\u201dWell to the north, in the state\u2019s Central Valley, Representative Jeff Denham is another Republican facing a threat in a district carried by Mrs. Clinton.And Jerry Kinkey, 71, is precisely the type of voter that Democrats are counting on this year.In the driveway of his home in Tracy, Mr. Kinkey, a registered Republican and a Vietnam veteran, said he had flipped in this election. He voted by mail last week.He dropped his support of Mr. Denham because of the lawmaker\u2019s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The top Democratic contenders to unseat him include Josh Harder, a former technology venture capitalist; Virginia Madue\u00f1o, the former mayor of the small city of Riverbank; and Sue Zwahlen, an emergency room nurse.So which Democrat did Mr. Kinkey pick?There were so many names on the ballot, he can\u2019t remember. \u201cI had to wing it,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Miriam Jordan from Brea, Calif., Thomas Fuller from Modesto, Sydney Ember from Simi Valley, Jose A.

Times on Sunday published a blaring banner headline on its front page, the sort usually reserved for the start of wars or devastating natural disaster: \u201cA new era of Times ownership.\u201dThe coverage, which included an exhaustive history of the paper \u2014 its rise under a Civil War colonel named Harrison Gray Otis in the late 1800s to national and international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 reflected the anticipation across the newsroom and the city as it awaits what changes are in store under Dr. Soon-Shiong.While he has promised to make new investments, much of Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s plans to reshape the paper for the digital age are vague.

{"Headline": "Where a Taboo Is Leading to the Deaths of Young Girls", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTURMAKHAND, Nepal \u2014 Not long ago, in rural western Nepal, Gauri Kumari Bayak was the spark of her village. Her strong voice echoed across the fields as she husked corn. When she walked down the road at a brisk clip, off to lead classes on birth control, many admired her self-confidence.But last January, Ms. Bayak\u2019s lifeless body was carried up the hill, a stream of mourners bawling behind her. Her remains were burned, her dresses given away. The little hut where she was pressured to sequester herself during her menstrual period \u2014 and where she died \u2014 was smashed apart, erasing the last mark of another young life lost to a deadly superstition.\u201cI still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s not alive,\u201d said Dambar Budha, her father-in-law, full of regret, sitting on a rock, staring off into the hills.Each year, at least one woman or girl \u2014 often more \u2014 dies in these huts, from exposure to the cold, smoke inhalation or attacks by animals. Just this June, another young woman was found dead in a menstruation hut, bitten by a snake. Her family tried to cover up the death, the police said, by destroying the hut and quickly burying her body, but the authorities exhumed it and are investigating what happened.Many women keep doing it, out of intense social pressure or even guilt, and every evening, across these rippled green hills where little wisps of smoke melt into the darkening sky, hundreds of menstruating women and girls trudge out of their houses into chhaupadi huts.One woman, Mansara Nepali, sheepishly showed me hers. Made of stone, it was no more than three feet tall. As Ms. Nepali bent herself nearly in half to get in, she thunked her head on the tiny door frame.\u201cWe built this ourselves,\u201d she said, rubbing her forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not so good.\u201dLike many other women I met, Ms. Nepali, who thought she was around 35, was illiterate. She had never gone to school and seemed embarrassed about her poverty. Her face was deeply grooved, cheeks reddened from laboring outside every day on a windy mountainside.In these villages, women are the workhorses. I saw one middle-aged woman shuffle into a market carrying what must have been 200 pounds of apples on her back, in boxes tied by ropes around her chest.Another problem that many women in this area have, aid workers said, is a prolapsed uterus, a painful condition in which the uterus slips down and protrudes from the vagina. It can be caused by heavy lifting and difficult births, both common here.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the suffering and humiliation women have to endure because of harsh traditions,\u201d said Pashupati Kunwar, who runs a small aid group to help women. \u201cDomestic violence is still bad. Child marriage is still high. We are trying to convince people that times are changing, but superstition is still strong.\u201dThe chhaupadi tradition seems especially hard to break. From the earliest age, people here are taught that any contact with a menstruating woman will bring bad luck. Most do not question it.\u201cIf a woman goes inside the family\u2019s home during her period, three things will happen,\u201d explained a farmer named Runcho. \u201cA tiger will come; the house will catch on fire; and the head of the house will get sick.\u201dMr. Runcho spoke without any doubt or flourish. When asked if he had ever seen a tiger in his village, he smiled and didn\u2019t answer yes or no, but then told a long story about how, maybe 10 years ago, he accidentally brushed up against his daughter when she was menstruating and lost his sight for several days.\u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d he said.As he spoke, his teenage niece, who was having her period, was getting ready to crawl into a storage space beneath his house. The sun was setting behind the mountains, a cool wind sweeping in. The storage space was dark, cold, cramped and smelled like wet fur \u2014 and it was filled with itchy straw.\u201cI\u2019m happy to go down there,\u201d said his niece, Devika. \u201cI don\u2019t want my parents to get sick.\u201dHer uncle watched her closely.\u201cThe only problem,\u201d she added, \u201cis that our mobiles don\u2019t work down there. We need to go outside to check our Facebook updates.\u201dWhen I asked Mr. Runcho if he would like to sleep in the crawl space, he laughed. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for women!\u201dIn some villages, menstruating women are sent to cow sheds. Women who just gave birth are also considered polluted, and many remain isolated with their newborns for several days. Two years ago, said Ms. Kunwar, the women\u2019s aid worker, a mother left her newborn alone in a shed for just a few minutes to wash her clothes. A jackal skulked in and snatched the baby.Many religions observe rules around menstruation, and Hinduism places a special emphasis on purity and pollution. Still, scholars are not sure why the menstruation taboo is so strong in western Nepal, where countless villages, across an area comprising hundreds of miles, still practice it.It may be because this region of Nepal is poor, relatively homogeneous, overwhelmingly Hindu and remote, and the houses tend to be small. (In other Hindu subcultures, menstruating women can be secluded to some degree within their homes.)Some women have to sleep in the huts for an entire week. When it comes to meals, they are not allowed to cook, which several women said was actually a relief. They often sit by themselves in their menstruation huts and wait for family members to slide them plates of food.They are also not supposed to touch livestock; if a calf or goat strays into their hut, they have to yell for someone else to shoo it out, out of fear the animal will get sick. During the day, the menstruating women work in the fields like everyone else, though they make sure not to come in contact with other villagers; at night, they go to the huts.But a growing number of people are trying.Dharma Raj Kadayat is one of the chhaupadi rebels. He grew up in a small mountainside village in western Nepal, a couple hours\u2019 drive from where Ms. Bayak died and where women still pound grain with a seesaw-like plank. He then spent nearly 20 years in Kathmandu, Nepal\u2019s relatively cosmopolitan capital.When he recently came back to take a job as an administrator in a hospital, he said he felt ashamed that his relatives were still practicing chhaupadi.\u201cIt\u2019s so backward,\u201d he said.A few years ago during a Hindu festival, he stood up in front of the whole village and made a speech about how any woman who does not want to go into a shed when she was menstruating was welcome to stay in his house.\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d a man yelled out from the crowd.He said that activists had persuaded many families in his village to destroy their huts. But a few months later, people got scared and rebuilt them all.Though menstruating women of all ages sleep in the huts, chhaupadi seems to disproportionately kill the young. Activists said this may be because young women aren\u2019t as savvy about protecting themselves; for example, they might not know which type of snakes are poisonous or how important it is to keep the hut\u2019s door slightly open if there\u2019s a fire burning.\u201cOur conclusion,\u201d said Rewati Raman Bhandari, a former member of Parliament, \u201cwas that if we left this up to society to change, it would take hundreds of years.\u201dMr. Budha, the father-in-law of the woman who died in January, Ms. Bayak, now tells as many people who will listen about the chhaupadi dangers.\u201cBut people don\u2019t care,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI say, \u2018My daughter died, yours could, too.\u2019 But then they say, \u2018We are sorry but that is our culture.\u2019 \u2019\u2019It wasn\u2019t lost on him that Ms. Bayak, who the family said was around 20 when she died, was something of a feminist, leading birth control classes and encouraging women to stand up for themselves.\u201cBut even she still followed this tradition,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe pressure\u2019s too strong. If she hadn\u2019t gone to the hut during her period, she would have felt embarrassed.\u2019\u2019He misses everything about her, he said: the way she read books, her enthusiasm for life, her voice. Ms. Bayak moved in with her husband\u2019s family after she married and grew especially close to her in-laws. After she died, it was her guilt-ridden father-in-law who smashed apart the menstruation hut with his own hands.Since then, he has insisted that his wife sleep in the main house during her period.\u201cAnd you know what?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cNothing bad has happened. All these years, we\u2019ve been fooled into believing a false superstition.\u2019\u2019Bhadra Sharma and Rojita Adhikari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Yet the biggest-selling nonfiction title on record in Australia concerns \u2014 of all things \u2014 personal finance.In a country of 24 million people, Scott Pape has sold more than one million copies of \u201cThe Barefoot Investor: The Only Money Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need\u201d since its publication by Wiley in December 2016 (a third updated version comes out on July 2). Even more extraordinary than those sales figures is the devotion of Mr. Pape\u2019s followers. They use terms like \u201csplurge card\u201d (a debit card for everyday luxuries), \u201cmojo account\u201d (for when you feel like quitting your job) and \u201cfire extinguisher funds\u201d (emergency reserves) with an enthusiasm not normally associated with fiscal responsibility.Part of Mr. Pape\u2019s appeal probably comes from the fact that so many Australians are happy to have more money than they\u2019d expected, but it\u2019s also a function of just how Australian he is.The 39-year-old, who has since rebuilt his property from scratch, isn\u2019t big on tough love. Instead, his tone is relentlessly casual, as though to make us forget we\u2019re reading about compound interest. At the end of each chapter, he encourages the reader to head to the pub. \u201cMoney talk is better with garlic bread and wine,\u201d he writes, counseling couples to talk through financial issues on the back of a napkin at least once a month. Throughout, he displays a suspicion for authority and a disdain for the wealthy, which syncs with the Australian national mythology of a classless society. Have a drink, he suggests at the end of a chapter about cutting up your credit cards, reasoning that it\u2019s not every day you save yourself from paying off some banker\u2019s BMW.On the phone from his farm, Mr. Pape is clear on what his book is not. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a wealth creation book which will make you a millionaire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about security.\u201d He\u2019s \u201cbarefoot\u201d because that\u2019s how life was for him growing up in a rural area, working alongside his father who ran and later owned a gas station.After a business degree at a regional university, Mr. Pape worked for a short time as a stockbroker in Melbourne before starting his own financial advising business. \u201cI went into finance not for the wealth, or the $300 pair of jeans, but because I wanted to keep my freedom,\u201d he said. Ten years ago, he started writing a syndicated newspaper column on personal finance. He\u2019s proud to say he\u2019s never been in the business of making outlandish claims \u2014 like telling people they can retire early. Mr. Pape himself isn\u2019t interested in stopping work, ever. \u201cI enjoy what I do too much.\u201d He is skeptical of \u201cthose guys who run around saying, \u2018I retired at 35, and you can too.\u2019\u201dMr. Pape\u2019s folksy manner delivers down-home truths: Don\u2019t get swept up in trendy investments; pay off your debts; analyze how banks are managing your money. As a result, it\u2019s uncontroversial with experts. Chris Richardson, an economist at Deloitte in Canberra, said that Mr. Pape\u2019s major tenets, like his argument that Australians have generally overvalued property and undervalued stock trading \u201care more real then people realize.\u201dAnother cornerstone of the Barefoot Investor\u2019s plan that resonates with economists is the importance of renegotiating bank fees, which, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia, run to 480 Australian dollars, around $355, a household per year. \u201cOver ten years,\u201d Mr. Pape writes, that\u2019s \u201cenough to take you to New York City and stay at a five-star hotel.\u201dBank fees are lower in the United States; in Australia, just four banks represent about 80 percent of the total share of the market. \u201cWe certainly have high market concentration by international standards,\u201d said Danielle Wood, an economist at the Grattan Institute, a public policy think tank in Melbourne. Ms. Wood sees high bank fees as a result of status quo bias, or the tendency to accept things the way they are, perhaps understandable for a country doing so well economically. \u201cI think the message of the Barefoot Investor gets traction because he encourages people to think about things, and think about why they\u2019re paying too much,\u201d she said.Jackie Frankel, a 47-year-old factory worker from Australia\u2019s Mornington Peninsula, is a zealous Barefooter, as Mr. Pape\u2019s fans are known. She concedes that her two grown daughters don\u2019t completely understand his appeal. \u201cThey say to me, it\u2019s common sense stuff to figure out what you owe, but I say people need it in black and white,\u201d Ms. Frankel said. After reading the book, she and her husband, who also works in a factory, started going out for \u201cdate breakfasts.\u201d (Nights were out because of their shifts.) After talking it through over eggs, they moved their money from one of the \u201cbig four\u201d banks to an online-only account recommended by name in Mr. Pape\u2019s book. (He says that he does not accept any endorsements, and will pull a recommendation if he sees a company using his name in advertising.) \u201cWe saved $500 a month just doing that, and now we\u2019re going to New Zealand on a cruise,\u201d Ms. Frankel said.Australians love to travel internationally: about 60 percent hold passports, compared with around 40 percent of Americans. Mr. Pape doesn\u2019t come across as abstemious about these sorts of big-ticket expenses. Instead, he advocates for letting the good times roll by divvying money into \u201cbuckets.\u201d This approach ensures daily expenses are separated from \u201csplurges,\u201d like lattes, and \u201csmile\u201d purchases, which, like vacations, make you smile when you think of them. Call it the set and forget principle of money management.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t subscribe to the idea that you\u2019ve got to get down to the bare bones and have no fun,\u201d said Ali Cusack, a 31-year-old lawyer in Melbourne. \u201cHe just says, build it into your budget.\u201d Ms. Cusack has been to Europe each summer for the past two years and recently started her own maritime law practice. \u201cI got so ridiculously good at saving money that I didn\u2019t even need to take out a loan to start my own business,\u201d she said.Mr. Pape knows Australians have it good. \u201cYou and I won the lifestyle lotto,\u201d is how he puts it in the book. But Australians also don\u2019t generally like to be perceived as promoting themselves. Tall poppy syndrome, which refers to Australians\u2019 supposed aversion to high-achieving individuals, can extend to avoiding sensitive topics, including money. Mr. Pape wants to change that, and his next book, which is due out with HarperCollins in September, will focus on how families can be more open about their financial situation.\u201cI\u2019ve got three little kids so that\u2019s where I\u2019m at at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI have parents who come to me and say, \u2018my little Tim is such a saver, he doesn\u2019t spend any of his money.\u2019\u201d Mr. Pape says he worries about how miserly \u2014 and miserable \u2014 that kid will be when he\u2019s 28. \u201cYou want your kids to grow up generous and hardworking and enjoying their life.\u201d His advice to parents: Talk to your kids about money. It\u2019s a way of sharing your values.Amelia Lester is an Australian writer living in Japan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Evolutionary Origin of Descending Testicles", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDescending testicles were likely present in the earliest mammals, then subsequently disappeared in elephants, manatees and their relatives, according to a new study. Reader, here\u2019s an incomplete list of things you shouldn\u2019t try with elephants: a memory contest, jump rope and castration. Biologists have wondered about this discrepancy for decades. Did the earliest mammals retain their testicles, like elephants, or did they let their family jewels drop? A new study, published Thursday in PLOS Biology, says it was the latter. Scientists often rely on geologic fossils to piece together evolutionary history, but this study shows that there is also a \u201cfossil record in the genome,\u201d said Mark Springer, a biology professor at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the research. These \u201cmolecular fossils\u201d abound across the tree of life. \u201cFor pretty much any species, you\u2019ll typically find on the order of a hundred or more broken genes that existed back in time and were lost,\u201d said Michael Hiller, a senior research group leader at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany, and senior author of the new paper.He and the study\u2019s lead author, Virag Sharma, did not start out targeting testicles. Additionally, they noticed that two genes called RXFP2 and INSL3 were inactive in several afrotherian species. From a literature search the researchers learned that if you knock these genes out in male mice, the rodents\u2019 testicles won\u2019t descend. They also learned that evolutionary biologists have long debated whether this absence of testicular descent \u2014 called testicondy \u2014 is a primitive trait, or one that afrotherians uniquely evolved. \u201cIt became clear that we\u2019d be able to help resolve that debate,\u201d Dr. Hiller said. It may be that researchers are only \u201clooking at part of the picture,\u201d and that other genes and processes involved have not yet been identified, said Ross MacPhee, a mammalogy curator at the American Museum of Natural History who did not participate in the new study.There\u2019s also the question of why testicles plummet in the first place. Given that they hold precious, life-giving contents, why carry them in vulnerable sacks? Scientists know that optimal sperm production requires temperatures lower than that of rest of the body, but they don\u2019t understand why. The answer may lie in further study of afrotherians, particularly why and how they came to hold their testicles so close. Advertisement"}

Not so fast.Many New York City landlords expect to see some hefty financial documentation from prospective tenants and their guarantors. To increase your chances of landing an apartment, brokers suggest collecting the following paperwork before even starting a search and, if possible, submitting it the same day you see an apartment.Here is what you will need:\u2022 Pay stubs, if you are already working, typically for the last two months\u2022 Otherwise, a letter from an employer stating your position, salary, length of employment or anticipated start date\u2022 Tax returns for at least two years\u2022 Recent bank statements, typically for the last three months\u2022 Proof of other income, like revenue from stocks, securities, real estate or trust funds\u2022 Contact information for previous landlords\u2022 Personal references\u2022 Business references\u2022 A credit report (many landlords require a score of at least 600 and would like to see 700; most will also do their own credit check, for which they charge a nonrefundable fee, usually included in the application fee)\u2022 Enough money on hand to cover initial costs____For that ideal studio that rents for $2,300 a month, you will likely also need:\u2022 A nonrefundable application fee of $50 to $150\u2022 The first month\u2019s rent of $2,300\u2022 The last month\u2019s rent of $2,300 (this is not always required, as some landlords don\u2019t ask for it)\u2022 A security deposit of $2,300\u2022 A broker\u2019s fee of 12 to 15 percent of the annual rent, or $3,312 to $4,140 (unless you get lucky and find an apartment without a broker)The total: somewhere between $4,650 and $11,190.____What if you don\u2019t have enough income or a guarantor? Here are a few options:\u2022 Try renting a condo: Individual condo owners tend to be more lenient about paperwork; while management companies might ask for six months or a year of rent up front, an individual might want just one extra month (although there may be an additional condo board application fee).\u2022 Work with a company like Rhino, Jetty or Insurent: For a fee, they offer guarantor services and money for things like security deposits.\u2022 Find a room share or sublet: Jack Clausen, the creative marketing officer at Gypsy Housing, said that room shares posted on the Facebook site range from $650 to more than $1,500. But while potential roommates may not ask you to submit pay stubs, they can still be fussy about employment and references, and might grill you on your kitchen habits.\u2022 Look for apartments in the city\u2019s less expensive pockets and in no-frills buildings.\u2022 Throw up a wall: In listing parlance, a \u201cflex\u201d one-bedroom means that the landlord will not mind if you put up a wall in a studio to create another bedroom.

What has happened in the city since then? Sabrina Tavernise, a national correspondent for The New York Times, and Lynsea Garrison, a producer for \u201cThe Daily,\u201d examine the question in this five-part audio series about a Baltimore teenager known as Nook, who was fatally shot by a police officer a year and a half after Mr. Gray\u2019s death.SABRINA TAVERNISE: At the corner of Warwick and Windsor \u2014 the intersection where Nook was killed \u2014 there\u2019s this stop sign. And sometimes, when people drive by, they see balloons that are tied to it. It\u2019s Toby who ties them there. She puts them up for Nook. She tied up a bunch when he would\u2019ve graduated from high school in 2017. She goes there a lot. Not only for the balloons \u2014 she goes to re-enact his death.LASHANDA \u201cTOBY\u201d DOUGLAS: He facing this way. He right here. He got out the car, he ran like this. Ran past that car, ran out here like this, down here, \u2019cause he like this. Remember, and then he like this, and he fell right there, he fell right there. He fell right there. There, like this \u2014 one, two, three. Nook died right here.TAVERNISE: She\u2019s trying to retrace his very last steps.DOUGLAS: See \u2014 wait a minute, he facing \u2014 O.K., the car \u2014\u2014 [SOUND OF CAR HORN]TAVERNISE: God. DOUGLAS: See him like this?TAVERNISE: Yeah.DOUGLAS: And I say he \u2014\u2014[SOUND OF CAR HORN]DOUGLAS: Go around! Go around! Go around!TAVERNISE: And sometimes, she goes there just to sleep in her car, to be close to him. People say they see her there, sleeping.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: Grief has really changed Toby, even physically. Since he died, she\u2019s lost 50 pounds.DAVETTA PARKER: You see how she look now? She ain\u2019t never looked like that. She was pretty. She was heavy. She had weight.DOUGLAS: Mhmm.TAVERNISE: Is that you?DOUGLAS: Mhmm. Amazing, right? Totally different person.PARKER: You know, she was having problems in the house, because she kept seeing him. She wasn\u2019t eating, she wasn\u2019t sleeping. She was sitting there at the front door, waiting for him to come back.DOUGLAS: You don\u2019t like the person I\u2019ve become. Everybody say this, though \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to be around you\u201d \u2014 people that knew Nook. O.K., so if it\u2019s hard for you to be around me \u2019cause you miss Nook, how do you think, how hard do you think it is for me to be around me? I am Nook. That\u2019s who I am. I think Nook, I eat Nook, I breathe Nook, I sleep Nook. Everything is Nook, Nook, Nook, Nook, Nook. But it always has been. It\u2019s not because he\u2019s dead. It\u2019s always been. And that\u2019s something I know.TAVERNISE: And what does it mean now that he\u2019s gone?DOUGLAS: No more Nook, no more Toby.[MUSIC]DOUGLAS: Yeah, I\u2019m a nuisance, I know.TAVERNISE: These days, Toby wears T-shirts with Nook\u2019s name on them. They have his picture, too. His name is tattooed on the side of her face, up near her left ear. She wears bracelets and necklaces with these little charms, and the charms have Nook\u2019s picture on them.DOUGLAS: Nook and little Tony? TAVERNISE: Wait, what\u2019s inside?DOUGLAS: A picture of Nook and little Tony.TAVERNISE: Aww.TAVERNISE: She\u2019s gone back several times to this little shop in Mondawmin Mall to get more made.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: She got so many of \u2019em, we don\u2019t know.DOUGLAS: But where\u2019s the picture?

I\u2019m too old for this.DOUGLAS: All right, bye-bye.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKERS: Bye.TAVERNISE: She hears it might help to join the moms\u2019 group \u2014\u2014[SOUND OF PROTEST]TAVERNISE: This group of women who\u2019ve lost their children to gun violence in Baltimore. They have these monthly meetings, and they also do activism. They get together and do marches, things like that.DOUGLAS: Yeah, I joined the moms\u2019 group. I joined it because they said it worked. It was good therapy. TAVERNISE: One time, she invited them to come to her son\u2019s cease-fire \u2014 essentially, a gathering of people at a place where a kid was shot.DOUGLAS: I invited them to the cease-fire and in the midst of the meeting, this lady, she said, \u201cWell, do I have to bring my gun?\u201d And all of \u2019em laughed. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why people even try.PROTESTER: Stabbed in West Baltimore. Eric Brown, 19, shot in East Baltimore.TAVERNISE: So with her grief comes this really intense loneliness. She\u2019s the mom of a criminal, a drug dealer. Her son\u2019s friends won\u2019t tell her anything, because telling her something would be snitching. The police won\u2019t tell her anything for reasons she can\u2019t understand. And the moms\u2019 group, it seems to just have this hierarchy of sympathy. It\u2019s like Nook\u2019s death was justifiable, so her grief isn\u2019t.PROTESTER: In Baltimore. And just last month, Oscar Torres, 15, shot in South Baltimore. And Joshua Carter, just 2 years old, ran up on the steps of a church and died along with his mother. We have to end the violence. We have to end it now.TAVERNISE: So instead of going to the moms\u2019 marches, she stays at home under a pile of laundry.DOUGLAS: Like, this is my daily thing. This was just cleaned yesterday. Like, I would call this \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: That\u2019s where I find her one day. Her legs and torso are kind of buried under this pile of clothes.DOUGLAS: I\u2019m gonna put that back. That\u2019s going to be straight, and then tomorrow, you\u2019ll be like, \u201cIt was so clean.\u201d I\u2019m gonna just do it again. It\u2019s not \u2014 no particular reason. Like these \u2014 everything is clean.DOUGLAS: I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t know why. That\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t. But it soothes me. And when I got company, I stop. Like, and then I want it. Like, I don\u2019t want to hurry up and put it away while y\u2019all here. And I know I should be doing it to clean it up off the floor, because it probably look bad to y\u2019all. But if I clean it up, then what I\u2019m gonna do later? So as long as it\u2019s here, I know I got something to do. But I got too much time and too little to do, so we gonna take our time.TAVERNISE: She has these little tiny steps of progress. She said she gained three pounds. But then she\u2019ll have this tiny setback \u2014 something that seems really small \u2014 but it\u2019ll really knock her for a loop, and she\u2019ll have a really bad day.DOUGLAS: And every time I put \u2019em up, they leave \u2014 they disappear. But they\u2019re not flying away, because then, I could\u2019ve said the wind did it. But there\u2019s no strings. There is no strings left. They\u2019re taking it all, all, all, don\u2019t leave no strings, don\u2019t leave no strings, they\u2019re taking it.TAVERNISE: We visited her on one of these bad days. Something had set her off. We didn\u2019t know what it was at first, but then we learned she\u2019d put up more balloons at Nook\u2019s intersection and someone had cut them down. She thinks maybe the police.PARKER: C\u2019mon now, these people, they liars. The Police Department is lying.TAVERNISE: Toby\u2019s mom, Davetta \u2014 she doesn\u2019t carry her grief in the same way. But she\u2019s mad. And she\u2019s mad at the police, too. And very specifically, at the officer that they think shot him. She\u2019s mad at that officer that they think shot Nook.PARKER: Yes, if I could say how I felt about him, y\u2019all be like, \u201cWe can\u2019t put that on there.\u201d This man\u2019s a murderer. He a punk. And another few other words.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: She says \u201cthis man\u201d about the officer, because she thinks she knows who it is. Toby does, too. And that\u2019s because the streets talk. And one day, they hear a name. And that name is Michael Baysmore.PARKER: I have hate for him. And I want him to die a horrible death.BAYSMORE: Oh, you just want to know about my certified vegan tattoo?LYNSEA GARRISON: Yeah.BAYSMORE: Oh, like, what made me get it?GARRISON: Yeah.TAVERNISE: So I found Michael Baysmore, and I sent him a message on Facebook. I didn\u2019t tell him why we wanted to talk. But he invited us anyway. That was kind of surprising to us. So we went to his apartment in the suburbs. And he opened the door, and we went inside, sat down. And then he\u2019s not at all what we expected.[MUSIC]BAYSMORE: I make this one dish with some Japanese sweet potatoes, red bell peppers \u2014 maybe, like, some yellow or orange ones. Some apples, you know, maybe, like, some Envy apples or Pi\u00f1atas or something that\u2019s, like, has a nice sweetness to it. And there\u2019s this Field Roast apple and sage vegan sausage. Mix it up in a pan, season it with some cinnamon, some little bit of salt, some raw agave. The secret is the cayenne pepper, so it\u2019d had that sweetness, but then it had some spice.TAVERNISE: So he\u2019s this kind of young, shy, soft-spoken guy. He\u2019s been a police officer at Coppin State University for several years. And he\u2019s a vegan \u2014 in fact, he was a finalist in this contest that PETA has every year for the sexiest vegan. BAYSMORE: It, it opened my eyes a lot more, and it helped me not only appreciate my life, but, like, all life in general.TAVERNISE: So when we first get there, we\u2019re feeling kind of nervous about telling him why we actually came. But then this weird things happens \u2014 he brings it up himself. He says he got this Instagram message from a girl. She accused him of killing someone. This was Nook\u2019s girlfriend, Desire.BAYSMORE: You know, the girlfriend, she pretty much said \u2014 let me see, I have it right here. \u201cYou killed my boyfriend the very next day of the picture. How does that make you feel? And I bet you didn\u2019t tell them you killed an 18-year-old.\u201d And she was like, \u201cYeah, I finally found you.\u201d To me it was like, you know, if she was bold enough to, you know, find me and message me, it\u2019s like, well, it\u2019s no telling if they know where I live, you know. They already know where I work at.TAVERNISE: He was really, really scared. Pretty freaked out. BAYSMORE: I mean, even, even to this day it still makes me, like, uneasy. Because, I mean, even right now it\u2019s still a shock, because I don\u2019t have any idea how my name came up, like, literally at all.TAVERNISE: They got it wrong.BAYSMORE: I told her, I was like, \u201cYou know, with all due respect, you know, you had the wrong person, it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d You know, I took off that day.TAVERNISE: And not only did he not do it \u2014 he gets how Toby is feeling.TAVERNISE: Does part of you understand her?BAYSMORE: Oh, I completely understand. I mean, because, you know, I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m an only child. You know, my parents actually adopted me, so I can kind of relate to her situation, because I think that\u2019s her only son?TAVERNISE: It\u2019s her only son.TAVERNISE: It\u2019s really good, right? BAYSMORE: And I saw it, yeah, and just \u2014 and I watch it from time to time, and, it, you know, it\u2019s not a lot of things that kind of touch or bother me, but just seeing that, you know, just being so close to it, I can, I can feel it. And I just wish that I just could just \u2014 you know, just honestly just apologize, not only just on behalf of, you know, our department and their ineptitude in handling the situation, but just \u2014 everybody in general. Like, I don\u2019t want to say it seems like, you know, like, the department\u2019s or the, or the court trying to hide something, but it\u2019d make you question it. Even before they mentioned my name, I still was curious, because it was just odd to me that they never even identified the officer, period. Like, it\u2019s still odd to me. And it, you know, it\u2019s like, are they going to do it?TAVERNISE: I think it\u2019s going to mean a lot that, that you\u2019ve been thinking about it, and \u2014\u2014[SOUND OF DOOR OPENING]UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Hi.GARRISON: Hi, we\u2019re here to see T.J. Smith.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: What \u2014 who are you with? Network?GARRISON: New York Times.TAVERNISE: At this point, we knew we needed to talk to the Baltimore police directly. And there was this one guy who Davetta and Toby kept talking about, a guy they blamed. They\u2019d been mad at him from day one. His name was T.J. Smith. He\u2019s the chief spokesman of the Baltimore Police Department, and he was the one who gave the press conference when Nook was killed.[REPORTER: Baltimore City Police were also here investigating at the scene. Chief T.J. Smith says that quick action may have saved students\u2019 lives.T.J. SMITH: The officer happened to be in the right place at the right time. This could have been a run and gun battle that could have ended up on the campus.]TAVERNISE: We asked him what happened with the investigation, and he told us this \u2014 that they didn\u2019t actually know very much about what was really going on there that night. He said they tried to talk to people, but no one would help. I mean, the car that Nook had been riding in just drove off, left him on the pavement. And he said they never got the license plates of either of the cars. We told that to Toby and Davetta later. They didn\u2019t believe it. They said there were cameras everywhere. It was weird they wouldn\u2019t have gotten a number. But the bottom line was this: Without witnesses \u2014 like, for example, the guys in the car Nook was riding in \u2014 it\u2019s kind of impossible for the police to solve these crimes.SMITH: We beg and plead to get the information. We don\u2019t have crystal balls, and I know that some people think that we should know of all this. But it doesn\u2019t work that way. You know, I had a cousin who was killed here in Baltimore several years back. And I remember being at his funeral, and there was anger in me. You want to come and shed tears, you want to hug my aunt, you want to wear T-shirts with his name on it and all. But you know who did it, and you don\u2019t want to reveal that information. That\u2019s something that we grapple with on a regular basis.SMITH: That\u2019s one of the first times in my career I\u2019ve ever heard of a loved one wanting the uncut version of the video. SMITH: It\u2019s not going to be the right image that families want to see, and I totally get that. I totally get that and, and I get the frustration behind it.TAVERNISE: But the police are in a tricky spot. Nook, the victim, was also a suspect of a crime. He was firing a gun.SMITH: It\u2019s always unfortunate if a family member feels that the customer service that they got was poor, and we can only learn from it and try to do better. Because at the end of the day, everyone we encounter are our constituents/customers. And regardless of what end of the spectrum they\u2019re on \u2014 whether they\u2019re a victim, victim family or a suspect \u2014 they have to be treated with dignity. And I know that we\u2019re doing better, we\u2019re getting better, we\u2019re recognizing that we must get better. And, you know, my condolences to her, because again, regardless of the decisions that he made, it\u2019s not fair to her if she feels victimized yet again. TAVERNISE: Is there, is there some part of the Police Department that deals with bereaved relatives, family members like this, like moms? I mean, I think part of it is just, it\u2019s just this sheer frustration \u2014\u2014SMITH: Not knowing which way to go.TAVERNISE: Exactly.SMITH: Right, it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a lot. You know, last year, my brother was killed here in Baltimore. You know, I saw it come up on my cellphone like I see every other murder victim and every other shooting victim in Baltimore \u2014 popped up on my cellphone. And I saw his name, and just like anyone else, denial. Immediate denial. Didn\u2019t believe it. Even with every indication \u2014 birth date, name, address \u2014 still denial. Even when I got the pictures, I was still in denial. It was tough. It was, it still is tough. The day of my brother\u2019s burial \u2014 we\u2019re at the burial gardens and the person from the burial grounds comes over to me and says, \u201cYou need to sign this paper right here.\u201d And I\u2019m just like, I mean, I really wanted to push him right in the hole. I mean, we haven\u2019t even lowered the casket, the flowers are still fresh, we\u2019re waiting for the doves to come back home, and you\u2019re asking me to sign something.TAVERNISE: As he\u2019s talking \u2014 he\u2019s sounding a lot like Toby. Like when the detective came to her house the next morning, started asking her all these questions, kind of cold. Filling out paperwork. Never saying he was sorry, even though the police had killed her son.SMITH: I don\u2019t really care what the answer to the why is, because the why doesn\u2019t bring him back. It\u2019s just some stupid reason. \u201cWhy?\u201d But knowing who did it does provide a little bit of solace.TAVERNISE: But you know, in Toby\u2019s case, that\u2019s also her situation, you know.SMITH: I get it, and, and I think, you know, with so much trauma, it\u2019s tough. All of that combined, certainly, can allow your mind to race.DOUGLAS: \u2019Cause, you know, a mom\u2019s mind can go different places. How many times was Lavar shot? How many bullets were removed? Did he get a look at year, make, model of the car Lavar was shooting at or got out of? Who was the first witness on the scene? What kind of gun was it? One shooter? Was it one gun? Was it his officer weapon, or was it his personal weapon? Who was he shooting at? That\u2019s the question. Did y\u2019all ask Mondawmin for their cameras? \u2019Cause did they really come from Mondawmin \u2014 \u2019cause what was tied around his wrist? Did they even think about that? Like, what was he protecting his hands from, gunpowder?[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: O.K., so that\u2019s another question. Was he alone in the car?DOUGLAS: Who was the first witness on the scene? Because it should have been that person in that Acura, \u2019cause they never should have went nowhere. Or was he tied up?TAVERNISE: O.K., so what\u2019s tied behind \u2014 around his wrist, that\u2019s another question.DOUGLAS: They had hair/shoe covers, that\u2019s what the autopsy say. You can highlight it. It\u2019s in the first paragraph.[PHONE RINGS]TAVERNISE: Hi. GARRISON: Holy crap.TAVERNISE: I know. I\u2019m \u2014 I, you know, I had a fear that this was going to happen. They were just going to say, \u201cCome in 20 minutes,\u201d so \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: A few weeks after our meeting with T. J., Toby gets a phone call. It\u2019s from the police, and they ask her to come in. They say they\u2019re going to show her the video without the black box and answer her questions.TAVERNISE: And he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t come into the meeting.\u201dGARRISON: O.K.TAVERNISE: You know what, let me call you back in, like, three minutes. I just have to put the GPS on so I can start moving. GARRISON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: So I jump in the car to try to get there in time.GARRISON: Are you scared of what you might see behind the black box, Toby?DOUGLAS: I don\u2019t know. Lynsea, I truly, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting, but I\u2019m ready for whatever. I\u2019m ready for whatever. The worst part has been done \u2014 they took my baby. The worst part. The worst part. It\u2019s overwhelming, but I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ve been ready.GARRISON: Sabrina\u2019s racing down to meet you. DOUGLAS: Thank you.GARRISON: You\u2019ll call her?DOUGLAS: I\u2019m gonna call her. I\u2019m gonna call, I\u2019ll call her when I get there.GARRISON: O.K. All right, you\u2019re gonna head out now?DOUGLAS: Yes.GARRISON: Good luck, Toby.DOUGLAS: All right. Bye.[GPS: In half a mile, use the right two lanes to take Exit 27 for I-95 North toward Baltimore. Use the right two lanes to take Exit 27 \u2014\u2014 ][CAR DOOR SLAMS]TAVERNISE: So I raced to Baltimore as fast as I could. I got to the police station, and I saw her just before she went up.TAVERNISE: Toby![MUSIC]TAVERNISE: I ran up to them. She\u2019s standing with a guy from the Police Department. They won\u2019t let me go up with her. So I sit in this blue chair in the lobby and I wait.TAVERNISE: It\u2019s 11:55. Still waiting.TAVERNISE: People are walking in and out. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: So will you be able to put a small segment in your paper regarding this poor lady? TAVERNISE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Well, this is the place, I tell you. This place got so much going on, it\u2019s unbelievable. I thought D.C. was bad.TAVERNISE: Cops in uniform. Some women trainees waiting for a test.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: She works for The New York Times.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Hey, New York! Hey! TAVERNISE: Even the commissioner walks by at some point. TAVERNISE: Yep.TAVERNISE: Was it close to Christmastime? TAVERNISE: It\u2019s 12:45, and I\u2019m still sitting in the lobby, waiting for Toby. She\u2019s been in there for about an hour and 20 minutes.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: So it\u2019s 1:06, and still waiting for Toby. [SOUND OF DOOR]TAVERNISE: All of a sudden she\u2019s out, and I\u2019m just fumbling with my recorder, kind of running after her. She\u2019s already halfway out the door before I realize it.DOUGLAS: You ready?DOUGLAS: I guess it\u2019s done. There\u2019s nothing else. They said it\u2019s over.TAVERNISE: What were they like? Were they respectful?DOUGLAS: In the beginning, until they say they just could not tell me anything, like it\u2019s nothing \u2014 unless y\u2019all answer this question. They called about four different people in there that worked on bullets and, and all that stuff. And they keep on trying to say, \u201cNo.\u201d Everybody keeps saying, \u201cNo, they didn\u2019t say, they said three bullets.\u201d Oh, no, then I\u2019m gonna correct them on that. \u201cOh, O.K., we see what you\u2019re saying. That\u2019s our mistake.\u201d No, it was four, no, it was not four. But they saying they putting a sixth bullet in the envelope. Where is the other bullets that they collected, that the autopsy collected? It don\u2019t say, it doesn\u2019t say. It\u2019s inconclusive. Everything inconclusive. Lavar\u2019s, Lavar\u2019s case is justifiably inconclusive. I cannot believe this city \u2014 the whole city. TAVERNISE: I just thought \u2014 she\u2019s been sitting with those people for an hour and a half, the police. She was finally having this meeting. The police finally, finally agreed to sit down, but it wasn\u2019t satisfying for her.DOUGLAS: \u201cThat\u2019s it, well, that\u2019s all we can help you with,\u201d you know, \u201cI hope you appreciate us even taking this time out, but the decisions are made.\u201dTAVERNISE: Did they say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss?\u201dDOUGLAS: Mhmm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you know, \u201cbut, you know, anger is the first stage to grief.\u201d I\u2019m angry at the city now. Like, I am angry. I\u2019m angry at the city. I\u2019ve never liked them, but it just make me feel even proven now that \u2014 I don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t care about, they don\u2019t care about us or our family. I don\u2019t care about them or their families. And that\u2019s any police at this point. I don\u2019t have nothing else to say, Sabrina. Shame on this city. Like, the end. It\u2019s really the end. TAVERNISE: And she just looked at me, and her face just, like \u2014 she just started crying so hard. I mean, there were tears coming down her face like it was just rain.DOUGLAS: I need to lay down.[MUSIC]TAVERNISE: T. J., if you lived in West Baltimore, would you trust the police?SMITH: So that\u2019s a, a bit of a loaded question, because it\u2019s only a hypothesis of \u201cWhat if?\u201d I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never lived there, and I don\u2019t know what those interactions are. But I know that if a certain group of police worked in that area, and then my suspicions are confirmed via G.T.T.F., it\u2019s a \u201cI told you so\u201d moment. And if these are things that have been \u201cI told you so,\u201d yeah, I can understand that. But I\u2019ve worked in some communities that have had challenges with law enforcement, but what I\u2019ve noticed through those challenges is, there are always going to be people who don\u2019t like you. I mean, it\u2019s like, you can get, you know, a cat and a dog to work together and live together, but by nature, they just don\u2019t like each other. Right? So there are always going to be people, you know, if you\u2019re interfering with a, a profit from a drug organization, they might not like you too much. But then, it\u2019s really not always about like \u2014 it\u2019s about respect. And, and it should be a mutual respect. [PHONE RINGING]DWIGHT PETTIT: Hello.TAVERNISE: Hi, Mr. Pettit, this is Sabrina calling.PETTIT: Hi.TAVERNISE: A lawyer named Dwight Pettit. In fact, Toby had asked him to take Nook\u2019s case.PETTIT: Yes. I talked to the mom, and I think she talked to one of the other lawyers in our office. I remember we declined the case after we looked at the video. I was advised by lawyers of my staff in my office that, uh, I remember they said they saw him firing. They didn\u2019t say whether he was firing at the officer, but that he\u2019s still discharging the gun when the officer opened fire.TAVERNISE: Hmm.PETTIT: But I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t recall from my recollection what I observed. It\u2019s been \u2014 several months ago. I\u2019ve gone through several videos since then of other cases.TAVERNISE: Would you mind asking the person in your office who did see it if they would be willing to talk to us? It would be very brief, and I\u2019m just trying to figure out what happened, you know, behind the box, basically.PETTIT: Sure. All right. Hold on a second.TAVERNISE: Oh, thanks.[HOLD MUSIC]PETTIT: Come in. Sabrina?TAVERNISE: Yes, sir.PETTIT: She\u2019s in my office. We were both on the, on the box. TAVERNISE: Oh, fantastic. What happens behind the box? I mean, the kid basically runs out, right, shoots at the passing car, and then it really just looks like he runs back to the car. But then you can\u2019t tell what happens. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Right. So with the box in the way, what you can\u2019t see is that as he\u2019s running, he\u2019s still shooting. What happens is that the undercover officer, he gets out of his car, and he takes, like, a, I guess what they would call, like, a safe position somewhere. And he fires a shot and hits him. But the young man \u2014 Mr. Douglas? \u2014 \u2014 TAVERNISE: Douglas, yeah. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Is still shooting. You know how you run and you use your arms to propel yourself, or they just kind of swing?TAVERNISE: Yep. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You can tell from the sparks on the ground, and seeing sparks in different places, that he\u2019s just still shooting as he\u2019s running. So it\u2019s kind of like he\u2019s not aiming, but it\u2019s just kind of wild.TAVERNISE: But it\u2019s like he\u2019s shooting behind him? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Yeah. It actually goes that way sometimes, too. It almost looks like you wouldn\u2019t be able to predict when he would stop shooting. It just kind of was going with his arm stride.TAVERNISE: Got it.PETTIT: Our gut was that we weren\u2019t going to be able to show excessive force or liability on the part of the officer, because the standard of proof here is being reasonable. Is the officer\u2019s action reasonable? And the standard in court is even higher than that \u2014 objectively reasonable. And so if you\u2019ve got a person who\u2019s firing a gun, even at somebody else, is it reasonable for the officer to, in fact, protect himself and/or the public by returning fire? Under that standard and the court standards, I believe that would be deemed to be reasonable. And then we concluded that it was too fuzzy, in light of our caseload to, in fact, be able to take it. You gotta remember, jurors are very, very, very pro-police. It\u2019s very difficult to win in federal court and state court. I\u2019ve lost murder cases, I mean, shooting cases against the police where the people didn\u2019t have a weapon at all, and they were shot in the back, and jurors still came back in favor of the police under the standard that they were in fear for their life or fear for injury of themselves and others. That\u2019s the first defense that the police put out there. And so when you have somebody that has a gun \u2014 in many cases, when they don\u2019t have a gun, and police say, \u201cI thought he was reaching for the gun,\u201d that\u2019s enough for jurors to find probable cause and rule in the benefit and favor of the police. So when you have a gun and somebody is firing a gun, then liability is a big reach.TAVERNISE: So, having a gun is basically just a case killer, in other words.PETTIT: We\u2019ve had cases where people have had plastic guns, toy guns, no guns, and those are still extremely difficult if the police in any way indicate that they believe that their life was in jeopardy. Those cases are just about always in favor of the police. So when a person does have a live gun, and he or she is firing that gun, you just about got a zero shot in terms of establishing liability.TAVERNISE: And that was the case in this case.PETTIT: That was our objective conclusion. Not that there was no liability, but we just felt that we would have difficulty establishing that, in light of the fact that we have a limited staff and we have about 35 open cases. And we probably have the heaviest caseload in the city. Not probably \u2014 we do, in terms of police brutality, police liability. They\u2019re the most difficult cases in the world to win.TAVERNISE: And what was your reaction on watching it?UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: The scene was a little wild. That was my reaction. It looked as if the officer kind of took things into his hands. And it appeared to me that the officer was making the situation safe for whomever was outside. Once he fell to the ground, the officer went over into his direction, and then it became unclear what he was doing. If I had to guess, I would say he was speaking with him.TAVERNISE: Hmm. So it seems like maybe he was even still alive.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Maybe he was, or maybe the officer was trying to ascertain whether he was alive. You can\u2019t tell for sure, because there\u2019s no audio, and that portion of the video was a little indeterminable.[MUSIC]GARRISON: Have you ever talked to him about this?BAYSMORE: Yeah, um, it bothered him a lot. Like, after it happened, he didn\u2019t really open up about it too much. You know, because his big thing from the way that he acted, his main concern was the students, of course.TAVERNISE: The day we went to his apartment, Michael Baysmore told us he knew who had shot Nook. He\u2019d actually talked to him about it.[MUSIC][SOUND OF DOOR]TAVERNISE: Davetta had been carrying so much anger toward Michael Baysmore. We wanted to give her the news.TAVERNISE: O.K., so we found out some things. The first thing we found out is that Michael Baysmore wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t him. And we had a long conversation with him, and so we want to play you a little bit of it.PARKER: O.K., I\u2019m ready. TAVERNISE: Does part of you understand her?BAYSMORE: Oh, I completely understand. I mean, I think that\u2019s her only son?TAVERNISE: It\u2019s her only son.BAYSMORE: So, yeah, I mean, that was her heart. And I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just how, how it goes, you know, with these kinds of cases and stuff. But if it is, it just still doesn\u2019t seem right. Like, I don\u2019t want to say it seem like, you know, like, the department\u2019s or the, or the court trying to hide something, but it\u2019d make you question it. I almost really don\u2019t know what to say. PARKER: You don\u2019t have to. You said it all right there. You just said it all right there. I been said it. He didn\u2019t know Nook, but he\u2019s still looking at Nook\u2019s videos. You know, he has been touched in Nook\u2019s videos, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s got a, a spiritual being with Nook.TAVERNISE: Davetta, what would you want to say to Michael Baysmore?PARKER: First off, I need to apologize, because I have been inflicting death on him and his family for what he did to my grandson. I need to apologize. He don\u2019t know that, but I\u2019m from the country, so we do a little voodoo, you know. I wanna apologize for that. I feel like he was sincere, and I owe him an apology. I mean, I have \u2014 I would be very nice to him and talk nice to him. And \u2014 y\u2019all gonna see him again? Are y\u2019all gonna talk to him again?TAVERNISE AND GARRISON: We don\u2019t know.PARKER: O.K. Well, if you happen to do talk, tell him his grandmother want to meet him. I\u2019m gonna be very nice. Y\u2019all can check me. [LAUGHS] No knives, no guns. I\u2019m not even going to cuss! I wanna hear some more. Is he finished? Is he finished? GARRISON: He\u2019s not finished.PARKER: O.K. Let\u2019s finish talking. Let\u2019s listen to him, \u2019cause I\u2018m surprised. I was expecting he would go, \u201cWell, he was in the streets, and he didn\u2019t \u2014 \u201d You know, stuff like that. But I feel kind of, feel kind of like I can feel his pain, and I don\u2019t know. We can hear some more. Let\u2019s see what he say.BAYSMORE: Oh, I, I think about it every time I, I drive past that intersection. Like, you know, even if I see, like, some balloons there or something like that, I think about it all the time. That\u2019s part of the reason why, when I\u2019m patrolling, I usually don\u2019t even drive up and down that area too much, because it\u2019s just \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: Yeah.BAYSMORE: But for some apparent reason, like, you know, our supervisor, you know, our lieutenant or whatever always has us go cut the balloons down. Like, and I, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, but, you know, I wasn\u2019t sure if, if, you know, Nook\u2019s mother, you know, anybody in the family ever noticed. You know, like, they might put the balloons up on, like, let\u2019s say, a Tuesday, and maybe by, like, the Saturday, sometimes, they would be gone. I was wondering if they ever noticed that.TAVERNISE: Toby mentioned that several times as something that made her feel so sad.BAYSMORE: Hmm.TAVERNISE: They definitely notice.TAVERNISE: So the police officer who shot Nook, in the eyes of the law, he was probably within his rights. He could reasonably argue that he was protecting the public. He was protecting himself. And from how Michael Baysmore talked about it, he was trying to do the right thing. And he\u2019s burdened by what happened. I tracked him down and got him on the phone. He hung up. But for Toby, it wasn\u2019t really about him. She told us once, way back in the beginning, back when we first met her in the library, that she didn\u2019t blame the cop. She blamed the Police Department and the city. Because yes, her son was doing something wrong. But she still had the right to an opinion. The right to get answers, and the right to ask the questions in the first place.DOUGLAS: Thanksgiving. Actually, the last picture we took. Thanksgiving. That was the last picture we took. Let me find our Thanksgiving picture \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: We still don\u2019t really know what happened out there that night, the night Nook got killed.TAVERNISE: Does he look happy to you? What does he look like to you?DOUGLAS: This might be my last Thanksgiving. He slept the whole time. I never really looked in his face in this picture. So Thanksgiving was November the 23rd. How many days is that before he died? Seven, 20 days, seven days till the first, and then 20 days before he died. He don\u2019t look happy.TAVERNISE: We know that earlier that day, he went to Marshalls to buy a coat for his mom. He\u2019d lost hers, and it was cold outside. It was December. We also know that he seemed really distant and kind of preoccupied, worried, in the weeks leading up to the shooting. And Toby said the night before he got killed, he stayed up, crying. She didn\u2019t know exactly why, but she thought it was some misunderstanding about some money that had gone missing. TAVERNISE: What does he look like?DOUGLAS: He\u2019s trying to smile. I wonder what was going on in his mind. He don\u2019t look happy. I never looked at it.TAVERNISE: Yeah, he looks \u2014\u2014 DOUGLAS: He don\u2019t look happy at all.TAVERNISE: He looks like he\u2019s thinking about something.DOUGLAS: Exactly. That\u2019s what I was just thinking.TAVERNISE: It looks like his mind is full of something.DOUGLAS: He act like it too.TAVERNISE: How was he acting?DOUGLAS: He still don\u2019t look happy. He gave out food. He went and bought hot food and then gave it out down Martin Luther King Boulevard.TAVERNISE: Who was he giving the food to?DOUGLAS: The homeless people.TAVERNISE: Did you guys do that together?DOUGLAS: Mm-mm. He called me and said he was at Food Depot, and he was asking me what was the name of the chickens, you know, the whole chickens \u2014 Cornish hens. And he said he was buying them and some sides, probably, like, three or four.TAVERNISE: It\u2019s a really nice thing to do.DOUGLAS: It was, it was. It really was. They made him look so bad.TAVERNISE: Why?DOUGLAS: What \u2014 what made Nook look bad?TAVERNISE: Yeah.DOUGLAS: I\u2019m sure they investigated me and looked into my life and stuff, and, you know, I\u2019m a poor person, you know? I\u2019m on Section 8. And I think they knew if I didn\u2019t have too many people that had my back, they could just push me away. And they did. They stuck together, and they pushed me away. Nobody wouldn\u2019t listen to me. I mean, I don\u2019t really care now if nothing come out of it. Y\u2019all listened to me. And that\u2019s all I was asking. My son wasn\u2019t ready to go.[MUSIC] DOUGLAS: It\u2019s, like, unbelievable that it really \u2014 he\u2019s really gone. Like, I have to tell myself every day. This is the day he was born at the hospital.TAVERNISE: Toby\u2019s grief and anger \u2014 she\u2019s channeled it for all these months at the Baltimore police. But just a couple of weeks ago, Davetta said something to me. And in my mind, something clicked into place.PARKER: If somebody is being held responsible, I think she could get her life back. But right now, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to get that back, because she\u2019s angry. She blames everybody, even herself. And it\u2019s like, what could she have did different? But she\u2019s not saying that, because she feel as though she say that, then people say that they blame her for his death. And it\u2019s been said, it\u2019s been told to me, and I\u2019m like, you know \u2014\u2014TAVERNISE: What\u2019s been told to you?PARKER: That they blame her for his death. Because she introduced him to the street life, you know, and the people she was hanging around with that he knew, all was in the street. So, that has an effect on her too.TAVERNISE: And that sort of feels like the whole thing. Who\u2019s to blame? The police or the streets? Nook or Toby? You\u2019d have to start back decades. But somewhere along the way, crime in Baltimore and the Baltimore police, they became inextricably linked. So when you start to really look at it, it can feel like everyone and no one is to blame.TAVERNISE: What do you think is worse, the streets taking young people\u2019s lives like that, or the police policing them?PARKER: Both. Both. Both. I just think both is dangerous. The police are worse than the streets, and the streets are worse than the police. So you\u2019re not safe from neither one of them. So I think both of them is dangerous. And they both on the same level. The No. 10. You know? TAVERNISE: What do you mean, the No. 10?PARKER: I mean, No. 10 is, you know, how you go from one is a low score, two, three. No. 10 is a high level, where it\u2019s dangerous. No. 10 is a dangerous level. TAVERNISE: And if anything seems pretty clear, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t solve one part of it without also solving the other. Some people in Baltimore said the only way to solve this, to win back the trust of people like Toby and Davetta, is to rip up the department and start fresh. To disband it. But Tyrone Powers doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.TYRONE POWERS: As I indicated to you one time before, we\u2019ve got to constantly understand that despite the facts that you can become a police officer at 21, there\u2019s no other position in the United States of America where you are allowed to legally remove another human being from existence based solely on your discretion and training. The military can\u2019t even do that. So we\u2019ve got to understand the important role of policing. So we\u2019ve got to make them do it right. Because it\u2019s such an enormous power, to have that much discretion. So we have to get it right. The leadership has to get it right. So the example is set, so you don\u2019t have another Baltimore. Because if we don\u2019t, I can promise you this \u2014 that we\u2019re going to have another situation like the Freddie Gray situation. We\u2019re going to have another uprising. We\u2019re gonna have more people hurt unless we get this right. So, you know, it\u2019s not a choice. It\u2019s not something that we say, we should get better. We absolutely have to get it better, or Baltimore is going to burn, and so is other cities. Either we\u2019re heading for a new day in town, or we\u2019re heading for something more destructive than what we saw with Freddie Gray.DOUGLAS: All right, where you at? I\u2019m gonna bring some down there with you, \u2019cause it\u2019s so many balloons over here.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Yeah, bring some \u2014\u2014 TAVERNISE: There was a murder a day in Baltimore last year. You can see it in the balloons. They\u2019re tied all over the city, on stop signs and streetlights. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That\u2019s why they be taking, a cop and their brooms, they be taking them off the walls. You know we had a whole collage? DOUGLAS: She said they keep taking them down from here. They just put all this stuff up here for streets since they took them down. So put \u2019em down there where they can see them at.TAVERNISE: And that means the police have a lot of chances to get this right.DOUGLAS: That\u2019s why I don\u2019t even put them by Coppin, \u2019cause they keep taking his stuff.TAVERNISE: You want me to take those?TAVERNISE: Nook would have turned 20 last month. I went with Toby to tie balloons on his birthday.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Happy birthday, sunshine.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Yeah, we miss you, Nook.TAVERNISE: It was a really warm day. It was bright and sunny. She\u2019d gotten her hair done for the occasion. She had this blue nail polish on.UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: All right, where the \u2014 oh. Get me some tape. Get the tape, my man. Bring that K over a little bit there. Give me a piece of tape.TAVERNISE: After we tied the balloons and remembered Nook, everybody was talking and kind of laughing, remembering him. I got in my car and drove away. I ended up having to stop at this one intersection where there was a train going by. It took forever, so I took out my phone, and I texted Michael Baysmore. [SOUND OF TRAIN HORN] TAVERNISE: Hi, Michael. Just letting you know that Toby and her friends put up balloons at Coppin, at Coppin tonight. Just wondering if they\u2019ll ask you to cut them down. Balloons for his birthday. Sabrina. TAVERNISE: And a few days later, Michael texted me back. He said the police had popped them all.[MUSIC]PARKER: Now, after doing this, this paper and everything, what kind of closing do you think it should be? What do you think, as a closing? You have no idea?TAVERNISE: God, Davetta, I was thinking about it so much, to be honest with you. I was thinking, what is the end to our story with Toby and Davetta? What is the end? PARKER: How can we put an end to this?TAVERNISE: I so wanted the end to be \u2014\u2014PARKER: Refreshing. TAVERNISE: Toby could get closure and try to move on.PARKER: Closure. Right. But that\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s not going to happen, really. Because she\u2019s just too far gone right now. So, but for \u2014 as our closure, we probably won\u2019t get it no time soon. Mhmm. Not this year, anyway, I don\u2019t think. But we gonna get it. It just don\u2019t know when. But we definitely gonna get closure to the situation.DOUGLAS: Every now and then, I could be talking about something, and for a brief second, I get a relief. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about, but I\u2019m getting ready to speak on it. Because I feel bad to tell anybody, but I do sometimes get, like, a relief feeling. And it just started. So I don\u2019t know if my son is saying, \u201cMa, let go, it\u2019s O.K. You trying, but you not. \u2019Cause I get it, it\u2019s O.K., and don\u2019t feel bad about it.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to find an excuse to let go. But then sometimes I know I be telling myself, like, if I could just lose my mind \u2014 you know how people, like, have an accident and don\u2019t remember nothing? How could you be sad about something you ain\u2019t never know about? But you know what I thought about? I think that would be worse. \u2019Cause I know it\u2019s something missing. Because that pain gonna be there. I know it\u2019s, I know it\u2019s gonna be there. Even if I don\u2019t remember I have a child, I\u2019m going to remember I had something that was not there, and it\u2019s, like, an arm or something. It\u2019s going. It got to. \u2019Cause even when I wake up out of my sleep and my day hasn\u2019t started yet, to even remember that Nook gone \u2014 one little piece of air come out of me, and a teardrop, and then my day \u2014 for like, the next hour, done. One little tinkling thing. Mmm. I\u2019m freezing, are you?TAVERNISE: Should we go upstairs?DOUGLAS: Whew, yes! I\u2019m just like, where did this \u2014 Nook, did you come in here?TAVERNISE: It\u2019s cold, it\u2019s cold.DOUGLAS: It\u2019s in my bones, like \u2014\u2014PARKER: All is done. All is done. So, I\u2019m, like, excited because I really want to write this book. I think it\u2019d be a good book, and I think it\u2019d be interesting to people. At first, I wanted to do it as a fiction book, but I changed. I think I want to make it a nonfiction book, because it\u2019s a true story, and true stories are nonfiction. Fiction is not, is not a true story. TAVERNISE: What does, what does it begin with? Does it begin with Ida?PARKER: Oh, no, it don\u2019t begin \u2014 my mother is in it, but it begins, like, me first starting to work. Well, first starting to have my kids, and when I first started working at the library. It tells about me working at the library, catching the bus, struggling for some years, and getting back on my feet. It has a lot, it has everything in there, yeah. And then, you know, I\u2019m going to have Nook in there, and they\u2019re going to be reading about him. They\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh, wow,\u201d you know, \u201che was supposed to \u2014 he died at such a young age, and they didn\u2019t take responsibility for him. Nobody took responsibility for his murder.\u201d But yeah, they can find other people, you know, and \u2014\u2014Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Listen to the Sounds of Narwhals That Have Been Elusive to Science", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs melting ice opens east Greenland to petroleum prospectors and cruises, scientists are rushing to study the noises made by a remote population of toothed whales.But then there\u2019s the narwhal of east Greenland. It\u2019s kind of the narwhal of narwhals. Narwhals live only in the Arctic, where it\u2019s dark much of the time, diving thousands of feet to hunt, where it\u2019s dark all of the time. Scientists knew they used acoustics to echolocate and communicate from studies done on narwhals in west Greenland or Canada, but they didn\u2019t know much about the sounds of individual narwhals, especially the east Greenland population.Say hi to Thora: Frida: Freya:Eistla:And Balder:Analyzing the recorded sounds, they found that narwhals made their buzzing noises more often in the deep sea, in one fjord in particular, likely zeroing in on prey in this potentially important feeding ground. But they made their call sounds more frequently near the surface where they spend most of their time, probably to communicate with other narwhals. They also discovered that narwhals went silent for about a day before acting normal, suggesting that tags that only last a few hours may only record sounds of frazzled narwhals. In the follow-up study, the researchers will gradually expose the narwhals to blasts from an air gun less powerful than industrial ones, figuring if they react to that, they\u2019ll react to the big stuff too.But whether they\u2019ll respond is unclear. Narwhals are used to the enormous crashes of calving icebergs. In this sense, the man-made sounds that they experience could be among the quietest in their marine environment \u2014 for now, at least. \u201cMaybe air gun pulses sort of sound like icebergs for a narwhal \u2014 I have no idea \u2014 but if we don\u2019t have the data, we can\u2019t make sound decisions to make sure that we have narwhals in the future,\u201d Dr. Blackwell said.

{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Threats: More Bark Than Bite", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Latynina is a Russian journalist who has been a visiting expert at the Kennan Institute.Is President Vladimir Putin of Russia really willing to go to war with the West? If we are to believe Russian state propaganda, the answer is a resounding yes. Mr. Putin is very aggressive in his foreign policy, and whenever he is opposed, he immediately takes umbrage.There\u2019s no way for the Kremlin to lose this game: When the free world yields to the Kremlin, the gain to Russia is used as a steppingstone to a new attack; when the West stands fast against a Russian provocation, it feeds the Kremlin\u2019s domestic propaganda \u2014 as evidence of the West\u2019s \u201cdouble standards\u201d and innate hostility to Russia.By now, Russian dreams of challenging the rest of the world militarily have become the main theme of state propaganda. In May, when Russia celebrated the anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, \u201cWe can do it again\u201d was the most popular slogan \u2014 in other words, \u201cWe can once again storm Berlin.\u201dBut think about it. Can Russia really storm Berlin again? Is it even willing to try? Does Mr. Putin really believe he can win a short and glorious war? Or is he just bluffing? Let\u2019s look more closely.On Feb. 8 at Deir al-Zour, Syria, a number of Russians who are believed to have been mercenaries \u2014 perhaps dozens, perhaps 200 \u2014 were reported killed during American airstrikes. The Kremlin often sees offense where none is intended. So it was reasonable to expect it to hit the roof. Instead, it remained silent, except for denying there had been any Russian soldiers at Deir al-Zour.Which left Mr. Trump in a position to claim he had stared Mr. Putin down, using his skills at dealing with international bullies \u2014 not surprising, since he is quite a bully himself.There was more to come.To this humiliating defeat, there was no Kremlin reaction at all.Unfortunately for the Kremlin, the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 presence in Syria is all that keeps the regime of President Bashar al-Assad alive. If he falls, it will mean the end of the Kremlin\u2019s game there and a personal humiliation for President Putin.So why didn\u2019t the Kremlin protest?Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had been the only Western leader to visit Moscow on May 9, Russia\u2019s Victory Day. The Kremlin\u2019s propaganda machine has made this an extraordinarily hyped-up event, a day when every television screams \u201cWe can do it again\u201d while families across Russia parade with photographs of ancestors who fought in World War II \u2014 the so-called Immortal Regiment.Not only did Mr. Netanyahu visit Moscow, he also marched alongside Mr. Putin on Red Square, brandishing a portrait of a Russian Jew who fought heroically in the war.This was just a day before the military debacle in Syria, when Syria\u2019s Russian-manufactured air defense systems failed to thwart Israel\u2019s attack. These days, Israel is the rare Western-oriented country still on friendly terms with Russia. So we can surmise that Mr. Netanyahu used his May 9 promenade to inform Mr. Putin of the impending showdown with the Iranians. That would have given Mr. Putin a choice: Stay friendly with Israel or raise hell. In any case, he chose the first.The next day, the Buk air defense missile system, which dates to the 1960s, didn\u2019t do so well against Israeli F-16s. \u201cWe can do it again\u201d? No, not quite. Supplying an ally with equipment so outdated signals that we can\u2019t.These three events illustrate that despite his bluster, Mr. Putin is keen to avoid any direct military confrontation with the West. He doesn\u2019t want a war likely to be neither short nor easy to win. What he wants is a television war \u2014 a computer simulation \u2014 with all the public relations advantages of being at war and none of its downsides.This is a fatal flaw in any strategy designed to bring Russia into a clash with the West. You can\u2019t really go to war without being ready to go to war.When Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland he meant business. He didn\u2019t want war just then, but he might well have fought, had he been challenged. With him, it was not just bluff. With Mr. Putin it is. Maybe he could survive another Deir al-Zour, and then another, but he cannot survive 100 Deir al-Zours. His image as a strongman would be shot to pieces.So it\u2019s not really the West that should fear a conventional military engagement with the Kremlin. It\u2019s the other way around.Yulia Latynina is a Russian journalist with Echo of Moscow and Novaya Gazeta, and is a recipient of the Defender of Freedom Award from the United States State Department.Advertisement"}

Mr. Calstier\u2019s menu is rooted in French-Mediterranean fare. The name of the restaurant translates to taste buds.Add this new branch of a popular Nassau County spot to the city\u2019s collection of grand Greek restaurants. Like most of the others, this one has soaring whitewashed rooms, stone and pottery details, potted olive trees and a gleaming display of fish on ice. The menu includes plates of parchment-thin fried zucchini and eggplant stacked around a tzatziki dip, spanakopita, stuffed or fried calamari, grilled fish, and salads strewn with feta. But there are also some inventive touches like pastitsio spring rolls. The restaurant, on two floors, is run by Reno Christou, who will open another restaurant, on West 85th Street, this year.This new Chinatown spot for instant ice cream borrows from the molecular gastronomy canon and uses liquid nitrogen as the freezing agent.

{"Headline": "Discussion Questions for \u2018Less\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Read ThisBelow are questions to help guide your discussions as you read the book over the next month. They go in chronological order of the book\u2019s chapters, so you can match the questions to your pace as you read. Spoiler alert for some of the latter questions below.You can also submit your own questions for Andrew Sean Greer on our Facebook page, which he will answer on the NewsHour broadcast at the end of the month.1. The novel\u2019s opening line reads: \u201cFrom where I sit, the story of Arthur Less is not so bad.\u201d Arthur Less, the book\u2019s protagonist, is introduced as nearly 50, with \u201cwashed-out\u201d blonde hair and \u201cwatery\u201d blue eyes. As we soon learn, he\u2019s also a writer less successful than his peers. How do you see Arthur Less in the opening chapters? Do you see him as a hero, as a man deserving of pity, as something else?2. When we meet the character of Freddy, Arthur Less\u2019s soon-to-be-former-lover, he is described as \u201cdreamy, simple, lusty, bookish, harmless, youthful.\u201d It is Freddy\u2019s marriage invitation that Less so studiously avoids \u2014 choosing to go on a round-the-world trip simply to avoid having to decline the invitation without a good reason. What do you make of this decision? Have you ever found yourself doing something similarly absurd?3. Arthur Less\u2019s trip itinerary is as a follows: New York to interview a more popular writer, Mexico City for an obscure conference, Turin for an unknown award, Berlin for a teaching gig, Morocco for someone else\u2019s birthday, India for a writer\u2019s retreat (possibly during the monsoon), Japan for an article. And somewhere along the way he will turn 50. Does his sojourn remind you of any others in literature?4. The book Arthur Less is writing is about a man on a journey through a place and his past, as he looks back on a series of disappointments. Freddy complains that Less is always writing \u201cgay Ulysses.\u201d Do you see echoes of or references to Ulysses or the Odyssey throughout \u201cLess\u201d?5. Less\u2019s other major relationship in the book is with the famous poet Robert Brownburn. In the chapter \u201cMexican,\u201d Less recalls a day of losing his ring in the grocery store, and how, in telling Robert about it, Robert saw Less\u2019s infidelities written across his face. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was like to live with genius,\u201d he writes. How does Roberts success and genius impact their relationship at the time, and how does it influence him in the end?6. So much of Less\u2019s focus during the round-the-world trip is on his own mishaps and foibles \u2014 or his perceived mishaps and foibles. Getting into a car with what he believes is the wrong driver because the name was a letter off. Believing he can speak German well when in fact he is bungling the words. Bringing athletic bands to every country that he will only half use. Do you see these as actual mishaps and foibles or is it a problem of perception for Less? Do you identify with that feeling at all?7. The book alternates between Less\u2019s trip in the present to memories of his youth \u2014 mostly memories involving nostalgia or regret. And yet the narrator tells us that Less also understands the pleasures of age: \u201ccomfort and ease, beauty and taste, old friends and old stories\u2026.\u201d How does Less\u2019s grappling with age play a role in the book? Is it something you can relate to?8. In a scene at a party in Paris, Less is told that in fact he is not a bad writer, as he had come to believe, but a bad \u201cgay writer,\u201d in that he is not telling the narratives the gay writing community wants him to. What do you make of this critique?9. In several countries, simply being around Less seems to make other characters sick. Why?10. Arthur Less is self-deprecating throughout the book to a fault; in one of many descriptions he calls himself insignificant compared to other writers he knows, \u201cas superfluous as the extra a in quaalude.\u201d (Earlier, though, he asks if there is \u201cany more perfect spelling\u201d than the word quaalude \u201cwith that lazy superfluous vowel.\u201d) Did you find these negative descriptors by Less funny or frustrating or silly or all of these? How does Greer complicate these descriptions by having some of them echo back?11. A number of people try to tell Less about what happened at Freddy\u2019s wedding. And while the wedding dominates his thoughts, he doesn\u2019t listen to them. What is keeping him from hearing the story? What do you think (or hope) happened?12. In the book, \u201cLess\u201d is always referred to by his last name, while Javier only by his first, and Robert Brownburn by both. Why do you think Greer chose to refer to the characters in these different ways?13. What lines in the book made you laugh out loud?14. Toward the end of the book, Less reunites with his supposed enemy and Freddy\u2019s father, Carlos. When they meet, Carlos tells him that he believes that people\u2019s lives are half-comedy and half-tragedy and that those just appear at different times. What do you make of this theory?15. Were you surprised (or glad) to find out who the narrator was? Do any elements of the book change for you when you revisit them with Freddy as the narrator in mind?16. The penultimate lines of \u201cLess\u201d (from Freddy\u2019s voice) read: \u201cAfter choosing the path people wanted, the man who would do, the easy way out of things \u2026 after holding it all in my hands and refusing it, what do I want from life?\u201d What do you want from life? Have you similarly strayed from the path you thought you should be on?17. After learning he won the Pulitzer Prize, Andrew Sean Greer wrote on Twitter that \u201cLess\u201d is a book that\u2019s most of all \u201cabout joy.\u201d \u201cA writer friend once said the hardest thing to write about is joy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI took it as a challenge.\u201d Do you think he met the challenge?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stay or Go? Two Puerto Ricans on the Choices They Made", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Atlantic hurricane season is underway. Many people in Puerto Rico and the rest of the Caribbean are still suffering, nine months after Hurricane Maria devastated their homes. We asked two colleagues from Puerto Rico to reflect on the decision to leave or stay.We\u2019d like to hear from readers who have had to make that choice: How were you affected by the storms? What choices did you make? What factors did you consider?By Charo Henr\u00edquezI confess I\u2019m terrible at goodbyes.I have always been that person at social gatherings that is either one of the last to leave or the one that disappears, just to avoid saying goodbye. But three years ago I decided to leave, not a party, but my home.Moving to New York from Puerto Rico was never part of my plan, at least not in the way some people visualize themselves leaving as the endgame to some master life plan. In my case, family and career prospects aligned at a time when the island\u2019s economic situation had begun to get progressively worse and it became clear that it wasn\u2019t going to get better anytime soon. So I joined the \u201cbrain drain\u201d \u2014 the diaspora of Puerto Ricans with the means and professional prospects to start somewhere else.I adjusted to new routines. I learned to find comfort in places and people that reminded me of home, and I kept connected to my family and friends through lengthy video and group chats.I went back for a high school reunion in August. There were many conversations about people having left or those planning to leave, but my visit left me with a happy sense of nostalgia.Then Hurricane Maria hit in September.Hurricanes are a part of life on the island. From the first day of June until the last day of November, there is a general awareness that you need to be prepared for a storm. Still, there was nothing that could have prepared us, inside and outside of Puerto Rico, for what happened.Watching this monster pummel the island from afar, while not being able to communicate, was devastating. For those of us who left, our contact was lost, our lifelines were gone.With too much information and enormous guilt, the only way not to feel helpless was to find things to do for the island. But was that enough? How could it be enough? We left. We weren\u2019t there when it happened. Could we do more from here than there?To say that Puerto Rico is a complicated place is an understatement. Our political, economic, cultural and social situations, historic and current, have made us hard to be understood and even harder to explain. We feel too close to our Latin American roots to be completely a part of the United States, but we are American citizens nonetheless.That predicament, along with a new set of concerns over how this crisis was managed, left us in the diaspora feeling a very lonely type of trauma. We couldn\u2019t seek comfort in friends and family who were actually there. We couldn\u2019t talk about the anxiety, the hurt and the overwhelming sense of failure we felt for not having been there, not done enough.The first time I went back home after Maria was in January. Enough time had gone by that nature had replenished itself, but not enough for things to feel back to normal. It was beautiful to see the people I love, but talking to them I could hear their struggles and the hardships they went through during those first days, weeks and months after Maria. As I listened to the stories of friends and family, I felt the lump in my throat and the guilt wash over me again. Why wasn\u2019t I there? Is this their new normal? How is this normal?The arrival of hurricane season brings wonder and worry about what\u2019s to come.I left because sometimes you have to. I left because I like to think doing things and going places where you represent your homeland is a way to metaphorically grow that piece of land beyond its natural borders.I left because maybe my voice can reach farther here and my words will always carry home. I left because maybe I can help make things better from here, much more than I could there.Or at least I hope I can.Charo Henr\u00edquez was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She is a senior editor for digital storytelling and training at The Times.By Ana Teresa ToroNobody here remembers when being exiled was a curse. When living in exile meant to have been expelled or, worse, to become an expatriate.It has been decades since exile has become the ideal, the goal, the aspiration, the dream. Moving \u201cOut There\u201d \u2014 that is what we call our exile \u2014 means the hope of a better life in the United States. Nobody remembers what it was like a century ago, when staying was also a curse.Since 1917, by virtue of the Jones Act, we can move freely to and from the United States with our blue passport. The price we have paid for this has been high, but nobody really understands the currency we have been using to pay it.The Puerto Rican educator Nilita Vient\u00f3s Gast\u00f3n articulated it best when she said: \u201cPuerto Ricans are not taught to be Puerto Ricans.\u201d With two flags, two anthems and two languages, it is difficult to be certain about anything. You can\u2019t be cat and dog at the same time. This is a terrible and, sadly, precise metaphor. The cost of this uncertainty has been high because we don\u2019t understand who we are fighting and where our loyalties lie. There are exceptions, but those are few.Moving \u201cOut There\u201d is a natural possibility. When you become a foreigner in your own country \u2014 not an independent state, but a nation in the most natural sense of the word \u2014 then it\u2019s normal to go to that \u201cOther Country\u201d which you have been told is also yours, even if you don\u2019t entirely understand the language in which they explained it to you.This ideal exile started off with a great misunderstanding. In English, the political status of Puerto Rico was deemed a Commonwealth, but the literal translation should be \u201cAssociated Free State,\u201d an oxymoron in so many ways. Why translate this as \u201cCommonwealth\u201d?Different meanings and interpretations were born from this mere act of naming, so Puerto Ricans have lived in political ambiguity. That is the diffuse and confusing peculiarity of our exile. After Hurricane Maria, this exile feels more like an expulsion than ever, as the question looms in all families: Are we staying or leaving?My father, who is a Puerto Rican patriot and rejects everything American on principle, told me weeks after the hurricane: Go, there\u2019s nothing here for you.I felt the defeat of his whole life\u2019s creed in that sentence. I asked myself: Would I be a traitor for abandoning my country in its most vulnerable moment? Whom will the country belong to if we all leave? Are Puerto Ricans condemned to become docile servants of their new owners? How is it that the best option appears to be escaping from paradise? Am I more helpful inside or outside? I want to stay, but why do they make it so difficult for me to start over? How can I contribute to my country in my field if my industry is dying? Am I contradicting myself if I express that I love my country, but I want my children to grow up in a place where they have, at least, clean drinking water and electricity?I stayed. I remembered the words that a colleague told me once: If I\u2019m going to eat soil, that will be MY soil. I know that the world will move on and that I am probably going to be left behind, as it happens in all the islands. But I decided that staying means you don\u2019t just keep your body here, you fully occupy the space.I stay because the Puerto Rican culture cultivated from the island cannot be extinguished, although our diaspora is glorious and immense, and sustained us during these most violent winds.I stay to hold on to the certainty that even without a state, this land exists and is mine.I stay because it\u2019s time to remember that time when we all wanted to stay.Ana Teresa Toro was born and raised in Aibonito, Puerto Rico.

They also revealed the fruits of simple curiosity, the way journalists try to make sense of their world and share the results.These stories were among my favorites.Language, not surprisingly, was clearly of interest to correspondents then, as it is now.\u201cAustralian slang is virtually a language apart and American soldiers who ran into it in its most concentrated form were quite baffled for a time,\u201d it read. \u201cNow they are getting the hang of it and even the Yanks are saying everything is \u2018dinkum.\u2019\u201dSome of the slang identified then is still around today \u2014 like \u201ccobber,\u201d which means \u201cbuddy\u201d \u2014 but does anyone still stay \u201ccurling the moe,\u201d which apparently meant \u201ceverything going along at its best\u201d?I\u2019m pretty sure \u201ctriddlybit\u201d (threepence piece) is out of fashion, too.All of these stories erred on the side of light, making them a good entry point, but the thing about historical research is that you never know what you\u2019ll find. And in addition to these, I also discovered the story of Byron Darnton.He was among the first New York Times correspondents sent to Australia in 1942, and he was killed while reporting near what is now Papua New Guinea.I had recently connected with John when a tour group came through Australia, so I sent him an email Thursday morning.I\u2019m not sure what I was looking for, but I think I wanted to know more about what his father had written (many stories lacked bylines back then) so I could better imagine him here in Australia and traveling through the region.John wrote back right away.\u201cThanks for your intriguing email,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, my father was killed as a war correspondent in the Pacific theater in Oct., 1942.\u201dTurns out his father spent several months in Australia \u201cmostly fighting the censors who protected Gen. Douglas MacArthur and censored anything that indicated, truthfully, that he was far from the front.\u201dWhile the United States military was eager to have stories about \u201cAllied troops,\u201d John said, Byron Darnton, who went by Barney, always wrote and fought for the use of \u201cAustralian troops.\u201dHe also wrote a lot of stories about Aussie soldiers \u2014 including that story above about the slang they used.His death came as a shock to the entire foreign press corps.John later did his own reporting, uncovering previously unknown details.\u201cIt turns out he was killed off the coast of Papua New Guinea, just south of Buna, where the first battle occurred, the first time U.S. troops took on the Japanese on land. My father, Barney Darnton, was the only reporter on an advance craft, a converted fishing boat called the King John, moving up the coast toward Buna in the run-up to the battle.\u201d\u201cEarly in the morning, he took notes. He wrote, at one point, \u2018plane overhead. Jap or ours?\u2019 The plane returned and bombed the ship. There was no direct hit, but exploding shrapnel struck my father in the neck and also killed another man. It turned out Barney\u2019s note was apt. The plane that bombed him was an American B-25.\u201dI wondered if John had gone back to the area \u2014 and he had. He went to a village near where the accident occurred, interviewing two tribal elders.\u201cOne of them recalled the bombing as a 6-year-old on his way to school. We talked for a while, through a translator. Then he tugged my sleeve and the two of us walked down to the beach. He pointed at a spot in the sand. I didn\u2019t need the translator to figure out what he was saying: That\u2019s where my father\u2019s body was laid.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe exactly what I was feeling. When we pulled away and we reached the spot where I imagined the King John at anchor, I felt a rush of contradictory feelings, anger certainly, but also, for the first time really, a sense of the loss for our family and especially our mother, who dreamed of sitting under a tree with him and sipping Tom Collins once the war was only a memory.\u201dJohn ended his email simply \u2014 \u201cHope this helps, Damien.\u201dIt did.Sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget that journalism is a profession of connection, of people in conversation across boundaries of power, time and distant \u201csomewheres.\u201d Sometimes a look to the past can shed light on how close history can be, reminding us all that small moments and words still matter.______In 2015, McKinsey & Company (the \u201cgodfather of management consulting\u201d) took on a risky contract with a flailing, state-owned South African power company \u2014 lured by the potential reward of $700 million.______I loved \u201cThe Corrections,\u201d and have followed Jonathan Franzen\u2019s angst for years. Now he\u2019s moved to California and seems content, but can you really remove yourself from public feedback without withdrawing from life?She also vows not to go birding with Jonathan Franzen. Then she of course goes birding with Jonathan Franzen.______As Sri Lanka\u2019s president sank the country deeper and deeper into debt over his ambitious port project, Chinese allies continued to hand out loans and assistance, even when other lenders refused.This case is one of many in which China has used loans to gain influence \u2014 and played hardball to collect.____________Via Tacey Rychter, our audience editor, who also helped select the stories above:A postscript: I\u2019ll be off for the next two weeks.

Because phone and cable companies couldn\u2019t easily dictate what happened online, the internet was exploding in dozens of genuinely new ideas. Among those back then were blogs, Skype, file-sharing, YouTube, Friendster, Netflix \u2014 ideas that scrambled our sense of what was possible in media and communication, and, in the process, posed existential threats to the established giants.Other than the phone and cable companies themselves, I couldn\u2019t see why anyone might oppose the simple premise of protecting the environment that had made all these things possible. Did they hate clean water, too?Net neutrality was too good for us. And even if rules are restored, the notion that the internet should afford at least a minimally competitive landscape for new entrants now seems as antiquated as Friendster.Today, the internet is run by giants. A handful of American tech behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 control the most important digital infrastructure, while a handful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon \u2014 control most of the internet connections in the United States.So, what now?It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201cHistory shows us that companies that have the technical capacity to do things, the business incentive to do them and the legal right \u2014 they will take advantage of what is made available to them,\u201d said Jessica Rosenworcel, an F.C.C. commissioner and a Democrat, who voted against the repeal of net neutrality last year.By repealing neutrality rules, the government has just given our online overlords that legal right, she cautioned.\u201cNow they can block websites and censor online content,\u201d Ms. Rosenworcel said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel good \u2014 and if you rely on the internet to consume or create, it shouldn\u2019t make you feel good, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Salvini added that his goal was to stop the flow of refugees and to cut spending on migrant care. \u201cWe\u2019ll solve identical problems for other ships,\u201d he said.The recent events, and Mr. Salvini\u2019s adoption of the Twitter hashtag #chiudiamoiporti, or \u201c We Will Close the Ports,\u201d suggested that he intended to.\u201cRescuing lives is a duty, transforming Italy into an enormous refugee camp is not,\u201d Mr. Salvini wrote on Facebook on Monday morning. \u201cItaly has stopped bowing its head and obeying.\u201dOn Sunday, the Italian authorities ordered the Aquarius, a rescue vessel operated by European humanitarian groups and Doctors Without Borders, to stop 35 nautical miles off the southern coast of Italy.The ship had 629 migrants aboard, hailing from 26 countries in Africa, and included 123 minors, 11 small children and seven pregnant women. It also had 15 people with serious chemical burns and several patients with hypothermia, according to Doctors Without Borders. The migrants boarded the Aquarius from six overcrowded boats adrift in the central Mediterranean.But the aid group said that Italy did not provide an alternate destination where it could safely dock, leading it to sail back and forth for hours.The Spanish government said in a statement, \u201cIt is our obligation to avoid a human catastrophe and offer a safe haven to these people, fulfilling that way the obligations of international law.\u201d Spain is offering to welcome the refugees in the eastern port of Valencia.European leaders, humanitarian groups, Italian mayors and newspapers decried the new Italian government\u2019s hard line on Monday. (\u201cSalvini Pushes back the Ship of the Desperate,\u201d read the front page headline of La Stampa. \u201c629 people Held Hostage by Salvini,\u201d read the banner headline in La Repubblica.)The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees appealed on Monday to both Italy and Malta to allow the immediate disembarkation of people stranded on the Aquarius.\u201cThere is an urgent humanitarian imperative here,\u201d said Vincent Cochetel, the refugee agency\u2019s special envoy for the central Mediterranean. \u201cPeople are in distress, are running out of provisions and need help quickly. Broader issues such as who has responsibility and how these responsibilities can best be shared between States should be looked at later.\u201dThe chief spokesman for the European Commission, Margaritis Schinas, said that \u201cthe priority of both the Italian and Maltese authorities should be ensuring these people receive the care they need.\u201dSome mayors from southern Italian cities excoriated the government for stranding the migrants and offered their ports to the ship. The mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, remarking that his city\u2019s name meant \u201call port\u201d in ancient Greek, said that the Sicilian capital would always welcome ships that saved lives in the Mediterranean.But their gestures were merely symbolic as the new populist government has jurisdiction over all of Italy\u2019s ports.Italy wanted Malta, which was only 27 nautical miles away, to take the migrants. But since 2013, Italy has officially coordinated rescue missions in the central Mediterranean, after a shipwreck left more than 350 migrants dead near the Sicilian island of Lampedusa.Since then, European countries have joined forces in a military operation led by Italy to prevent similar tragedies while patrolling in search of human traffickers. Over recent years, the mission has shrunk, but rescued migrants were usually brought to Italy. The consensus in the international community is that Malta, whose population is less than 1 percent of Italy\u2019s, could not absorb the migrants as easily as Italy could.\u201cItaly is violating international law,\u201d Prime Minister Joseph Muscat of Malta wrote on Twitter on Sunday night as his government offered emergency medical evacuations, if necessary, but refused to allow the ship to dock on the island.Mr. Salvini and the anti-establishment Five Star\u2019s new transportation minister, Danilo Toninelli, issued a joint statement Sunday night urging the Maltese government to open its ports to the migrants, and to face its responsibilities \u201cfor the first time in a long time.\u201dThe Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, agreed.\u201cTo premier Joseph Muscat, who I called personally tonight, I asked that he at least take care of the humanitarian aid of the people in difficulty on Aquarius,\u201d Mr. Conte said Sunday night. \u201cMuscat has not guaranteed any action. This is umpteenth unwillingness of Malta, and thus of Europe, to act. Italy is totally alone.\u201dHe then called for a change in the European Union law requiring migrants applying for asylum to do so in the first country in the bloc where they arrived, and for their applications to be processed before they are allowed to go to other European nations.Such relocations are slow and rare. As a result, Italy bears the brunt of a migration crisis that has drastically transformed its politics.\u201cWe have taken in thousands a day for years, and Malta is not available to welcome even a few hundred,\u201d said Luigi Di Maio, the political leader of the Five Star Movement and Mr. Salvini\u2019s counterpart in the governing alliance. He said that Italy was awaiting a response from European leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s about time to say enough.\u201dThe Five Star Movement, which won nearly a third of votes in Italy in March, long maintained a vague line on polarizing issues like immigration. By being hard to pin down, they succeeded in attracting voters from both the left and the right. After the standoff on Monday though, it is now clear that they share the League\u2019s hard line.The previous government of the center-left Democratic Party also implored European leaders to help share the burden of the migration crisis. They struck deals with Libyan tribes, and possibly human traffickers, to reduce the flow of migrants. (Italy has recorded 13,706 sea arrivals so far in 2018, a significant decrease from recent years.) But they never turned ships away.A former interior minister, Marco Minniti, told the daily La Repubblica on Monday: \u201cSalvini\u2019s is an electoral move. I\u2019ve never thought of closing the ports, not even when 26 ships arrived with 13,500 migrants within 36 hours.\u201dIndeed, on Sunday, more than seven million Italians voted in local elections, with early results showing a strong showing for the League in several cities.This is not the first time the League has closed ports to aid ships. In 2009, the interior minister at the time, Roberto Maroni, also from Mr. Salvini\u2019s party, left a Turkish merchant boat at sea for days in an attempt to redirect the migrants aboard to Malta.In 2004, Italy\u2019s center-right ruling coalition left a German aid group at sea for three weeks. Italian authorities delivered food by helicopter, and eventually gave in and allowed the vessel to dock in Italy.This time, at least, Mr. Salvini and his government seems to have caught the attention of Europe\u2019s most powerful leaders.\u201cItaly needs common rules on asylum and we need a common border police,\u201d Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said on German television Sunday night. \u201cI will use all my influence for this purpose.\u201dRaphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Understand What Ails the Modern Internet? Look at eBay", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThere was a time when eBay was practically synonymous with buying and selling things online. Now it\u2019s surprisingly easy to forget that it exists, until you need to buy something you can\u2019t find anywhere else or clear some space in the attic. Or until someone like Elon Musk, made fabulously wealthy when PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, muscles his way back into your consciousness by, for example, launching rockets into space or burrowing tunnels under major American cities. Where did he come from, exactly? As with a surprising number of tech heavyweights, the answer is complicated, but it runs through eBay.None of this is to say that eBay has gone away \u2014 in 2017, more merchandise changed hands over the platform than in any earlier year. It\u2019s just ancient in tech terms. It went public in 1998. But perhaps more than any other tech giant of its era \u2014 excluding Amazon \u2014 eBay has shaped the tech industry of 2018. Depending on how you look at it, this is an assignation of credit or blame. EBay\u2019s influence can be felt in both trivial and fundamental ways in companies like Facebook, Google and Uber.EBay is a platform that connects buyers and sellers. It does not itself sell goods; it lists and sorts and processes, providing shelves for its users\u2019 inventory and aisles for their prospective customers. It mediates as little as possible, and it takes a cut. Its problems, in the early days, felt new, at least at eBay\u2019s scale: managing disputes among significant numbers of users, dealing with bad actors of various sorts, addressing scams and fakes, establishing not just a framework for mass human interaction but systems through which to codify trust and resolve conflict.To its credit, eBay has ameliorated many of its problems, through public trial and error, over the course of nearly two decades. \u201cAll the linchpins on which modern platforms rely, at least at a very high level, eBay pioneered,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and a longtime researcher of online platforms. \u201cWe use it in almost every paper we do.\u201d EBay, in obvious and subtle ways, has served as a model well beyond the world of commerce, inspiring the systems that play host to discourse, media, culture and communication online. It was among the first true megaplatforms \u2014 the sort that establishes itself as something like online infrastructure. And it may be, to date, the last one we truly understand.This basic approach to seller vetting has been adopted, and adapted, for much wider use, often with far less remove. In 2001, an eBay user might have given an eBay seller a low rating for an unsatisfactory packaging job; in 2018, an Uber driver might be dinged if a rider doesn\u2019t like his personality or choice of music. Facebook recently began ranking publishers by trustworthiness, based on feedback from users. Upon discovering a problem, a platform company\u2019s first instinct is to find a way to expose it to the wisdom of a market, or at least the will of a crowd.EBay users\u2019 participation in the site\u2019s governance is best understood as large-scale offloading of labor, and is basically limited to snitching on one another; users have some recourse against one another and somewhat less against the site itself. That imbalance doesn\u2019t bother us because eBay is eBay. \u201cIt\u2019s a transactional platform; the transaction is very clear to both sides,\u201d Hagiu says. \u201cBy and large, buyers and sellers are aligned on eBay.\u201d A seller banned for counterfeit sunglasses hasn\u2019t lost any rights, just his ability to use eBay. Crucially, to most ears, a scammer\u2019s claims to the contrary would sound ridiculous.But quite often it\u2019s managed like one, because in many ways, that\u2019s exactly what it is: a giant, multisided marketplace for buying and selling, in which the largest party \u2014 the users \u2014 doesn\u2019t do the buying or the selling. A social network\u2019s profitable transactions involve everyone but the users. Ad rates are even determined, in many cases, by auction. If eBay is a machine for finding the right price for a pair of shoes, Facebook \u2014 behind the veneer of enabling human connection \u2014 is a machine for discovering the right price for a pair of eyeballs. Your eyeballs.When the biggest platforms seem to be flailing or punting on problems, it\u2019s often because they\u2019re trying to address broad social issues with market solutions. They\u2019re rediscovering, at scale and at great expense to their users, the ways in which a society is more than a bazaar, and the pitfalls of allowing human attention to be sold and resold as a commodity. If a platform is addressing a collective problem in a maddeningly strange way, consider that it might see itself, or only know to govern itself, like an eBay. If it can\u2019t keep bad actors from using the service to exploit other users, that\u2019s because it\u2019s modeled after a system in which finding the highest bidder \u2014 or the biggest sucker \u2014 is gamely understood to be the point.There are more lessons for the new internet to learn from the old, and eBay\u2019s more recent trajectory might likewise give us clues about where its successors will go next. EBay was once a world-beating company, destined to totally remake commerce. While its legacy is powerful, it has, over the years, discovered its limits. Amazon, not eBay, is now most synonymous with online shopping. The site has also undergone some more fundamental changes. Auctions, for example, have become less popular over time, as sellers and buyers have favored the site\u2019s other buying styles, with fixed or suggested prices. And in many categories, large sellers have become entrenched, functioning more like stores themselves than desperate participants in a giant open-air market. EBay\u2019s final lesson to the next generation of platforms is that nothing is inevitable. Or lasts forever.Even still, eBay and PayPal\u2019s alumni are now immensely wealthy and unusually influential, and are using that power to reshape the world around them: Musk, with his electric cars and rockets and flamethrowers; Pierre Omidyar, with his investments and media ventures; Peter Thiel \u2014 an early Facebook investor and board member \u2014 with his funding of lawsuits against media companies and his eclectic and severe right-wing politics. It is worth considering what sort of initiatives might be spawned by the beneficiaries of today\u2019s much larger platform companies. EBay invited us onto an auction floor and dared us to compete with one another; millions did. Social-media companies found a more lucrative approach, with an even bigger payoff, by building the auction floor right under our feet.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

It was just a small thing, he added. An acting student with piercing eyes, he wasn\u2019t looking for attention and was a bit surprised when I asked for his name.But Nikole and I were both impressed. Here was individual action and creativity, deployed quietly for good.Mark\u2019s coffee plan was also a reminder that the responsibility for education should fall more heavily on those who need it most. As Nikole put it at our events Sunday in Melbourne and Monday in Sydney, black and brown people consider and discuss race all the time; they\u2019re not the ones who need more education and conversation \u2014 it\u2019s the rest of us who could invest more in the subject.The image above, for example, is part of a series shot by Michael Cook, a Bidjara man who has said his work reverses reality and highlights \u201cthe lack of Indigenous representation within Parliament, the judicial system and the business world.\u201dHere are two other images from the series, which is called \u201cMajority Rule.\u201dThis week especially, the need for more education and discussion on race and equality seems striking. In much of the world, compassion and understanding are in retreat.The United States is in the throes of a debate about the morality of separating immigrant children from their parents. In Germany, Bavarian conservatives threatened to take down the government of Angela Merkel to close the border to immigrants, in violation of European Union rules, while here in Australia, there are signs of a collective retrenchment.Earlier this week, Australia\u2019s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, sent out an email responding to calls for an end to his position, or at least a renaming to make his replacement a \u201ccommunity relations commissioner.\u201dWhat\u2019s interesting, though, is that in both countries, there is a clear generational divide on issues of race and immigration. Young people, those 45 and under, are far more likely to prefer openness and diversity.They are also increasingly turned off by the way their elders run things; less than half of Australians aged 18 to 44 said they preferred democracy to other forms of government, compared with 76 percent support for democracy among those 45 and over.Anyone want to share their take on why that might be the case? (I have a few theories.)______\u201cIt was supposed to be the day when President Emmanuel Macron of France received a long-awaited response from Germany on his big ideas on how to rekindle Europe as a force for liberalism in the world.And he did, sort of.But his meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Tuesday was overshadowed by the urgent issue of how to put out the growing number of populist fires over migration on the Continent \u2014 including in Germany itself.\u201d______It made me realize that many of us do notice style and wardrobe even if we don\u2019t think we do.______It is, by their account, \u201ca Sochi gastro pub recommended to fans on the World Cup website that just so happens to be in the same building that housed the notorious antidoping laboratory at the center of one of the most elaborate cheating schemes in sports history.\u201d______Q. What do you think of the state of art in Australia?A. \u201cIt\u2019s moribund.

{"Headline": "What Data Has Done to Capitalism", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I\u2019m regularly frustrated by the process of searching for hotel accommodations for my family of five. We know what we want: a basic suite, like at a Residence Inn, with four beds, two bedrooms and a bathroom off the common area. But we struggle to find it, because hotel search engines make it surprisingly difficult to figure out the specifications of rooms.Lacking that information, I sometimes end up calling a hotel reservations agent, who typically can\u2019t tell me much more than I can read online. Then I go back to the search engine, make a decision based on price and hope for the best. If someone \u2014 either a hotel chain or an aggregator \u2014 built a better search engine, I would happily use it. I would also be willing to pay a bit more for the kind of room my family wants, rather than shopping almost exclusively by price.After reading this new book by Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Thomas Ramge, \u201cReinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data,\u201d I now have a name for what I\u2019m looking for: a data-rich market. And I\u2019m optimistic that it will one day come to the hotel business. Data-rich markets are sweeping across the global economy. \u201cUntil recently, communicating such rich information in markets was difficult and costly. So we used a workaround and condensed all of this information into a single metric: price,\u201d they write. \u201cIn data-rich markets, we no longer have to condense our preferences into price and can abandon the oversimplification that was necessary because of communicative and cognitive limits.\u201dAmazon, with its many product specifications and customer reviews, is often a data-rich market. So are Spotify, Netflix, Lyft, StubHub, Rent the Runway, Tinder and Airbnb (which provides a much better search for lodging than hotels do). These markets aren\u2019t just about first-world convenience, either. In the Indian state of Kerala, among other places, a data-rich market has transformed the fishing business. Fishermen no longer have to guess which seaside market needs their catch. They can use their mobile phones to tell them which markets have a gap between supply and demand.All in all, the move to data-rich markets is for the good. It is of a piece with the ideals of Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Immanuel Kant. Knowledge spreads, and people are able to act on it. Fishermen sell more fish. Fish eaters have more choice. In one realm after another, people are able to find products and services they want, rather than having to settle for something less useful.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the University of Oxford, and Ramge, a writer for The Economist, explain all of these advantages. To their credit, though, they spend more time in their book on the downsides of data-rich markets. These include the potential to put people out of work and to concentrate corporate power among a small number of firms that control the most valuable data. The book echoes some of the themes of Tim Wu\u2019s 2010 history, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d which documented the tendency of information technology to produce cartels and monopolies. The only way to avoid this fate, all of these authors agree, is a smart, activist government dedicated to protecting its citizens\u2019 interests.This new book starts its story with the ancient idea of human coordination. \u201cIf there is a single crucial thread that has persisted through human history,\u201d the authors write, \u201cit is the importance of coordination.\u201d Coordination allows communities to accomplish tasks that individuals working alone cannot. People can build on one another\u2019s strengths and make up for one another\u2019s weaknesses. Coordination made possible the library of Alexandria, the Great Wall of China, the Suez Canal and the moon landing. Coordination, in turn, depends on communication \u2014 the exchange of information that allows people to work together.In modern times, the most effective way to coordinate behavior, other than through government, has been through a company, also known as a firm. Firms tend to follow a top-down approach to coordination. A canonical example is Henry Ford\u2019s automobile firm. There, workers were divided into specialized groups. Information flowed up from these groups through a tightly controlled management structure that culminated with an imperial chief executive. Decisions came down from the top.But the firm is not the only way for the private sector to coordinate. The market offers a different model for doing so, one that both complements and competes with the firm\u2019s hierarchical approach. The market is decentralized. It has no top-down authority. Participants come and go with ease.In the market, the dominant mechanism for coordination and communication has long been price. It\u2019s simple to understand, often too simple. It is one-dimensional. That\u2019s why firms have long provided a more efficient way for people to coordinate, because they could better synthesize a rich stream of information and then act on it. Today, however, the explosion of computing power has enabled many more people to gather information and analyze it quickly, which has allowed the lingua franca of the market to become more sophisticated. In response, many firms are reorganizing themselves to mimic markets. They have become less strictly hierarchical and spread decision-making power to a larger number of people.For all their differences, the firm and the market do share a central flaw. They often are not self-correcting. Early winners can use their strength to beat back competition, amassing yet more strength \u2014 and ultimately hurting the public interest. It happened with the railroad trusts, Standard Oil and AT&T, and it is beginning to happen with the big winners in today\u2019s data-rich, market-oriented economy. Superstar companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google earn enormous profits, while employing a surprisingly small work force relative to their scale. They are adept at avoiding taxes. And they continue to amass data about human behavior that will help them grow even stronger.Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Ramge offer several intriguing ideas for limiting the excesses of data-rich capitalism. One idea is a \u201crobo tax\u201d as a partial replacement for the payroll tax \u2014 machines would be taxed more and human employment less. Another idea is mandated data sharing \u2014 an echo of the patent system, which also depends on disclosure, the authors note \u2014 to allow new entrants a fair chance to compete.These ideas won\u2019t get much of a hearing in today\u2019s Washington. But the shift toward an information-based economy will outlast the current administration. Eventually, this country will have a government interested in encouraging the best parts of modern capitalism while restraining the worst.David Leonhardt is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}

You, too, can see a winner.The last two big winners at the Tony Awards, \u201cHamilton\u201d and \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d were already very tough tickets even before they were named best new musical in 2016 and 2017, Mr. Paulson said.2.

There\u2019s a new category this year.In 2014, the Tony Awards stopped recognizing sound designers, saying the category was too specialized. \u201cBut there was an outcry,\u201d Mr. Paulson said, \u201cand this year the category is back, both for plays and musicals.\u201d4. The Times will be represented.Sara Krulwich, the longtime theater photographer for The New York Times, was recognized earlier this week with a Tony honor for excellence in the theater \u2014 the first journalist to be so honored.5. This is the first Tony Awards show since the #MeToo era.\u201cWhat a difference a year makes,\u201d Mr. Paulson said. \u201cLast year, the Tonys were hosted by Kevin Spacey, who months later saw his career implode over accusations of sexual misconduct.

{"Headline": "On Father\u2019s Day, Skip the Politics", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 \u201cI think you should write an article about me,\u201d my father-in-law said last year, a startling statement for a man so private he abandoned Facebook once his friend list swelled to 27 people, even though at least half of them were his own children and grandchildren.\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d I asked.\u201cWrite about how you still love me even though I support President Trump.\u201dMy father-in-law joins us for supper several times a week, not just for Thanksgiving, and he lives in the same ZIP code, so no cellphone analysis would ever pick up the fact that political conversations can get pretty hot at our supper table, thanks to the divide this study observed.To me, the election of Donald Trump felt like a death in the family. I couldn\u2019t sleep. I found it hard to focus at work. I was barely a click away from wailing and rending my garments. And every attempt my father-in-law made to explain the new president\u2019s behavior just made me want to yank up his plate and dump it on his head. But people are more than the worst thing they\u2019ve ever done, as Sister Helen Prejean often says of death-row inmates, and since the election I\u2019ve been trying hard to remember that people are also more than their political opinions.With my beloved father-in-law, though, it isn\u2019t hard to remember that truth at all. This is a man who grew up during the Depression, raised by a single mother in the home of his grandparents, Irish Catholic immigrants. In the small-town South of the 1930s, being a child of divorce was as uncommon as being a Catholic, and my father-in-law, always shy by nature, grew up feeling a little bit different.He remembers riding his bicycle past the rural airport where a man had taken his airplane apart and spent weeks putting it back together, day after day. My father-in-law was watching as the man fastened the last screw. He looked at the lonely little boy, and said, \u201cWant to go for a ride?\u201d Without an instant\u2019s hesitation, my father-in-law dropped his bicycle and hopped in. For his daring, he was rewarded with a bird\u2019s-eye view of his hometown.Later, he earned an engineering degree on an ROTC scholarship and served his country in Korea, constructing entrenchments under heavy enemy fire. Back at home, he married my beautiful mother-in-law, and together they raised six children. He was a typical father of his age, leaving all the hands-on work of caregiving to his wife, but when she got sick with Parkinson\u2019s disease, he cared for her tenderly, as though he had spent a lifetime taking care of others. He managed her medication, drove her to a zillion doctors\u2019 appointments, helped her to bathe and dress. Every night, he tucked her in, leaning over the bedrail to kiss her one last time before turning out the light. She lived 18 years with that devastating disease, and he was by her side to the very last day.Yes, my father-in-law supports a president whom I consider an incalculable threat to American democracy and global stability. He supports a legislature systematically dismantling the best of what a government can do: provide a safety net for the needy, protect the environment, foster a culture of civility and inclusion, guarantee liberty and justice for all. It makes me heartsick to see what\u2019s happening to my country under the president my father-in-law supports. But when I lean in close enough, all I see is my husband\u2019s cherished father, my children\u2019s devoted grandfather, the good man who loves this country exactly as I love it, even if we disagree on what that love calls us to do.My own father consistently canceled my vote \u2014 from the very first election I voted in until the very last election of his life. But there was never any question about our love for each other. Never. We argued politics at almost every meal \u2014 so vehemently that in 1982 the only thing my mother wanted for Mother\u2019s Day was a promise from us both not to utter the name \u201cRonald Reagan\u201d during brunch. But what came out of those arguments was respect. We both cared enough to be informed. We never agreed on what to do with that information, but neither of us thought the other was an idiot.My father-in-law will be 90 in August, and he is still the sharpest bridge player I know. He pays attention to the news, and he has no party allegiance. More than once in the past, he has changed his mind about a president he voted for, and I haven\u2019t given up hope he\u2019ll come around on Donald Trump, too. But even if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll love him exactly as I always have. The president is polarizing and poisoning the country I love, but I won\u2019t let him poison this family, too.Advertisement"}

He was 68.Mr. Kirwan was only a teenager when he joined Fleetwood Mac in 1968, but his talent was apparent to the band, which at the time consisted of the guitarists Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer, the bassist John McVie and the drummer Mick Fleetwood.His work was featured on five albums, beginning in 1969 with the bluesy \u201cThen Play On,\u201d on which he shared writing and lead guitar duties with Mr. Green. He also sang all the songs he wrote with the band, which included half the tracks on the gold-certified 1972 album \u201cBare Trees.\u201dAs a guitarist, he was known for his vibrato.His departure came as Fleetwood Mac was transitioning from its foundation in bluesy rock to the more melodic California pop-rock the band came to epitomize in the 1970s.

As a teenager he was the frontman for a band called Boilerhouse, which was playing in a Brixton pub when he was discovered by Mr. Green and Mr. Fleetwood, according to online biographies.He and Ms. Clare had a son, Dominic, who survives him.

Read as much or as little as you can, and bring your questions to the events if you\u2019re coming.\u201cWhat\u2019s missing from the American conversation on race is the fact that people don\u2019t have to hate black people or Muslims or Latinos to be uncomfortable with them, to be suspicious of them, to fear their ascension as an upheaval of the natural order of things.

{"Headline": "By Taking a Bullet, a Muslim Woman Finds Her Calling", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBERLIN \u2014 Seyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living. A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women\u2019s center in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.\u201c \u2018I want to go back,\u2019 I told God,\u201d Ms. Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women\u2019s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. \u201cI still have a mission.\u201dMore than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side-by-side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque \u2014 the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered \u2014 are recognized as imams. Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shiite, transgender, gay or straight\u201cWe want to send a signal to political Islam,\u201d Ms. Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshipers. \u201cWe want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.\u201dOver the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members \u2014 many of them women. They help Ms. Ates organize weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Against the backdrop of these debates, Ms. Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.She recently extended the lease on the room where the mosque is housed for two more years, defying those who foretold a swift demise for the project.\u201cA couple of days after we opened the mosque, a young man showed up and told us, \u2018You won\u2019t be here long. The Arabs will never allow it,\u2019 \u201d she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services. Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as 500 euros, or about $580, Ms. Ates said, emphasizing that the mosque receives no public funding.\u201cEven atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,\u201d she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. \u201cI had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.\u201dThe criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats. \u201cMay Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,\u201d someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book \u201cIslam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u201d in 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community. \u201cI want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, \u2018She\u2019s just a lawyer,\u2019 \u201d she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II. Ms. Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ms. Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realization that because of her gender she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counselor in a women\u2019s center. In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the center, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her; the other struck Ms. Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack. She returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin\u2019s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fund-raising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the United States, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.Meriam Yabir, an 18-year-old Muslim from Munich, had heard about the liberal mosque and sought it out while she was visiting Berlin. In a story similar to that of Ms. Ates, she said she grew up in a conservative household, but with her bright blue hair, pierced nose and miniskirt, she said she has struggled to find a congregation where she feels welcome.\u201cIt is hard to find a mosque where I fit in, so I normally pray at home,\u201d said Ms. Yabir, adding that she wished there were more liberal mosques. \u201cWhere I can be like this,\u201d she said, gesturing to her clothes, \u201cand still be a Muslim.\u201dWhile several hundred Muslims visit the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque each month, Ms. Ates said, like Ms. Yabir, many are just passing through. Ms. Ates said she would like to see her congregation grow among the city\u2019s Muslims.\u201cThere are still many who are afraid to come, because the rumor that we are a terrorist organization persists,\u201d she saidNevertheless, she said she believed that she would be able to live without 24-hour protection one day, although it might take 10 or 15 years. \u201cThe more liberal mosques exist in Germany and across Europe, the less there will be this fixation on one individual.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very confident of it,\u201d she said, adding, with a nod to the muscled officer on the other side of the room, \u201cYou\u2019ll soon be out of a job,\u201d she laughed.Advertisement"}

Unfortunately, we have to keep them,\u201d Mr. Salvini said on Monday during an interview on a regional television station.Reaction was immediate. Luigi Di Maio \u2014 leader of the Five Star Movement, coalition partner of Mr. Salvini\u2019s far-right League party \u2014 said that a census on an ethnic basis was not constitutional, so \u201cwe can\u2019t do it.\u201dPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in Berlin to meet with his German counterpart, Angela Merkel, was infuriated by Mr. Salvini\u2019s remarks and said that the interior minister \u201chad gone too far,\u201d according to Italian news reports. The prime minister did not comment publicly.The proposal for the census evoked distant but still-bitter memories of the racial laws against Jews and the Roma, instituted by Mussolini\u2019s government 80 years ago.Mr. Salvini, leader of the League party, is considered the most powerful political figure in Italy \u2014 more so than the prime minister, a little-known independent who was chosen by the governing coalition to be the ostensible head of the barely three-week-old government.Though the League and Five Star are theoretically partners, Mr. Salvini has commandeered the political conversation, if not the agenda, veering toward right-wing, populist and nativist positions that have not always sat well with his allies.Italian news organizations noted on Tuesday that whenever Mr. Conte was about to step out on the international stage, as he did in Berlin on Monday, Mr. Salvini managed to steal the limelight. The interior minister\u2019s comments on the Roma drew the first significant grumblings from his coalition partners, and Mr. Di Maio scrambled to have his voice heard.\u201cItalians have priority,\u201d said Mr. Di Maio, who is minister for labor and economic development. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to deal with problems related to immigration, but let\u2019s start working on the problems of millions of Italians who can no longer eat.\u201dThe Roma, also known as Romanies or Gypsies, are a people of South Asian origin who migrated centuries ago to Europe, where they have often suffered severe discrimination. Some have lived in itinerant communities, largely isolated from the societies around them, while many others have settled and integrated.He would learn, Mr. Stasolla said, that \u201csix out of seven Roma pay taxes,\u201d most own homes or pay rent, and that only about 26,000 live in camps, \u201csegregated areas\u201d that were \u201ccreated by previous right-leaning governments,\u201d or in informal settlements, he said.He said that more than 50 percent of the country\u2019s Roma population, estimated at between 120,000 and 180,000 people, were Italian citizens. A large percentage of the rest were from Romania or from the former Yugoslavia, and are considered stateless, \u201cso they can\u2019t be expelled,\u201d he said.Beyond Mr. Salvini\u2019s threats, Mr. Stasolla voiced concern that the government\u2019s stated agenda for the Roma \u2014 which includes closing irregular camps and removing children from Roma parents who do not send them to school \u2014 was moving toward \u201cxenophobic and populist positions that could violate fundamental human rights.\u201d\u201cInstigation to racial hatred starts with words, and gives people the impression that they are shielded from any consequences, so that anything could happen,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\u201cMany Italians don\u2019t even know that the Roma were also victims of racial hatred during the Second World War, as the Jews were, and this becomes of greater concern with new fascist tendencies rising.\u201dNow that the interior minister had closed Italy\u2019s ports to people escaping war and famine, he could increase his popularity by \u201chunting Gypsies,\u201d Mr. Spinelli said.Last week, three white men shouting \u201cSalvini! Salvini!\u201d drove by two men from Mali and fired a compressed air gun at them, lawyers for the migrants said on Tuesday. They said the incident, in Caserta, near Naples, had been reported to the police, and that the victims, one of whom was hit, were very frightened.One of the lawyers, Ida Grasso, said a security camera near the site where the shooting took place might have captured the license plate of the car. \u201cAt least we hope so,\u201d she added.Italy\u2019s Jewish community has also weighed in on Mr. Salvini\u2019s latest move, issuing a statement that said that there was no justification for the \u201cdisturbing proposal\u201d to register specific social groups, and \u201csubmit them to special security policies that are reserved for them alone.\u201dMr. Salvini\u2019s proposal to conduct a census \u201cis worrisome and reawakens memories of racist laws and measures that were enacted only 80 years ago, but are sadly increasingly forgotten,\u201d the statement said.But Mr. Salvini\u2019s openly aggressive attitude has clearly struck a chord. Many Italians posted comments on Mr. Salvini\u2019s social media feeds praising his decision.A survey published on Monday by the Italian pollster SWG showed that in the three months since the election, when it won the largest number of seats, the League has gained in popularity.Mr. Stasolla said he was concerned that Mr. Salvini\u2019s populist message was taking root among Italians \u201cwho believe you can respond to complex issues with simple slogans that single out scapegoats.\u201d\u201cThis is the real drama,\u201d he said, \u201cthat populism has infected broad segments of the Italian population at a speed we could not have anticipated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After the Faked Journalist Killing in Ukraine, the Murk Deepens", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The strange cast of characters emerging in the faked assassination of a prominent Putin critic \u2014 including a Russia-hating right-wing priest and the director of a Ukrainian arms manufacturer \u2014 set the already bizarre case on a path to a murky, up-is-down mess of the sort that Ukraine seems to specialize in.Both the priest and the executive claimed to be working for Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services. Ukrainian officials at first denied that but, in the case of the priest, subsequently reversed themselves and admitted he had played a role. They would not say what.However, in the absence of solid facts and real evidence about any plot to kill the dissident, Arkady Babchenko, somewhat implausible figures have emerged from the shadows, perhaps the most unlikely being the priest, who claimed he was hired to carry out the hit.The cleric has never made a secret of his longstanding antipathy toward Russia, fighting Russian-backed militias in eastern Ukraine and switching his religious affiliation from the Russian Orthodox Church to a breakaway branch of the Orthodox Church that has declared its independence from Moscow.Given such strong and publicly avowed enmity toward Russia, it is odd to say the least that Mr. Tsimbalyuk would be selected to carry out the contract killing of a prominent Kremlin critic.When he first posted the information on Facebook, a spokeswoman for the Security Service of Ukraine, known by its initials, S.B.U., denied that he was involved. But she later acknowledged that he had been.Then there is the accused organizer, who Ukrainian officials said was just warming up with the killing of Mr. Babchenko and had a list of some 30 others Moscow supposedly wanted to eliminate.That man, Boris L. Herman, was arraigned in a Kiev court on Thursday night and ordered to be held in custody for two months. Prosecutors said he had given the supposed assassin a down payment of $15,000, half what he was promised for carrying out the hit.In court, Mr. Herman tried both to link the plot to President Vladimir V. Putin and to claim that he, too, had been working for Ukraine all along. He was first contacted six months ago, he said.\u201cI got a call from a longtime acquaintance who lives in Moscow, and in the process of communicating with him it turned out that he works for a Putin foundation precisely to orchestrate destabilization in Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Herman was quoted as saying by Interfax Ukraine, a news agency.Claiming that he was working for Ukrainian counterintelligence, he said he had known perfectly well that there would be no killing. A monk was hired because he would not kill an unarmed man, he said in court, and once Mr. Babchenko\u2019s \u201cassassination\u201d had taken place, he said, his Russian contact had given him the list of 30 more names, which he says he passed to Ukrainian counterintelligence.Mr. Herman\u2019s lawyer, Eugene Solodko, wrote on Facebook that his client was the executive director of Schmeisser, a Ukrainian-German joint venture and the only arms manufacturer in Ukraine not owned by the government. It specializes in manufacturing sights for sniper rifles, he wrote.The prosecutor\u2019s office denied that Mr. Herman worked for Ukrainian counterintelligence.In Moscow, Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Mr. Putin, said on Friday that the Kremlin had nothing to do with the operation.\u201cNo such foundation exists in Russia,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAny allegations about Russia\u2019s possible complicity in this staging is just mudslinging. They do not correspond to reality.\u201dAside from hinting that catching the organizer hinged on completing the killing, Ukraine has not made it clear why such a deception was necessary. Nor has it provided any evidence about accomplices or a coherent time line. Officials said the ruse was two months in the planning stages.For his part, Mr. Babchenko said he was not privy to all the details of the investigation, but went along with the ruse because he believed his life was at risk. Numerous other critics of the Kremlin who have gone into exile in Ukraine have been murdered on the streets of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, previously.\u201cThey probably had their reasons,\u201d he said of the security services at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cMaybe they wanted to collect proof that was 100 percent solid.\u201dA famous war reporter, Mr. Babchenko, 41, fled Russia in early 2017 after a campaign of intimidation against him following his criticism of Russian involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria. He said that Ukrainian agents approached him a month ago to tell him that the Russian security services had put out a contract on him.\u201cI said: \u2018Great. Why have you been waiting a month?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Babchenko, who is now living under protection from the security services.He also provided a few details about the staging of the crime last Tuesday night. Security officers took one of his sweatshirts and fired shots through it, then smeared it with pig\u2019s blood after he put it back on.Taken to a hospital after his wife, who was in on the plot, summoned an ambulance, he was first wheeled into an intensive care unit and pronounced dead, then taken to the morgue. It was only then that he stopped playing dead and began watching the tributes to him pour in on television.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Ukraine and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Cases Read Like \u2018Manual in How Not to Investigate\u2019 Sexual Assault", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt took the woman one agonizing month to decide to report that she had been sexually assaulted by a colleague from the World Food Program, a United Nations agency, while working in Ethiopia.It took the agency a week to investigate, concluding in a single-page document that it didn\u2019t believe her.Then, more than a year later, investigators asked her lurid questions about her sexual positions during the encounter, according to the case files.She had no bruises or proof of force, and investigators concluded that her claim fell short of the legal definition of rape in Ethiopia and in the man\u2019s native country.On the world stage, the United Nations takes an uncompromising stance on sexual abuse, trumpeting a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for infractions by its employees and condemning rape laws that require a woman to show injuries to prove that she did not consent.But within the United Nations itself, the system for examining sexual misconduct by employees is so inconsistent that investigators sometimes use those same contentious laws to help guide their inquiries \u2014 a clear example, critics say, of the broad gap between the organization\u2019s public pronouncements and its own practices.\u201cI was absolutely baffled\u201d by the investigation\u2019s conclusion, the woman said. The case files, which she shared with The New York Times, \u201cread like a manual in how not to investigate a sexual assault,\u201d she added.But to many women in the industry, these measures sidestep the deep structural problems that have allowed decades of sexism and abuse within the United Nations to continue.They say internal investigations give greater credence to powerful men who deny wrongdoing than to the women who accuse them, and that reporting systems are so byzantine that it is often unclear how to make a complaint, or what happens to the women who do.Such criticisms \u2014 that the policies are inconsistent and that the sprawling bureaucracy is tarnished by sexism \u2014 are \u201cexactly the secretary general\u2019s opinion,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Dujarric, Mr. Guterres\u2019 spokesman.Mr. Dujarric said a lack of gender diversity and specialized training in internal investigations inhibited organization\u2019s handling of sexual assault reports.\u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d he said.Mr. Dujarric acknowledged that across the United Nations there is no consistent procedure or standard of proof for investigating sexual harassment and assault cases. The organization\u2019s 27 programs, funds and agencies largely operate independently, creating a patchwork of policies across a vast bureaucracy. Some investigators indicated that they relied on the legal definition of rape in the country where the act is committed \u2014 even in countries where the United Nations considers the law flawed.\u201cThe whole thing is just a system designed to protect the organization,\u201d said Peter Gallo, who worked as an investigator at the Office of Internal Oversight Services at the United Nations Secretariat. \u201cThe U.N. is more interested in its reputation than in protecting victims.\u201dMore than a dozen women who worked at five United Nations agencies over 10 years, whose names are being withheld because they fear workplace retaliation, described a system that they said was stacked against them. Some said they were accused of being overly emotional when they tried to report an incident. Others described being verbally abused for seeking to report it.Mr. Dujarric, the spokesman for Mr. Guterres, said the secretary general led discussions on the issue at a May meeting of the United Nations Chief Executives Board. He said the board had agreed to changes in reporting, investigation and decision-making procedures, like recruiting better-trained investigators and building a database of employees fired for sexual harassment, to avoid rehiring them at a different agency.The process for investigating misconduct is so unpredictable, some critics say, that victims of harassment or abuse don\u2019t know whether they will be discouraged, taken seriously or penalized for coming forward.One woman working for the United Nations in Iraq described how a male colleague, who sometimes shared videos demeaning women, told her how happy he was to have \u201cloose and sexy women\u201d from Ukraine and Lebanon in the office. When she tried to file a complaint, she said, she was discouraged by an ethics officer who told her the insults did not count as harassment.A woman at an agency headquarters in New York described seeking advice for a friend about reporting an assault, only to find out that she was required to report what she knew, even without the friend\u2019s consent. Moreover, she learned, she and her friend\u2019s names could be shared with the accused, making her nervous about retaliation.\u201cI don\u2019t think this guy is going to come with a gun to my house or something, but on the other hand, you never know,\u201d she said.Investigators at some United Nations agencies described their work as operating in a gray area. They conduct internal reviews that can lead to punishments like termination; they are not criminal investigators prosecuting offenders.But they said they often turned to criminal definitions of sexual assault \u2014 and sometimes use a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof \u2014 in the absence of clear guidance from their agencies.\u201cIt\u2019s not so clear cut,\u201d said Fabienne Lambert, the internal investigator at the United Nations Population Fund. \u201cIt depends on the type of wrongdoing.\u201dPaula Donovan, who advocates greater accountability in sexual assaults by United Nations personnel, argued that sexual assault claims face the highest burdens of proof, which unfairly disadvantages victims.\u201cThe system is designed to ensure that the smallest possible number of those who are accused are found guilty,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re using a standard that is only applied when people are facing 10 years to life in prison.\u201dIn recent months, U.N. Women, the United Nations agency dedicated to gender equality, appointed a special coordinator on sexual harassment, and other major United Nations agencies have reminded staff members of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d for sexual harassment in the workplace.Still, agencies within the United Nations sometimes interpret that differently.At the United Nations Population Fund, the standard for determining misconduct is \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d Ms. Lambert said.At the World Food Program, by contrast, the standard is the same as in an American court of law, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d according to a program spokeswoman.Complicating matters, there is little evidence in many sexual assault cases beyond the statements from the two people involved, investigators said. Often, they added, they must decide how to assess those statements on their own.\u201cIt boils down to credibility,\u201d said Henrik Malmquist, the head of investigations for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.In the World Food Program case in Ethiopia, the man\u2019s credibility was assessed, in part, by asking witnesses what kind of \u201cguy\u201d he was, according to the case files. The woman\u2019s credibility was assessed by asking questions about her mental health, her past romantic history and whether she engaged in \u201cflirtatious\u201d behavior with the accused, among other things, the files show.To the woman, the language investigators used when they first closed her case in November 2014 suggested that they were more interested in clearing her accuser\u2019s name than in understanding what had happened, she said.\u201cI remember exactly what they said: \u2018We recognize that the sex happened, but we do not have evidence that it was not consensual,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Do you have evidence that it was consensual?\u2019 And they said, \u2018That\u2019s not our job.\u2019\u201dAccording to the case files, investigators partly supported their decision by arguing that she could have escaped, based on the sexual positions they had her describe.\u201cVictims talk about that, feeling like they were paralyzed by the fear, and that\u2019s a result of the circuitry of fear,\u201d said Elana Newman, a psychology professor at the University of Tulsa.The investigators assigned to re-examine the woman\u2019s case were former prosecutors, one of whom had published papers about the risk factors for false convictions in the criminal justice system. Stroz Friedberg did not return phone calls or emails requesting comment.According to the case files, the firm interviewed a dozen people in late 2015. Two witness statements sided with the accused. One came from the man himself, who said the sex was consensual. Another came from a middle manager who said she didn\u2019t believe the woman because she thought a rape victim would scream or fight during the act, and because she thought the accused appeared to be \u201cquite a gentleman.\u201dOf the nine people the investigative team interviewed, seven indicated that they believed the woman. A counselor also told investigators that the woman\u2019s behavior after the assault was consistent with other rape victims he had counseled.Investigators acknowledged that the woman\u2019s statements to witnesses after the episode supported her claim that the sex was not consensual. But because she had given the man her phone number and kissed him before the alleged assault \u2014 a fact she acknowledged \u2014 the investigators determined that the activity was \u201cnot non-consensual,\u201d the case files show.The man she accused denied committing sexual assault, and said his case raised concerns about false accusations. In an email, he questioned his accuser\u2019s professional qualifications, mental state and motives. \u201cMy success in life might have attracted jealousy, unfortunately,\u201d he wrote.The woman said the investigation felt like a \u201csecond violation.\u201d\u201cWhen it happened, I felt like I was torn open,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then people are saying, \u2018No, that didn\u2019t happen. You have no proof,\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re not credible.\u2019\u201dShe is now pursuing an internal claim against the World Food Program for its handling of the case. The agency invited her to settle the matter through \u201camicable discussions\u201d \u2014 and required strict nondisclosure terms that precluded any further referral of the matter, including to \u201cadministrative or judicial bodies,\u201d according to an email from an official seen by The Times.She refused.Ed Flaherty, a lawyer who represents United Nations employees, including in sexual abuse cases, said the current process for investigating assaults was fundamentally flawed.\u201cThe U.N. should not be investigating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cGod help you if you\u2019re on the wrong side.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Digital Sex Lives of Young Gay Teenagers", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Turban is\u00a0a resident physician\u00a0in child and adolescent psychiatry.Last summer in Wisconsin, a mother came home to find her 15-year-old son running up the stairs from their basement. He yelled that a man had broken into the house and raped him. A police officer apprehended Eugene Gross, who was 51 years old and H.I.V. positive, in a nearby backyard.It\u2019s common for gay, bisexual or questioning minors to go online to meet other gay people. It\u2019s normal for these kids to want to explore intimacy. But most online social networks for gay men are geared toward adults and focused on sex. They have failed to protect minors, who simply have to subtract a few years from their birth date to create a profile.Gay kids, especially closeted ones, don\u2019t necessarily have the opportunities for intimacy that straight kids do: classroom Valentines and first prom dates. So they go online. Though they may be looking for friends or boyfriends, they mostly find sex.On Grindr, it\u2019s common to receive unsolicited naked pictures. A minor can make a profile within minutes and instantly start chatting with adult men who live nearby.Should apps like Grindr be held accountable when minors use them? Dr. Elizabeth Englander, a psychologist and expert on the digital lives of minors, thinks yes: \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical line and a no-brainer.\u201dGrindr\u2019s terms of service state that users must be 18 or older, and the app requires everyone to enter a birth date to join. But it could certainly do more to try to verify ages. Some gambling sites, for instance, make users upload a credit card or ID to prove their age. But this brings up confidentiality risks for gay men who don\u2019t want to be outed.When asked to comment, Grindr\u2019s chief technology officer and president, Scott Chen, said that Grindr is \u201cin the process of testing further safeguards for our account creation procedures to help ensure authentic and proper account activity, including verification through social media platforms.\u201d He said the company takes the issue very seriously, is working on improving its screening tools and encourages users to continue reporting any \u201cillegal or improper activity.\u201dThis is heartening, but it isn\u2019t enough. Age verification through social media is hardly foolproof, since minors can lie about their age on Facebook, too.And Grindr is hardly the only problem \u2014 there are many similar venues. When I searched online for \u201cgay chat,\u201d as a lonely, closeted child might, the first hit was #1 Chat Avenue. Two minutes after I opened a gay chat room, a user wrote: \u201cAny boys 13 or 14 with cameras? I\u2019m 35.\u201d After some deep searching, I found that you can report activity like this to moderators, but they aren\u2019t always online. I reported it to the site\u2019s administrator via email, but I never heard back.In the end, it is largely up to parents to protect their children. Unfortunately, this topic combines two of many parents\u2019 greatest fears: sex and technology.Parents can block apps like Grindr. But kids almost always outsmart us, and it\u2019s probably better to educate them in addition to using parental controls.Dr. Englander tells parents not to try to be experts on the technology. \u201cParents can instead be the experts on the importance of deeper in-person relationships,\u201d she says. Explain to children that while what they find online may be exciting or interesting, they never know who\u2019s on the other side.Parents also need to stay calm, so that the kids feel comfortable coming back to them if they ever end up in a bad situation, like if a scary stranger won\u2019t stop messaging.As a society, we have failed to create enough spaces for gay youth to thrive, pushing them online and underground. While we try to find ways to hold digital sites accountable, we need to talk to our kids about how to be safe online.Advertisement"}

A tool called Screen Time, for example, is meant to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps. And parents will be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones.Apple\u2019s software chief, Craig Federighi, said the company felt it was time to address smartphones\u2019 oversize impact on everyday life. \u201cFor some of us, it\u2019s become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we\u2019ve become,\u201d he said.These features looked quite handy \u2014 we will know for sure once they\u2019re released to users this year. If they do push users to quit wasting so much time on Facebook and YouTube (where getting people to waste time is a big part of the business plan), they are sure to roil Apple\u2019s relationship with others in tech.But that is not Apple\u2019s problem; it is more concerned about selling you a new phone.Apple is also putting considerable resources into making its Watch stand apart from its phone, a direction that in the long run will create more opportunities to go without a phone. Are you wearing an Apple Watch instead of carrying an iPhone? In time, Apple may not care.But at its event here, Apple\u2019s support for what\u2019s being called \u201cdigital well-being\u201d often awkwardly butted up against Apple\u2019s larger goal: to make the digital world so awesome, you can\u2019t resist it.The next iPhone will let you turn your face into an emoji, and now it can even do \u201ctongue detection\u201d \u2014 an animated version of your face can stick out its tongue when you do. With Apple\u2019s new augmented reality system, the iPhone can turn Legos into a video game. But if you can\u2019t even play with some Legos without reaching for your phone, isn\u2019t that kind of a problem?Apple wants to stand apart from the techlash with its emphasis on privacy and its oft-stated distaste for the excesses of the internet ad industry. On Monday, the company said its Safari web browser would disable tracking software, or cookies, that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users\u2019 activity across the internet.The new Safari feature is a direct swipe at the data-collection practices of big internet companies that Apple has tried hard to separate itself from.Apple argues that it has always been one of the more high-minded of the big tech companies, so it shouldn\u2019t be lumped in with outfits like Facebook.But that argument has always been a little complicated. Apple benefits from our obsession with social software; people buy its powerful phones to use Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year for the privilege of being the iPhone\u2019s default search engine.\u201cWe aim to put the customer at the center of everything we do,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said several times Monday.That seemed like a promise as well as a backhanded defense. Apple will give you the world.

{"Headline": "With Twitch, Amazon Tightens Grip on Live Streams of Video Games", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate on a recent night, more than 600,000 people watched one of the most popular video game players, Tyler Blevins, engage in Fortnite Battle Royale with a celebrity guest: Drake.Drake was deferential to Mr. Blevins as they teamed up before an audience that peaked at roughly 667,000 viewers, a ratings record (since broken) for a nontournament live stream. As the game progressed, the world-famous rapper played a supporting role, collecting supplies for Ninja, seemingly content to lend a hand to a master at work.Like others who make significant money on Twitch, Mr. Blevins is a born talker, and he bantered with the fans as he and Drake played. Drake joined the conversation, too. He told the commenters that he liked pineapple on his pizza and explained that he was a Ninja fan before Twitch, back when Mr. Blevins, 27, first found fame among gamers on YouTube and Instagram.Streamlabs \u2014 a San Francisco tech company whose software allows viewers to tip streamers, giving the company insight into an opaque ecosystem \u2014 suggests that Amazon\u2019s lead may be all but insurmountable. Its data shows that, in the last quarter, the average number of people watching Twitch\u2019s streams at any given moment increased to 953,000, up from 788,000. Twitch\u2019s archrival, YouTube Gaming, averaged 272,000 concurrent viewers, down from 308,000 in the previous quarter, Streamlabs reported.YouTube pushed back against the data, but declined to provide numbers of its own. \u201cWe have truly gotten bigger every single month in live gaming, and live gaming viewership is up over two times, year over year,\u201d said Ryan Wyatt, a YouTube vice president in charge of gaming content. (Ali Moiz, the Streamlabs chief executive, stood by his company\u2019s report. \u201cThey should publish their data, if they think this is wrong,\u201d he said of YouTube.)Twitch began in 2011 as an offshoot of Justin.tv, a lifecasting site founded by two Yale graduates, Emmett Shear and Justin Kan. They started the platform after they found that viewers were more interested in watching their lifecasters play video games than eat or sleep. Big tech companies came courting, and Amazon beat out Google.In the four years since the sale, video gaming as a spectator sport has gone mainstream, and Twitch has captured the majority of those who want to watch it live.For the dedicated fans, the live, freewheeling sessions on Twitch have the appeal of a major sporting event crossed with a talk show. The interaction between the host and viewers is one key to the site\u2019s success, making for an involved viewing experience that is markedly different from the prerecorded and edited videos of game sessions that have long been popular on YouTube.On Twitch, the player\u2019s face, when visible, typically inhabits a small part of the screen, and the world of the video game takes center position. On the right side of the screen, endless comments from the viewers \u2014 mostly male, mostly young \u2014 appear in a continuous scroll.Craig Riches, who plays under the name PythonGB, has posted his Minecraft videos on YouTube proper since 2010. Despite his affiliation, he said the Amazon-owned site remained well ahead of Google\u2019s foray into live game-streaming.\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that YouTube Gaming is still playing catch-up to Twitch\u2019s platform,\u201d said Mr. Riches, 23.The hosts on Twitch, some of whom sign up exclusively with the platform in order to gain access to its moneymaking tools, are rewarded for their ability to make a connection with viewers as much as they are for their gaming prowess. Viewers who pay $4.99 a month for a basic subscription \u2014 the money is split evenly between the streamers and Twitch \u2014 are looking for immediacy and intimacy. While some hosts at YouTube Gaming offer a similar experience, they have struggled to build audiences as large, and as dedicated, as those on Twitch.\u201cYou have this really unique live interaction you don\u2019t get with YouTube videos,\u201d said Meg Kaylee, a streamer and host on GameStop TV who built her career playing various games on Twitch after starting on YouTube. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different experience.\u201dCiting Twitch\u2019s fervent audiences and the \u201cbetter job\u201d it does in communicating with talent, Ms. Kaylee, 20, added that she had never really considered signing up with YouTube Gaming.Facebook Live, Periscope and Mixer all grew quickly in the last quarter, according to Streamlabs, but none have approached the scale of Twitch. The number of those watching game streams on Facebook\u2019s platform, for instance, increased to 56,000 from 27,500, according to the firm\u2019s estimates.Even with the rise of live streaming, gamers have continued to do big business posting recorded videos on YouTube\u2019s main site, which reports 1.8 billion \u201clogged in\u201d users a month, across all types of content. That makes it much larger than Twitch, which claims around 100 million monthly viewers. Mr. Wyatt, the YouTube executive, noted the full scope of YouTube\u2019s gaming content, which includes the videos posted on the main site and the live streams on YouTube Gaming, in comparing it with the Amazon-owned platform.\u201cThe size and scale and businesses is not comparable from YouTube to Twitch,\u201d Mr. Wyatt said. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve seen indicates that video-on-demand will be the biggest part of gaming content consumption.\u201dHe also pointed out that YouTube Gaming offered a different kind of programming: its live sessions last \u201ca couple hours at a time\u201d \u2014 a sharp contrast with the typical Twitch marathons.Still, YouTube created YouTube Gaming in direct response to Twitch. During its first few months, in 2015, the platform\u2019s hosts complained about the lack of ways to make money and asked for better tools for managing chat streams, which can easily descend into toxicity.\u201cIt took them a really long time to bring out basic features you would have on Twitch,\u201d said Cole Riness, a professional YouTuber who specializes in family-friendly gaming videos.YouTube has taken steps to address complaints. Most notably, as of April, its subscription systems \u2014 for live and recorded content \u2014 have been unified. As for support, Mr. Wyatt said, \u201cI would argue that we certainly have equivalent moderation tools to any other service on the market.\u201dOther challenges have proved more difficult for YouTube Gaming to solve. The site\u2019s copyright policing has frustrated some hosts, who have found themselves penalized, or even barred, because music was playing in the background of their sessions. Twitch has a reputation for being less punitive \u2014 or perhaps just less aware \u2014 where copyright issues are concerned.While YouTube has made millionaires out of the creators of popular videos through its advertising program, Twitch\u2019s hosts make money primarily from subscribers and one-off donations or tips. YouTube Gaming has made it possible for viewers to support hosts this way, but paying audiences haven\u2019t materialized at the scale they have on Twitch.Now that it seems well on its way to becoming synonymous with long-form live video gaming, Twitch\u2019s competitors may be running out of time to take their shot.Brandon Freytag, a former Twitch employee who is chief executive of Loaded, a talent agency that represents Mr. Blevins, said the most credible challenge to Twitch may come not from another tech company but from within. The most popular hosts, he noted, could be enticed to leave it for another platform, or create their own. They could also make demands of Twitch itself.The popularity of its stars is a force Twitch has yet to reckon with. For now, Mr. Freytag said, the calculus for hosts like Mr. Blevins is pretty simple: \u201cEveryone is on Twitch.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the screen name of Craig Riches. Mr. Riches goes by PythonGB, not PythonDB.A photo with an earlier version of this article was published in error. The image showed a Twitch streamer pictured on Meg Kaylee\u2019s channel; it did not show Ms. Kaylee. The image has been removed from the article.Advertisement"}

He tried doing the same at a sushi bar in Manhattan and was shocked by the bill.At Davelle on the Lower East Side, Mr. Kanayama, an owner, wanted to treat uni not as a luxury but as a common pleasure, of which you can never have too much. Thus the name of his \u201ctoo much\u201d uni spaghetti, which comes in a simple breakdown of tomatoes, butter and soy sauce, littered with more than two dozen lobes of sea urchin, harvested in Maine and tossed in at the last minute. They arrive still loyal to the sea.Next to this, a plate of mentaiko spaghetti looks almost bare, but it\u2019s just as thrilling: noodles slicked with cream, soy sauce and translucent pink cod roe cured in salt, kombu, sake and red chile. It\u2019s deeply marine with a streak of heat against the calming velvet of cream.These exemplars of wafu (Japanese-style) pasta are available all day. Only at night, when Davelle shifts from kissaten (coffee shop) to izakaya (pub), will you find oden, a wintry stew that dates back centuries. One evening, Mr. Kanayama, wearing oversized mechanic\u2019s coveralls, explained that the dashi base for the stew was made when his restaurant opened in March.\u201cWe\u2019re three months old and so is the broth,\u201d he said. They keep adding to it, deepening the flavor while maintaining its lightness and clarity. (In Tokyo, one of the most famous oden restaurants, Otafuku, has a broth that\u2019s been simmering since 1945; it would\u2019ve been older, if not for an World War II air raid that destroyed the original batch.)Traditionally, customers select their ingredients, which are then crowded into a single bowl. Here, each appears separately \u2014 meaty daikon cut into hearts, inari (fried tofu skin) stuffed with enoki mushrooms, okra gone tender without losing sturdiness \u2014 lending a sense of ceremony.The dining room is no more than a cubby, with three tiny tables and dried flowers hanging on walls of chipped paint. Stools line the brief bar and the fireplace, with only its narrow mantle for plates.Impossible, Mr. Miyata said, but he did it, using ingredients that Mr. Kanayama thought would \u201cnever go together,\u201d including vegetables (whose identity must remain secret) pulverized into a paste to give the curry body and muted sweetness. The dish is musky and warm, somehow evoking childhood even for those who didn\u2019t grow up eating it.Afterwards, you\u2019ll want a fruits sandwich: shokupan \u2014 Japanese milk bread, unapologetically white \u2014 pressed around whipped cream mixed with yogurt for heft and embedded with kiwi, banana, whole strawberries and a dark, syrup-stained orb of canned peach. In Japan, Mr. Kanayama advised, this is not dessert but lunch.At breakfast, a two-inch-thick slab of shokupan emerges from the toaster with crunchy edges and a still lofty center. It\u2019s slathered with butter, sugar and red beans, and accompanied by a hard-boiled egg and a teacup of potatoes mashed with Kewpie and truffle oil, savory antidotes to the sweetness.Davelle might be loveliest in the morning, hushed and half-empty, with crumbs as fine as dust on your fingers. Music murmurs; time retreats. I could have sat there for hours, wishing I could keep this place to myself, and tell no one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Last March of the \u2018Wooden Elephants\u2019: Africa\u2019s Ancient Baobabs Are Dying", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResearchers fear the trees are parched by drought and rising temperatures linked to climate change. On January 7, 2016, a group of tourists set out to visit Chapman\u2019s Baobab, one of the oldest and mightiest trees in Africa. As the visitors neared that day, they heard a cracking boom like thunder. A cloud of dust obscured the site: Chapman\u2019s Baobab had collapsed. \u201cThe largest and oldest trees are more sensitive to changing climatic conditions because of their large dimensions,\u201d said Adrian Patrut, a chemist at Babes-Bolyai University in Romania and lead author of the new study. After Chapman\u2019s Baobab collapsed, for example, Dr. Patrut found that the tree\u2019s water content was just 40 percent, compared to 79 percent for healthy baobabs. Dr. Patrut and his colleagues did not set out to document the death of Africa\u2019s \u201cwooden elephants,\u201d as the species are sometimes called. Instead, they wanted to date them. Baobabs do not regularly produce tree rings, so the team turned to radiocarbon dating. The scientists compared carbon-14 levels from small samples taken in the oldest parts of the trees to samples from other tree species whose age had been determined by counting their rings. In 2005, the researchers began collecting samples from more than 60 of the largest African baobabs \u2014 those with trunk circumferences of at least 65 feet. The oldest trees, they found, were around 2,500 years old. The scientists also confirmed that baobab\u2019s unique structure \u2014 they often have hollow centers \u2014 are formed when the trees generate new stems in a ring-shaped pattern. Over time, those stems may fuse together, creating an open or closed circle. As the study progressed, though, the researchers were shocked to find that a number of their subjects \u2014 the largest and oldest trees \u2014 began to fall. Eight of the 13 oldest and five of the six largest have died or partly collapsed in the past 13 years. The trees did not simply succumb to old age, the researchers believe. \u201cThe fact that these trees just suddenly died in the early part of this century is to me a canary in the mine,\u201d Dr. von Reden said.While he and his colleagues have yet to determine what is causing the deaths, they have largely ruled out disease. Instead, they suspect climate change. \u201cThe new paper nicely brings together information showing that the death of the millennial baobabs is likely due to an unprecedented combination of temperature increase and drought,\u201d said Jens Gebauer, a horticulturist at the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences who was not involved in the research. \u201cThis information is valuable to the scientific community and the public, as the baobab is an outstanding and very important species in many African countries.\u201d While younger baobabs so far seem to have been spared, the largest trees often host rich communities of animal life, including bats and bees that nest inside their cavities and birds adapted to building nests in the tree\u2019s branches. People value them, too. Ancient baobabs often are staples of local lore and frequently are the site of ceremonies and meetings. In times of famine, their nutritious seeds feed humans and wildlife, and the tree\u2019s bark \u2014 which can be stripped away without killing it \u2014 is a source of both nutrition and hydration for elephants. In addition to impacts on people and the environment, there is also a symbolic loss, said Jack Pettigrew, an emeritus professor of physiology at the University of Queensland who has studied baobabs.

{"Headline": "A Guide to Soft Fresh Cheeses: Cottage Cheese, Mascarpone and More", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySoft, fresh cheeses are milky and moist, created to be eaten not long after they are made. The differences among them are like shades of white to an interior designer, subtle but distinct; some versions work better in certain applications than others. Variations come with the strains of bacteria a cheese maker selects, along with fat content, pasteurization, salt and time. But the process is basically the same: Milk is fermented by lactic acid bacteria or curdled by heat or acid from a souring agent like lemon juice or vinegar. Sometimes rennet is added to speed up the process. A soft, creamy cheese, this starts with milk proteins that have been turned into curds and separated from the watery whey. The curds are washed to get rid of any remaining acid, so the cheese tastes mild or even slightly sweet. Curd size depends on the cheese maker\u2019s style. Cottage cheese is made entirely out of skim milk until the end, when a dressing made from cream or milk is mixed with the curd. Fat content, which can be as high as 4 percent, comes from the dressing.Essentially cottage cheese before it has been dressed, farmer\u2019s cheese is sometimes hung in cheesecloth or pressed to make a crumbly but solid mass; the American style is salted. Different nations have different versions, like the slightly spongy Mexican queso fresco (which can be salted or not), or the Indian chenna, which is like more like dry cottage cheese, and paneer, which is chenna that is pressed and easily cut into cubes. (Neither Indian cheese is salted.) Whether this is essentially a version of low-fat cottage cheese, farmer\u2019s cheese, a thick sister to yogurt or its own thing depends on which country you live in. In Germany, quark is thick and smooth like yogurt, but slightly drier. Israel has both a creamy style and something drier and more akin to pressed, dry cottage cheese. In Russia and Poland, quark is sold as soft, pressed cakes of curds that are often broken up and mixed with other dairy products for blintzes, pierogi fillings or dips. Its Italian name is giuncata. This is somewhere between cottage cheese and farmer\u2019s cheese in dryness. The name is a reference to a style of cheese easily made in a pot on top of a stove. It is sometimes sold as \u201cdry-curd cottage cheese.\u201dThe lighter, fluffier, finer cousin of cottage cheese. The key difference: It\u2019s made primarily from the protein-laden whey left over from making cheese, though some milk may be added to increase yield. Of the cheeses listed here, it is the only one that is cooked curd, coagulated by heat and aided by the addition of acid, thus it takes its name from the Italian word for recooked.Sometimes called Italian cream cheese, mascarpone is a specialty of Lombardy, Italy. It\u2019s made by adding acid to heavy cream. It\u2019s smooth, rich, fatty and just the slightest bit sweet. Think of it as whipped cream without the air.A smooth French soft cheese, this is even thicker than cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, which is technically cultured cream, with a bit more tang. French legislation requires that fromage blanc have no live cultures, unlike fromage frais.Advertisement"}

My daughter and son-in-law send their 6-year-old to a parochial school. They are not particularly religious; I am an atheist. The little girl asked recently why another child wasn\u2019t baptized. Her mother said, \u201cSome people do that, others don\u2019t.\u201d When my sister died, the girl asked if she was in heaven. My daughter said, \u201cSome people don\u2019t believe in heaven.\u201d I\u2019ve been going along with this approach. But at some point, won\u2019t it be in my grandchild\u2019s best interests for me to explain that belief in a fictional deity is a poor substitute for science and rationality?GRANDMALet\u2019s hold off on the \u201cGod Is Dead\u201d banners for now. Judging by the youngsters I\u2019ve met in my life, I\u2019m guessing that Nietzsche\u2019s meaning would sail right over your granddaughter\u2019s head. You would probably also annoy your daughter and son-in-law, who, despite their lack of religious zeal, chose to enroll their child in a church-affiliated school.I\u2019m glad you mentioned the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child. I trust that\u2019s what you\u2019re after here (along with a mild dose of wanting to speak your mind). I suggest deferring to your daughter and son-in-law. They are entrusted with their child\u2019s care. And it sounds as if they\u2019re trying to balance her religious education with age-appropriate lessons that different people hold different beliefs.If you are concerned that your granddaughter\u2019s worldview is too narrow, head straight for her parents. Your daughter sounds open-minded. But you\u2019ve had your turn raising children; now it\u2019s theirs. (And remember how it felt when parents and in-laws offered unsolicited advice to you?) Your granddaughter will probably appreciate hearing your philosophy when she\u2019s older. For now, wait for her to ask you about it. I am a young artist who supports herself (and buys art supplies) with temporary gigs. It\u2019s a struggle, but I\u2019m making it work. Last year, I gave a painting I made to a friend for her birthday. She thanked me and seemed to like it. So, I was really upset when I saw it hanging at an acquaintance\u2019s apartment. I want to tell my friend how insensitive she was. Any suggestions?ANNEI\u2019m doubly sorry, Anne. First, because you\u2019re hurt, and second, because I don\u2019t think your friend did anything wrong. Let\u2019s start with the fact that you were generous to give her one of your paintings. (I\u2019m glad she thanked you.) But it is a sad fact that most of us have limited wall and storage space. So, your friend can simultaneously love you and not want to hang or store your painting.Given the extremely personal nature of your gift \u2014 your art! \u2014 consider how awkward it would have been for her to tell you she wasn\u2019t crazy about it when you gave it to her. In a way, she honored your generosity by finding a pal who likes the painting well enough to hang it. In the future, consider limiting gifts of your work to people who have expressed real admiration for it or outright desire to own a piece.My husband and I had another couple over for dinner. They just moved into the neighborhood, and our young kids are the same age. (They\u2019re both only children.)

{"Headline": "My Wife Said You May Want to Marry Me", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveShe encouraged her husband to find new love after she was gone. A year later, he reflects on what her generosity has meant to him.Amy couldn\u2019t have known that her essay would afford me an opportunity to fill this same column with words of my own for Father\u2019s Day, telling you what has happened since. I don\u2019t pretend to have Amy\u2019s extraordinary gift with words and wordplay, but here goes.During our life together, Amy was a prolific writer, publishing children\u2019s books, memoirs and articles. Knowing she had only a short time to live, she wanted to finish one last project. We were engaged then in home hospice, a seemingly beautiful way to deal with the end of life, where you care for your loved one in familiar surroundings, away from the hospital with its beeping machines and frequent disruptions.I was posted up at the dining room table overlooking our living room, where Amy had established her workstation. From her spot on the couch, she worked away between micro-naps. These brief moments of peace were induced by the morphine needed to control her symptoms. A tumor had created a complete bowel obstruction, making it impossible for her to eat solid food. She would flutter away on the keyboard, doze for a bit, then awake and repeat.When Amy finished her essay, she gave it to me to read, as she had done with all of her writing. But this time was different. In her memoirs she had written about the children and me, but not like this. How was she able to combine such feelings of unbearable sadness, ironic humor and total honesty?When the essay was published, Amy was too sick to appreciate it. As the international reaction became overwhelming, I was torn up thinking how she was missing the profound impact her words were having. The reach of Amy\u2019s article \u2014 and of her greater body of work \u2014 was so much deeper and richer than I knew.Letters poured in from around the world. They included notes of admiration, medical advice, commiseration and offers from women to meet me. I was too consumed with grief during Amy\u2019s final days to engage with the responses. It was strange having any attention directed at me right then, but the outpouring did make me appreciate the significance of her work. When people ask me to describe myself, I always start with \u201cdad,\u201d yet I spent a great deal of my adult life being known as \u201cAmy\u2019s husband.\u201d People knew of Amy and her writing, while I had lived in relative anonymity. I had no social media presence and my profession, a lawyer, did not cast me into public view.After Amy died, I faced countless decisions in my new role as a single father. As in any marriage or union of two people with children, we had a natural division of labor. Not anymore. People often assumed Amy was disorganized because she had list upon list: scattered Post-it notes, scraps of paper and even messages scrawled on her hand. But she was one of the most organized people I have ever met.There are aspects of everyday life I have taken on that I never gave much consideration to in the past. How did Amy hold everything together so seamlessly? I am capable of doing many things on my own, but two people can accomplish so much more together and also support each other through life\u2019s ups and downs.While I do not know much about reality TV, there was also this touching letter submitted by the child of a single mother, who wrote: \u201cI\u2019d like to submit an application for my mom, like friends and family can do for participants on \u2018The Bachelor.\u2019\u201dAnd I appreciated the sentiment and style of the woman who wrote this: \u201cI have this image of queues of hopeful women at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. Single mothers, elegant divorc\u00e9es, spinster aunts, bored housewives, daughters, wilting violets \u2026 all in anxious anticipation as to whether the shoe will fit, fit them alone, that the prince from the fairy tale is meant for them. That they are the right person.\u201dI couldn\u2019t digest any of these messages at the time, but I have since found solace and even laughter in many of them. One thing I have come to understand, though, is what a gift Amy gave me by emphasizing that I had a long life to fill with joy, happiness and love. Her edict to fill my own empty space with a new story has given me permission to make the most out of my remaining time on this planet.If I can convey a message I have learned from this bestowal, it would be this: Talk with your mate, your children and other loved ones about what you want for them when you are gone. By doing this, you give them liberty to live a full life and eventually find meaning again. There will be so much pain, and they will think of you daily. But they will carry on and make a new future, knowing you gave them permission and even encouragement to do so.I want more time with Amy. I want more time picnicking and listening to music at Millennium Park. I want more Shabbat dinners with the five of us Rosies (as we Rosenthals are referred to by our family). I would even gladly put up with Amy taking as much time as she wants to say goodbye to everyone at our family gatherings, as she always used to do, even after we had been there for hours, had a long drive home ahead of us and likely would see them again in a few days.I wish I had more of all of those things, just as Amy had wished for more. But more wasn\u2019t going to happen for her or us. Instead, as she described, we followed Plan \u201cBe,\u201d which was about being present in our lives because time was running short. So we did our best to live in the moment until we had no more moments left.The cruelest irony of my life is that it took me losing my best friend, my wife of 26 years and the mother of my three children, to truly appreciate each and every day. I know that sounds like a clich\u00e9, and it is, but it\u2019s true.I am now aware, in a way I wish I never had to learn, that loss is loss is loss, whether it\u2019s a divorce, losing a job, having a beloved pet die or enduring the death of a family member. In that respect, I am no different. But my wife gave me a gift at the end of her column when she left me that empty space, one I would like to offer you. A blank space to fill. The freedom and permission to write your own story. Humbly, Jason Jason B. Rosenthal, who lives in Chicago, is the co-author of the forthcoming picture book \u201cDear Boy,\u201d written with his daughter Paris.Advertisement"}

Alibaba and Facebook have done the same in recent days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has returned to record territory, up 8 percent since the end of April. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Bug Changed Privacy Settings of Up to 14 Million Users", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook has been fighting for months the perception that it did not do enough to protect people\u2019s privacy. On Thursday, the company said it had again failed to keep the information of millions of users private.As many as 14 million Facebook users who thought they were creating private posts last month that only a small group of friends could see were, in fact, making public posts that anyone could view.Facebook blamed a software bug for the problem. The company did not say how it had found the bug, or how it knew the problem was limited to 14 million people.In a statement, Facebook said the bug affected users from May 18 to May 22, while the company was testing a new feature. By May 27, the company had changed the affected posts from a public setting back to a private one.In the last few months, Facebook executives have repeatedly been forced to apologize to users for failing to protect their privacy.Norman Sadeh, co-director of Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Privacy Engineering Program, said that although Facebook survived temporary losses of trust from the public in the past, the recent scandals appeared to be taking their toll on the social media company.In response to the problems, the company has added a number of new privacy controls, as well as a centralized page for privacy and security settings. Mr. Sadeh said the new settings were still confusing.One of Facebook\u2019s key privacy features is that it lets people decide an audience for their posts. Someone can, for example, share a post with only a limited group of family and friends, or decide to make a post public so that anyone, including people not logged on to Facebook, can see it.It was unclear if users could have done anything to their settings to prevent being affected by the bug the company revealed on Thursday.Until Facebook and other companies improve their approach to privacy and develop settings that are easier to use and more aligned with what users want, \u201cpeople should probably refrain from sharing too much sensitive information with these platforms,\u201d Mr. Sadeh said.Advertisement"}

When I wrote him there, another auto-reply informed me that he had moved on. I couldn\u2019t find him on Facebook or Twitter. The man seemed to have vanished.When I finally found a working number for him, he was reluctant to talk. Three years ago, his life was overturned by an online mob that accused him of murder. The fact that the mob\u2019s outrage was driven by ignorance didn\u2019t make it any less frightening.It wasn\u2019t until the public realized that Dr. Filardi had \u201ccollected\u201d the bird \u2014 killing it for the museum\u2019s research collection \u2014 that the adulation turned to venom.Colleen O\u2019Brien, a director at PETA, condemned it as \u201cperverse, cruel and the sort of act that has led to the extinction of other animals who were also viewed as \u2018specimens.\u2019\u201d All that was needed to document the bird, she argued, was \u201ccompassion, awe and a camera, not disregard and a death warrant.\u201dWhile Dr. Filardi was still on the mountain, almost entirely off the grid, the rage spread. Tens of thousands of people signed petitions that condemned his actions, and thousands more signed a petition calling for him to be fired, or even jailed.The museum frantically tried to reach him. People were trying to hack into his Facebook account, which was quickly disabled. The pages of his children were targeted. His wife began receiving phone calls with death threats, at all hours of the night. A petition that stated, \u201cChris Filardi is a disgrace and frankly does not deserve to breathe another breath,\u201d was signed by 3,798 people.He descended from the mountaintop into an inferno of hate. \u201cIf they wanted to make me feel horrible and more than a little frightened for my family or welfare,\u201d he told me, his voice strained, \u201cit worked.\u201dWhen he returned to the museum in New York, police officers told him to \u201cbe conscious\u201d of how he entered it, never walking in the front door with the rest of the public, but using a back door instead.Still, Dr. Filardi wanted to engage, if only to defend his field and the museum, which he had been visiting since his childhood. \u201cI felt like a failed ambassador of the natural sciences,\u201d he told me.His essay received over 900 comments, the most up-voted of which called him a murderer.The mustached kingfisher was not gathered for public display, as a \u201ctrophy,\u201d as many claimed. It resides in a carefully maintained part of the museum dedicated to research alongside nearly a million other ornithological specimens, none of which spawned death threats.The collections almost certainly hold answers to questions that researchers haven\u2019t yet thought to pose about the changes happening to our planet. And in this age of the Sixth Extinction, the collections are becoming even more vital.When I asked Dr. Filardi whether he could have obtained what he needed for research by simply plucking a feather \u2014 a suggestion made by many online \u2014 he bristled. \u201cAll a feather gets you is DNA, and that\u2019s not a magic wand!\u201d With the specimen, though, \u201cwe have RNA, a skeleton, gonads, tissues in cryogenic storage.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIn 100 years, there\u2019s going to be all sorts of ways to utilize this that we don\u2019t even know yet.\u201dIn the end, it was Dr. Filardi\u2019s children \u2014 who had grown up in the age of cyberbullying \u2014 who reassured him that the online threats were unlikely to translate into real-world violence. They helped him understand what he described as \u201cthe nameless ease with which people can violently assault and denigrate, to feed a sense of righteousness\u201d before moving on to their next digital target.Nine months after he discovered the mustached kingfisher, Dr. Filardi left the American Museum of Natural History. He told me that he was worried about doing damage to an institution that he loved \u2014 people were threatening to pull donations \u2014 but that he was not pushed out. He still collaborates with the museum and with Conservation International, and has just returned to the Solomon Islands with a new organization.Before he left for the islands, he told me he was \u201cnot bitter\u201d about what had happened.\u201cI understand and empathize with the challenge of confronting the taking of another life to feed the intellect of humans,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to give people the benefit of the doubt.\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t help but be outraged on his behalf that people claiming to act in wildlife\u2019s name had ruthlessly harassed someone who had done more than most of us to understand and protect the natural world. And I worried about the effect of that harassment on other scientists in his field.Van Remsen, the curator of birds at Louisiana State University\u2019s Museum of Natural Science, told me that the Filardi affair hasn\u2019t changed his mind about the importance of collecting. \u201cAlmost every kingfisher that has ever lived has suffered a more painful death than the one Filardi collected, either being eaten alive by a predator or from the inside by a disease,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we thought for a second that what we were doing is wrong in terms of hurting populations, we wouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201dBut it has led him \u2014 and many other ornithologists with whom I spoke, almost all of whom asked me not to use their names \u2014 to be extremely cautious about attracting any kind of attention. Many research expeditions are no longer being publicized; in some cases, there is a total blackout on media. As a result, the public will grow even less informed about the importance of this research.Advertisement"}

That same day, a resident sent an Oakland police officer footage from a home security camera that showed Mr. Moore ringing a doorbell. And when Mr. Moore returned to the area last week for more inspections, a resident confronted him with a cellphone camera and demanded to see his identification.\u201cPeople need to know that minorities are treated differently in this country,\u201d Megan Bryan, an Oakland firefighter who works with Mr. Moore at Fire Station 24, said Tuesday.\u201cI\u2019ve never had anyone wonder what I\u2019m doing in their yard,\u201d said Ms. Bryan, who is white. \u201cBut with Kevin, it\u2019s a different attitude. They are suspicious.\u201d\u201cRecent events in Oakland and around the country demonstrate that implicit bias and overt racism persist and cause great harm to our communities of color,\u201d Sabrina Landreth, the city administrator, wrote. \u201cNow more than ever we need to treat each other with kindness, dignity, and respect; stand up for injustice; speak out for what\u2019s right; and support each other and our community.\u201dThe Oakland Black Firefighters Association planned to send an email to its members on Tuesday. Damon Covington, the group\u2019s president and a Fire Department captain, said he hoped what happened with Mr. Moore would lead to a conversation in the city about biases and the treatment of others.\u201cIt\u2019s a teaching moment and reminder that everyone should be treated with fairness, dignity and respect,\u201d Mr. Covington said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be profiled because the Fire Department is always there to help and help you save your home in the event of a wildfire.\u201dMr. Moore, who has worked with the Fire Department for 12 years, did not respond to repeated requests for interviews. Mr. Covington and Ms. Bryan said he told them this week that he did not want to speak with the media.The area is cut off from the rest of Oakland in other ways, too. About two-thirds of the people who live there are white, compared with about a quarter of all Oakland residents. The median income for residents there is about double that of the citywide number, according to the census.As more people move into the wooded areas, the potential for another wildfire to turn catastrophic remains a chief concern. With that in mind, Oakland firefighters head into the hills this time of year to look for potential hazards.Before they arrive, the Fire Department sends fliers to residents reminding them to clear brush from around their homes, remove fallen limbs from their roofs and create a 100-foot perimeter free of anything that could feed a fire. They are told exactly when firefighters will be on their street for inspections.On May 16, a team of four firefighters from Station 24 \u2014 Mr. Moore, Ms. Bryan and two other white firefighters \u2014 drove a fire truck into the Merriewood section of Oakland for inspections. They split up the work, each firefighter assigned to one block.Soon after, Ms. Bryan said on Tuesday, she heard a 911 dispatcher over her department radio. A resident had spotted Mr. Moore, who was wearing blue wool pants and a jacket and hat that said Oakland Fire Department. The resident did not believe he was a firefighter and reported him to the police, Ms. Bryan said.\u201cI knew Kevin was on that street,\u201d said Ms. Bryan, who told the dispatcher that the person who had been reported was actually a firefighter. \u201cThey know what we are doing with our inspections. They know we are coming.\u201dLater that day, another resident sent home security footage to a police officer, who forwarded it to the supervisor of the Fire Department\u2019s inspection team.

{"Headline": "How the Ice Age Shaped New York", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "Long ago, the region lay under an ice sheet thousands of feet thick. It terminated abruptly in what are now the boroughs, leaving the city with a unique landscape.Supported byAt its southern edge, the vast body deposited tons of rocky debris \u2014 from sand and pebbles to boulders the size of school buses. Then, some 18,000 years ago, the planet began to warm and the gargantuan sheet of ice began to melt and retreat.Today, the southernmost edge of that frozen expanse is marked by a line of rubble that extends across the northern United States for thousands of miles. The largest deposits form what geologists call a terminal moraine. The intermittent ridge runs from Puget Sound to the Missouri River to Montauk Point on Long Island, forming the prominence that supports its old lighthouse. The ancient sheet of ice also left its mark on a very modern phenomenon: New York City. The ice over Manhattan would have buried even the tallest skyscraper and was so heavy that it depressed the underlying bedrock. As it melted, giant boulders embedded deep within its flanks landed throughout what became the city. Many are still visible in Central Park, unlikely obelisks scored by time. But the island was the last hurrah, and the mammoth sheet of ice ended immediately to the south, in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. The terminal moraine, the mounds of rubble left behind, form much of their high ground. While the line of glacial debris across the northern United States is often poorly delineated, the hilly ridge around New York City tends to be quite prominent. Its maximum height is roughly 200 feet, about that of a tall apartment building.Eventually, the neglected parcels became strings of parks, cemeteries, golf courses and, in time, some of the region\u2019s most attractive neighborhoods, often heavily landscaped and densely wooded.Many city neighborhoods take their names from the ridge\u2019s elevations, as well as its leafy embellishments: Glen Oaks, Hollis Hills, Jamaica Hills, Briarwood, Forest Hills, Ridgewood, Cypress Hills, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, Greenwood, Bay Ridge, Lighthouse Hill and Arden Heights.Why should remnants of the last ice age be so prominent in New York City, of all places? It started long ago as the continental ice sheet developed one of its thickest regions over what is now eastern Canada. Vast fields of ice are incredibly weighty. Gravity pushes down hard. Any tilt or slant of the underlying terrain sends the ice moving slowly downslope.For ages, the Canadian ice kept flowing into a long valley to the south that ran from the Lake Champlain area down through the Hudson River gorge. It was a reliable conduit. The river of ice and rock kept moving relentlessly southward until it hit a region warm enough to halt its slow advance.In recent times, the resulting moraine got much scrutiny from scientists because of its proximity to one of the nation\u2019s first big cities. Just as early maps of the United States often focused on New York, so did geologic inquiries \u2014 starting nearly two centuries ago.Despite the ridge\u2019s prominence and early allure for scientists, it turned out to be no rival for skyscrapers and urban distractions. The moraine that shaped the city was all but forgotten. \u201cIt makes it much easier to see,\u201d he said recently, while gazing at the ridge from the Staten Island Ferry.Mr. Horenstein, 81, sought to deepen the re-examination by sharing with The Times a vast trove he had assembled of scientific studies, official reports, news clippings, magazine articles and old books that mention or profile the city\u2019s glacial relic.His collection also sheds light on how moraine study in general helped geologists in New York and elsewhere discover that the planet had experienced a series of ice ages. That breakthrough came in the mid 1800s.Ridges, mountains and even flatlands are typically rooted in rocky strata, such as the bedrock that underlies Manhattan and makes it ideal for erecting skyscrapers. But early investigators found the hilly ridges to be composed of clay, silt, sand, pebbles, cobbles and boulders, all jumbled up together.A related clue was that nearby rocks often looked quite smooth, even polished. At times, their faces also displayed parallel lines of groves and striations.By the 1860s, a growing body of evidence had convinced most scientists that the Earth had endured ages in which rivers of ice transported rocks and coarse sediments over long distances \u2014 at times, it turned out, for hundreds of miles. The accompanying report said the rise exhibited strings of \u201chillocks and hollows, or interrupted ridges and troughs.\u201d It noted that some depressions held ponds, marshes and small lakes. The report put the feature\u2019s overall width at up to two miles.At Umpire Rock in Central Park, overlooking baseball fields, the geologist noted places where glacial ice and rubble had carved massive grooves, wider than a human body.Yet the rock\u2019s overall surface was quite smooth. The reason, Mr. Horenstein said, was that ages of glacial abrasion had acted like sandpaper. \u201cKids can slide down the rocks,\u201d he said of many Central Park outcroppings.\u201cThey\u2019re rounded,\u201d Mr. Horenstein said, because rivers of ice kept \u201cdragging them around.\u201d Later, on a visit to Staten Island, he pointed to the much-celebrated skyline of Lower Manhattan. Current estimates put the ice\u2019s thickness there at roughly twice the early calculations \u2014 not 1,000 feet, but closer to 2,000 feet, and possibly more.\u201cIt was taller than any building,\u201d Mr. Horenstein remarked, \u201ceven the Freedom Tower.\u201d The skyscraper at the very top of its spire measures 1,776 feet high, after the nation\u2019s birthday. The forward edges of glaciers can be inclined or sheer, like a cliff. Mr. Horenstein said geologists believe the local face was sheer. Its precipitous edge shed not only tons of rocky debris but gargantuan blocks of ice.At Fort Wadsworth, a historic battlement next to the Verrazano Bridge, we stood atop the moraine and looked across the Narrows, the strait between Staten Island and Brooklyn. The land that would become the two boroughs had originally been connected by the glacial ridge.What fraction came from the glacial ridge?\u201cAll of them,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was the local building material.\u201dIn all of New York City, \u201cthis is the only place you can see the moraine clearly,\u201d Mr. Horenstein said, leaning into the wind. \u201cThis is it, the southernmost end.\u201dMr. Horenstein held up a rounded stone. Somehow, it ended up in reporter\u2019s backpack as a souvenir of the day.Remarkably, millions of people live on or near the glacial ridge.In all, it runs for roughly 30 miles beneath New York City. Invisibly, it links three boroughs, offering mute testimony to the power of vanished ice.If the ridge is lost history to most of the city\u2019s inhabitants, at least one knows something about the art of bringing it back to life.\u201cIt keeps me young,\u201d Mr. Horenstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something to see, something you missed, something new.\u201d Advertisement"}

So I\u2019m grateful to Jaron Lanier for redistributing blame on the lumpen-user, for pressing the public to flee social media. He writes, \u201cIf you\u2019re not part of the solution, there will be no solution.\u201dHis latest manifesto, \u201cTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\u201d is, alas, less polished. It makes important arguments, but Lanier has pressed many of them several times before. While Lanier has shown a capacity for wit, this book is hokey. He\u2019s enthralled by his coinage of the acronym \u201cBUMMER,\u201d which stands for \u201cBehaviors of Users Modified, and Made Into an Empire for Rent.\u201d Instead of slamming Facebook and Google by name, he endlessly refers to them as \u201cBUMMER\u201d companies. There\u2019s a laziness to his polemic: a lack of examples, arguments that unfold much too quickly to gather their full powers of persuasion, writing that chokes on excessive metaphor. Over the course of three pages, he uses lead paint, climate change and crude oil to describe the workings of the BUMMER machine.Many of his criticisms of social media will feel familiar to distant observers of American politics. Twitter and Facebook have made us cruder, less empathetic, more tribal. Only at the very end does Lanier venture into new territory. His argument, however, is a profound one. He worries that our reliance on big tech companies is ruining our capacity for spirituality, by turning us into robotic extensions of their machines. The companies, he argues, have no appreciation for the \u201cmystical spark inside you.\u201d They don\u2019t understand the magic of human consciousness and, therefore, will recklessly destroy it.Whatever the flaws of this short manifesto, Lanier shows the tactical value of appealing to the conscience of the individual.

{"Headline": "Facebook Gave Data Access to Chinese Firm Flagged by U.S. Intelligence", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has data-sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese electronics companies, including a manufacturing giant that has a close relationship with China\u2019s government, the social media company said on Tuesday.The agreements, which date to at least 2010, gave private access to some user data to Huawei, a telecommunications equipment company that has been flagged by American intelligence officials as a national security threat, as well as to Lenovo, Oppo and TCL.The four partnerships remain in effect, but Facebook officials said in an interview that the company would wind down the Huawei deal by the end of the week.The deals were part of an effort to push more mobile users onto the social network starting in 2007, before stand-alone Facebook apps worked well on phones. The agreements allowed device makers to offer some Facebook features, such as address books, \u201clike\u201d buttons and status updates.Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends \u2014 including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.Huawei used its private access to feed a \u201csocial phone\u201d app that let users view messages and social media accounts in one place, according to the officials.Facebook representatives said the data shared with Huawei stayed on its phones, not the company\u2019s servers.Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who leads the Commerce Committee, has demanded that Facebook provide Congress with details about its data partnerships. \u201cFacebook is learning hard lessons that meaningful transparency is a high standard to meet,\u201d Mr. Thune said.His committee also oversees the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Facebook to determine whether the company\u2019s data policies violate a 2011 consent decree with the commission.\u201cI look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that information about their users was not sent to Chinese servers,\u201d said Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\u201cAll Facebook\u2019s integrations with Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL were controlled from the get-go \u2014 and Facebook approved everything that was built,\u201d said Francisco Varela, a Facebook vice president. \u201cGiven the interest from Congress, we wanted to make clear that all the information from these integrations with Huawei was stored on the device, not on Huawei\u2019s servers.\u201dBanned in China since 2009, Facebook in recent years has quietly sought to re-establish itself there. The company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has tried to cultivate a relationship with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and put in an appearance at one of the country\u2019s top universities.Still, Facebook has struggled to gain momentum, and in January an executive in charge of courting China\u2019s government left after spending three years on a charm campaign to get the social media service back in the country.None of the Chinese device makers who have partnerships with Facebook responded to requests for comment on Tuesday.Huawei, one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world, is a point of national pride for China and is at the vanguard of the country\u2019s efforts to expand its influence abroad. The company was the recipient of billions of dollars in lines of credit from China\u2019s state-owned policy banks, helping to fuel its overseas expansion in Africa, Europe and Latin America. Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, is a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army.United States officials are investigating whether Huawei broke American trade controls by dealing with Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. The Trump administration has taken aim at Huawei and its rival ZTE in recent weeks, and in April the Federal Communications Commission advanced a plan to bar federally subsidized telecom companies from using suppliers that are considered national security threats.Facebook has not entered into a data-sharing agreement with ZTE, officials at the social network said.TCL, a consumer electronics firm, has accused the Trump administration of bias against Chinese companies and last June dropped a bid to buy a San Diego-based company that makes routers and other hardware.Lenovo, a maker of computers and other devices, recently shelved ambitions to acquire BlackBerry after the Canadian government signaled that such a deal could compromise national security.Nicholas Confessore, Michael Forsythe and Paul Mozur contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But many advertisers, including small businesses and news organizations, are complaining that Facebook\u2019s detection system has mistakenly miscategorized their ads as political. All ads that have political content \u2014 including the miscategorized ones and ads that are taken down after running \u2014 are included in the public database.Michelle Benson, who runs a children\u2019s day care center in Shirley, N.Y., tried to spend $100 to circulate an ad on Wednesday. The ad said that she had openings for more children this summer. \u201cI will beat anyone\u2019s rates and accommodate parents according to their schedule,\u201d it read.The ad contained no reference to any political candidate or issue. But Ms. Benson received a notification from Facebook that her ad had been rejected because she was not \u201cauthorized to run ads with political content.\u201dA similar thing happened to Jamila Zaidi, who manages a hair salon in Frederick, Md. Ms. Zaidi was surprised when her Facebook ad for a store special \u2014 \u201c$100 for a full highlight or color service for all new clients!\u201d \u2014 was deemed an unlabeled political ad.The Wild Cow, a vegetarian restaurant in Nashville, felt the effects of the new policy as well, when Facebook took down an ad for a fund-raising show the restaurant was hosting for a local dog rescue group. The ad included information about the show along with a photo of a handsome pit bull.\u201cI was wondering why that didn\u2019t get approved,\u201d Melanie Cochran, the Wild Cow\u2019s co-owner, said when a reporter told her that the ad had appeared in Facebook\u2019s political ad archive. \u201cI assumed it had to do with the picture.\u201dRob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product management, said that in all three of these cases, the company\u2019s review process had simply not worked as intended.\u201cThese ads were mistakenly marked as political, and those decisions have been overturned,\u201d Mr. Leathern said. \u201cThese are new policies, and it\u2019s not going to be perfect at the start.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe think it\u2019s better than doing nothing at all.\u201dThe flagged ads were not part of large or lucrative campaigns, but they illustrate a growing problem for Facebook, which has said it is trying to safeguard elections around the world while not disturbing its hugely profitable advertising business, which generated $40 billion in revenue last year.Facebook\u2019s new review system uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human reviewers to determine if an ad is political in nature. The company said it looks at text and images in the post itself, as well as the ad\u2019s target audience and other attributes, to make a determination.Ads flagged as political are kept offline until the advertiser goes through the verification process, which can take several days. It requires the advertiser to submit a photo identification, the last four digits of his or her Social Security number, and a code that is sent in the mail.\u201cWe believe that these tools, which make our mistakes very visible, are working,\u201d Mr. Leathern said.The new ad policies have been especially contentious within the news industry. Facebook has angered publishers by classifying some opinion columns and news articles \u2014 including some about issues like immigration \u2014 as political content. When publishers pay to raise the visibility of those columns and articles on Facebook, they have been held to the same standards as campaign ads and other partisan posts.\u201cHi there, @facebook. This is not political content. This is journalistic content that deals with policy. There\u2019s a difference,\u201d the organization wrote on Twitter.\u201cNews and advocacy are different, and we\u2019ll be showing them separately in the transparency archive \u2014 but we flag both to prevent workarounds for bad actors,\u201d Mr. Goldman wrote.Some advertisers are being more patient, perhaps seeing a glitchy advertising filter as better than none at all.Patagonia, the outdoor clothing company, has seen several of its Facebook ads rejected for mysterious reasons. Still, Scott Carrington, Patagonia\u2019s digital and social media marketing manager, seemed to forgive the mistakes.\u201cWhile Facebook has more work to do to improve transparency among its users and advertisers, we applaud the steps the company is taking to prevent Russian bots from running and ruining our democracy,\u201d Mr. Carrington said.Advertisement"}

Lech was on a trip to Peru and Argentina. A volcanic eruption in Iceland had slowed his return. He even printed fake newspaper articles chronicling the fake journey, which a former associate saved and showed to The New York Times.Only after Lech was buried and his mother had recovered did Jaroslaw Kaczynski tell her what had really happened.\u201cThere were moments that I wanted to believe those stories myself,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski said in a rare interview the year after the crash. \u201cThat Lech was alive.\u201dIt is also part of a broader pattern in Central and Eastern Europe, where Mr. Kaczynski has formed an alliance with Hungary and its populist leader, Victor Orban. Their nationalist rhetoric has found emulators in neighboring countries.When Europe\u2019s leaders gather in Brussels this month to discuss whether Poland should be penalized for changes to its judicial system that many experts say undermine the rule of law, other nations will be watching closely. Failure to take action, critics worry, may embolden nations like Slovakia and Romania that are flirting with their own brands of \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201dWhat complicates the situation further is Mr. Kaczynski, and how he has blended the personal with the political. From the moment of his brother\u2019s death, he has nurtured a mythology of martyrdom and aggrieved nationalism around the Smolensk crash, using the tragedy as a narrative to try to reshape Polish identity, even as two independent inquiries placed blame on bad weather and human error.The government has opened a new investigation and hauled up political enemies for questioning \u2014 even as his party is tightening its grip on the judiciary. His critics say he is using Smolensk as a pretense to arrest political enemies before elections in 2020. Others wonder if he is simply gripped by anguish, vengeance and paranoia, and is dragging his country along with him.Or, perhaps, it is both.\u201cIt is impossible to overestimate the significance of the Smolensk crash in the life of Jaroslaw Kaczynski \u2014 and in the life of Polish politics in general,\u201d said Marek Migalski, who ran for the European Parliament as a Law and Justice candidate in 2010 and is now a lecturer at the University of Silesia in Katowice. \u201cFor Kaczynski,\u201d he added, \u201cpublic debate is no longer a political one \u2014 between people of different values; it\u2019s an eschatological war between good and evil.\u201dFor years, Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s party has pointed to a host of possible devious scenarios \u2014 a thermobaric bomb that blew up the plane without leaving evidence; assassins using artificial fog to obscure the runway. But the heart of the narrative boils down to two basic unproven accusations: The Russians did it, and Polish political opponents of Mr. Kaczynski deliberately conducted an inadequate investigation to cover up their own negligence.A few weeks ago, tens of thousands of supporters gathered in Pilsudski Square in Warsaw to commemorate the eighth anniversary of the crash. A new monument to the 96 people killed in the crash was unveiled \u2014 a block of solid black granite, with 18 stairs carved into the stone, a symbol of both the stairs leading onto the plane and of a stairway to heaven.The anniversary came and went with no new details made public.The faithful, however, remained unshaken.\u201cI know you\u2019re afraid of the truth, but do not wipe your treacherous mugs with my late brother\u2019s name,\u201d he said, banging his hand on the podium. \u201cYou destroyed him! You murdered him! You are scoundrels!\u201dIt was a rare public outburst from a man who apparently prefers to wield power from behind the scenes. He holds a seat in Parliament but is neither prime minister nor president. He does not use email, or carry his own mobile phone or wallet. He rarely holds anything resembling a news conference and gets most of his news filtered through aides.He has never married, has no children and lives alone with his cat. Yet, as leader of the Law and Justice Party, his power is unquestioned. If he thinks a law needs to be passed, it is usually passed. His control is not total \u2014 there are factions even within his party that he must contend with \u2014 but it is sweeping, according to friends and foes alike.For more than a month after Mr. Kaczynski went to the hospital to have knee surgery on May 5, much of the nation\u2019s pressing business was conducted by his bedside. He recently left the hospital, but his prolonged absence from the public stage raised questions about the direction his party and country will take when he leaves.Of the two, Lech grew to be the more outgoing, public figure, while Jaroslaw was regarded as brilliant but also mercurial, largely keeping his own counsel.No one doubts Jaroslaw\u2019s grief over his brother\u2019s death. On the day of the crash, Lech Kaczynski was flying to visit a memorial in the Katyn Forest, a place haunted by history, killing grounds where more than 20,000 Poles were slaughtered by Red Army soldiers in the early days of World War II, a crime that the former Soviet Union long denied and outlawed Poles from discussing.In the plane crash, Lech died along with the top ranks of the Polish military and members of Parliament.But whether Mr. Kaczynski truly believes the conspiracy theories that he promotes is harder to know.Joanna Kluzik-Rostkowska, who served as Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s campaign manager in 2010, spent nearly every day with him immediately after the crash.\u201cThe first thing he said to me, unasked, was: \u2018Don\u2019t think for even a second that I believe this business about it being an assassination,\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Kluzik-Rostkowska, who is now aligned with the political opposition.She says she does not know what he truly thinks anymore, even as the question has taken on far greater significance.Mr. Migalski, another former ally, does not have a definitive answer either. \u201cDoes Jaroslaw really believe the Russians assassinated his twin brother?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf he truly believes that, then Poland is in great danger. Because if there was a crime there must be a punishment.\u201dThe government is moving to settle scores. Bronislaw Komorowski, who became acting president after the plane crash, was summoned to the prosecutor\u2019s office the week of this year\u2019s anniversary and asked about government negligence in the investigation.Donald Tusk, who was Poland\u2019s prime minister at the time of the crash, has been repeatedly summoned for questioning in two separate Smolensk investigations, most recently in the trial of his former chief of staff, Tomasz Arabski.Mr. Arabski and four other government officials who played roles in organizing the trip are facing charges of negligence. If Mr. Arabski is convicted, it could pave the way for prosecuting Mr. Tusk, who is currently the president of the European Council, which represents the leaders of the European Union. Mr. Tusk is widely expected to be the main rival of Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s party in the 2020 presidential elections in Poland.\u201cOne of the reasons Kaczynski is so eager to commandeer the Polish judiciary may be that he wants to use it against Donald Tusk,\u201d said Marcin Matczak, a law professor at Warsaw University.Indeed, many say that Mr. Kaczynski is trying to use the Smolensk crash to reshape historical memory, placing his dead brother at the center of the country\u2019s hard march to freedom, and himself as the guiding force leading it into its next chapter, what he calls the Fourth Republic.Behind the conspiracy theories is a deeply held belief of Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s that when Poland first emerged from Communist rule to form its Third Republic, it did not properly cast out all those who had helped the Communists keep their grip on power.Those people, in his view, still infect the system.Mr. Walesa has posted messages on Facebook condemning the spread of Smolensk monuments, and he was going to take part in protests last summer at one of the monthly marches that were held to mark the crash.But in response to growing demonstrations against the marches and the politicization of the tragedy, the government passed a law limiting where protesters could gather \u2014 a law widely criticized as undemocratic \u2014 and added hundreds of police officers to the route of future marches.He claims it was his twin brother, Lech Kaczynski \u2014 not Lech Walesa \u2014 who was the real leader of Solidarity.For outside observers, the different views on Smolensk reveal how Poland, once a pillar and paragon in the defense of democracy, has become a land divided.Graffiti in a bar in Warsaw summed up the debate: \u201cSmolensk \u2014 lesson, tragedy, or the first Polish fake news.\u201dJoanna Berendt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protests Across U.S. Call for End to Migrant Family Separations", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Protesters marched into Lafayette Square opposite the White House on Saturday and chanted \u201cfamilies belong together\u201d to counter President Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy, and were joined in declaring that message by dozens of other rallies from New York to California. While the occupant of the White House was away for the weekend at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club, images of the rallies were broadcast by cable news networks throughout the day.Animated by what they view as the cruel treatment of migrants seeking refuge in the United States from violence in their home countries, the crowds turned out Saturday bearing homemade signs that read \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d \u2014 the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency \u2014 and \u201cZero tolerance for family separation.\u201dFor two sisters, Claudia Thomas and Monica Escobar, the sight of immigrant children being taken from their parents hit close to home. When they were young, they immigrated to the United States from Guatemala, one of several Central American countries that is a source of migrants today. They said they were out at Saturday\u2019s protest in the nation\u2019s capital to stand up for \u201chuman decency.\u201d\u201cNo human being should be going through what they\u2019re going through,\u201d Ms. Escobar said. \u201cGod bless those families.\u201dWhile Washington was the political epicenter of the protests, similar scenes unfolded in cities around the country, including large, border cities like El Paso, state capitals like Salt Lake City and Atlanta, and smaller, interior towns like Redding, Calif. In total, organizers anticipated more than 700 protests, in all 50 states and even internationally.The protests were largely peaceful, though there were a few arrests.In Huntsville, Ala., police said one man was arrested after he got into a scuffle with protesters and pulled out a handgun; no one was injured. In Columbus, Ohio, one person was arrested on a charge of obstructing official business, police said. And the Dallas Police Department said five people were arrested during a protest outside of an ICE building.Otherwise, the protests caused few disturbances as demonstrators descended on statehouses and Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings, and gathered in plazas and in parks, where they danced, chanted and sang. Many clutched signs in one hand with messages berating Mr. Trump and his immigration policies. And, given the summer heat, many clutched water bottles in the other hand, as they sweltered under temperatures that across much of the United States crept into the 90s.In Chicago, all police stations, fire departments and hospitals opened as cooling stations, and in Washington fire trucks misted attendees with water, to cheers.Celebrities like Kerry Washington, star of the hit ABC series \u201cScandal,\u201d and the comedian Amy Schumer joined the protests in New York, and politicians like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, joined the demonstration in Boston. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of \u201cHamilton,\u201d and Alicia Keys, the singer, songwriter and pianist, performed in Washington.\u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation where we\u2019re replacing baby jails with family camps,\u201d said Karthik Ganapathy, a spokesman for MoveOn, a progressive advocacy organization that helped organize the protest.The Washington rally was in many ways a festive affair, a moment of unification under a scorching sun. One protester arrived dressed as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; another wore a shirt saying \u201cIt\u2019s Mueller time,\u201d a reference to the special counsel leading the inquiry into Russian meddling in the election.Adam Unger, a local software engineer, wore a five-gallon bucket turned into a drum, with a felt covering depicting an American flag with the insignia of the Rebel Alliance from \u201cStar Wars\u201d replacing the stars. \u201cThis drum has gotten its use over the last year and a half,\u201d Mr. Unger said. He first used it to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries when it was announced in January 2017.\u201cThe idea of kids in cages and asylum seekers in prisons and moms being separated from breast-feeding children, this is just beyond politics, it really is just about right and wrong,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington State. On Thursday, she was arrested with more than 500 other women who occupied a Senate office building as part of a Women\u2019s March protest against Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy.Ms. Jayapal said she has visited a federal prison just south of Seattle and met with 174 women and several dozen men who had been transferred from the Texas border. She said she was moved by the stories of asylum seekers and parents \u2014 stories of family members killed, of children left behind, of violent physical attacks and domestic abuse.\u201cI promised them that I would get their stories out and I promised them I would do everything I could to reunite their families,\u201d Ms. Jayapal said.In New York, protesters overflowed Foley Square in Lower Manhattan and filled the surrounding sidewalks. At every intersection on the way to the central march location, clusters of people chanted, \u201cWhen children are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!\u201dCrowds also inched across the Brooklyn Bridge, a little more than a mile long, for more than two hours. On one side, in Brooklyn, protesters filed into Cadman Plaza, where people stood in the center or sat in the shade, displaying colorful signs and listening to speakers onstage.\u201cWe were walking by cars and all the people driving were honking, giving us the peace sign, shaking fists,\u201d said Laura Rittenhouse, who lives in Manhattan and walked across the bridge. \u201cThe most important question is what is the process to reunite these families?\u201d she asked.Carmela Huang, from Brooklyn, brought her two young children to the march. Both children were carrying rectangular cardboard signs they had made this morning that read \u201cREUNITE\u201d in large sharpie letters.Ms. Huang said they had not been to a protest yet in 2018. \u201cBut today feels really important,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my head in the sand, just feeling tremendously sad.\u201d She described the march as \u201creassuring, energizing and rejuvenating.\u201dSome protesters carried rainbow umbrellas and blew bubbles, while a trombone player accented chants of activists.Sadatu Mamah-Trawill, a community organizer with the group African Communities Together, brought her 9-year-old son to the protest. A Muslim woman, Ms. Mamah-Trawill said she still had family in Ghana, her place of birth, and could not imagine being separated from her children.\u201cI\u2019m hoping our government hears us very clearly,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is big. I don\u2019t think anybody should miss it.\u201dA small group of mostly women and children rallied in Marquette, Mich., in one of the few counties in the state that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Silke-Maria Weineck, a German studies and comparative literature professor at the University of Michigan, dressed her service dog, Meemo, with an \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d sign for the occasion.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a conservative part of the country,\u201d she added, \u201cbut people feel very strongly about their children.\u201dOutside the Bedminster country club where Mr. Trump was spending the weekend, a few protesters could be seen. \u201cMy civility is locked in a cage,\u201d said one sign. \u201cReunite families now.\u201dAlexandra Yoon-Hendricks reported from Washington and Zoe Greenberg from New York.

{"Headline": "Arizona Man Left a Trail of 6 Bodies, Police Believe, Then Added His Own", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe killings in Arizona began Thursday afternoon, and they continued with alarming frequency.First there was Steven E. Pitt, a forensic psychiatrist known for his work on high-profile cases like the JonBenet Ramsey investigation. He was shot outside his office in northeast Phoenix.The next afternoon, Veleria Sharp, 48, a paralegal who had been shot, was seen stumbling down a street and begging for help. When the police followed a trail of blood back to the Scottsdale, Ariz., law firm where she worked, they found Laura Anderson, 49, another paralegal who had been shot. Both women died.Just hours later, Marshall Levine\u2019s girlfriend found him, a 72-year-old life coach and marriage counselor, dead of two gunshot wounds in his office. That brought the killings in this otherwise relaxed golf and spa hub to four.By then, ballistic evidence had convinced the authorities that the first two shootings were related. And at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday, they got the most important of more than 100 tips \u2014 one that would lead them to Dwight Lamon Jones, a man who had a connection to all of the deceased through a bitter divorce proceeding several years ago.By Monday morning they felt they had a solid case against Mr. Jones, 56, and they also knew where he was. The police arrived at an Extended Stay America hotel in Scottsdale and surreptitiously began to evacuate guests.Mr. Jones figured out what was happening and opened fire on the police. He did not strike any officers. Just after 8 a.m., he was discovered dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his room.But those were not the only killings.On Sunday, the police learned of the deaths of a man and a woman at a home in Fountain Hills, about 15 miles east of the other shootings. Though the police later said they had not explicitly linked the deaths of the two \u2014 Mary Simmons, 70, and Bryon Thomas, 72 \u2014 to Mr. Jones, they said he may have been in the area sometime before the bodies were discovered. That brought the killings they believe he carried out to six in about 96 hours.\u201cIn law enforcement, we don\u2019t have the benefit of saying we were successful when lives are lost,\u201d Sheriff Paul Penzone of Maricopa County said at a news conference, calling Mr. Jones\u2019s actions \u201cthe worst of humanity.\u201dAt the same news conference, Rich Slavin, an assistant chief with the Scottsdale Police Department, tied the first four deaths together. Mr. Jones, he said, had gone through \u201ca divorce situation\u201d eight or nine years ago, in which his now ex-wife, Connie Jones, had retained a lawyer at the firm where the paralegals were killed. As part of his divorce proceeding, Mr. Jones was also required to see Dr. Pitt; and his son was required to see a doctor who had used the office space Dr. Levine happened to be occupying the day Mr. Jones shot him.\u201cWe started to see that Mr. Jones was visiting them in an effort to right some wrong,\u201d Chief Slavin said, adding that the suspect had probably intended to kill Ms. Jones\u2019s lawyer.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t present in that law firm that day,\u201d Chief Slavin continued. \u201cUnfortunately, two employees were.\u201dIn a statement, Ms. Jones said she was \u201cdeeply saddened by the tragedy caused by my ex-husband,\u201d who she called \u201ca very emotionally disturbed person.\u201dShe also said her husband, a retired Phoenix police detective, recognized the connection between the divorce and the three crime scenes and he notified the police Saturday night, around the time the police say they got the crucial tip.\u201cPersonally, I have feared for my safety for the past nine years,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot express the emotions I feel for the innocent families touched by this senseless violence.\u201dChief Slavin said Mr. Jones had been arrested around 2008 or 2009 on domestic violence charges alleging that he mistreated his wife and a child. He also said Mr. Jones had been residing at Extended Stay hotels for the past nine years.Ms. Jones was far from the only person who was on edge over the past several days. The killings, which had not appeared to be random, worried those in the medical and legal professions and prompted the police to blanket Maricopa County with officers who provided security for people who may have been at risk.\u201cI personally fielded a lot of questions from those groups because they were concerned,\u201d Sgt. Ben Hoster of the Scottsdale Police Department said. Among their inquiries, he said: \u201cShould we go to work on Monday?\u201dAt a breakfast restaurant just steps away from the hotel where Mr. Jones shot himself, Peter Verros, the restaurant\u2019s owner, noted how uncommon violence was in the area.\u201cThis is a suburb,\u201d Mr. Verros, 40, said. \u201cYou\u2019re not used to something like this \u2014 a four-, six-person murder spree in Scottsdale? Holy cow!\u201dWhen asked Monday about the killer\u2019s motive, Chief Slavin said it was impossible to totally understand.\u201cTaking the lives of innocent people,\u201d Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams said, \u201cshould never make any sense.\u201dRebekah Zemansky contributed reporting from Scottsdale, Ariz.

{"Headline": "They\u2019re Not \u2018Mad Men\u2019 Anymore. But the Ad Business Is Still High Stakes.", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Once upon a time, everyday America was fascinated by the advertising business, in somewhat the way that the turkey is fascinated by the ax. It began in the 1930s and \u201940s, when sellers of consumer products and their ad agencies controlled the contents of the radio programming to which the nation listened. Comedians turned advertisers \u2014 and the denizens of Madison Avenue who worked for those brands \u2014 into grist for their mills. In \u201cA Word From Our Sponsor: Admen, Advertising, and the Golden Age of Radio,\u201d Cynthia B. Meyers recalls a joke from a Jack Benny show in 1948, a show sponsored by Lucky Strike: When Benny told his wife, Mary Livingstone, that he was calling the cigarette\u2019s ad agency, Batten Barton Durstine & Osborn, she replied, \u201cSounds like a trunk falling down stairs.\u201dElsewhere in popular culture, there were novels and movies \u2014 and novels made into movies \u2014 about the ad game and those who played it, among them \u201cTake a Letter, Darling,\u201d \u201cLaura,\u201d \u201cThe Hucksters,\u201d \u201cMr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,\u201d \u201cWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter?,\u201d \u201cLover Come Back,\u201d \u201cThe Thrill of It All,\u201d \u201cGood Neighbor Sam\u201d and \u201cThe Arrangement.\u201d On television, there was \u201cBewitched\u201d and, whenever characters in \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d were especially anxious to flee the rat race, Rod Serling made sure, in episodes like \u201cA Stop in Willoughby\u201d and \u201cWalking Distance,\u201d that they worked in advertising.The nonfiction best-seller lists were filled with ad books, from \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders\u201d and \u201cMadison Avenue, U.S.A.\u201d to \u201cConfessions of an Advertising Man\u201d and \u201cFrom Those Wonderful Folks Who Gave You Pearl Harbor: Front Line Dispatches From the Advertising War.\u201d And versions of TV commercial jingles \u2014 for products like Alka-Seltzer, Diet Pepsi and Coca-Cola \u2014 made the pop-music hit parade. (Fun fact: The original \u201cHit Parade\u201d was created by an ad agency, Lord & Thomas, for Lucky Strike.)This widespread infatuation with advertising appears, in retrospect, to have peaked around 1971 with the spot that inspired one of those hits, the \u201cHilltop\u201d commercial for Coke, a.k.a. \u201cI\u2019d Like to Teach the World to Sing.\u201d It\u2019s been downhill from there. For one thing, the process by which the professionals sell us soft drinks, soap and soup ceased to be a novelty. And the switch in the \u201970s from the \u201cbrought to you by\u201d sponsorship model of radio to the magazine-style, multiple-ad format of TV transformed advertisers from benign patrons into interruptive annoyances. Besides, other industries became shinier objects in the public\u2019s eye, particularly Wall Street and Silicon Valley.One could make the case that technology has assumed the place in the zeitgeist that advertising once occupied \u2014 and then some. The most recent TV series set in an ad agency, \u201cThe Crazy Ones,\u201d lasted a season; \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has been renewed for a sixth season. (Yes, there was \u201cMad Men,\u201d from 2007 to 2015, but one of its main accomplishments was to remind us that Madison Avenue meant more then than now.) There have been other efforts to rekindle the American appetite for all things advertising, but none has truly broken through.Now comes another attempt, from Ken Auletta, the prolific media reporter, critic and best-selling author, with \u201cFrenemies: The Epic Disruption of the Ad Business (and Everything Else).\u201d The title comes from a word popularized by Martin Sorrell, formerly the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising and marketing holding company; he started referring to Google as a \u201cfrenemy\u201d of WPP\u2019s in that they do business together (friend) at the same time they compete against each other (enemy). For those who wince at the characterization of the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon as \u201cfrenemies\u201d of the ad industry, be thankful; according to hbr.org, Sorrell also used the word \u201cfroes\u201d to describe that love-hate relationship.Sorrell is a principal figure in \u201cFrenemies,\u201d which seeks to rebuild interest in Madison Avenue by borrowing interest from Silicon Valley. It\u2019s not unlike how advertisers themselves borrow interest, hiring celebrities to endorse products or devoting ads to buzzed-about subjects like a royal wedding. Auletta posits that few industries have been \u201cconvulsed by change\u201d as much as advertising, which, as a result, is \u201cfacing fundamental challenges to its existence.\u201dIt may be a mug\u2019s game to figure out which industry has suffered the deepest damage at the hands of Silicon Valley; if you\u2019re reading this in print, you\u2019re holding another example of a business under siege. But Auletta works hard to get us to care about the fate of ad folks, despite our diminished interest in them or our distaste for what they do, because of their essential role as suppliers of the dollars that fuel the media ecosystem. If you \u201cfollow the money,\u201d he writes, you\u2019ll understand the importance of advertising and the significance of the threats against it, and maybe value it more, or at least disdain it less.Auletta surveys the tumultuous, treacherous ad landscape through the framework of frenemies. Not only are Madison Avenue and Silicon Valley frenemies, but so, too, he declares, are ad agencies and their marketer clients; agencies and media companies; traditional and digital media companies; agencies and consultancies like Accenture and McKinsey; agencies and software firms like Adobe and Salesforce.com; and, perhaps most telling, advertising and consumers. The easier it becomes for the public to zip, zap through and avoid interruptive ads \u2014 through innovative technology like ad blockers and streaming video \u2014 the madder, and more anxious, the mad men (and women) grow.Yet as dire as their fate looks, some flowers bloom amid the gloom, taking the edge off the book\u2019s pessimism. A respected industry strategist, Rishad Tobaccowala, tells Auletta: \u201cPeople say we are dinosaurs. We are not dinosaurs. We are cockroaches. Everybody hates us. Nobody likes to see us. But cockroaches have outlived everyone. We scurry out of corners. We soldier on and hire people with different skill sets.\u201dAuletta details the adaptive behavior \u2014 new types of agencies; reviving the sponsorship model; embracing data-driven, two-way marketing based on individualized relationships \u2014 while suggesting that, at the biggest ad conglomerates like WPP, the money for such substantive changes exists thanks to still-respectable margins (\u201ca relatively robust 15 or so percent\u201d). And he weaves into his narrative evidence of the wealth the business can still produce.For instance, one conglomerate\u2019s chief executive \u201cspends much of the year at his home in Palm Beach.\u201d The leader of a large agency has a \u201cglassed weekend home perched on 200 acres overlooking the Hudson River\u201d along with an \u201c8,000-square-foot Chelsea loft.\u201d And a well-known industry consultant sells his company for potentially as much as $207 million, hosts a $400,000 dinner at Cannes, buys a Tesla, gets rock-star treatment at his favorite restaurants and arrives at a meeting \u201csporting his Christmas tan from Turks and Caicos.\u201d There are martinis aplenty scattered among the pages of \u201cFrenemies,\u201d lending a nostalgic touch to the forward-facing proceedings.Alas, \u201cFrenemies\u201d can\u2019t avoid a pitfall common to such topical books, in that some of what\u2019s chronicled has been overtaken by events between writing and publication. The most notable example: In the book, Sorrell is \u201csecure\u201d in his top role at WPP and \u201cunlikely to step down anytime soon\u201d \u2014 but he did, suddenly, in mid-April, after an internal investigation into alleged misconduct. It\u2019s disconcerting, given how much Sorrell figures in \u201cFrenemies,\u201d to read of him telling Auletta, \u201cI will stay here until they shoot me!\u201d It\u2019s ameliorated, though, by a newsy tidbit: Several years ago he negotiated \u201cto sell WPP to Warren Buffett, but they did not see eye to eye and the discussions amicably collapsed.\u201dThat\u2019s a shame, if only because it\u2019s fun to imagine how Buffett \u2014 whose holdings at Berkshire Hathaway include Geico \u2014 might have approached the ad business: \u201cMarketers, save 15 percent on your campaigns with Geico WPP.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The story dominated the news, seeping into nearly every area of coverage \u2014 including, of course, tech.So why are businesses getting political? For one, we live in a highly politicized time with a deeply polarizing president, and platforms like Twitter have made it easier for brands to weigh in directly.In the case of tech executives, their increased activism might also in part reflect their growing power and importance.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Market Value Should Cross $1 Trillion and Keep On Trucking", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIt has been a long time coming, but Apple could soon be worth $1 trillion \u2014 and counting. At about $940 billion, the tech giant is close to being the first company to pass that threshold in market capitalization, as Breakingviews predicted seven years ago. Growth has slowed since then, but customers remain loyal and today\u2019s valuation is far from stretched. Apple\u2019s timely focus on data privacy may help it get there.The rather mundane improvements rolling out at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference this week demonstrate how the smartphone market is largely mature. Shipments worldwide declined slightly for the first time last year, the research firm IDC believes, and should grow less than 3 percent annually over the next five years.That said, there\u2019s no obvious replacement for smartphones on the horizon. Apple earned $48 billion last year, mostly from iPhone sales, so this looks like the base camp for the company. Phones are prone to being dropped, dunked in water or lost. Throw in small improvements, and the company can reap more per device. The average iPhone sales price actually rose last year.Apple can wring more dollars out of users in other ways, as well. Service revenue from selling apps, online storage and streaming music is rising at a 31 percent annual clip and now accounts for 15 percent of sales. Add in revenue from ancillary hardware, and analysts think the company can increase operating profit 13 percent this year. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a healthy rate of growth continuing. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is also milking the discomfort of Facebook, Google and others whose businesses rely heavily on sharing data, sometimes controversially, by contrasting them with Apple\u2019s privacy-friendly approach.Yet Wall Street has remained oddly skeptical over the years. Apple is valued at 15 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, which is slightly less than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over all. And peers trade at a substantial premium, with Facebook at 22 times forward earnings and Microsoft and the Google parent Alphabet on a multiple of 25.That\u2019s too large a gap. Microsoft is projected to grow roughly as fast as Apple this year. Facebook and Google are growing faster, but they are in the line of fire from consumers and regulators over data gathering and privacy worries. Apple\u2019s conference this week may be short on pizazz, but the nearly trillion-dollar company can tweak its business without the distraction of defending it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Democrats Challenging Party Incumbents, Insurgency Has Its Limits", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Suraj Patel, running for Congress against an entrenched incumbent has led to some awkward and unexpected moments.Elected officials have asked him to delete their pictures from his campaign\u2019s Facebook page. When he has tried to set up meetings with key New York City leaders, some refused \u2014 simply because they do not dare to be seen with him in public. Many did not answer at all.\u201cYou\u2019ll never eat lunch in this town again if you challenge Carolyn Maloney,\u201d Mr. Patel recalled one political consultant warning about his race against a 13-term Democrat.For Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, challenging Representative Joseph Crowley has meant watching local Democratic officials bolt the other way from her at parades, wary of appearing too close to her. Some have agreed to meetings, but behind closed doors \u2014 no cellphones allowed.Mr. Patel, 34, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, are among a group of energetic Democratic insurgents across the country, many of them young or female or people of color, who are seeking to knock off some of Congress\u2019s most tenured Democrats.They have not succeeded so far: No congressional Democrat in America has lost a primary in 2018.The establishment\u2019s winning streak will be tested again on Tuesday in New York City, where primary contests feature four Democratic challengers in one of the densest concentrations of intraparty battles in the nation.While national Democrats have celebrated the President Trump-inspired surge of activist energy coursing through the party in their efforts to take control of the House, many of those same leaders have moved to tame that energy, from Colorado to Massachusetts to New York, when it has turned against them.Beyond Mr. Crowley and Ms. Maloney, Representatives Eliot L. Engel and Yvette D. Clarke also face unusually spirited rivals. All four are Democrats in safely Democratic districts, and all four are heavily favored.\u201cAny time there\u2019s an infusion of new people it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Mr. Engel, who was first elected in 1988 and faces his most serious primary challenge in more than a decade. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you should automatically elect the people.\u201dMs. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, in particular, has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for some on the left who seem set to put a scare into Mr. Crowley, the head of the Queens Democratic Party, one of the last and most powerful political machines remaining in New York. MoveOn.org and Our Revolution, an outgrowth of the Sanders campaign, both endorsed her, and the news site The Intercept has generated a drumbeat of negative stories on Mr. Crowley.\u201cWe have a political culture of intimidation, of favoring, of patronage and of fear and that is no way for a community to be governed,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.Lauren French, a spokeswoman for Mr. Crowley, predicted victory next week because the congressman \u201cis unapologetically fighting for the people of Queens and the Bronx \u2014 communities that need health care, affordable housing, gun safety laws, immigration reform and better jobs with higher wages.\u201dMr. Patel has waged the most millennial of campaigns. On a recent Thursday evening, he was sitting in a former bar in the East Village that he uses as his campaign headquarters. His campaign manager handed him one of three phones that was logged into the dating app Tinder, and Mr. Patel began furiously swiping right.All around the bar \u2014 adorned with blue-velvet booths and a sound system that was playing Kanye West \u2014 campaign volunteers, logged onto Tinder, Grindr or Bumble, were doing the same thing. Mr. Patel calls it Tinder banking: Participants set up an account with a picture of an attractive person, usually not themselves, and begin seeking matches. Mr. Patel uses a picture of his brother.He compared it to the practice of creating a fake online persona to lure someone into a relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda like catfishing,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut you are telling people who you are.\u201dWhen someone responds, Mr. Patel replies with a political pickup line: \u201cHi Sarah. Are you into civic engagement?\u201d He soon reveals who he really is.Mr. Patel, a hotel executive, made a splash by amassing $1.2 million in a few short months \u2014 rivaling Ms. Maloney\u2019s haul. He said he is not interested in kowtowing to the traditional Democratic machine or methods; he has been canvassing for votes at yoga studios and printing campaign materials on coffee sleeves and drink coasters across this mostly affluent district that covers much of the east side of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens.\u201cNo bar ever says no to free coasters,\u201d he noted.Ms. Maloney did not directly address Mr. Patel\u2019s challenge, but in a phone interview, she acknowledged \u201ca lot of energy on the Democratic side.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing for the country and the party,\u201d she said.\u201cThe mom was a city councilwoman and she went ahead and inherited her mom\u2019s seat. When it came time for the congressional, the mom helped push her in,\u201d Mr. Bunkeddeko said.He has criticized Ms. Clarke sharply \u2014 \u201cNo one can credibly say this community has been represented well,\u201d he said in an interview \u2014 and not surprisingly, their recent debate on NY1 was intense.\u201cI understand that Ms. Clarke is upset by the fact that she has a competitive primary,\u201d Mr. Bunkeddeko said at one point.In an interview, Ms. Clarke said she was annoyed at Mr. Bunkeddeko for misrepresenting her record; his age was not an issue. \u201cMy office is full of millennials,\u201d Ms. Clarke said.Ms. Clarke called Mr. Bunkeddeko a \u201cshiny new thing\u201d who wasn\u2019t part of the \u201cbench of young people committed to their community and public service.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant young man and I take nothing away from him, but I\u2019ve brought value to my district and the nation,\u201d Ms. Clarke said.Among those who counseled Mr. Bunkeddeko against running was Representative Hakeem Jeffries, also of Brooklyn. He recalled telling Mr. Bunkeddeko that his future had two divergent paths: one was to be like Shirley Chisholm, Barack Obama or Charles B. Rangel; the other option was characterized by various obscure figures who had run for Congress and lost. The difference, Mr. Jeffries said, is that Ms. Chisholm, Mr. Obama and Mr. Rangel ran for lower office before Congress.\u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for them,\u201d Mr. Jeffries, who served as a state assemblyman for six years, recalled telling Mr. Bunkeddeko, \u201cit should be good enough for anyone.\u201dIn the Bronx and Westchester County, Mr. Engel faces a challenge from Jonathan Lewis, 56, who co-founded a money management firm and has put roughly $650,000 of his own money into the contest and is airing three different ads on cable.Mr. Lewis, who lives in Scarsdale, said he is running in part because of \u201cthe energy of the post-Trump era.\u201d\u201cMy diagnosis is many of us na\u00efvely presumed our party would take care of the issues but our party was taking of itself,\u201d he said in an interview. He has taken particular aim at Mr. Engel\u2019s raising money with groups with business before Congress.Mr. Engel pushed back that Mr. Lewis \u201capparently thinks only wealthy people should run for office.\u201dNancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, recently made an appearance with Mr. Engel in his district and praised him profusely. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be better served than by Eliot Engel,\u201d she said.The mailer features a large seal of the C.I.A., and says Mr. Lewis\u2019 record \u201cdoes include an award from the C.I.A.!\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Engel initially said he was \u201cfrankly not aware that we did that,\u201d but then defended it. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we were implying what you think we were implying,\u201d Mr. Engel said.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said there is \u201ccamaraderie\u201d among congressional challengers, and that she\u2019s spoken with Mr. Bunkeddeko and Mr. Patel to \u201cshare best practices in dismantling this calcified machine.\u201dAmong the common themes have been criticizing where Congress members get their money and embracing unconventional tactics.\u201cWhat if Tinder banking works so well that we get 1,000 extra votes? Shouldn\u2019t the party be like: \u2018Cool, let\u2019s start doing this,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Patel, who added that Democrats risk becoming a tired \u201clegacy corporation\u201d without further innovation. \u201cThe primary is a phenomenal opportunity for us to test new ideas, new energy.

We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.\u201dAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington. And some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., publicly promoted its work with ICE in January in a blog post, citing it as an example of the success of its technology.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d Mr. Nadella said at Microsoft\u2019s developer conference last month.Yet criticism of Microsoft\u2019s work with ICE began to grow. One Microsoft engineer, Larry Osterman, tweeted on Monday to ask how working with ICE matched with the company\u2019s \u201cethical stances.\u201dBut for many Microsoft employees, that was not satisfactory. A group of about a dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter, in which they said the company\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not go far enough.\u201dThe employees continued, \u201cWe are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy.\u201dThe letter added that Microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ICE but be open to a review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally, and that it should create a policy stating it would not work with those \u201cwho violate international human rights law.\u201dMicrosoft declined to comment on the employee letter, which was posted internally on Tuesday afternoon.

{"Headline": "Lake Disappointment and Useless Loop Road", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUstralia DiaryIndigenous Australians choose spiritual and poetic names for their roads and lakes. The rest of Australians, not so much.Nullaki Peninsula, Western AustraliaBy Joann GrenNames of places in Australia, like Aussies themselves, are brutally honest and steeped in rich, witty humor. Who wonders how the early explorers were feeling in Misery Bay or on Cape Tribulation? Captain Bligh and his crew found safe harbor on Restoration Island. The Pink Roadhouse on the Oodnadatta Track in South Australia is exactly that: a roadhouse painted pink.Frank Hann found Lake Disappointment while searching for fresh water in the Pilbara region of Western Australia in 1897. When it isn\u2019t dry, which isn\u2019t often, it\u2019s saltier than the oceans.My personal favorite, Useless Loop Road, is a dirt track out on a peninsula near Shark Bay (guess what\u2019s in the bay) in Western Australia; it gets to the water eventually, but is, well, useless, really.Indigenous names, which often express love of country and connection to the land, often tie up white people\u2019s tongues. For example, the road that connects the new highway to Mandurah just south of Perth is called Mandjoogoordap Drive. Say it really fast a couple of times and you might get it. In the Noongar language it means \u201cmeeting place of the heart.\u201d Oodnadatta is an adaptation of \u201cutnadata,\u201d an Arrente word meaning \u201cmulga blossom.\u201dThe Aussie tongue \u2014 of white settlement at least \u2014 seems to prefer being firmly planted in the Aussie cheek. Consider, for example, the application of the word \u201cgreat.\u201dThe Great Southern Highway weaves through country towns from Perth to Albany. A slow, two-lane road with a nominal shoulder, it bears no resemblance to the superhighways of the United States. The Great Eastern Highway, four lanes of traffic with streetlights and crosswalks in Perth, narrows to two lanes long before it ends in Kalgoorlie 600 kilometers to the east.I suppose these roads are considerable in degree, power and intensity. Compared with the back roads, where there is sometimes a single lane of bitumen (put your outside tires in the dirt if you encounter oncoming traffic), one might describe them as first rate. But \u201cgreat\u201d? Then again, perhaps the Aussies are having a go. After all, taking the piss, of themselves and everyone else, is a national sport here.The most direct route across Australia, it\u2019s been dubbed \u201cAustralia\u2019s longest shortcut.\u201dThe road is open all year, but unless harsh daytime conditions that cause exhaustion and dehydration \u2014 or sudden heavy rains that render the road impassable for days \u2014 don\u2019t worry you, it\u2019s best to travel between April and October. Feral animals, especially camels, are present all year.We chose the Great Central Road on our way home from Alice Springs. After refueling at the petrol station in Yulara, the resort base for visitors to Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park (also known as Ayers Rock), the ranger at the gate shook his head and waived the park fee when we explained we were driving through to Perth.Jarring vibrations, intermittently suspended by loose sand slides and pothole plunges, shook the truck; red bull dust seeped through closed vents. The Petermann Ranges, made of granite and sandstone, emerged on the horizon. Ernest Giles, the first European to visit here, named them after the geographer August Petermann. But there was so much more. Between the ranges, acacia shrubs dotted the low-lying hills that gave way to sand dunes spiked with spinifex. We saw no one for hours. Anangu Pitjantjatjara land \u2014 Anangu means people who belong to the earth \u2014 swallowed us up whole. We knew the outback was vast and remote; we were well prepared in terms of spare parts, permits and fuel stops. But the word \u201cgreat\u201d wasn\u2019t nearly big enough for the raw energy of the bush or the weighty power of its night sky. A deep love and respect of this land, one shared by all Australians, was born in me. That, I\u2019ve come to believe, is what black and white fellas, each in their own way, are expressing with their place names \u2014 love and respect for this great land.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Accused Gunman in Capital Gazette Shooting Left a Trail of Conflicts", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAUREL, Md. \u2014 Before he stormed into a quiet newsroom and unleashed a burst of gunfire that left five people dead, the suspect in the Maryland attack vented his hostility at the world with a barrage of lawsuits, harassment and workplace conflict.Jarrod W. Ramos, the suspected gunman, had been fired from his job as a government employee, was the subject of a police investigation and for years kept up an online crusade against targets including the criminal justice system, the local newspaper and a mental health counseling facility.\u201cWhen I heard about the Capital shooting on the news, I told my wife, \u2018it\u2019s Ramos,\u201d said Brennan McCarthy, a lawyer in Annapolis, Md., who represented a woman whom Mr. Ramos was convicted of harassing in 2011. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who is so out there, he is stalking the attorney for the stalking victim,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.His trail of public clashes finally came to an end when Mr. Ramos used a pump-action shotgun and smoke grenades to attack the employees of the Capital Gazette, against which he had long held a grudge after a columnist wrote about his harassment of a female high school classmate.On Friday, Mr. Ramos, 38, appeared in State District Court by a video feed and was charged with five counts of murder. He was denied bail.The arraignment came as the authorities released additional details about Thursday\u2019s shooting. Speaking outside the courtroom, Wes Adams, the Anne Arundel County state\u2019s attorney, said that Mr. Ramos had barricaded the rear door to prevent people from fleeing and that one of the victims had tried to escape through the blocked door and was shot.Over the years, Mr. Ramos directed particular fury at the Capital Gazette and its staff. In July 2012, Mr. Ramos filed a defamation lawsuit in Maryland\u2019s Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court against Capital Gazette Communications, its then editor and publisher, and a former reporter, claiming that his reputation had been damaged by a column. Three months later he filed a fuller complaint alleging invasion of privacy.According to the article, Mr. Ramos sent a friend request on Facebook to a former high school classmate and over the course of several months, he \u201calternately asked for help, called her vulgar names and told her to kill herself.\u201dMr. Ramos began tweeting under an account he called @EricHartleyFrnd, in which he taunted the reporter, Eric Hartley. He posted screenshots of court documents relating to a defamation case he had filed against the newspaper, and railed against other newspaper employees. His tweets were laced with profanities, and often addressed Capital employees directly, as though he were having an ongoing conversation with them.The attacks online prompted members of the Anne Arundel County Police Department to visit Mr. Ramos in the spring of 2013, at the behest of the newspaper\u2019s editor at the time, Thomas Marquardt, who was concerned about the hostile messages.But nothing came of the investigation, which has become a source of recrimination in the aftermath of the attack.Chief Timothy Altomare of the county police said in a news conference on Friday that Mr. Marquardt \u201cdid not call in\u201d to a conference call where the decision was made not to pursue criminal charges. Mr. Marquardt, for his part, said that the news organization\u2019s lawyer had been on the call, and that the police had advised that they did not have a strong case.In a police report obtained on Friday, law enforcement officials had indicated that they did not believe Mr. Ramos to be a threat to the Capital Gazette\u2019s employees. \u201cHe has not attempted to enter the Capital Newspaper building or sent direct threatening correspondence,\u201d the report said.\u201cThey told us they didn\u2019t think the information was there and we bowed to their wisdom on this thing,\u201d Mr. Marquardt said.The police investigation came on the heels of another legal dispute between Mr. Ramos and his former high school classmate, the subject of his earlier harassment case. She had retained a lawyer, Mr. McCarthy, in early 2013, after receiving a letter from Mr. Ramos that made her uncomfortable.\u201cI am prepared to add you to my lawsuit against Eric Hartley,\u201d Mr. Ramos wrote in a letter dated Jan. 30, 2013. \u201cI am satisfied you did not directly solicit his column about me, but I think you know who did. Given all that has transpired, I think you have many such secrets, and I would ask you to surrender them.\u201dAfter Mr. McCarthy obtained another order prohibiting him from contacting her, Mr. Ramos sued the lawyer himself. He also appealed the order against contacting the former classmate, which was granted, Mr. McCarthy said.Mr. Ramos graduated from Capitol Technology University in 2006 with a degree in computer engineering. For several years, he held a job as an information technologist with a subcontractor for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But in July 2014, six months after Enterprise Information Services took over the contract, he was terminated at the request of the government, representatives of the company said.The contractor said it was not aware of the reason for the request. Mr. Ramos, who had worked on the help desk answering employee questions about computer glitches and how to reset passwords, then filed a lawsuit against his former employer, saying that money was not paid to him.On Friday in court, Judge Thomas Pryal told Mr. Ramos, \u201cThere is a certain likelihood you are a danger.\u201d Mr. Ramos did not speak and showed no emotion, staring into the camera and blinking occasionally.Mr. Ramos lived in a small brick apartment building in Laurel, Md. A neighbor on Friday said he was so reserved that most people did not know he was a resident. He was oddly expressionless, she said, almost as if he were putting forth a calm facade. When her daughter asked him for jumper cables to help start her car, he refused.\u201cI said, \u2018This guy is not right,\u2019\u201d said the neighbor, who identified herself only as Veronica. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this guy?\u201dHe seemed purposeful and alert, never careless or out of control, she said. She said he did not have regular hours, and in the years he lived there, she had only ever seen him have visitors once.\u201cHe looked like someone who knew what he was doing,\u201d Veronica said. \u201cNo drugs, no alcohol. No. Nothing like that. He\u2019s got a straight face all the time.\u201dShe was anxious at first when a police car came to the apartment building in the late afternoon on Thursday. But after more officers arrived and began taking pictures and evacuating the building, her mind jumped to Mr. Ramos.\u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s my neighbor,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve come because of my neighbor.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article contained an incorrect dateline.

{"Headline": "Marches Across the U.S. Protest Separation of Migrant Families", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Drawing on an American history of cruelty, from the conquest of the Indians to the slave trade to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, activists in this city gathered on Thursday to voice outrage at what they see as the latest affront to American values by the Trump administration: splitting up migrant families at border crossings, and confining children in detention facilities.\u201cI think we are fighting for the heart and soul of America,\u201d Yolanda Varela Gonzalez, a teacher and activist, told a crowd of several hundred protesters in MacArthur Park, before they marched to an immigrant detention center in downtown Los Angeles.From the start, the Trump administration\u2019s hard line on immigration has galvanized this city of immigrants, where nearly half the population is Latino, and where deportations and roundups of undocumented immigrants by government agents has spread fear and anger in immigrant neighborhoods. And the stories they have heard lately, and the images they have seen, of children being ripped from the arms of parents at the border have heightened a sense of outrage, a sense that they are experiencing an era of American history that will be looked back upon with shame.\u201cTaking kids from their parents is crossing a line,\u201d said Gale Chernich, who joined the protest in Los Angeles.Organizers said more than 5,000 people had signed up to join the Families Belong Together rallies, aimed at halting one of the most widely debated new fronts in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to slow the flow of migrants across the southwest border from Mexico and Central America.Ms. McClain said she began planning for the rallies after learning about the campaign on Twitter. Interest in the event grew exponentially, she said, as volunteers, many of them outraged mothers, jumped in to help.\u201cDefense lawyers tell us that the parents being prosecuted for crossing the border are being made to wear yellow bracelets to denote their status,\u201d said Eve Krief, a protest organizer.Demonstrators sang and recited a poem. One speaker, Harold Fernandez, said he had come to the United States from Colombia, by way of the Bahamas, at 13. He said he was uncomfortable speaking to the crowd, but he spoke about a familiar issue.\u201cI\u2019ve been separated from my family when I was a little child,\u201d Dr. Fernandez said. His parents came to the country before he did.Bob and Margaret Slifkin watched and listened, overwhelmed with emotion.\u201cThis is not America,\u201d Mr. Slifkin said. \u201cThis is not the country that I want to live in.\u201dAt a rally in Austin, Tex., Nichole Miller, a local activist, said protesting the administration\u2019s practices was crucial in her state, where immigration issues affect such a large share of residents.\u201cWe\u2019re in the capital of Texas so there\u2019s a lot more impact here,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s super important, I think, to start wherever we can all around the city but also get that message to our lawmakers, our governor and those who have an impact in D.C.\u201dMicaela Eller, a leadership coach at I.B.M., said she had helped put together the rally in Austin after reading about the family-separation issue from stories posted on Twitter and Facebook.\u201cI read an account of a mother whose 4-year-old son had been taken from her and about her experience of being \u2018processed\u2019 with yellow wristbands with numbers on it to identify those families that were separated so they could be easily identified,\u201d Ms. Eller said. \u201cIt was a gut-wrenching account, and as a mother, it broke my heart.\u201d\u201cI believe we are at a crossroads as a nation, and we have a choice to make,\u201d Ms. Eller said, \u201cand I wanted to make sure that my voice was among the loudest voices saying this is not O.K., and this is not who we are as a country.\u201dA rally outside a public library in Augusta County, Va., drew around 50 people, many of whom wore yellow and waved as honking cars drove past.\u201cThe county that we live in is incredibly red so for that dynamic to exist and still have so much support I just think that it further proves that this issue goes beyond politics,\u201d said Jennifer Kitchen, a field organizer who helped coordinate the event. She said she wanted her community\u2019s interest to go beyond the demonstrations on Thursday.\u201cThere was a lot of conversation about what we need to do next and about how to keep showing up for immigrant families,\u201d Ms. Kitchen said.In Los Angeles, many of the organizers were immigrants themselves, some of them undocumented \u2014 a fact they proclaimed loudly, calling themselves \u201cundocumented and unafraid.\u201d And many of the protesters were teachers from Los Angeles public schools, where they said they have seen firsthand how deportations have split up families, and how the children have suffered.\u201cThey can\u2019t focus on school or the future if we just take out the welcome mat,\u201d said Elizabeth Kenoff, who teaches special education.Organizers handed out yellow sheets of paper listing slogans, in English and Spanish, for the protest. \u201cNo hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!\u201d was one. \u201cSay it loud! Say it clear! Immigrants are welcome here!\u201d was another.Carla Estrada, an organizer, said she is undocumented, and for years has been motivated by anger at how she has been treated \u2014 anger that came long before the Trump administration. Ms. Estrada, 27, said that when she graduated high school her counselor told her she would have no chance to go to college and that she should go back to Mexico.\u201cThat propelled me into so much anger,\u201d she said. She went to college, got her degree and now helps other immigrants.Justino Mora, a software engineer, is also undocumented, and served as the master of ceremonies. He runs a nonprofit focusing on immigrant rights, and said what is going on in the country reminds him of a book he read about Manzanar, an internment camp in California where Japanese-Americans were sent during World War II.\u201cThis is definitely a chapter in this country\u2019s history, its xenophobic, racist history,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Representative Joseph Crowley of New York passed out from heat exhaustion. He did not lose consciousness.Tim Arango reported from Los Angeles and Kayla Cockrel from New York. Arielle Dollinger contributed reporting from Huntington Village, N.Y.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senator Jeff Merkley, a Quiet Stalwart of the Left, Has a Breakout Moment at the Border", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It did not exactly make for riveting video this month when Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, was turned away from a converted Walmart at the Texas border that is housing hundreds of migrant children who have been taken away from their parents by the Trump administration.Shirt sleeves rolled up and cellphone in hand, Mr. Merkley spent the better part of half an hour waiting outside the shelter\u2019s doors, talking calmly to the cameras until the police arrived, at which point the shelter\u2019s supervisor emerged and asked him to leave. He politely complied.Now the mild-mannered Mr. Merkley is having a breakout moment. A darling of the progressive movement, he has until now been an under-the-radar presence in Washington, overshadowed by his high-profile colleagues, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Though a champion of same-sex rights and environmental causes, he has not been a legislative standout, and is known mostly as the only senator who endorsed Mr. Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries.He went to the border, he said in an interview on Thursday, because he thought reports of children being separated from their families might be fake news: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t envision that the administration would actually take asylum seekers, those fleeing persecution, and deliberately inflict trauma on their children.\u201dMr. Merkley, who has never met the president, is steamed about that. \u201cI know I took a lot of heat for using that term, but that\u2019s what they look like,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201ccages\u201d comment.\u201cI think if you\u2019re going to do a policy that injures people,\u201d Mr. Merkley said, \u201cyou ought to have the guts to go see it firsthand.\u201dTall and gray-haired at 61, Mr. Merkley is not, by his own admission, the kind of politician who makes audiences swoon.\u201cI\u2019m not the person who comes to battle with, if you will, extensive charisma,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not me. But I am determined.\u201dIndeed, if there is one word his colleagues use to describe Mr. Merkley, it is \u201cpersistent.\u201d In trying to win support for the Equality Act, a bill that would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, Mr. Merkley badgered fellow Democrats and the independents who caucus with them until all but one of them signed on. That persistence extends to his personal life; he has also completed two Ironman triathlons while serving in the Senate.\u201cHe\u2019s like a dog with a bone,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cHe will just not let go.\u201dBut some find that quality irksome, and Mr. Merkley\u2019s border attention grab has clearly irritated at least one Republican. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri at first grew quiet when asked about Mr. Merkley \u2014 a telltale sign among senators that they do not have something nice to say.\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Blunt finally allowed, \u201cother people went to the border when Obama was president on our side, and were never allowed in, and it was never any news.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a beer and burgers guy,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal group that has raised money for Mr. Merkley.A one-time intern for Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a moderate Republican, Mr. Merkley came up in politics as a State House representative in Oregon. A close friend and adviser, Robert Stoll, remembers him as \u201ca very quiet, very studious sort of guy, and a little geeky.\u201d In 2007, after leading an effort to flip the House from Republican to Democratic control, he was elected speaker.That same year, he set out to take on Gordon Smith, a senator at the time and another popular moderate Republican. \u201cWe said, \u2018You have a 20 percent chance of winning,\u2019\u201d Mr. Stoll recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018That good? I\u2019m running.\u2019\u201dMr. Merkley won that race, swept in on Barack Obama\u2019s presidential coattails. Once in the Senate, he championed banking overhaul and led a successful push to change Senate rules so that Mr. Obama\u2019s judicial nominees could be more easily confirmed. More recently, he has endeared himself to the Trump resistance by hosting meetings every two weeks in his office where outside groups like Indivisible and Move On swap strategy with senators.On Sunday, Mr. Merkley again traveled to Texas, this time leading a delegation that included Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, and several House members. They made five stops; what he saw there haunts him.At a legal port of entry, Mr. Merkley said, he witnessed American border guards \u201cblocking people seeking asylum from getting to the U.S.\u201d At a detention center, he said, he met with 10 women whose children had been taken away at the border; they had no access to legal representation, he said.At a border patrol center, he met a woman from Honduras who told him she had fled, at eight months pregnant, after members of a drug cartel threatened to kill her if she did not pay a loan to a local bank. She gave birth during her journey north. Under new, more restrictive rules imposed by the Trump administration, Mr. Merkley said, the woman is likely not eligible for asylum in the United States.As Congress wrestles with whether to pass legislation addressing the border crisis, Mr. Merkley is skeptical; he says legislative debates in Congress are \u201clike stepping in quicksand \u2014 it sucks you down and you can\u2019t move.\u201dHe calls Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order \u201ca travesty,\u201d because it allows migrant families to be detained indefinitely \u2014 a policy he has nicknamed \u201chandcuffs for all.\u201d His next step is to have Democrats convene a \u201cshadow hearing\u201d on the topic, perhaps as soon as next week. He is hoping to have migrant families testify.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ICE Came for a Tennessee Town\u2019s Immigrants. The Town Fought Back.", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "Agents conducted one of the biggest workplace raids since President Trump announced a crackdown on illegal immigration, detaining 97 workers in Morristown. But for residents, these workers were their neighbors. MORRISTOWN, Tenn. \u2014 One morning in April, federal immigration agents swept into a meatpacking plant in this northeastern Tennessee manufacturing town, launching one of the biggest workplace raids since President Trump took office with a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration.Dozens of panicked workers fled in every direction, some wedging themselves between beef carcasses or crouching under bloody butcher tables. About 100 workers, including at least one American citizen, were rounded up \u2014 every Latino employee at the plant, it turned out, save a man who had hidden in a freezer.The raid occurred in a state that is on the raw front lines of the immigration debate. Mr. Trump won 61 percent of the vote in Tennessee, and continues to enjoy wide popularity. The state\u2019s rapidly growing immigrant population, now estimated to total more than 320,000, has become a favorite target of the Republican-controlled State Legislature. In 2017, Tennessee lawmakers passed the nation\u2019s first law requiring stiffer sentences for defendants who are in the country illegally. In April, they passed a law requiring the police to help enforce immigration laws and making it illegal for local governments to adopt so-called sanctuary policies.So the day Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided the  Southeastern Provision plant  outside the city and sent dozens of workers to out-of-state detention centers was the day people in Morristown began to ask questions many hadn\u2019t thought through before \u2014 to the federal government, to the police, to their church leaders, to each other.Donations of food, clothing and toys for families of the workers streamed in at such volume there was a traffic jam to get into the parking lot of a church. Professors at the college extended a speaking invitation to a young man whose brother and uncle were detained in the raid. Schoolteachers cried as they tried to comfort students whose parents were suddenly gone. There was standing room only at a prayer vigil that drew about 1,000 people to a school gym.Here, based on interviews with dozens of workers and townspeople, and in their own words (some edited for length and clarity), is how it happened. The April 5 operation signaled a return to the high-profile immigration raids that last happened during the presidency of George W. Bush. President Barack Obama\u2019s chief workplace enforcement tactic was to conduct payroll audits and impose fines on businesses found to employ unauthorized workers. The Trump administration, on the other hand, has vowed to quintuple worksite enforcement. Last week, ICE agents arrested 114 employees at two worksites operated by a gardening company in Ohio. All 97 workers taken into custody in the Tennessee raid now face deportation, though several have been released pending hearings. And much of the town is reeling. Up to 160 American-born children have a parent who could soon be ordered to leave the country; many families are relying on handouts.After the raid, immigrant advocates organized a peace march, and Nataly carried a sign bearing the image of her father, a native of Mexico who had been working in the United States without papers for 20 years before he was taken into custody at the meat plant that day. \u201cWe Miss You,\u201d the sign read. \u201cWe need you by our side. You are the best father.\u201dNestled between two mountain ranges and flanked by two large lakes, Morristown is the county seat and industrial hub of Hamblen County, where most of the plant workers\u2019 families reside.The Latinos who arrived here, especially those who came after the late 1990s, were part of a swelling wave of migrants bypassing traditional gateway states like California and Texas to seek opportunity in the fast-growing South. Word reached their villages that jobs were plentiful.More recently, as with other places, Tennessee has been struggling with a meth and opioid epidemic. As drug abuse has sidelined many working-age American men and women, local employers have increasingly turned to immigrants.These days, Latinos make up about 11 percent of Hamblen County\u2019s population and account for one of every four students in its public schools. Immigrants toil in meat, poultry and canning plants, as well as at automotive parts, plastics and other factories that dot the area.Not everyone in town has been welcoming, though. One theme many expressed: The workers were lawbreakers who got caught. In the parking lot of the local Walmart, where several people were talking about the raid at the meat plant, one woman said it could open up employment opportunities. But not everyone agreed with her.Undocumented workers from Mexico and Guatemala formed the backbone of the work force at Southeastern Provision, located 10 miles north of Morristown in the town of Bean Station. They killed, skinned, decapitated and cut up cattle whose parts were used for, among other things, oxtail soup and a cured meat snack exported to Africa.Immigrants were critical to the family-owned abattoir\u2019s growth over the last decade. Many of those affected by the raid, fearing further action from the authorities, spoke on the condition that only their first names be used.With the $11.50 hourly wage that her husband, Tomas, made at the plant and the $9 she earns as a seamstress, Elisabeth and her family could afford the $700 rent for a house big enough to accommodate their six children, three from her previous marriage, and live a relatively stable life, she said. To be sure, the work was heavy, gory and low-paying. Day after day, the workers endured the smell of manure, blood and flesh. But Southeastern Provision offered a major advantage over other businesses: The management, several workers said, didn\u2019t seem to expect them to bother with fake work authorization documents.Federal authorities said there was evidence that the company had run afoul of the law. In an affidavit, the Internal Revenue Service said the company had withdrawn millions of dollars in cash and told bank employees the money was needed to pay \u201cHispanics\u201d\u2014 suggesting that the company knew it was hiring undocumented workers and evaded payment of federal employment taxes.An informant hired at the plant in 2017 told investigators that workers felt they couldn\u2019t complain about poor working conditions because of their immigration status. Some had to work unpaid overtime, the informant reported. He said he saw others required to work with \u201cextremely harsh\u201d chemicals without protective eyewear.It was just after 9 a.m., about two hours after more than 100 workers had arrived for the 7 a.m. shift, when shouts of \u201cinmigraci\u00f3n, inmigraci\u00f3n\u201d rang out across the plant.Alma went numb. In the cutting line, another worker, Raymunda, put down the butcher\u2019s knife she was holding and raced toward an exit. So did dozens of others, their blood-smeared smocks and protective aprons weighing them down. They soon realized that ICE agents, backed by state law enforcement, blocked every door.Within minutes, all the Latinos at the plant were rounded up, including at least one American citizen and several other people who had legal authorization to work.Immigrants who were lined up, many of them crying, tried to give the woman messages to pass to their loved ones, because they knew she was an American and, therefore, likely to be freed.In groups of about a dozen, according to several workers interviewed, Latinos were placed mainly in plastic handcuffs, escorted to white vans with tinted windows and transported to a National Guard Armory. A helicopter hovered above.Word began to spread that  \u201cla  migra,\u201d as ICE is known, was in the area. Panicked immigrants walked off the job at other companies in the region and frantically texted each other.Ms. Galvan described how she arrived to a crowd amassed behind yellow police tape surrounding the armory, as state troopers stood guard. Relatives of plant workers were crying and obsessively checking their cellphones for news.Inside, workers said they waited hours to be interviewed and fingerprinted by agents, a process delayed by computer glitches. When agents asked women who had young children to identify themselves, virtually every hand went up.By late afternoon, agents had released only a handful of people, mainly those in frail health or who had proven they had the legal right to work in the United States.In the evening,  Johnny  headed to the armory with his father and 7-year-old sister, Brittany, who was weeping. They brought insulin injections to be delivered to his mother, who is diabetic.Families were gathering in an elementary school across from the armory. By nightfall, about 100 people, including teachers, clergy, lawyers and other community members had assembled. Volunteers distributed pizza, tamales and drinks.As the night wore on, about 30 of the detainees, including Raymunda and Alma, were gradually released.A little after 1 a.m., the agents announced that no one else would be let go. Workers still in detention \u2014 54 in all \u2014 were put on buses to Alabama and then Louisiana.St. Patrick Catholic Church\u2019s parish center was converted into a crisis response center. All day, people arrived with food, clothing, toys and supplies for the affected families. At one point, six trucks waited to unload donations.Volunteers, who showed up by the dozens, received color-coded tags: Yellow for teachers, white for lawyers, and pink for general helpers, who prepared meals in the kitchen, packed grocery bags and performed other tasks.Bleary-eyed immigrants packed the main room. In smaller rooms, teachers entertained children with stories while their parents received legal services.Members of other churches turned up to help, some bearing gift cards and checks.On  Topix , a community website where comments are posted anonymously, one person asked, \u201cWhy does St. Patrick Catholic Church support law breakers?\u201dAnother person wrote, \u201cThis bust is legal, the people are illegals. Why the big sympathy case? I don\u2019t get it.\u201dStill, a couple of days later, \u201cwe had more volunteers than we knew what to do with. We had to turn people away,\u201d Ms. Jacobs said.At a news conference, faith leaders and Elisabeth, surrounded by her sons, pleaded for the community to pray for the immigrants.Hundreds of children missed school after the raid. On the evening of April 7, about 120 teachers and school staff packed the church\u2019s basement to talk about how to assist students. On a poster board, they scrawled their feelings. \u201cI cried Thursday night wondering which of my students were without parents that night,\u201d one teacher wrote. \u201cI feel helpless,\u201d wrote another.On Monday, three days after the raid, a prayer vigil at Hillcrest Elementary School drew nearly 1,000 people who sat in the bleachers, in folding chairs on the court and, when the chairs ran out, they stood along the walls. A 16-year-old named Ramon stood up to speak.Two nights later, St. Patrick Church\u2019s center still brimmed with activity as immigrants and supporters gathered to make posters and banners for a  procession  through downtown Morristown. Ms. Smith brought her 8-year-old daughter, Laurel, figuring it was an important lesson. \u201cThis community is a snapshot of the dissonance of America on immigration,\u201d Ms. Smith said.At Walters State Community College, instructors gathered in an auditorium to hear Jehova Arzola, 20, an engineering honors student whose brother and uncle were detained, describe his family\u2019s ordeal. No one knew when, or if, they would see them again, he said.On Thursday, a week after the raid, about 300 people took to Morristown\u2019s downtown streets in the evening to draw attention to the plight of the families. Some people, like Colin Loring and his partner, Margaret Durgin, drove for an hour to participate.\u201cWe are here to support our immigrant neighbors. The system needs to be fixed,\u201d said Mr. Loring, who is retired from the United States Department of Agriculture. Ms. Durgin arrived with a $540 check to help the immigrants.Before setting out, a nun led the marchers, who wore white and clutched white flowers, in prayer. \u201cWe love Morristown. We are here to send a message of love and unity,\u201d they chanted before heading down Main Street. Along the way, a driver shouted an expletive at the crowd from inside his brown truck and sped off.Pulling to the front of the line was Raymunda, her youngest children, Johnny, 15, and Brittany, 7, by her side. She said she had a notice to appear in court for deportation proceedings.Produced by Gray Beltran and Shreeya Sinha.Produced by Gray Beltran and Shreeya Sinha.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Anxiety About World Affairs ", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new poll finds that Australians are disillusioned with President Trump, and worried about Chinese investment, immigration and climate change.How do Australians feel about President Trump and the state of the world? Not good, on both counts, according to the Lowy Institute\u2019s annual poll of Australians, which was released Wednesday. The poll shows they\u2019re also not pleased with Chinese investment, immigration rates to Australia, or their country\u2019s response to climate change.Here are a few key findings that provide a summary of the country\u2019s mood and political direction on global issues. A slight majority of Australians (55 percent) say they trust the United States to \u201cact responsibly in the world\u201d \u2014 a six-point drop since 2017 and a 28-point collapse since 2011.The responses, from one of America\u2019s closest allies, represent the lowest level of trust in the United States recorded in 12 years of Lowy Institute polling. Australians still value their country\u2019s alliance with the United States \u2014 three out of four said the alliance was either \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cfairly\u201d important for Australia\u2019s security. It\u2019s the president that concerns them: 42 percent consider the presidency of Donald J. Trump a critical threat to Australia\u2019s interests. Australians are more concerned about China\u2019s influence on their economy than their politics. Even though Australian politicians have been especially focused on Chinese interference in politics over the past year, only 41 percent of Australians see \u201cforeign interference in Australian politics\u201d as a critical threat.And while 63 percent expressed concern about China\u2019s influence in Australian politics, almost as many (58 percent) said they were concerned about the influence of the United States.\u201cThis debate has not really resonated with Australia,\u201d said Alex Oliver, the poll\u2019s author. \u201cIt\u2019s not high on their list of concerns.\u201d A bigger priority for Australians is the flood of Chinese cash. Almost three-quarters of Australian adults (72 percent, up from 56 percent in 2014) said the Australian government was \u201callowing too much investment from China,\u201d especially in real estate and agriculture. For the first time, the Lowy Institute poll found that a majority of Australians (54 percent) think the current rate of immigration to Australia is too high. That\u2019s up 14 points since last year, and 17 points since the poll started asking the question in 2014.Australians also appear to be questioning immigration\u2019s impact on national identity. A majority (54 percent) still say \u201cAustralia\u2019s openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation,\u201d but a significant minority (41 percent) now say that \u201cif Australia is too open to people from all over the world, we risk losing our identity as a nation.\u201d Climate change is back on the Australian agenda: 59 percent of Australians said \u201cglobal warming is a serious and pressing problem\u201d about which \u201cwe should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs.\u201d That figure has been rising steadily since 2012, when it was 36 percent, but is still below the peak of 68 percent in 2006. Almost all Australians (84 percent) also said \u201cthe government should focus on renewables, even if this means we may need to invest more in infrastructure to make the system more reliable.\u201d Only 14 percent said the government should promote traditional energy sources like coal and gas despite the environmental costs.In past polls, Australians ages 18 to 29 expressed far less support for democracy than their elders, with a slight majority (52 percent) saying last year that they preferred it as a form of government. This year, that number dropped to 49 percent, and it\u2019s even lower among Australians ages 30 to 44 (45 percent). By contrast, 76 percent of those 45 and older favor democracy, which raises an interesting question: If Australia did not have compulsory voting, who would actually participate?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arizona Man Who Was Beaten by Officers Gets Charges Against Him Dismissed", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA judge in Arizona on Thursday dismissed disorderly conduct charges against a black man whose beating by several police officers during an arrest last month was recorded on video and led to four of them being put on leave.Mr. Johnson was told to sit down but did not, the officers later reported. Surveillance camera video showed what happened next: The officers repeatedly punched Mr. Johnson, who was unarmed, and kicked and pushed him to the ground, where he was handcuffed.Benjamin Taylor, a lawyer for Mr. Johnson, said in a telephone interview that he had asked for the charges, which include hindering prosecution, to be dismissed.A motion filed by prosecutors seeking that dismissal said that it would be \u201cin the interests of justice.\u201d Judge Elizabeth Arriola dismissed the charges on Thursday.A call to the Mesa Police Department was not immediately returned.The department\u2019s use of force in other recent episodes has been scrutinized. After the video showing Mr. Johnson\u2019s arrest was released on June 5, public comments flooded the department\u2019s Facebook page calling for something to be done about police violence.Andre Miller, the pastor at New Beginnings Christian Church in Mesa, which Mr. Johnson attends, said in an interview last week that Mr. Johnson had seen a doctor for head and chest injuries after the episode.\u201cThis is a culture that we are trying to combat which is bigger than Mr. Johnson,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt is not a race issue but it is a policing culture.\u201dTwo more cases involving the Mesa Police Department emerged after it released the video of Mr. Johnson\u2019s arrest. At a news conference on June 6, activists highlighted an episode in November, captured by body cameras, in which officers forcibly removed a 30-year-old man from his house after he had called the police about an intruder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edmund White\u2019s Unerring Influence on Queer Writing", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the release of the author\u2019s book about the pleasures of reading, we asked his acolytes to reflect on the pleasures of reading White\u2019s own work.Vidal\u2019s medieval conception of queer literature \u2014 a paucity of thrones, with deadly usurpers huddled in every bush \u2014 suggests where we were in the 1980s. With the notable exception of Christopher Isherwood, there were few benevolent eldergays in the literary scene. James Baldwin was ailing, Tennessee Williams was on a strict diet of goofballs, and Vidal had paranoid delusions of oil-based assassination. In 1980, when a barefoot Truman Capote met White in New York City, he carried a pink palmetto fan and a warning: \u201cYou\u2019ll probably write some good books. But remember, it\u2019s a horrible life.\u201dI must have read White\u2019s story \u201cRunning on Empty\u201d when I was 17 or 18, and there\u2019s a moment in it I\u2019ve never forgotten. An H.I.V.-positive man, a translator, has returned to the United States after years living in Paris. Staying with a cousin in Texas, he\u2019s surrounded by the world he fled, and increasingly frightened that his illness might trap him there, undoing a hard-won liberation. (\u201cTears of humiliation: he was offended that a virus had been permitted to win an argument.\u201d) Walking through a cemetery with his cousin one afternoon he sees a beautiful young man urinating beneath a tree; that night, alone, he returns to what he thinks is the spot. And this is the moment I\u2019ve never been able to forget: he kneels down to touch the dirt, he imagines he feels moisture, he lifts his hand to his lips. That gesture crystallizes a quality that I think of as White\u2019s signature, and as an ideal of art: it\u2019s elegant, refined, ceremonious; it\u2019s also a complete surrender to the abjection of desire. Like other moments in White\u2019s work, it has been a kind of lodestar for me, an orientation in queer art-making.When I think of White, I picture him in the period when he was living with the beautiful young theater actor Keith McDermott and pining for him and listening to McDermott having loud sex with 1950s movie heartthrob Tab Hunter. Somehow this story, revealed in White\u2019s memoir \u201cMy Lives,\u201d blends juicy gossip and romantic yearning, and it has stayed with me maybe because White is the observer here, the one outside of the action, when he has so often been in the middle of it.White is justly celebrated for the unblinkingly honest truth-telling in the three volumes of his autobiography, \u201cMy Lives,\u201d \u201cCity Boy\u201d and \u201cInside a Pearl,\u201d but it\u2019s the third volume, about his time in Paris, that holds a special place in my heart. It has his trademark seeming \u2014 I want to underline the word \u201cseeming\u201d \u2014 ease of style, and effortlessness of telling, as if he had an infinite fountain of stories in him. But beyond that lightness, so full of art, there is a profoundly cosmopolitan sensibility that sees through everything, especially the way different cultures diverge and collide and face off. He is witty, funny, naughty, entertaining and you can see his eyes twinkling with both delight and wisdom as you read the dispatches from this true citizen of the world.This article has been updated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "East Pittsburgh Police Kill Antwon Rose, Unarmed 17-Year-Old, as He Flees", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn unarmed 17-year-old boy was shot and killed by the East Pittsburgh police on Tuesday night as he tried to flee a traffic stop, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.\u201cWhy are they shooting?\u201d the woman recording the video says. \u201cAll they did was run and they\u2019re shooting at them!\u201dThe Allegheny County Police Department, which is investigating the encounter, said that two firearms were found on the floor of the car. When asked if the teenager was found with a weapon on his person, Coleman McDonough, the department\u2019s superintendent, said he was not.In a statement on Wednesday night, S. Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing Antwon\u2019s family, said: \u201cWe know very little about the circumstances surrounding his death at this early stage. We must emphasize that rumors of him being involved in a separate shooting are unsubstantiated. We know that he was not armed at the time he was shot down, that he posed no immediate threat to anyone, and that, significantly, the driver of the vehicle he occupied was released from police custody.\u201dOn Wednesday evening, dozens of people gathered outside the East Pittsburgh Police Department to protest the black teenager\u2019s death. \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d they chanted. Some carried signs that said, \u201cJustice4Antwon\u201d and \u201c#BlackLivesMatter.\u201d\u201cHe was an excellent student,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, adding that Antwon was taking Advanced Placement classes.With Antwon\u2019s death, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve lost four students to gun violence\u201d over the past school year.Kim Ransom, the owner of Pittsburgh Gymnastics Club, where Antwon worked for about a year, recalled the sweltering day in 2015 that he interviewed to work at the club as an instructor.\u201cHe brought his typed-up r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and he was wearing a full three-piece suit with his shiny shoes and he was sweating profusely,\u201d she said.She had never seen someone arrive at the club so formally dressed for an interview.\u201cI just thought it was very cute. I think he was 14 at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone in his life must have been guiding him in the right direction.\u201dHe got the job and began coaching children in an after-school program and other classes.\u201cEverybody loved him here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very mature.\u201d\u201cI feel like it\u2019s important for people to know that he was Antwon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a statistic, he\u2019s Antwon.\u201dInvestigators said a gunman in a passing vehicle had fired nine .40-caliber rounds at the 22-year-old, who returned fire.The 911 callers provided a description of a vehicle they saw fleeing the scene, the police said, and an East Pittsburgh officer saw a similar vehicle, a silver Chevrolet Cruze that appeared to have ballistics damage to its rear window.\u201cI\u2019m very confident that that was the vehicle involved in the shooting,\u201d Superintendent McDonough said.The officer stopped the car at 8:40 p.m. and took the driver into custody.\u201cWhile he was putting the driver into handcuffs, two other occupants ran from the car,\u201d the Allegheny County police said. An East Pittsburgh officer started shooting, striking the 17-year-old \u201cseveral times.\u201dThe teenager was taken to U.P.M.C. McKeesport hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:19 p.m., Superintendent McDonough said.\u201cWe believe he was hit three times,\u201d he added. \u201cHe was hit in various places on his body.\u201dThe driver of the car was later released after being interviewed.\u201cAt the time we did not feel that charging was called for,\u201d Superintendent McDonough said.The police are still searching for the second person who ran from the officers. Superintendent McDonough asked that he turn himself in \u201cso that he can give a comprehensive description of what occurred this evening,\u201d the police statement said.The officer who shot the teenager has been placed on administrative leave, officials said.Reached by phone on Wednesday, Ms. Fetterman recalled Antwon\u2019s politeness when he would stop by to help on Saturday mornings. \u201cHe would always call me Ms. G or Ma\u2019am,\u201d she said.Raemon Prunty, 18, a childhood friend of Antwon\u2019s who also volunteered at the Free Store, said he last spoke with him three days ago.Mr. Prunty said that as an African-American, he, too, would have acted as Antwon did.\u201cIf I was in Antwon\u2019s shoes,\u201d he said, \u201cI would have ran.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s out of fear,\u201d Mr. Prunty said.Melissa Gomez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

H.I.V. and AIDS advocacy forces us to think big: to consider the progress we have made \u2014 as a movement, and as a society \u2014 in a very short time. Just a few decades ago, I saw  people living with AIDS  taken to hospitals in wheelbarrows because they could not walk.  Today, science has made possible treatments that give people with H.I.V. the opportunity to live lives as long, full and healthy as their peers. But for too many people around the world, those benefits are still out of reach. Even in places where treatment is available, the stigma that persists around H.I.V. \u2014 along with the shame imposed by  homophobia \u2014 contributes to  new infections and keeps people from seeking treatment even when they know they need it. Our work as advocates is to help end that hopeless feeling of invisibility. As an artist, I know that a single photograph can tell a greater truth than a pile of statistics, and there is profound humanity in giving individuals at the margins the opportunity to step into the light. Robin\u2019s images tell the story of struggle and survival, of resilience and empathy, of discrimination and the hard work and advocacy needed to overcome it. These images show us  people  who seek only to live honestly, openly, with dignity and without fear. The good news is that in each of these places \u2014 and everywhere around the world \u2014 local activists, advocates and everyday heroes are working to build better, healthier and more inclusive societies. Their efforts, supported by grants from organizations like mine, are making a real difference. In Kenya, L.G.B.T. people fleeing  Uganda, Somalia and South Sudan arrived in the Kakuma refugee camp only to find that they faced poverty and prejudice there as well. With the help of a grant, however, they now have access to safe housing, food and H.I.V. testing and treatment at the camp. In fact, Kakuma just observed its first Pride celebration. In Mozambique, H.I.V. is prevalent among gay men, but because of stigma, many don\u2019t have access to care. New hope comes in the form of a program that will test thousands for H.I.V., as well as train L.G.B.T. people to test their peers confidentially and in their own homes. Confidential treatment means freedom \u2014 from the risk of having your H.I.V. status made public, from the burden of stigma in the community you\u2019ve always called home.

{"Headline": "Comcast Offers $65 Billion for 21st Century Fox, Challenging Disney", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byComcast announced an offer worth $65 billion for the bulk of 21st Century Fox\u2019s businesses on Wednesday, setting up a showdown with the Walt Disney Company for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire.The one-upmanship reflects an industry under threat from Silicon Valley, where deep-pocketed technology companies like Netflix and Amazon are stealing audiences, ad dollars and big name creative talents.Now Comcast is back \u2014 creating a likely bidding war for a conglomerate that Mr. Murdoch has spent a lifetime building, and setting up a showdown between the Comcast chief executive Brian L. Roberts and his counterpart at Disney, Robert A. Iger, who has staked his legacy on this deal.\u201cComcast seems hellbent on winning this time, and I think the narrative in Philadelphia is that Brian should have listened to his gut in 2004 and bought Disney,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a co-founder of the research firm MoffettNathanson and a longtime media analyst, referring to Comcast\u2019s headquarters. \u201cHe seems very personally committed to this.\u201dIn a statement, Fox said it planned to review Comcast\u2019s offer. Representatives for Disney declined to comment.There are questions about how hard Disney will fight. As Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company, put it in a client note on Wednesday, Mr. Iger \u201chas never (as far as we are aware) been put in a position where a proposed acquisition faced a significant competitive challenge such as this, so it\u2019s hard to gauge his sensitivity to price.\u201dMr. Iger does have a history of paying premiums for properties he wants, albeit on a much smaller scale. The most obvious example is Pixar, which Disney bought in 2006 for $7.4 billion, or $9.4 billion in today\u2019s money. The price was criticized at the time as exorbitant \u2014 wrongly, as it turned out, given the value that Disney has since gotten from the animation studio.Comcast\u2019s new offer is about 19 percent higher than Disney\u2019s proposal, according to its statement. It also includes contractual assurances such as a reverse breakup fee \u2014 worth about $2.5 billion \u2014 in the event a transaction is blocked by the government.Mr. Murdoch and his company\u2019s board had rejected Comcast\u2019s earlier offer partly because of concerns that the government would block the deal, but the AT&T-Time Warner decision allayed many of those worries.Mr. Roberts wrote in a 700-word letter to Mr. Murdoch and his sons \u2014 James, the chief executive of Fox, and Lachlan, the executive chairman \u2014 that he \u201clong admired what the Murdoch family has built,\u201d but that he and his company were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Fox\u2019s decision to engage Disney.\u201cIn light of yesterday\u2019s decision in the AT&T/Time Warner case,\u201d Mr. Roberts continued, \u201cwe are pleased to present a new, all-cash proposal that fully addresses the board\u2019s stated concerns with our prior proposal.\u201dThe businesses that Mr. Murdoch has agreed to sell include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, almost two dozen regional sports networks like the Yankees\u2019 YES channel, a lineup of cable networks that include FX, and a 30 percent ownership stake in the streaming service Hulu.But the key attractions for Comcast are Fox\u2019s broad international assets. Among them are Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in the European pay-TV operator Sky and its control of Star, one of India\u2019s largest media companies, which reaches 700 million people every month, according to the company.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s overseas business accounts for 27 percent of annual sales, about $7.8 billion. Comcast, whose cable business is strictly a domestic operation, draws in only 9 percent of its revenue from foreign agreements, largely through NBCUniversal.Comcast has already made an offer to buy the other 61 percent of Sky in a separate deal. The Fox News cable network, the Fox broadcast stations, the Fox Business Network and the sports network FS1 would not be part of a transaction.A Fox combination could help Comcast amplify its streaming services. Netflix, YouTube, Apple and Facebook are spending billions of dollars a year to create original series and are competing directly for content and sports programming.Hulu, which has more than 17 million subscribers, would come under Comcast\u2019s control if it pulls off the acquisition. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a wonderful asset,\u201d NBCUniversal\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Burke, said Wednesday on a conference call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this deal, and we\u2019d be very interested in growing that business in the future.\u201dAT&T\u2019s decisive court victory \u2014 the judge said the merger could move forward without requiring the telecommunications giant or Time Warner to divest any assets \u2014 creates a blueprint for Comcast. Both AT&T and Comcast are distributors seeking to buy content companies that they do not directly compete with, in what is known as a vertical acquisition. Comcast, for example, already pays Fox for the right to carry its channels like FX and Fox News.\u201cThe AT&T ruling pretty much eliminated the vertical issue from at least where the world stands now,\u201d said Ketan Jhaveri, a former antitrust lawyer for the Justice Department, which had sued to block the merger. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to make the comparison from AT&T buying Time Warner to Comcast buying Fox.\u201dEven so, the combination of Comcast and Fox would put more content and distribution under one company\u2019s control than even the AT&T deal with Time Warner. In his ruling, the judge wrote that \u201cthe temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than a resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\u201dIn the weeks ahead, Comcast and Disney are expected to work overtime to convince Fox shareholders that each will have an easier time passing regulatory muster.Mr. Iger is expected to contend that Disney\u2019s regulatory process will be faster because it has a head start, having announced its deal in December. Comcast maintains that the two timelines will be comparable.Unlike its merger with NBCUniversal in 2011, Comcast said, a deal with 21st Century Fox would not undergo a regulatory review by the Federal Communications Commission because the transaction would not involve the transfer of broadcast licenses, which requires a rigorous public interest and competition review by the agency.Either merger would be the first test for the Department of Justice since its sweeping court defeat this week. Analysts say it may be reluctant to challenge another major media deal.\u201cThe regulatory backdrop is now more positive for companies in a \u2018get big\u2019 environment,\u201d Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Research, said.Two businesses that would receive particular regulatory scrutiny would be Fox\u2019s film business and its 22 regional sports networks.In 2017, Disney and Fox controlled a combined 35 percent of the box office in North America. This year, the two make up 50 percent. Comcast and Fox controlled a combined 28 percent last year; this year, the total is 25 percent.As for sports, NBCUniversal owns nine regional networks of its own, while Disney owns ESPN, the most popular national sports network.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even With Mo Salah in the World Cup, Egypt Can\u2019t Seem to Catch a Break", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCairo DispatchCAIRO \u2014 When Russia scored its third goal against Egypt in the World Cup last week, the tidal wave of heartache that rippled across Cairo seemed to land squarely on the broad shoulders of Mahmoud Abdel Razek.The burly accountant had already spent the previous hour perched on a rickety chair outside a tiny cafe on Kasr al-Aini avenue, its usual flood of traffic now strangely quiet, with his eyes glued to a small television atop a pile of red crates.He stamped his feet. He slapped his thigh. He banged the small gold tea table at his side, muttering prayers and soft curses. But after the third goal, he couldn\u2019t bear it any more.\u201cWe thought God was with Egypt,\u201d he said in a choked voice, motioning to the sky. \u201cBut no.\u201dEgyptians, it seems, just can\u2019t catch a break.Even soccer, the nation\u2019s most beloved sport, is carefully controlled. Domestic games have been played before empty stadiums because of a ban on crowds at soccer games instituted in 2012, driven in part by fears that opposition forces could harness the power of a large public gathering.But then the World Cup came along and with it, a cloudburst of unfiltered national happiness.For the first time in 28 years, the national soccer team, known as the Pharaohs, qualified. And they got there courtesy of Mr. Salah, a goal-scoring machine who has rocketed to global fame in the past year, fueled by the love of his soccer-mad compatriots.The streets of Cairo exploded with joy in October when Mr. Salah scored a dramatic last-minute goal against Congo that propelled the national side into the World Cup finals. Egyptians, riven by so much fear, division and bloodshed since their Arab Spring uprising in 2011, had finally found an undisputed hero.\u201cSalah is the king,\u201d said Moataz Badr, a 16-year-old high school student, as he left a street cafe in the Cairo district of Agouza after a recent game. \u201cKing of Liverpool. King of England. King of Egypt.\u201dBut sport has little respect for fairy tale endings, and intoxicated hopes that Mr. Salah could propel Egypt to the second round of the World Cup crashed to the ground this week. Yet few Egyptians are giving up on Mr. Salah.In a country where hope is fragile, many see him as a once-in-a-generation star \u2014 a moral as well as a sporting force, an ambassador for country and faith.Stories of his charitable giving and humility have become the stuff of legend. He lavishes money on schools and ambulances in Nagrig, his small hometown in the Nile Delta, and avoids hobnobbing with wealthy business figures.\u201cIf he scores another few, then I\u2019ll be a Muslim too,\u201d goes one Liverpool chant.He unifies Arabs too. After Mr. Salah declared on Facebook that he was wearing his soccer boots on behalf of 100 million Egyptians, fans across the Middle East jumped in. \u201cKing Abu Salah, add 20 million Syrians,\u201d said one. \u201cAdd 50 million Iraqis,\u201d said another.That kind of popularity can be dangerous in a country like Egypt. After Mr. Sisi won re-election in April in a widely discredited vote in which 1.7 million votes were spoiled, some voters crossed out the president\u2019s name and wrote in Mr. Salah\u2019s.Last year Mohamed Aboutrika, who captained Egypt\u2019s soccer team for a decade until 2013, was placed on a terrorist watchlist for alleged ties to the banned Muslim Brotherhood group. He currently lives in exile in the Gulf nation of Qatar.In interviews, Mr. Salah has studiously avoided talk of politics, and insisted he was not fazed by the crushing pressure of shouldering the hopes of 97 million Egyptians.A beefy tackle by Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos in May, three weeks before the contest, left Mr. Salah with a shoulder injury that raised anguished fears he might miss the World Cup.\u201cThe Night Egyptians Cried: Ramos the butcher dislocated Salah\u2019s shoulder,\u201d howled a headline in the Egyptian newspaper Al Masry Al Youm.Mr. Salah missed Egypt\u2019s first World Cup match against Uruguay, which the team lost 1-0. When he did finally appear on Tuesday, against host nation Russia, his only score was a consolation penalty that brought the final tally to 3-1.After the game, emotions ran high.In the Nile Delta city of Tanta, a fist fight erupted at a cafe after one customer spat at the television and cursed the national team. Ahmed Abdulla, a taxi driver watching the brawl, suffered a scalded leg after a friend kicked over a table loaded with teacups.\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal was more painful than the burn.\u201dElsewhere, shellshocked fans wept quietly or walked away silently. In one Cairo cafe, men left without paying for their drinks and the waiters didn\u2019t have the heart to stop them.Since then, the frustration has spilled into a social media war with Egyptians exchanging sharp retorts calling on Mr. Sisi to resign or defending his record. In Chechnya, where the Egypt team is training, the autocratic leader Ramzan A. Kadyrov made Mr. Salah an honorary citizen.On Monday, Egypt plays its third and final game against Saudi Arabia, the competition\u2019s lowest ranked team. Mr. Salah is expected to score. Although Egypt cannot progress to the next round, a win could salve the country\u2019s bruised morale, said Hatem Maher, a sports journalist with the state-owned Ahram Online news website.If nothing else, the roller-coaster World Cup ride has offered a pointed lesson to Egyptians conditioned by decades of strongman rule.\u201cIt shows that we can\u2019t rely on one guy,\u201d Sabir Mohammed, a carpenter, said after the Russia game. \u201cWe have to learn to play as a team.\u201dNour Yousef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Brewery to Bakery: A Flour That Fights Waste", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor some people, beer is the perfect end to a workday. For Bertha Jimenez, it\u2019s the start of a new way to eliminate food waste.Breweries throw out millions of pounds of used grain every day that could have other uses. While some is repurposed as animal feed, compostable products or heating fuel, little has been exploited for its value as food.The potential for recycling beer waste first came into the cross hairs of Ms. Jimenez, an immigrant from Ecuador, while she was working toward her doctorate in 2015 at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University. Intent on finding ways to reduce industrial waste, she started a side project with like-minded friends \u2014 most of them also immigrants \u2014 and craft beer provided an easy target: Everyone loved it, but it had issues.Ms. Jimenez lives in Brooklyn, which at last count had 20 craft breweries that are tossing out grain. Ms. Jimenez and Ashwin Gopi, a classmate and a founder of Rise, began asking around for samples so they could figure out how best to reuse them.Brewing relies on grains, typically malted barley, which are first soaked in hot water. This step releases sugars that are crucial to the later production of alcohol. Once those sugars are released into the liquid, the grain is discarded.Knowing that barley was healthful, Mr. Gopi, Ms. Jimenez and a third founder, Jessica Aguirre, nibbled it plain. Spent grains look and taste like brown rice, without the heft. They stirred the stuff into porridge, and baked it into cookies and cakes. But when they took the dried grain to bakers to gauge their interest, they were met with shrugs.Today, the Rise Products team makes its flour in a commercial kitchen in Long Island City, Queens. The grains are dried in an oven, then ground, milled and sifted into a fine flour \u2014 all by hand, which is why it costs $8 a pound wholesale, and $16 retail. The price will drop, the partners say, when they raise more money, move to a bigger space and automate the process.But because of the growing interest in reducing waste, many chefs and bakers are already eager to work with what the team is calling its \u201cSuper Flour.\u201dAs barley contains less gluten than wheat, it works better with foods that don\u2019t need to rise much, like biscuits or bread, Mr. Gamoran used the Rise flour for biscotti, crisp shortbread and wafers, which he thought were \u201c400 times better then anything I had put together\u201d in the past.And because brewing removes sugars, Rise flour has one-third the carbohydrates of traditional all-purpose flour; because it\u2019s made from barley, it has twice the protein and 12 times the fiber.Rise now uses about 1,200 pounds of grain a week, from several craft brewers in Brooklyn; it takes about four and a half pounds of grain to make one pound of flour.In preparation for the final exhibition, Ms. Jimenez and Ms. Aguirre managed to make a cup of flour using a microwave at their Airbnb apartment in Rome. The two baked a loaf of banana bread and served it to Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, the Vatican\u2019s point person at the presentation. He liked it. \u201cIt was a proud moment,\u201d Ms. Aguirre said.The team hopes to move beyond brewery waste. It can use byproducts from wineries or juice bars; anything with a moisture content of more than 70 percent will work. With infinite waste streams to be tapped, the founders \u2014 who hail from India, Lithuania, Korea and other nations \u2014 have their sights set beyond the United States.\u201cIn the long term, we can bring this to countries like ours,\u201d Ms. Jimenez said. \u201cWe want to look at technologies that won\u2019t be prohibitive for other people to have.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instagram Goes Long. Will You Follow?", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey came for Snapchat. Now they\u2019re gunning for YouTube with hour-long video. The influencers are stoked.Sam Sheffer, a former tech journalist, has 165,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel and only 29,800 followers on Instagram. He said that he still intended to use the new feature.\u201cEveryone spends time on Instagram,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single person is always on Instagram. When you go to YouTube, you\u2019re actively looking for something. Instagram, you\u2019re waiting in line and it\u2019s like, let me just go waste some time.\u201d\u201cFor a lot of our fan base, the simplest things in a sense can be kind of difficult for them,\u201d he said. \u201cJust trying to turn your screen to look at another platform, some people might see that as kind of difficult. It\u2019s easier to have something made specifically for a phone.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what kind of brands are hopping on board, what the monetization policies are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cool thing, all of that has to be established for the first time just like it was with YouTube.\u201dShe expected IGTV to alleviate the difficulty of coaxing fans to follow her from the app to YouTube, where her subscriber base is much smaller than the 141,000 strong who follow her on Instagram. She would not disclose if Instagram paid her to appear at the event.\u201cI was saying all day yesterday this was top three best moments of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like this is really going to change a lot in the social media world, and social media is one of the most important things in any industry.\u201d Instagram would not comment on any financial arrangement it had made with those who appeared at the event. Instagram said it has not yet decided how and when it will monetize IGTV. Those interviewed did not seem concerned.He said that Instagram was the only platform big enough to take on YouTube and that it had a natural advantage on the phone. He expects many faithful users of that platform to gravitate to IGTV, where highly produced, glossy videos have already sprung into rotation.Creators said that the key difference between IGTV and YouTube was that, on the Google-owned video platform, users sought out videos directly. Instagram, on the other hand, allowed for their videos to be discovered spontaneously, and the seamless autoplay will make it even more difficult. The vertical video format, which Instagram has emphasized as a selling point, was popularized by Snapchat, which IGTV seeks to supplant.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Prince Who Would Remake the World", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "OpinionIn Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Saudi Arabia, women will take the wheel. How much is really changing?Supported byOpinion ColumnistAt the approach of members of the Saudi religious police, whose official mission is to promote virtue and prevent vice, she reached for her head scarf. She did not, however, put it on. Enough already, she thought.\u201cCover your head!\u201d the agents ordered her.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d they muttered, \u201cmay God protect you.\u201dWith that, the bearded enforcers limped away. They used to descend on stores that sell the shapeless black gowns called abayas imposed on Saudi women, scoop up those with any adornment \u2014 a trace of color, beads \u2014 and burn them. No longer: These once-feared upholders of a puritanical Islamic order are now defanged \u2014 completely neutered, as the woman put it to me.The prince\u2019s apparent aim is to upend just about everything, except the absolute rule exercised since 1932 by the House of Saud, with the help of oil and American power. He wants to liberalize, at least economically and socially, and so demonstrate that Islam, in the nation of its holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, is not a harsh, unbendable rule book based on ancient scripture but is rather compatible with modernity and tolerance.That\u2019s a bold project. The prince\u2019s father, the 82-year-old King Salman, is \u201cthe custodian of the two holy mosques.\u201d Custodianship is a conservative business. Look no further than Egypt\u2019s assassinated Anwar el-Sadat or the toppled shah of Iran to see the fate of tradition-trampling Westernizing leaders of Muslim Middle Eastern states. Saudi Arabia is not any such state. It\u2019s the lodestar.Perhaps his most radical proposition is the empowerment of women because the genuine liberation \u2014 and that\u2019s still in doubt \u2014 of half the Saudi population would transform the country and send a clear message of a modernized Islam.The prince\u2019s makeover could, in theory, change more than Saudi Arabia. Five times a day many of the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims turn toward the country in prayer. \u201cWhen people look at Saudi Arabia, see Mecca and Medina, they want to emulate it,\u201d the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told me in an interview. \u201cWhen they see openness and moderation and tolerance and innovation, that\u2019s what they want to be.\u201d No other country, he argued, has \u201cthat soft power.\u201dIn other words, change Islam in its Saudi nucleus and you change the world. It was not, of course, Saudi moderation that put 15 Saudis on the 9/11 planes. It was the well-funded metastasis of extreme Saudi religious intolerance \u2014 its Wahhabi orthodoxy \u2014 into forms of murderous Islamist hatred of the apostate West. It was the House of Saud\u2019s unseemly deal with fundamentalist clerical firebrands: Spare us here at home, and we\u2019ll grant you license abroad.It could still be that M.B.S. is the great Make Believe Show. But something is moving. Cynicism is too facile. \u201cI get annoyed with the West telling us the changes are cosmetic,\u201d Hoda Abdulrahman al-Helaissi, one of the first female members of the Shura Council, an advisory body to the king, told me. \u201cWe are changing at the rate of a high-speed train, not of a rocket. Young people, and 70 percent of the population is under 30, don\u2019t want to live as we lived. The prince understood we have to pull the tooth from the mouth!\u201dPrince Mohammed is everywhere, even when, as in recent weeks, he scales back his public appearances. I went to see Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, the economy minister, to find out how the heir to the throne operates. He told me he\u2019d met six times with the crown prince the previous week. M.B.S. fires rat-tat-tat questions at him: What do you need from me? What do you think of that crowd-management software for the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca? How do we make things happen? One meeting took place at 4 a.m.Things are happening, all right. A new Jeddah airport opened last month. The Riyadh subway will begin operation next year. Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil giant, is to be partly privatized. Ground has just been broken near Riyadh on a vast, multibillion-dollar \u201centertainment city\u201d that will include a Six Flags theme park and create 50,000 Saudi jobs, the minister said.Instead of husbands ferrying their wives around, women will be able to drive from A to B. Saudization of the work force is also feminization. \u201cOur preference ultimately is no difference between men and women in terms of involvement and seniority in the economy,\u201d the minister said.Rulers over 80, a Saudi norm, may be wise, but they are not risk-takers. Now, with the crown prince, gradualism is gone. It\u2019s all \u201cVision 2030,\u201d his slogan, and K.P.I.s (key performance indicators) on a forced march to a less oil-dependent country of mass tourism, empowered women, renewable energy, theme parks and the rest.Believe it if you will. This is the Saudi Arabia the crown prince sought to sell during a three-week American roadshow that ended in April. From Trump to Richard Branson, from Jeff Bezos to Oprah Winfrey, he peddled his message of reinvention and urged American investors to join the party. The second school is the pride-before-a-fall faction. They see a rash leader, as corrupt as those he\u2019s accused of corruption, embarked on the helter-skelter pursuit of modernization as he reinforces rule by royal decree, cutting subsidies even as he acquired a French chateau for several hundred million dollars. \u201cM.B.S. is erratic, irrational and immature,\u201d Samer Shehata, a professor of Middle East studies at the University of Oklahoma, told me. \u201cIs he really the man who can reconcile Saudi Arabia with the modern world?\u201dAt a restaurant, over rice and lamb, I met with a man in his 30s, a former journalist who\u2019s taken himself off Twitter and decided to go abroad for a few years to sit out what he sees as an unpredictable, troubling moment. What sort of transformation, he asked me, includes no political change and shuts the door on more freedom? In what kind of society are you a national security risk if you question the bungled war in Yemen? Saudi society, he mused, never challenges the government \u2014 as a public, press or parliament. Nor, it seems, will it any time soon.In a transition to democracy, the core question is often the degree to which civilian leaders can bring the military under control. But democracy is a nonstarter in Saudi Arabia. In the hybrid Saudi transition, the question is how far the Wahhabi religious conservatism that created security problems around the world, and made Saudi Arabia a very repressive place, can be curtailed on the way to \u201cnormality.\u201d Judged on that basis, I\u2019d say Prince Mohammed\u2019s chances of success are good for two reasons: He has amassed tremendous power, and tens of millions of restive young Saudis back him.That sounded much more like a needed Saudi mea culpa.A huge CNN screen behind the minister churned through stock prices, Trump and tumult. It\u2019s a reactionary moment in world affairs, yet maybe, just maybe, Saudi Arabia can inch in the other direction under the crown prince. Tuwaijri said: \u201cI'm not sure if the pace is sustainable. But 90 percent of the time he's cool.\u201d The minister paused before adding, \u201cAnd he's ready to change his mind.\u201dCould the Saudi prince, Qataris wonder, be suffering from a touch of pique and envy? Certainly, he has shown recklessness, both here and in Yemen, where the military coalition Saudi Arabia leads has been placed on a United Nations \u201clist of shame\u201d for the killing and maiming of children.The thrust was clear: To heck with Big Brother\u2019s demands to shut down Al Jazeera and cut off all relations with Iran!In response, Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, was equally defiant. I asked him in Riyadh why Saudi Arabia \u2014 along with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt \u2014 had imposed the blockade. \u201cHate!\u201d he said. \u201cInterfering in our affairs, paying money to terrorists.\u201d He urged Qatar \u201cto move from denial to introspection,\u201d adding that \u201cuntil they change, we\u2019re not going to talk to them.\u201dThe Qatar blockade was imposed on June 5, 2017, two weeks after Trump\u2019s lovefest in Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip as president. Trump exulted on Twitter: This was a blow to \u201cradical ideology.\u201d The president has since tried to row back his elation, and he hosted Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar at the White House in April. The fact is that neither Saudi Arabia nor Qatar is innocent when it comes to having funded Islamist extremism.Trump, at heart, has no interest in the details. His uncritical embrace of Saudi Arabia reflects a radical gut-driven, money-tinged reorientation of American foreign policy in the Middle East.This infuriated Saudis and the United Arab Emirates. It terrified them. In Trump they saw opportunity, plying him with flattery and blandishments. He has duly shredded Obama\u2019s attempted Saudi-Iranian rebalancing.The problem is Iran is a big, resource-rich country. Qatar and Iran share the world\u2019s biggest gas field. As Thani, the Qatari foreign minister, told me, Qatar has \u201clegitimate reason to have a relationship with Iran.\u201d In fact, it has no choice. But for Trump, and Prince Mohammed, any tie with Iran is heinous. Several times from Saudi ministers I heard Iran compared to Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime. The crown prince himself uses the analogy. This is pure Iran Derangement Syndrome. Iran is a repressive country with a hideous human rights record (just like Saudi Arabia) and an expansionist agenda in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. It needs to be confronted, with great firmness and creative diplomacy. It will not, however, surrender to Trump\u2019s braggadocio or Prince Mohammed\u2019s absolute demands, which play into the hands of Iranian hard-liners. So, as the United Arab Emirates\u2019 ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba, told me over lunch in Washington, a big push went into backing the counterrevolution \u2014 that is, along with Saudi Arabia, plying tens of billions of dollars into backing the movement that ousted Morsi and installing as president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, whose repression of the Brotherhood has been brutal.This is the fundamental disagreement with Prince Mohammed, the basic Middle Eastern schism. He is betting that he can crush the Brotherhood and its sympathizers in Qatar, as well as crush Iran and its sympathizers in Yemen.Three years after it began, the Yemen war continues unabated, with widespread starvation, cholera, thousands dead, accounts of indiscriminate Saudi bombing of hospitals and schools, Houthi missiles being fired into Saudi Arabian towns, and spreading misery. If the prince can indeed change his mind, Qatar and Yemen would be good places to start. Qatar is not going to genuflect to every demand. Yemen is not going to be an Iran-free zone. \u201cWhere would we be if the Yemen war had not taken place?\u201d Helaissi, the Shura member, asked me. \u201cBut this has been terrible for our image around the world. I think it\u2019s our Vietnam.\u201dI went down to Jeddah, the Red Sea Saudi port and gateway for pilgrimages to Mecca. On the corniche, dotted with beaches, flanked by a new bike path, high-rise condos are going up beside luxury hotels. I tried to imagine this pleasant, uncluttered stretch of coast as a kind of Saudi Canc\u00fan a decade from now, with busloads of tourists clogging the streets.It was a stretch. What I saw was a pier with shaded areas down which formless black shapes \u2014 that is to say, women \u2014 glided with their faces veiled, one woman lifting the black flap over her mouth to insert an ice cream cone; and an official telling a little girl to get off her tricycle. I turned from the sea, where nobody swam, and looked for somewhere to get a cold drink by the beach. The Starbucks was closed for prayer. I waited in the blistering heat.At the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, I asked Saud Bin Saleh Al-Sarhan, the secretary general, and Abdullah bin Khalid Al-Saud, the director of research, how far the Saudi makeover could go. They suggested that where there is disagreement between Islamic scholars change would occur, but where there is unanimity it would not.Women would go uncovered; store closings for prayer and restaurant gender segregation would end; the crippling system of \u201cguardianship\u201d (already crumbling) that allows men to control the movement and lives of Saudi women would unravel; Medina might be accessible to non-Muslim tourists, Mecca probably not.However, alcohol, same-sex marriage and going public about homosexuality would never be allowed.I visited the Riyadh driving school for women, out on a university campus. It has a waiting list of a mere 70,000. Here, some 3,000 registered students go through 30 hours of training, for about $600, or about six times the cost of the course for men. (Saudi authorities insist the quality of the training is higher.) Her analysis of her country at the cusp struck me as about right. The crown prince is genuine. He\u2019s put his finger on what is keeping Saudi Arabia back. He lacks wisdom, especially on Qatar. There are lots of red lines, new and old, constant censorship, calls to blacklist any \u201canti-Saudi\u201d media. The centralization of power is alarming. Changes have occurred but have not been framed in law, which makes them vulnerable. And so? \u201cI am hopeful,\u201d Fassi told me. \u201cHopeful that 10 years from now we will have a public sphere that is more humane and safe for women, freed of the guardianship\u2019s abuses, and that will be good for the Saudi economy.\u201dI also think that will happen. If it does, Saudi Arabia\u2019s embodiment of a harsh, troublemaking Islam will have collapsed, and that could usher in the post-post-9/11 era. As a sign of his intent, Prince Mohammed should immediately release the female activists recently detained.Advertisement"}

The commission is empowered to impose fines of up to $11bn \u2014 which is 10 percent of the global turnover of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet \u2014 but typically decisions are at the lower end of the range.The decision will mark an escalation of the commission\u2019s battle with Google, which began eight years ago with an investigation into comparison shopping, then only a narrow part of online commerce. Though that case concluded with a \u20ac2.4bn fine, it has not led to significant changes to Google\u2019s business.The issue with AndroidAs the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android.The bigger picture\u2014 Michael de la MercedAthenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday:To ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership.The context Over the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealth\u2019s co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home.In an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit:\u201cI believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country \u2013 these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, it\u2019s easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.\u201dWhat happens nowAthenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale.Elliott\u2019s response to the newsFrom a spokesman:\u201cElliott welcomes the Board\u2019s decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth\u2019s shareholders, employees and customers. We have long believed that athenahealth is a great company, and we look forward to participating as a bidder in the company\u2019s strategic exploration process.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedMembers of the British government\u2019s digital, culture, media, and sports committee tried to catch him out with questions about a series of media reports on Cambridge Analytica, but they didn\u2019t seem to unsettle the ex-C.E.O.Things didn\u2019t start well for Mr. Nix. He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide \u201cfew clarifications\u201d about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasn\u2019t.Here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing:\u201cThe allegation is false, the facts are not correct.\u201d\u201cThose boxes were not ours. As far as I\u2019m aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t represent the company properly, I didn\u2019t represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.\u201dDid Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users.\u201cIt was my firm impression that Mr. Collins\u2019 questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data\u2026 so I answered no.\u201d\u201cWhen I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.\u201d\u201cI also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebook\u2019s request.\u201dHow useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the company\u2019s work in the U.S.?\u201cThat data was less useful than simply using Facebook\u2019s own advertising algorithms.\u201d\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMore from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance:Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends \u2014 including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.According to Facebook, the user data stayed on phones and never reached those companies\u2019 servers. Lawmakers are irate anyway: Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that he will \u201clook forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that.\u201dMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced that he was dismissing the bureau\u2019s consumer advisory board, which provides feedback on its rules and policies.By law, the bureau must convene the advisory board and hold an in-person meeting with its members at least twice a year. The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week.Anthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group.The consumer advisory board\u2019s members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard.The White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly.\u201cAnything that we can do to unlock government data, we\u2019re committed to. We\u2019d love to hear from any academic that has any insights.\u201dSo far, a big part of the administration\u2019s approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly. It also says that it\u2019s increased investment in R.&D. for \u201cA.I. and related technologies\u201d by more than 40 percent since 2015 \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear what those \u201crelated technologies\u201d are.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeElsewhere in tradeBut something bigger is at work. Comcast is also challenging Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for most of Fox, which includes 39 percent of Sky. (Got all that?) If Comcast could buy the 61 percent of Sky that Fox doesn\u2019t already own, it would be a considerable blow to the Disney deal. Oh, and Comcast is expected to fight hard for the other Fox assets that Disney wants, too.In a survey, America\u2019s CEOs expressed concern over the Trump administration\u2019s approach to trade, with 95 percent of respondents seeing a moderate or serious risk of \u201cforeign trade retaliation leading to lower U.S. exports.\u201d\u201cAs you may have read, Uber is now run by your dad \u2014 so, no, that interpretation was lost on him, but he appreciates Business Insider pointing it out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

While on a merchant mission on Thursday, the ship came to the assistance of a boat in distress 5 miles off the coast of Pozzallo, Italy.\u201cThey have the right to live,\u201d Axel Steier, a Mission Lifeline founder, said of the migrants. \u201cAnd they have a right to seek asylum, and that isn\u2019t being guaranteed at the moment. It\u2019s kind of like you are jailed on the ocean.\u201dMr. Steier, who said the MV Lifeline was waiting off the western coast of Malta, described the rescue vessel as a \u201cball in a political game.\u201d The migrants onboard, all of whom are from sub-Saharan Africa, had set off from Libya on two dinghies.The group is mostly made up of men, with 14 women and at least four children among them, Mr. Steier said. He called the idea of transporting migrants back to Libya inhumane and contrary to international human rights norms.Describing migrants\u2019 accounts relayed to worked on the ship, he said, \u201cWe have women who have been raped, and also people who have been tortured.\u201dHe said the migrants had been rescued in Libyan waters and therefore should be returned to Libya, an assertion that the staff of the MV Lifeline denies.The Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Center \u2014 which coordinates sea rescues and provides location details of distressed boats in Italian waters to charities and merchant vessels in the Mediterranean \u2014 was involved in coordinating both of the rescues. But the Italian authorities would not let the ships dock, Mr. Steier said.The Maltese authorities brought humanitarian supplies to the MV Lifeline on Saturday, but Malta also refused entry, saying it could not take responsibility for the ship.Even as MV Lifeline and Maersk Alexander waited to see where they could dock, other rescues continued in the Mediterranean.The charity Doctors Without Borders, which takes part in rescue efforts there, said the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Center had alerted the group to seven boats at risk on Sunday with around 1,000 people onboard.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, speaking ahead of the meeting, said changes needed to be made to European policies requiring that refugees claim asylum in the first country they arrive in.Because of Italy\u2019s location in the Mediterranean, it is responsible for the majority of new arrivals hoping to reach Europe from Libya and claim asylum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video Shows Border Patrol SUV Hitting Native American Man, Then Driving Away", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBUQUERQUE \u2014 Tensions flared on Friday between federal authorities in Arizona and residents of a Native American reservation straddling the border with Mexico after a video surfaced in which a Border Patrol vehicle appears to hit a man from the tribe before driving away.\u201cThey just ran me over, bro,\u201d Mr. Remes is heard saying on the video. He told The Arizona Daily Star that he was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of injuries from the incident, which took place on Tohono O\u2019odham land about 60 miles southwest of Tucson. Mr. Remes appeared to be standing in a dirt road facing the vehicle when it made contact, knocking him to the ground.Mr. Remes told the newspaper that the driver of the vehicle did not stop.The United States Border Patrol said in a statement that it was \u201cactively investigating\u201d the incident. \u201cWe do not tolerate misconduct on or off duty and will fully cooperate with all investigations of alleged unlawful conduct by our personnel,\u201d the Border Patrol said.Robert G. Daniels, a spokesman in Arizona for the Border Patrol, said the agency was not able to release the identity of the agent involved in the episode; the video seems to show the vehicle speeding away after the victim is hit.\u201cAll I can say is that this incident is under investigation,\u201d Mr. Daniels said.The vehicle incident is the most recent episode in a history of strain between federal authorities and the Tohono O\u2019odham, a tribe with about 34,000 enrolled members whose territory straddles the border between the United States and Mexico. The tribe controls about 2.8 million acres in Arizona.Edward D. Manuel, the chairman of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, said in a statement that the victim is 34 years old. Mr. Manuel, who did not identify the victim by name, added that the tribe\u2019s police department was investigating the incident together with the F.B.I. and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201cThe Nation is aware of disturbing video footage of the incident,\u201d Mr. Manuel said, adding that it was under \u201cactive investigation.\u201dLeaders of the tribe have expressed opposition to President Trump\u2019s pledge to build a wall through their land along the border. Largely because officials strengthened security at other points along the border, the reservation of the Tohono O\u2019odham has emerged as an important transit point for unauthorized immigrants and drug traffickers, leading to frequent encounters with law enforcement and the Border Patrol.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watching the World Cup in a War Zone, Where Every Goal Matters", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAVDIIVKA, Ukraine \u2014 Headquarters for the 2nd Battalion of the 92nd Brigade of the Ukrainian Army is in a pummeled building that once housed the district road repair agency. War has left the building in even worse shape than the roads. At the entrances, sandbags and tires are stacked in fortification. Logs reinforce the basement ceiling against the shelling.In the command center, a quarter mile from the front line of a simmering conflict, troop locations are shown on one television. There are blue triangles for the Ukrainian military, red diamonds for the Russian-backed separatists. A second television shows surveillance from cameras placed along the firing zone.A peculiar and fragile normalcy has returned to the mining and steel region of eastern Ukraine after four years of fighting that has taken roughly 10,300 lives and displaced about 1.5 million people. Low-grade skirmishes continue daily, and people are still dying, but the Ukrainian military and the separatists have reached a treaty-enforced standstill, like boxers in a clinch.On Thursday, for the first half anyway, the usual thud of nighttime shelling remained largely silent as some Ukrainian commanders, troops and townspeople watched Russia cruise to a 5-0 victory over Saudi Arabia, sports briefly distracting from politics and war.Oleg A., 40, the Ukrainian commander of the 2nd Battalion, who like many soldiers declined to give his full name, turned the television to soccer more out of obligation than curiosity. It was for the others, he said. He prefers Formula One auto racing.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why 22 people run around with one ball,\u201d he said.Ukraine did not qualify for this year\u2019s World Cup. Still, some soldiers said that they looked forward to watching the matches, if disruptions caused by a blocked Ukrainian television channel and slow local internet service could be resolved.\u201cIt unloads your brain,\u201d said a soldier who gave his name as Nikolai. \u201cWhen you are in the trenches, you can watch a match and the way the ball is passed and you forget everything.\u201dMany international observers wondered before the World Cup whether fighting would escalate or calm down during the tournament. As the opener began, Oleg A., the battalion commander, led a Times reporter, photographer and translator along a two-mile excursion of Ukrainian combat positions near the front line, to see if any of his troops were watching.Graying and brawny, garrulous and darkly funny in the way of soldiers, Oleg A. carried an AK-47. The fields and forest felt empty, hushed. The loudest sounds seemed to come from the trilling of birds.\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be any shooting for two hours,\u201d he said of the rebels. \u201cRussia is playing. Everyone will be watching, 100 percent.\u201dNear a bunker along a weed-strewn, defended highway, Oleg A. encountered four of his soldiers. Two were filling sandbags. One of them, Aleksandr I., 27, said, \u201cWe love football but we don\u2019t have the capacity to watch. The internet is too slow.\u201dOleg A. laughed and said, \u201cWe will only hear it.\u201dHe looked toward a rebel position just over a mile away. \u201cIf those guys will be shouting, everything will be fine,\u201d he said.At the next Ukrainian position, an Orthodox church along a dirt road in the forest, soccer was again absent. Same problem with the internet.Water was offered from a well.\u201cIt\u2019s holy water,\u201d one soldier said.\u201cNo,\u201d another said, \u201cit\u2019s beer.\u201dOne of the soldiers, Maxsim S., is a 35-year-old lieutenant who also coaches soccer. Asked what he felt about the Russian team, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m not against and I\u2019m not for. They are people. There is a division between people and the government.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re starting to worry me,\u201d his commander cut in. \u201cYou sound like a philosopher.\u201dSix years ago, Ukraine played co-host to the last major international soccer tournament held in the region, when it shared the 2012 European championships with Poland.The industrial city of Donetsk \u2014 only a few miles from the Ukrainian positions \u2014 hosted five matches, including a semifinal. The atmosphere was festive back then. Acrobats walked outside the stadium on stilts. Security personnel carried riot helmets in the crook of their arms, like baskets of flowers. A new airport opened for the tournament. The architectural tilt of Donbas Arena made it seem to lift off like a flying saucer.But Donetsk is no longer controlled by the Ukrainian government. The city is rebel-held and the separatist area is known as the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic. The New York Times repeatedly requested permission to enter the rebel area during the World Cup but was denied.Fighting here began in 2014, after Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, fled the country and separatist movements broke out in two eastern Ukrainian provinces. (Russia also annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine that year.) The airport in Donetsk was shelled to a husk. Donbas Arena was wounded, less seriously, by shrapnel.The stadium now sits empty. Its former occupant, the Ukrainian champion soccer team Shakhtar Donetsk, now plays its home matches 200 miles away in Kharkiv.Last month, after Shakhtar clinched its 11th title in the Ukrainian Premier League, Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro Poroshenko, wrote in a congratulatory message on Facebook: \u201cI have no doubt that the time will come and this renowned football club will return to its home stadium in the de-occupied Donetsk and will glorify the Ukrainian state with new successes, including in the Champions League.\u201dIn most countries, soccer and politics are inextricably connected, like a ball to a foot. Ukraine\u2019s national public television network declined to broadcast the World Cup this year, saying it would amount to Russian propaganda. The Ukrainian soccer federation did not grant credentials to the country\u2019s journalists or request its quota of tickets. There were calls by some politicians to boycott the tournament.But Ukrainians are passionate about soccer, and there is no comparable international sporting event between mid-June and mid-July. Two other Ukrainian channels decided to broadcast the matches, and some 6,000 Ukrainian fans purchased tickets to attend games in Russia.Still, Andriy Pavelko, the president of the Ukrainian soccer federation, said that he would follow the matches only on Italian or British television. \u201cWe must have some moral restrictions,\u201d he told reporters.Yuri Zapisotsky, general secretary of the soccer federation, said in a statement that any broadcasts of the World Cup by Ukrainian channels would be considered collaboration \u201cwith the country-aggressor,\u201d meaning Russia.Eastern Ukraine, though, is far from politics in the distant capital of Kiev. Many people in this region have cultural or familial ties to Russia. In Avdiivka (pronounced av-DEEV-ka) there appears to be little, if any, stigma in rooting for the Russian national team.\u201cIt\u2019s only football,\u201d Inna Koslova, 50, a resident, said as she walked home from a convenience store. \u201cWe don\u2019t divide people here.\u201dThe town has a population estimated between 20,000 and 34,000. Life is a jarring mix of the routine and the disrupted. Children and soldiers play soccer at the local stadium, ignoring jagged shrapnel in the grass.Artyom A., the leader of a unit affiliated with an ultranationalist Ukrainian volunteer battalion known as the Right Sector, picked up a piece of spiky metal and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t explode.\u201dThere are two smaller soccer fields, with artificial turf, where children and adults play in late afternoons in the center of town. Like others strolling in the evening and sitting on park benches, they ignore the sound of mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and tubelike, anti-tank weapons known as SPGs that ritualistically begin to boom like fireworks in the distance.\u201cIt\u2019s not heavy shelling,\u201d said Dima Belous, 13. \u201cYou get used to it.\u201dThe last heavy fighting here occurred in February 2017, evidenced by the punch-drunk apartment blocks with their pockmarked facades at the city\u2019s edge. Along Yasinovatskyi Lane, leading to the 2nd Battalion headquarters, most everyone has left behind their battered homes, their cherry and apricot trees and even some of their pets. \u201cLooking for a cat,\u201d says a sign spray-painted on a wall.The home of Nina and Evgeni Kovalyova is typical on this street: shrapnel holes in the metal gate, plastic covering the windows, replacement tin on the shelled roof, no gas for heat in the winter, only well water to drink.The couple, both pensioners, left for a time when the fighting began, but returned to protect their belongings, to renew their sense of place. \u201cWhere to go?\u201d Nina Kovalyova, 64, said. \u201cHow to move?\u201dIn a way, she feels lucky. She took visitors to a neighbor\u2019s empty house across the street, saying looters had stolen nearly everything there, \u201ceven the spoons and forks.\u201dShe would like to watch the World Cup, she said, if the available Ukrainian television channel is unblocked. But she especially misses traveling to Donbas Arena with her daughter, granddaughter and son-in-law to watch Shakhtar Donetsk.\u201cEverything is good when it is close to home,\u201d Ms. Kovalyova said. \u201cWhen it flees, it\u2019s not the same.\u201dUp the road, Oleg A. returned to 2nd Battalion headquarters at halftime of the World Cup opener, ferried in a combat ambulance. The driver, Capt. Valentin Kocherzhuk, 56, said he expected shooting from the rebels whether Russia won or lost.\u201cIt\u2019s better to hope for 0-0,\u201d he said.At headquarters, the score was relayed. Russia was already ahead 2-0.The match was being shown on a Russian television channel. Capt. Dima Shvets, 29, sat in a lounge chair the color of camouflage. He seemed to be the biggest soccer fan at headquarters and said he would love to attend a World Cup.Even in Russia?\u201cI\u2019d rather go to Brazil,\u201d he said.Others chose not to watch. It was a matter of principle, said Lt. Alexei J, who is 34. He pointed to his arm and lifted his olive drab T-shirt to show his scars, including a thick pink line along his abdomen.\u201cAll of my 100 shards are telling me not to watch football,\u201d he said.Lt. Dmitry Yarovoy, 28, the battalion chief of staff, also did not plan to watch. Games seemed too frivolous when enemy soldiers faced one another only 40 or 50 meters apart. \u201cWe are not in the right place and the right time to watch football,\u201d he said.He spent much of the second half in front of a television, observing surveillance cameras along the front line. The Ukrainians had received small-arms fire from the rebels during the first half, he said. Now a sniper and eight or nine other separatists had moved beneath a bridge about three-quarters of a mile away.Russia went ahead 3-0, but Oleg paid little attention. He had eaten a bowl of cold soup and removed his boots. In his sandals, he peered at his laptop and ordered a strike of 73-millimeter SPG projectiles to push the rebels back. The artillery kicked up plumes of dust and smoke.\u201cOur night games,\u201d Capt. Shvets said.The rebels responded with 82-millimeter mortar fire. Oleg glanced at the match and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to put a big shell in the center of the field.\u201d He sensed that he had gone too far. Quickly, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s a joke.\u201dRussia went ahead by 4-0, then 5-0. The Ukrainians lobbed 120-millimeter mortar fire. Oleg motioned his hands, explaining that one side played a card, then the other side raised the bet.\u201cFootball is finished,\u201d Capt. Shvets said. \u201cNow we start poker.\u201dIuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, and Katerina Malofeyeva from Avdiivka.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco Restaurants Can\u2019t Afford Waiters. So They\u2019re Putting Diners to Work.", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UpshotThe city offers a case study of how high housing costs alter the economics of everything else, including restaurant service. The small menu is so appealing and the place itself so charming that you almost forget, as a diner, that you have to do much of the work of dining out yourself. You scout your own table. You fetch and fill your own water glass. And if you\u2019d like another glass of wine, you go back to the counter. Inside these restaurants, it\u2019s evident that the forces making this one of the most expensive cities in America are subtly altering the economics of everything. Commercial rents have gone up. Labor costs have soared. And restaurant workers, many of them priced out by the expense of housing, have been moving away. San Francisco\u2019s tech riches have fed demand for restaurants \u2014 and some wealthy tech workers have decided they would also like to be partners in a restaurant, opening up more investment. But as those highly paid workers have also driven demand for scarce housing, the city has struggled to keep lower-wage workers afloat. If customers won\u2019t buy $20 burgers, or $25 dosas, and the staff in the kitchen can\u2019t be cut, that something is service. \u201cAnd that is what we did \u2014 we got rid of our servers,\u201d Mr. Mitra said. Charles Bililies had worked in fine-dining restaurants for years before he opened the first Souvla in 2014. By then, restaurateurs were already fretting about the city\u2019s employer mandates and housing costs. \u201cWe can sit around here, and we can complain and whine and moan,\u201d Mr. Bililies said. \u201cWe can be very negative about this. Or we can sort of turn this on its head and see an opportunity.\u201dAt Souvla, there is no oversize menu board above the counter, no service line where your food is assembled before your eyes. Behind the counter sits a shelf of wine glasses for the all-Greek wine list, touches that make the place feel plausible for a dinner date. At the original Souvla, the counter is just inside the front door, so a line invariably spills onto the sidewalk, a neat marketing trick that also means the restaurant wastes little of its rented space on waiting customers.The model and the small menu are conducive to takeout, which produces more than half of the revenue at this location. The restaurant has just 40 seats, but now averages more than 900 meals a day, far more than a full-service restaurant could manage in the same space. For restaurateurs, counter service makes fine dining \u2014 or something like it \u2014 profitable. To economists, it makes sense. David Neumark, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has studied the minimum wage, recalled a trip to Norway where nearly every restaurant he and his wife visited relied on counter service.Innovations in farming machinery or microwave meals, for instance, freed up people to be more productive, and better paid. But that is not entirely what is happening here. Restaurants haven\u2019t developed a way to serve meals with less labor. They\u2019ve gotten customers to do the labor they had been paying employees to do. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad,\u201d said Jennifer Sullivan, who worked for years as a server in the area. Twenty years ago, she moved from Chicago to Oakland, where she rented a $750 studio apartment and waitressed her way through college. She fears that story would not be possible in the Bay Area now. When she opened Jardini\u00e8re in 1997, they were 27 percent. (Mr. Bililies said Souvla\u2019s percentage is in the mid-20s now, even with paid vacation and retirement benefits.) Ms. Des Jardins has experimented with raising her prices, but she said customers simply spent the same amount in different ways, skipping a second glass of wine, or ordering two appetizers instead of an entree. At one of her other restaurants in town, she now serves lunch as counter service.\u201cI enjoy doing what I do, and we support a community of people here,\u201d Ms. Des Jardins said. \u201cBut the economics are pretty rotten.\u201d Souvla, on the other hand, is planning to expand beyond the Bay Area, starting with New York. Mr. Bililies said he wanted to occupy \u201ciconic streets in iconic neighborhoods in iconic cities.\u201d The strategy, in other words, is to go to precisely the places with rotten economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Giant Salamanders Pose a Conservation Conundrum", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of the animals now are found on farms in China. Giant salamanders released recently into the wild are genetically distinct from those that evolved there, a man-made \u201cspecies.\u201d \u201cWhen we started the survey, we were sure we\u2019d at least find several salamanders,\u201d said Samuel Turvey, the lead author and a senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London. \u201cIt\u2019s only now that we\u2019ve finished that we realize the actual severity of the situation.\u201dIn the wild, Chinese giant salamanders were not just one species but at least five, and perhaps as many as eight. On farms, they are being muddled into a single hybridized population adapted to no particular environment. \u201cThe farms are driving the extinction of most of the species by homogenizing them,\u201d said Robert Murphy, a co-author and senior curator of herpetology at the Royal Ontario Museum. \u201cWe\u2019re losing genetic diversity and adaptations that have been evolving for millions of years.\u201dAs with so many other protected species in China, poaching is the main threat to giant salamanders, which can weigh up to 140 pounds. Unlike pangolins, tigers and rhinos, however, salamanders were never historically valued as meat, trophies or medicine. \u201cTraditional knowledge associated them with bad luck and dead babies,\u201d Dr. Turvey said. \u201cThey were animals you didn\u2019t want to go near.\u201dThat changed in the mid-20th century when famine forced people to turn to alternative food sources. By the 1990s, giant salamander meat had been rebranded as a luxury food item in China, and government-subsidized salamander farms began popping up around the country.As prices for live animals skyrocketed, captive populations grew and wild ones plummeted. \u201cThe development of this industry led to huge amounts of increased pressure on salamanders, which were poached from the wild to stock these farms,\u201d Dr. Turvey said.Realizing the amphibians were disappearing in nature, officials decided to restock wild populations by releasing captive-born salamanders. But what seemed like a good conservation strategy led to a number of new problems, Dr. Turvey said.Not recognizing that salamanders from different parts of the country were distinct species, farmers had inadvertently created hybrids \u2014 a fact that the researchers confirmed through genetic analysis of over 1,000 captive amphibians.\u201cWhen we looked at farmed animals, we found a large mixture of different genetic components, like a witch\u2019s caldron,\u201d said Jing Che, a herpetologist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology and co-author of both recent studies. No system was ever put in place to prevent hybrids from release into the wild, nor to ensure that reintroduced animals were matched with their geographic origins. \u201cThese hybrids may create a big mess by changing the genetic makeup of locally adapted wild animals,\u201d Dr. Che said.In 2009, Dr. Murphy and his colleagues raised these concerns at a government meeting but were dismissed. \u201cThey just said it wasn\u2019t an issue,\u201d he said.At least 72,000 captive-bred salamanders have been released since then. Until now, the cumulative effect of poaching, farming and release on wild populations was unknown. So in 2013, Dr. Turvey and his colleagues organized a nationwide giant salamander search \u2014 apparently the largest wildlife survey ever conducted in China.They spent three years scanning riverbeds and turning over rocks at 97 sites in 16 provinces. They found giant salamanders at just four sites. All of the animals had genetic profiles that did not match the places in which they were living, indicating they likely originated on farms.The researchers also interviewed nearly 3,000 local people, about half of whom said they had seen giant salamanders in the wild. But the most recent sightings they could recall took place, on average, 18 years ago.\u201cThere could be remnant populations of genuine salamanders scattered here and there, but they are effectively impossible for any researchers to find now,\u201d Dr. Turvey said.Given that, the best strategy for preventing extinction in the wild, he added, is to rescue genetically pure animals from farms, and then undertake carefully controlled conservation breeding to rebuild each species\u2019 numbers. \u201cIf we wait too long, all those wild-caught individuals will be gone,\u201d he said.Releases of giant salamanders without knowing their genetic makeup should stop immediately, Dr. Che added. But that can\u2019t happen without buy-in from Chinese authorities.\u201cWe hope to work with the government to improve the existing conservation plan,\u201d Dr. Che said. \u201cWe have a responsibility to do conservation based on scientific knowledge.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Wins Approval for $85.4 Billion Time Warner Deal in Defeat for Justice Dept.", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday approved the blockbuster merger between AT&T and Time Warner, rebuffing the government\u2019s effort to stop the $85.4 billion deal, in a decision that is expected to unleash a wave of corporate takeovers.The judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, said the Justice Department had not proved that the telecom company\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would lead to fewer choices for consumers and higher prices for television and internet services.The merger would create a media and telecommunications powerhouse, reshaping the landscape of those industries. The combined company would have a library that includes HBO\u2019s hit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and channels like CNN, along with vast distribution reach through wireless and satellite television services across the country.Media executives increasingly say content creation and distribution must be married to survive against technology companies like Amazon and Netflix. Those companies started producing their own shows in just the last several years. But they now spend billions of dollars a year on original programming, and users can stream the video on apps in homes and on mobile devices, putting pressure on traditional media businesses.Executives and investors of other companies had watched the six-week trial closely for signs about how it might affect their ambitions. Comcast, for example, would like to beat out the Walt Disney Company for some of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, but has held off from making a formal bid until the trial ended.The ruling is a major setback for the Justice Department and its antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, whose decision to sue to block the merger broke with convention. Deals such as this one, in which the two companies are in related industries but do not produce competing products, are usually approved by federal regulators.Mr. Delrahim had insisted that the two companies sell some major parts before getting government approval, a demand that the executives rejected. That led the Justice Department to file its lawsuit in November. Judge Leon\u2019s decision essentially confirmed the conventional thinking about antitrust law.Mr. Delrahim appeared somber after the decision. He said he was disappointed and would review the 172-page opinion before deciding whether the government would ask a higher court to issue a stay of the ruling. The Justice Department could appeal the decision even if it did not get an injunction.\u201cI\u2019ve taken an oath to uphold competition,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. \u201cWe are going to take the next steps as necessary.\u201dJudge Leon took the unusual step of warning the government not to try to seek a stay, saying it would hurt the defendants, which had already gone through an 18-month regulatory and legal battle for their review. The companies face a June 21 deadline to close their deal.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that it took 18 months to get here,\u201d Daniel Petrocelli, the lead litigator for AT&T and Time Warner, said outside the courthouse after the opinion. \u201cBut we are relieved it is finally behind us and we look forward to closing the transaction in the upcoming days.\u201dShares in AT&T fell 5.5 percent in morning trading on Wednesday, while shares in Time Warner rose 2.7 percent.The deal was hatched in August 2016 when Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, called Jeff Bewkes, his counterpart at Time Warner. Mr. Bewkes\u2019s company, with its popular HBO shows, live N.B.A. and N.C.A.A. sports broadcasting rights, and CNN, has been a takeover target for years.The two then had a long lunch in the Time Warner dining room in New York and agreed that their industries were under siege. The purchase of Time Warner would give AT&T the premium television content it needed to make its bundle of wireless, television and broadband services more attractive to customers.The deal would put AT&T in charge of Time Warner\u2019s vast portfolio, which includes HBO and CNN, rights to major sports leagues, and valuable film franchises such as Harry Potter. John Stankey, an AT&T executive, would oversee the integration of these units into AT&T and eventually lead the Time Warner business.\u201cWe want people engaged with their mobile devices all day watching movies and video,\u201d Mr. Stephenson testified at the trial.Presidential politics clouded the merger from almost the moment it was announced. President Trump, while still a candidate, said he would block the deal \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dThose comments and his repeated criticism of CNN, which is owned by Time Warner\u2019s Turner Broadcasting unit, raised speculation that Mr. Trump had pushed Mr. Delrahim and the Justice Department to block the deal.But Mr. Delrahim swore to the court that he was not influenced by the White House, and Judge Leon stopped the companies from introducing evidence about possible political interference.\u201cWe always believed that the motivations for bringing this case were questionable at best,\u201d Gary Ginsberg, an executive vice president for Time Warner, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe court\u2019s verdict resoundingly supported that view.\u201dMr. Delrahim had argued that the only way antitrust concerns could be resolved was through the sale of major businesses. Last fall, he presented AT&T and Time Warner with two options: Sell the majority stake in either DirecTV, which is AT&T\u2019s satellite television company, or Turner Broadcasting. The companies rejected both options.Mr. Delrahim\u2019s position, which the White House said it supported, also had the backing of some left-leaning politicians and antitrust experts. They have been increasingly calling for the government to break up Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon and to prevent greater consolidation in health care, media, transportation and agriculture.Judge Leon, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, tried to limit the reach of his opinion, writing that \u201cthe temptation by some to view this decision as being something more than a resolution of this specific case should be resisted by one and all!\u201dBut many antitrust experts and analysts believe the decision will embolden companies to pursue deals.The decision \u201cwill give AT&T market power to raise the price of Time Warner content, and, secondly, it will lead to further vertical mergers in this industry that will harm consumers,\u201d said Steven Salop, an economics and law professor at Georgetown University who has pushed for stronger government regulation.The trial drew large crowds that included executives, hedge fund managers and financial analysts. Mr. Delrahim attended occasionally, and so did Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes. The two executives each took the witness stand to defend the merger.Judge Leon asked few questions during the trial and gave little indication of where he was leaning before his opinion on Tuesday. But many experts felt that the government had struggled to make its case.After Judge Leon delivered his decision to a packed courtroom, representatives from AT&T and Time Warner lined the small hallway just outside. The men and women embraced and clapped one another on the back, beaming as they whispered congratulations.\u201cIt\u2019s a receiving line,\u201d one woman joked, her hands outstretched for the next hug.Cecilia Kang and Emily Cochrane reported from Washington, and Edmund Lee from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Dropped From the Dow After More Than a Century", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were none.General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company\u2019s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company\u2019s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.Over the last year, G.E.\u2019s shares have fallen 55 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Dow. G.E., which closed Tuesday at $12.95, has the lowest share price of any of the index\u2019s 30 components.S. & P. Dow Jones Indices \u2014 which owns the Dow \u2014 suggested that the slide in G.E.\u2019s stock price contributed to the decision to remove the company from the index, where it had been a member continuously since 1907. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction.\u201cThe low price of G.E. shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point,\u201d said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWalgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s share price is higher, and it will contribute more meaningfully to the index.\u201dThe move also is freighted with economic symbolism. With the inclusion of Walgreens Boots, the index \u201cwill be more representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said.The removal of G.E., which will formally occur June 26, reflects a shift in the economic composition of the United States, which long ago tilted away from heavy industry and toward services, such as technology, finance and health care.And it also amounted to a milestone for General Electric. It was the last remaining original member of the index, when the stock market measure was introduced in 1896.Back then, just a few years after the company was formed through a merger of Thomas Edison\u2019s electric companies with a rival, G.E. was the modern-day equivalent of a technology stock, and the Dow itself was geared heavily toward the growth industries of the day such as railroads. In the more than 120 years that followed, the company was often at the center of American capitalism. And as recently as the 1990s. G.E. was at times the most-valuable American company by market value.Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the United States today.After G.E.\u2019s departure from the index, the company with the longest presence in the Dow will be Exxon Mobil, whose corporate predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, joined the Dow in 1928, according to S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.Advertisement"}

No one wants that world.\u201dMr. Hagedorn, who acknowledged that some might look askance at advertisers taking up the cause of ethical persuasion, said he heard Mr. Harris on a podcast last year when his agency was manually reviewing tens of thousands of YouTube videos to figure out what kind of content its clients\u2019 ads were appearing with.\u201cI ended up basically giving myself PTSD because I saw so many horrible things,\u201d Mr. Hagedorn said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been, as an industry, blindly telling clients that being \u2018video neutral\u2019 is fine \u2014 you can follow the eyeballs from platform to platform \u2014 and I think we\u2019ve been unaware, or not paying attention potentially, to what we\u2019re monetizing and funding.\u201d\u201cDigital advertising as an industry has grown really, really rapidly and the unintended consequences of that sort of rapid growth means there are things happening that no one had anticipated,\u201d Mr. Weed said in an interview. He said he expected to work directly with platforms like Instagram on such issues, adding that social media sites are grappling with a decline in trust.Jon Kaplan, the global head of sales at Pinterest, said that he had observed \u201ca growing backlash\u201d against automated, data-driven advertising. In an interview on a pier that the company rented for the week, which welcomed \u201cfriends of the Pin,\u201d he recalled the disenchantment of major advertisers at an industry gathering last year.\u201cEvery story was like, we thought this was the panacea, and while it has its place, we may have over-rotated into that kind of data-driven marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s kind of no soul and no creativity and no real brand love associated with that.\u201dThe big tech companies also had an unexpected neighbor on the beach \u2014 Big Tobacco. Philip Morris International hosted a concert by the band St. Lucia and served drinks by robot bartenders. As the week closed, the company issued \u201ca bold call to action for the creative, media and communications communities\u201d to support its efforts in advertising tobacco products.Wendy Clark, the chief executive of DDB Worldwide, said that in the 1990s the beachfront space now ruled by tech had been dominated by ad agencies. She was optimistic, however, about technology forcing advertisers to come up with increasingly creative ways to reach people.\u201cThe best ads don\u2019t feel like ads,\u201d she said. Terms like \u201cadvertising\u201d and \u201cmarketing\u201d have come to mean less, she said, recounting a meeting she had during the week with a young YouTube influencer. \u201cShe would never describe herself as a marketer, but she\u2019s a modern-day marketer,\u201d Ms. Clark said.Still, Shane Smith, Vice\u2019s co-founder, appeared to remain popular with the ad industry, judging by the long line to enter the company\u2019s annual party.As more reports have emerged about misconduct of varying levels at advertising or media companies, it has posed a challenge for brands.Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble, the world\u2019s biggest advertiser, said in an interview that, generally, such situations are \u201cfew and far between,\u201d but that when they do arise, the company has to examine whether they are \u201cisolated incidents or is there a pervasive pattern that you need to do something about.\u201dMr. Pritchard added that the company has been working to build up its own databases to make its digital ads more precise and pointed to new partnerships it announced last week with Katie Couric and Queen Latifah.\u201cThe bigger thing we\u2019re pushing on,\u201d he said, \u201cis we\u2019re just trying to take more control over things.\u201dEmily Steel and David Gelles contributed reporting.Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or follow her on Twitter: @sapna.Advertisement"}

Where did it come from? It has indistinct antecedents in the adventure novel, the spy novel and the hybrid midcentury experimentations of Elmore Leonard, but realistically, the answer isn\u2019t pretty: Its pure form was the invention of Robert Ludlum and Frederick Forsyth, who set their lone heroes loose against immense forces in the 1970s and haven\u2019t come back for them yet. The genre spread fast and hard \u2014 America had all that unmelting, isolate, stoic toughness, and, with the west at last wholly settled, nowhere to put it, fictionally.

As \u201cRoom to Dream,\u201d written with the Los Angeles\u2013based critic and journalist Kristine McKenna, makes clear, his artistic Midas touch lately extends from film and television to painting and music; like Patti Smith (and possibly nobody else), Lynch apparently gets up in the morning and makes art in one medium and another right up until bedtime. \u201cRoom to Dream\u201d is, as the introduction observes, \u201cbasically a person having a conversation with his own biography.\u201d McKenna turns in an impressively industrious and comprehensive account of Lynch\u2019s career, larded with insightful quotes from dozens of people whose lives have intersected with his \u2014 after each chapter of which Lynch offers, at similar length, his own impressionistic and free-associative commentary.by Patricia Hamplby Stephanie Rosenbloomby Levison Woodby Mark Adamsby Alastair Bonnettby Stephan Orthby Jamal Mahjoubby Kushanava Choudhuryby Shoba Narayanby Rick Bassby Darryl SleathWhy do we travel?

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and the Feud Over Killer Robots", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "As the tech moguls disagree over the risks presented by something that doesn\u2019t exist yet, all of Silicon Valley is learning about unintended consequences of A.I.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg thought his fellow Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk was behaving like an alarmist.So, on Nov. 19, 2014, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, invited Mr. Musk to dinner at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. Two top researchers from Facebook\u2019s new artificial intelligence lab and two other Facebook executives joined them.As they ate, the Facebook contingent tried to convince Mr. Musk that he was wrong. But he wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cI genuinely believe this is dangerous,\u201d Mr. Musk told the table, according to one of the dinner\u2019s attendees, Yann LeCun, the researcher who led Facebook\u2019s A.I. lab.Mr. Musk\u2019s fears of A.I., distilled to their essence, were simple: If we create machines that are smarter than humans, they could turn against us. (See: \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d) Let\u2019s for once, he was saying to the rest of the tech industry, consider the unintended consequences of what we are creating before we unleash it on the world.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Zuckerberg would talk in detail about the dinner, which has not been reported before, or their long-running A.I. debate.The creation of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 the name for the supersmart technological breakthrough that takes A.I. to the next level and creates machines that not only perform narrow tasks that typically require human intelligence (like self-driving cars) but can actually outthink humans \u2014 still feels like science fiction. But the fight over the future of A.I. has spread across the tech industry.Artificial intelligence research has enormous potential and enormous implications, both as an economic engine and a source of military superiority. The Chinese government has said it is willing to spend billions in the coming years to make the country the world\u2019s leader in A.I., while the Pentagon is aggressively courting the tech industry for help. A new breed of autonomous weapons can\u2019t be far away.\u201cYou can now talk about the risks of A.I. without seeming like you are lost in science fiction,\u201d said Allan Dafoe, a director of the governance of A.I. program at the Future of Humanity Institute, a research center at the University of Oxford that explores the risks and opportunities of advanced technology.In April, Mr. Zuckerberg spent two days answering questions from members of Congress about data privacy and Facebook\u2019s role in the spread of misinformation before the 2016 election. He faced a similar grilling in Europe last month.Facebook\u2019s recognition that it was slow to understand what was going on has led to a rare moment of self-reflection in an industry that has long believed it is making the world a better place, whether the world likes it or not.Even such influential figures as the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the late Stephen Hawking have expressed concern about creating machines that are more intelligent than we are. Even though superintelligence seems decades away, they and others have said, shouldn\u2019t we consider the consequences before it\u2019s too late?\u201cThe kind of systems we are creating are very powerful,\u201d said Bart Selman, a Cornell University computer science professor and former Bell Labs researcher. \u201cAnd we cannot understand their impact.\u201dPacific Grove is a tiny town on the central coast of California. A group of geneticists gathered there, in the winter of 1975 to discuss whether their work \u2014 gene editing \u2014 would end up harming the world. In January 2017, the A.I. community held a similar discussion in the beachside grove.The heavy hitters of A.I. were in the room \u2014 among them Mr. LeCun, the Facebook A.I. lab boss who was at the dinner in Palo Alto, and who had helped develop a neural network, one of the most important tools in artificial intelligence today. Also in attendance was Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book, \u201cSuperintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\u201d had an outsized \u2014 some would argue fear-mongering \u2014 effect on the A.I. discussion; Oren Etzioni, a former computer science professor at the University of Washington who had taken over the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle; and Demis Hassabis, who heads DeepMind, an influential Google-owned A.I. research lab in London.And so was Mr. Musk, who in 2015 had donated $10 million to the Cambridge, Mass., institute. That same year, he also helped create an independent artificial intelligence lab, OpenAI, with an explicit goal: create superintelligence with safeguards meant to ensure it won\u2019t get out of control. It was a message that clearly aligned him with Mr. Bostrom.On the second day of the retreat, Mr. Musk took part in a nine-person panel dedicated to the superintelligence question. Each panelist was asked if superintelligence was possible. As they passed the microphone down the line, each said \u201cYes,\u201d until the microphone reached Mr. Musk. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. The small auditorium rippled with knowing laughter. Everyone understood that Mr. Musk thought superintelligence was not only possible, but very dangerous.Mr. Musk later added: \u201cWe are headed toward either superintelligence or civilization ending.\u201dWarnings about the risks of artificial intelligence have been around for years, of course. But few of those Cassandras have the tech cred of Mr. Musk. Few, if any, have spent as much time and money on it. And perhaps none has had as complicated a history with the technology.Just a few weeks after Mr. Musk talked about his A.I. concerns at the dinner in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s house, Mr. Musk phoned Mr. LeCun, asking for the names of top A.I. researchers who could work on his self-driving car project at Tesla. (That autonomous technology was in use at the time of two fatal Tesla car crashes, one in Florida in May 2016 and the other in March of this year.)During a recent Tesla earnings call, Mr. Musk, who has struggled with questions about his company\u2019s financial losses and concerns about the quality of its vehicles, chastised the news media for not focusing on the deaths that autonomous technology could prevent \u2014 a remarkable stance from someone who has repeatedly warned the world that A.I. is a danger to humanity.There is a saying in Silicon Valley: We overestimate what can be done in three years and underestimate what can be done in 10.On Jan. 27, 2016, Google\u2019s DeepMind lab unveiled a machine that could beat a professional player at the ancient board game Go. In a match played a few months earlier, the machine, called AlphaGo, had defeated the European champion Fan Hui \u2014 five games to none.Even top A.I. researchers had assumed it would be another decade before a machine could solve the game. Go is complex \u2014 there are more possible board positions than atoms in the universe \u2014 and the best players win not with sheer calculation, but through intuition. Two weeks before AlphaGo was revealed, Mr. LeCun said the existence of such a machine was unlikely.A few months later, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, the best Go player of the last decade. The machine made moves that baffled human experts but ultimately led to victory.Many researchers, including the leaders of DeepMind and OpenAI, believe the kind of self-learning technology that underpins AlphaGo provided a path to \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d And they believe progress in this area will significantly accelerate in the coming years.It\u2019s the kind of unpredictability that raise grave concerns about the rise of A.I., including superintelligence.But the deep opposition to these concerns was on display in March at an exclusive conference organized by Amazon and Mr. Bezos in Palm Springs.One evening, Rodney Brooks, a roboticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, debated the potential dangers of A.I. with the neuroscientist, philosopher and podcaster Sam Harris, a prominent voice of caution on the issue. The debate got personal, according to a recording obtained by The Times.Mr. Harris warned that because the world was in an arms race toward A.I., researchers may not have the time needed to ensure superintelligence is built in a safe way.\u201cThis is something you have made up,\u201d Mr. Brooks responded. He implied that Mr. Harris\u2019s argument was based on unscientific reasoning. It couldn\u2019t be proven right or wrong \u2014 a real insult among scientists.\u201cI would take this personally, if it actually made sense.\u201d Mr. Harris said.A moderator finally ended the tussle and asked for questions from the audience. Mr. Etzioni, the head of the Allen Institute, took the microphone. \u201cI am not going to grandstand,\u201d he said. But urged on by Mr. Brooks, he walked onto the stage and laid into Mr. Harris for three minutes, saying that today\u2019s A.I. systems are so limited, spending so much time worrying about superintelligence just doesn\u2019t make sense.The people who take Mr. Musk\u2019s side are philosophers, social scientists, writers \u2014 not the researchers who are working on A.I., he said. Among A.I. scientists, the notion that we should start worrying about superintelligence is \u201cvery much a fringe argument.\u201dPanicking about A.I. now, so early in its development, could threaten the many benefits that come from things like self-driving cars and A.I. health care, he said.\u201cWith A.I. especially, I\u2019m really optimistic,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cPeople who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios \u2014 I just, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201dIn other words: You\u2019re getting ahead of reality, Elon. Relax.\u201cThis is going to be a very central question for how we think about A.I. systems over the next decade and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, a lot of our A.I. systems make decisions in ways that people don\u2019t really understand.\u201dMr. Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind, still thinks Mr. Musk\u2019s views are extreme. But he said the same about the views of Mr. Zuckerberg. The threat is not here, he said. Not yet. But Facebook\u2019s problems are a warning.\u201cWe need to use the downtime, when things are calm, to prepare for when things get serious in the decades to come,\u201d said Mr. Hassabis. \u201cThe time we have now is valuable, and we need to make use of it.\u201dCade Metz reported from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s New Political Algorithms Increase Tension With Publishers", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews publishers have long had a fraught relationship with Facebook. But tensions have become more public in recent weeks, with news organizations openly criticizing the tech giant for new policies that they say are harmful to journalism.The most recent salvo came on Thursday, when Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, accused Facebook of unintentionally \u201csupporting the enemies of quality journalism\u201d by using algorithms that can mischaracterize news as partisan political content.Ms. Brown cited the importance of safeguarding elections and said the problems with political ads were \u201csomething we are deeply concerned about. We hear you.\u201dIn criticizing Facebook, Mr. Thompson showed two advertisements that The Times had recently purchased on the platform. Both had been flagged as political.Executives like Robert Thomson, the News Corp. chief and lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch, and Jonah Peretti of BuzzFeed have consistently called for increased payments from Facebook \u2014 which, along with Google, has been gobbling up more of the online advertising revenue that publishers need to survive.But the latest fight has more to do with the treatment of content than the economics of the media industry. Last month, with public and political pressure growing over Facebook\u2019s role in the 2016 election, the company unveiled a policy that created a publicly searchable archive for ads that its algorithms deemed to be political. In addition, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said the company would start ranking publishers by their perceived \u201ctrustworthiness.\u201dFacebook has agreed to create a distinction between publishers\u2019 content and political ads, but it has not yet built a separate archive.Moves like those have only inflamed tensions with publishers, said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The Times, and who signed the publishers\u2019 letter last month.\u201cFacebook communicated poorly,\u201d Mr. Kint said. \u201cThey have not built trust with publishers.\u201dAlthough Facebook remains a vital outlet for publishers, its power has diminished. According to data from Chartbeat, an online analytics company, publishers\u2019 traffic from Facebook has declined about 15 percent in the last year. At the same time, traffic from Google is up 20 percent since last August.During the discussion on Thursday, Mr. Thompson sparred with Ms. Brown, who was an NBC News correspondent and a CNN anchor before joining Facebook.In response to his complaints about the ad policy, Ms. Brown said there was a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d of the policy, adding that \u201cThe New York Times does not want to be transparent about the money they spend\u201d on ads.Mr. Thompson also called Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments on trust \u201cterrifyingly na\u00efve,\u201d echoing a speech he gave on Tuesday at the Open Markets Initiative in Washington.In that speech, Mr. Thompson accused Facebook of trying to \u201cset itself up as the digital world\u2019s editor in chief, prioritizing and presumably downgrading and rejecting content on a survey- and data-driven assessment of whether the provider is \u2018broadly trusted\u2019 or not.\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But Ms. Malone had different reasons: She is a curator at the National Museum of Ireland who is working to preserve the posters.She asked friends via Facebook, too \u2014 but advised them not to climb any lampposts.\u201cVery early on in the campaign I realized we needed to collect these banners,\u201d Ms. Malone said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey spoke so strongly \u2014 they\u2019re so creative and witty,\u201d she said, adding that a personal favorite read, \u201cGet your rosaries off my ovaries.\u201dCorinna Gardner, a senior curator at the museum, said she received regular requests from other museums to borrow such items. She also said that other institutions had asked her for advice about how to develop their own rapid-response programs.L\u00e9ontine Meijer-van Mensch, the deputy director of the Jewish Museum Berlin, said in a telephone interview that she was \u201cintrigued by the rapid-response approach of the V&A.\u201d She said that her museum had followed suit and had begun acquiring objects that had figured prominently in current affairs.Ms. Meijer-van Mensch said she wanted the display to be the first in a series that brought topical objects quickly to the museum. But she said she wanted to collect works beyond those related to controversies about anti-Semitism. For example, she said, she is considering documenting a gay Jewish wedding.Ms. Meijer-van Mensch said she realized that many of the objects collected in rapid-response programs were associated with left-wing causes and could therefore open museums to accusations of political bias. But she said that a museum was \u201cnever a neutral, objective space.\u201d If institutions supported the causes of particular activists, they should at least be transparent about it, she said.Ms. Malone of the National Museum of Ireland said that she had gone on marches calling for a change in the country\u2019s abortion laws for years, but that her views were irrelevant to her work. \u201cThe museum is nonpolitical, and my job is to research this moment in history, not how I feel about it,\u201d she said.No anti-abortion campaigners had yet sent the museum a banner, she said. (She had to climb up lampposts herself to secure those.)Ms. Gardner of the V&A agreed that politics could be an issue, but she said that all items in the Victoria and Albert Museum were presented factually, and that visitors were encouraged to make up their own minds about them.Ms. Malone said she did not know when the referendum banners she was collecting would go on display. More space in the museum and more varied examples were needed before that could happen, she said.Nonetheless, she said she was planning soon to make a 200-mile round trip to Roscommon, a rural area in the middle of Ireland. She plans to pick up a banner, \u201cRoscommon Farmers 4 Yes,\u201d that supported the repeal of the abortion ban. The region voted against the legalization of gay marriage in another referendum in 2015.

Felter, whose law office represents the 15 students who received formal disciplinary decisions, said in an email Sunday that some of them were suspended for one year and others for two years.The students are prohibited from any presence or activity on university property. Readmittance is not guaranteed and is at the discretion of Syracuse, she said.But that is not what these \u201cstrait-laced engineering kids\u201d deserve, said Gregory L. Germain, a law professor at the university who serves as a pro bono adviser to three of the students.The decision was the result of an \u201cunfair process that was dominated by the university,\u201d he said, that \u201cmanipulated the rules to meet the facts.\u201dOn Monday, Dara Royer, a Syracuse University spokeswoman, said in a statement that the university approached the case \u201cfairly and professionally,\u201d and that the fraternity videos had \u201ca significant impact\u201d on the well-being of students, faculty and staff on campus.\u201cThe videos contain language, even if offered under the guise of satire, that is sexist, racist, ableist, anti-Semitic and demeaning to the L.G.T.B.Q. community,\u201d the statement said. \u201cMoreover, speech or conduct can be harassing in nature based on its effect on others, even if that was not the underlying purpose or intent.\u201dIn April, Syracuse University halted all the activities of the engineering fraternity, Theta Tau, soon after footage surfaced of members speaking and acting in ways described at the time by the university\u2019s chancellor, Kent Syverud, as \u201cextremely racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist and hostile to people with disabilities.\u201dOne of the videos, which is about six minutes long, includes a pledge \u201cto always have hatred in my heart\u201d for African-Americans, Hispanics and Jews, all of whom are referred to with slurs. One member of the fraternity tells Jews to get in the shower, an apparent allusion to Nazi gas chambers. The video also shows members of the fraternity laughing while pretending to masturbate each other and perform oral sex.\u201cI love my girlfriend,\u201d says the student sitting in the wheelchair, drawing howls of laughter from the crowd. The other students onstage then pretend to sexually assault him.According to Mr. Germain, one student who participated in the skit said that it was based on disturbing jokes by the YouTube personality Brandon Rogers. In another of the skits, Mr. Germain said, the students were roasting a conservative \u201cTrump-supporting frat member.\u201d\u201cThey were making fun of him by pretending that he is a member of the alt-right that started a competing fraternity,\u201d Mr. Germain said. \u201cThey had an anointment where the new pledges pledged to be racists.\u201dMr. Germain acknowledged that the skits were in poor taste, but said that the fraternity members \u201cwere making satirical, antiracist jokes,\u201d not using slurs against fellow students.After the footage emerged, 18 students were charged with violating the student code of conduct. The university quickly set the disciplinary process in motion, scheduling the students\u2019 first hearing in early May. The charges included harassment and conduct that threatens the mental health, physical health or safety of others.According to Ms. Felter, two of the students accepted penalties offered by the university before the formal hearing, and one accepted a resolution at the conclusion of the hearing. The remaining 15, who were suspended, now have the option of appealing the decision, a process that could take several weeks.\u201cWe are waiting for the administrative process to end so we can pursue legal action on their behalf,\u201d Ms. Felter said.Four prospective Theta Tau members and one current chapter member are suing Syracuse University for injury to their reputation, according to a complaint filed in April. The students accuse the school of branding them as racist and anti-Semitic, among other labels used by the school\u2019s chancellor, and \u201cthreatening their academic success and survival,\u201d the court documents said.\u201cDid the involved members do stupid things? Of course,\u201d the article said. \u201cAre they racist, sexist, anti-gay criminals? Not even close, and indeed the context of the event shows just the opposite.\u201dMr. Germain and others on campus have argued that the students\u2019 right to free speech has been violated. But for many students at Syracuse, the videos \u2014 while distressing in and of themselves \u2014 are indicative of a larger problem.Advertisement"}

At a popular restaurant in Union Square in Manhattan, workers struggled to comprehend that the young politician whose face was all over TV really was the same woman who had tended bar until a few months ago.And on the streets of Midtown Manhattan Wednesday morning, the candidate herself was trying to make sense of it all. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood outside Rockefeller Center after appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d juggling phone calls and live TV interviews and the well-wishes of doormen and office workers on their coffee breaks.\u201cI\u2019m used to people kind of knowing me in the community,\u201d said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28. But to have a stream of random people walk up and ask to take a selfie with her? \u201cInsane.\u201dShe is expected to have little difficulty defeating the Republican candidate, Anthony Pappas, in a predominantly Democratic district that takes in working-class, immigrant-heavy swaths of the Bronx and Queens in November.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to be adjusting to the intensity with the aplomb of a natural retail politician, graciously granting every request for a picture while staying cheerfully on a progressive message that has energized the Democrats\u2019 left wing. \u201cThank you!\u201d she said, over and over, eyes wide, smile wider, her hand flying to her chest. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d\u201cWhen you won, I was bawling,\u201d said Tahia Islam, a woman in her early 20s whose family lives in Queens. Ms. Islam was passing through the plaza on a break from her marketing job. \u201cI had my whole family vote for you.\u201d\u201cOh my God, thank you!\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cTell your family thank you.\u201dBehind the scenes, of course, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s rise has been a little less sudden. \u201cFor two years,\u201d she said, \u201call I have been thinking about is 8:59 on June 26,\u201d when the polls closed on Tuesday night.But it goes back many years before that. As a teenager, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez never hesitated to speak her mind during political conversations around the dinner table.\u201cThere was nobody who could shut her up,\u201d said her mother, Blanca Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cI saw the political tendencies since she was very, very young.\u201d\u201cOne of the administrators wasn\u2019t there at the beginning and came in after she started, and he said to the superintendent, \u2018What company is she from?\u2019\u201d Mr. Blueglass recalled. \u201cThe superintendent said, \u2018She\u2019s a 17-year-old senior in our high school.\u2019 She presented herself, verbally, visually, everything, as if she was a 30-year-old professional presenter businesswoman even though she was 17 years old.\u201dMr. Blueglass said that even as a teenager, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez looked at science research through a political lens. \u201cShe was interested in research to help people in all areas, including developing nations, not just for the people with money.\u201dShe majored in economics and international relations, impressing the professor who taught an antitrust economics class, Marc Rysman, with \u201cgreat analytic abilities.\u201dShe also dabbled in establishment politics during college, working for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on immigration, but soon turned her attention to the grass-roots work that would come to define her candidacy.She returned to national politics when she worked as an organizer for the Sanders campaign. She has credited her decision to seek office with her experience protesting at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation in 2016 against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Around that time, she was contacted by Brand New Congress, a newly formed progressive organization that asked her to run.She has also worked for years teaching summer courses in community leadership to high school students for the National Hispanic Institute.\u201cI spent the entire first part of this campaign just going to people\u2019s living rooms and having them invite their neighbors, and just doing little coffee parties for like six or seven months,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how we really started this campaign.\u201dHer campaign evolved into something of a digital and door-to-door crusade. She and her campaign\u2019s digital staff used Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to turn out new voters and push a progressive message that included calls for tuition-free public colleges, Medicare for All, and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\u201cThe scope of the digital effort for a campaign like this was massive,\u201d said Jake DeGroot, who helped to manage Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s digital efforts. About 30 volunteers used a private WhatsApp group to coordinate social media strategy, according to Ananya Kumar-Banerjee, another volunteer with the campaign.On Facebook, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team spent months refining and testing various get-out-the-vote messages and campaign announcements in English and Spanish. Since early May, when Facebook began archiving political ads in a public database, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign purchased about 180 ads for her official Facebook and Instagram pages. Mr. Crowley\u2019s campaign bought 110 Facebook and Instagram ads during the same time period, all in English.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez also kept with her ground game, saying it was important to \u201ccommit to grass roots, on-the-ground organizing, to knocking on those doors and making those numbers and phone calls.\u201dOn Tuesday, Primary Day, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez still did not know where she was going to have her \u201cwatch party\u201d for the election results. She finally settled on a billiard hall in the Bronx.In the car there, she put her phone away and did not check the returns. \u201cEverybody in the car we were in was so nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were just like, \u2018Don\u2019t check it, don\u2019t check.\u2019\u201dAs the car pulled up, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez saw through a window a headline on a screen inside that put her in the lead.\u201cSo I just started running,\u201d she said. \u201cI literally ran and I busted through the doors.\u201dArielle Dollinger and Kevin Roose contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ayala, Famed Biologist, Resigns After Sexual Harassment Inquiry", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Administrators at the University of California, Irvine, said they would remove Dr. Ayala\u2019s name from campus buildings and academic posts.Francisco J. Ayala, one of the world\u2019s most eminent evolutionary biologists and a major benefactor of the University of California, Irvine, has resigned his position there after a monthslong investigation into allegations of sexual harassment. In a sharp rebuke, the university said it would remove his name from its School of Biological Sciences and its science library, as well as from graduate fellowships, endowed chairs and other programs, many of them started or nurtured with his funds.In a letter sent Thursday to university employees, Howard Gillman, the chancellor, said Dr. Ayala, leaves the university as of this Sunday without \u201cemeritus\u201d status and that he \u201cwill abstain from future campus activities.\u201d In effect, the university has cut off one of its most generous donors and a star professor, an action one faculty member said left her \u201cfloored.\u201dIn response to an email to Dr. Ayala\u2019s office, his longtime assistant, Denise Chilcote, said he was out of the country. She forwarded a statement in which he said he regretted that what he thought of as \u201cthe good manners of a European gentleman\u201d \u2014 compliments and kisses on the cheek \u2014 had made colleagues uncomfortable.But Micha Liberty, a lawyer representing three of the four women whose complaints sparked the investigation, which began in November, said there is \u201ca marked difference between gentlemanly behavior and sexual harassment in the workplace. We would not be here if we were talking about manners and gallantry.\u201dAt issue, she said, were \u201cinappropriate comments and other kinds of behavior,\u201d including unwanted touching. She said that despite earlier complaints, \u201cthe university had failed to curtail this behavior,\u201d and that she and her clients are exploring \u201cevery potential legal option and avenue.\u201dThe university identified the four women as Kathleen Treseder, who holds the Ayala Chair in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Jessica Pratt, an assistant professor in that department; Benedicte Shipley, an assistant dean in the biological sciences school; and Michelle Herrera, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology.The report found that women often respond to this harassment by declining leadership opportunities, leaving their institutions or even abandoning research altogether. Some of Dr. Ayala\u2019s colleagues expressed shock at the allegations made against him. Apart from his many scientific honors, including the National Medal of Science, which he received in 2001, \u201che is a good human being,\u201d said Virginia Trimble, an astrophysicist at the university. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to say it.\u201dShe said she was \u201cfloored\u201d by the chancellor\u2019s letter to the university community, and her first action on reading it was to send Dr. Ayala an email whose subject line read \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word of it.\u201d A number of other faculty members spoke in Dr. Ayala\u2019s defense, saying they were troubled by the fact that the wider university community had not yet been able to read the report that led to his ouster. \u201cI have no facts, no information,\u201d Donald Saari, a professor of mathematics, said in an email. \u201cI do not even know what are the charges. But all of this is upsetting because it runs counter to everything I know about Dr. Ayala.\u201dPeople on both sides of the matter accused the university of acting in bad faith. Ms. Liberty said that administrators had not taken earlier action on complaints against Dr. Ayala, because he had donated millions of dollars to the university. Protecting Dr. Ayala \u201cwas more profitable to them and more important to their reputation than was the security and safety of their female graduate students and professors,\u201d she said. At the least, it is clear that many universities are not faring well in the #MeToo movement, said Kristen Monroe, a professor of political science at the university who is finishing a book on gender equality in the workplace, and who Dr. Ayala called as a character witness during the recent investigation.\u201cI am concerned that universities do not know how to deal with the due-process issues that come up,\u201d she said. \u201cTransparent, open procedures \u2014 we don\u2019t have this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And why did my identity mark me as someone in need of \u201cpurifying\u201d to be let back in?Six months after that first series of exorcisms, I found photography as a way to share my voice when I felt voiceless, to express my joy and pain when I had no other outlets.I began making images for myself. If I didn\u2019t see any images of L.G.B.T.Q. Africans, I could create them. If I had grown up without stories of gay and transgender Africans to rebut my father\u2019s words, then I could fill that gap in the historical record with my work.I began traveling the world and exploring the beauty of my community, a beauty that existed when I was a child but that I had never seen: A gay Nigerian mother and their daughter in England; gay Kenyan twins in Germany; transgender Burundian women in Canada; a gay Somali asylum seeker in Sweden; and many more. I photographed and interviewed over 50 L.G.B.T.Q. African immigrants in 10 countries across North America, the Caribbean and Europe.Reflecting on Nzinga\u2019s story and imagining it in a modern context, I saw a butch queen with a harem of African drag queens leading a 40-year war of resistance against European infringement.My work has shown me that one of the most potent tools of colonization is the intentional destruction of histories and cultural traditions; of stories like Nzinga\u2019s; of stories like my own and the dozens of L.G.B.T.Q. Africans whom I have worked with. Our histories and stories as same-gender-loving and gender-variant African peoples have always existed. I work to reclaim this space where we can be free \u2014 again.\u201cThere have been lots of times when I have felt and been pushed away from my African and queer identity. I am not fully out to all my family members and the few times I have been back home since we moved to England, I almost always have to hide my identity as a queer, non-binary person \u2014 take out my piercings; deal with being misgendered or read as a woman; hide my shaved sides with unnecessarily long braids; wear clothes that are definitely not my style or choice; refrain from talking about my partners or just how intertwined in my person being queer is for a mixture of reasons: fear of rejection, worry about the kind of upheaval it would cause my nuclear family ... the list goes on. \u201cFor me, Limit(less) is an important project for the next generations. That they can have some faces, some references and not waste time as we did because we were scared or we felt alone and/or ashamed.

{"Headline": "Owning a Gun While Muslim", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySupported byA small number of American Muslims are buying guns as they worry about their safety. Why did you decide to pursue gun culture in the Muslim community?The Parkland shooting ignited a large conversation around gun control. I noticed that the majority of the debate centered the voices of this country\u2019s most powerful: white men. For this reason, I tried to shed a light on a group that has not involved themselves in the gun debate, but have existed within it, unheard and dismissed; Muslim gun owners in the United States are often marginalized and have faced hate and discrimination.I tried to explore what it means to own a gun when you\u2019re Muslim by focusing on the voices of a marginalized group that has stereotypically been seen as a violent threat to the United States. I wanted to learn the reasons behind their ownership, their relationships with other Muslims and their weapons, and their views on gun control.How did you find your subjects and pick the states?I came across two major lawsuits that were filed against a gun range in Oklahoma and a gun store in Florida. Each declared itself to be a \u201cMuslim-free Zone.\u201d I tried to get in touch with all parties for a better understanding for both cases. That\u2019s when I found out about two of the main subjects of the story: Hassan Shibly and Raja\u2019ee Fatihah. They connected me with other Muslim gun owners. Other subjects came through my networks in the Muslim community.I focused on regions where gun culture is more predominant. I believed that this juxtaposition would add important layers and nuances to the story.Were you surprised by the stories they recounted and why?No. As a Muslim immigrant myself, I was exposed to similar narratives while working on different projects on Islam in America. I have experienced similar stories firsthand.What was the biggest takeaway?I believe that the group of people I met had different reasons and motivations for owning guns, but they all shared pride in being Americans defending their Second Amendment rights. For most of them, guns emphasize their American identity and give them a sense of liberty.When Sheima Muhammad takes her Glock pistol to her local gun range in central Ohio, she gets funny looks.

{"Headline": "She Who Produces the Receipts Controls the Narrative", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBringing out the documentation on reality TV or on Instagram doesn\u2019t always get us closer to the truth. It\u2019s still usually hilarious.Consider an exchange from the reunion episode of Season 5 of Bravo\u2019s \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u201d Phaedra Parks was feuding with Kenya Moore over whose workout video was more successful.\u201cThe truth is, the numbers speak for themselves,\u201d Ms. Moore said of the reviews for her \u201cBooty Boot Camp\u201d versus Ms. Parks\u2019s \u201cPhine Body: Donkey Booty.\u201dIt\u2019s a subject of feverish debate in modern society how much is \u201creal\u201d about the exchanges on these shows. Producers push contestants to pursue spicy story lines. Editors splice together bits of conversation that make it sound as though someone said something they did not in a technique known as \u201cfrankenbiting.\u201dBut as the medium evolves, its participants and viewers have become increasingly fixated on telling their truth by doing as Ms. Parks suggested, and showing the receipts.It\u2019s become a hallmark of \u201cgood TV\u201d to show a reality star assert something and cut screen back to a moment, previously filmed, when they said or did the opposite \u2014 the ultimate \u201cgotcha\u201d moment. That\u2019s the producers unfurling their receipts. But increasingly often the tables are turned: The internet has given power to reality TV stars who were once completely at the mercy of those controlling the presentation of their narratives.Take the Season 1 \u201cWAGS Miami\u201d reunion. The show is part of a franchise that includes \u201cWAGS L.A.\u201d and \u201cWAGS Atlanta,\u201d which follow the wives, girlfriends and wannabe girlfriends of athletes in those cities. Much of the drama that occurs between them is fueled not by what happens on camera but on the social media platforms where they harvest their income through sponsored posts.The night the reunion aired, the cast member Claudia Sampedro went off in a Twitter rant. She was upset that a fellow cast member, Hencha Voigt, had behaved differently on set than she did in the \u201creal\u201d world. On Twitter, Ms. Sampedro said she was going to \u201cpull out the receipts\u201d of her relationship with Ms. Voigt, and made good on her threat by tweeting various text messages the two exchanged during the filming of the show.It\u2019s much more difficult to suspend doubt about the reality of it all when contestants break character and reveal secrets in order to tell their side of the story. \u201cI was mad surprised when I watched the show!\u201d Ms. Sampedro said on Twitter, before going on to blame the show producers for misrepresenting her.The drama was big enough that there was no way it wouldn\u2019t be included on Orange County, though if the fans that had involved themselves in it thought they would be a part of the story explicitly, they were mistaken. In Season 12 of Orange County, we learned that Ms. Judge and Ms. Dodd had not stopped warring \u2014 on social media and on camera \u2014 since the intense fan-encouraged exchange. But the details were kept out of it.\u201cI think you\u2019re a lot like me, where I\u2019m over things,\u201d Ms. Judge said to Ms. Dodd. They then apologized to each other, and went on to joke about the size of their respective vaginas and struggles with incontinence.There is one constant in the world of receipts: The possessor of the receipts is trying to gain power in a universe in which they rarely have any. We see the producers\u2019 hands are forced when they allude to what\u2019s happening behind the scenes in order to get a plot to make sense, creating an even more porous relationship between what\u2019s inside and what\u2019s outside the reality TV bubble. In this respect, receipts have become key to making good reality television, an integral part of the fabric of the medium\u2019s lexicon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mass Shooting at New Jersey Arts Festival Leaves 22 Injured and 1 Dead", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRENTON \u2014 Krystal Knapp was 15 minutes from the end of her shift as a volunteer at the entrance to the Art All Night festival in Trenton when she heard some scuffling.Peering into the long and narrow former factory building where the festival was being held, she saw paintings being knocked to the floor. She heard screams and gunshots as people hurtled toward the exit and she was pushed to the ground and trampled.Ms. Knapp sought shelter behind a car. Then, 15 feet away, one of the gunmen was shot and killed.The authorities said the shooting appeared to be gang-related and that 22 people were injured; 17 were shot and the others hurt by being trampled. It happened just before 3 a.m. Sunday at a 24-hour art festival cherished by Trenton residents as a testament to the New Jersey capital\u2019s artistic revitalization.Tensions were rising shortly before the event descended into violent chaos.\u201cThere was a report that the mood inside the venue had been changing,\u201d Angelo J. Onofri, the Mercer County prosecutor, said at a news conference on Sunday.He said before the shooting there were \u201cnumerous physical altercations that took place both inside and outside of the venue.\u201dThe police told organizers that the event needed to be shut down and tried to disperse people, but some loitered, and then the shooting broke out, Mr. Onofri said.The person who was killed, Tahaij Wells, 32, was believed to have been shot dead by the police and was one of multiple gunmen, officials said. One was hospitalized in critical condition, and another, identified as Amir Armstrong, 23, was arrested on weapons charges. Mr. Onofri said Mr. Wells had been in prison on \u201chomicide-related charges\u201d until February, when he was released on parole.The authorities did not believe the festival was targeted.Reed Gusciora, the mayor-elect, confirmed there had been unspecified threats of violence before the shooting. He said he had received a screenshot of a Facebook post on Sunday that said: \u201cPlease, please do not go to Art All Night! They will be shooting it up!\u201dMr. Gusciora said he believed the police were aware of threats. \u201cThey were advised that there might be trouble,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was this specific post.\u201dEvery year, the show is assembled virtually overnight, with submissions received on Friday and placed on the walls on Saturday.\u201cEveryone can put in one piece,\u201d said Becke Singleton, who had volunteered at the event in the past. \u201cIt\u2019s nonprofessional next to professional. Elderly next to a little child.\u201d\u201cI grew up in this city and it\u2019s always been rough,\u201d said Gaby Fern\u00e1ndez, 21, adding that she went to the festival because the paintings \u201cmade me feel proud.\u201dShe said rumors of violence had circulated hours before the shooting but she still showed up with a friend shortly after 11 p.m.\u201cWe both were warned that someone had planned to come and do harm but took the risk anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to Art All Night for years and it\u2019s always been a safe place.\u201dA.J. Rodriguez, 22, lives a couple of blocks from where the shooting happened. He said that when he heard the news, he was not surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s just regular around here,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean it\u2019s every day. You think it\u2019s going to be a good get-together and then everybody is beefing and not cool with each other.\u201dMore than 25,000 people were projected to attend the festival, now in its 12th year. It was held at the Roebling Wire Works, once home to a factory that supplied wire cables for the Brooklyn and Golden Gate Bridges.On Sunday afternoon, the authorities were roaming the cavernous building. Outside, the ground was littered with plastic cups and trash cans remained tipped over, their contents spilled to the ground.Mr. Onofri said multiple weapons were recovered from the scene, including a handgun with an \u201cextended capacity magazine\u201d that could hold more ammunition than permitted under state law.\u201cIt saddens me that a public attack such as this is what has brought major attention to our capital city on Father\u2019s Day,\u201d Mayor Eric Jackson said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s yet another reminder of the senselessness of gun violence,\u201d he said.\u201cOur hearts ache and our eyes are blurry but our dedication and resolve to building a better Trenton through community, creativity and inspiration will never fade,\u201d the statement said.Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed reported from Trenton, and Mihir Zaveri from New York.

Where did it come from? It has indistinct antecedents in the adventure novel, the spy novel and the hybrid midcentury experimentations of Elmore Leonard, but realistically, the answer isn\u2019t pretty: Its pure form was the invention of Robert Ludlum and Frederick Forsyth, who set their lone heroes loose against immense forces in the 1970s and haven\u2019t come back for them yet. The genre spread fast and hard \u2014 America had all that unmelting, isolate, stoic toughness, and, with the west at last wholly settled, nowhere to put it, fictionally.

(Perhaps you\u2019re still agonizing over missing those three minutes when ramps were available?) One way to fend off this very fortunate brand of anxiety is to check out some new cookbooks. Thankfully, just in time, there\u2019s the expected flood of vegetable-reverent titles, as well as books that will take you to all corners of the world and personal, nostalgic journeys inspiring the rediscovery of classics that feel just right for the season of rebirth.by David Lynchby David Peisnerby Matthew Pollyby Jonathan Abramsby Joseph McBrideby Michael BensonA new batch of summer reading tells the back story of some of the greatest movies and television.Not that Lynch need unduly worry about his talents becoming obsolete. As \u201cRoom to Dream,\u201d written with the Los Angeles\u2013based critic and journalist Kristine McKenna, makes clear, his artistic Midas touch lately extends from film and television to painting and music; like Patti Smith (and possibly nobody else), Lynch apparently gets up in the morning and makes art in one medium and another right up until bedtime. \u201cRoom to Dream\u201d is, as the introduction observes, \u201cbasically a person having a conversation with his own biography.\u201d McKenna turns in an impressively industrious and comprehensive account of Lynch\u2019s career, larded with insightful quotes from dozens of people whose lives have intersected with his \u2014 after each chapter of which Lynch offers, at similar length, his own impressionistic and free-associative commentary.by Tiffany Reiszby Sarah MacLeanby Eloisa Jamesby Lynn Turnerby Helen Hoangby Kate Claybornby Joanna Shupeby Cat SebastianEscape to Regency England, Gilded Age New York or a French sex-commune chateau.Some people say that summer reading \u2014 whether poolside or briskly air-conditioned \u2014 means big, unwieldy books, too heavy to lug farther than from the shelf to the lounge chair, a single volume to last the season. These people baffle me. The best summer reading is absorbing, delightful and, in the sun or shade, will make you break a sweat. That\u2019s romance, and here are eight new releases for the summer.

We had the place to ourselves, though getting any speed was tricky since the roads were pocked and potted. On all sides, the lawns were filthy and tattered.

He\u2019s confident you know about the time the 1986 Mets won the World Series. He doesn\u2019t want to trot out the old war stories.What he offers instead is an impressionistic account of his baseball boyhood, a kind of \u201cRemembrance of At-Bats Past,\u201d complete with a baked good to set the memories in motion. When Hernandez was growing up in Pacifica, Calif., his father worked as a fireman. After an overnight shift, he would bring home fresh sourdough bread from a bakery in San Francisco.

Henderson Jr. has traveled up and down the East Coast, stopping alongside rural roads in his native Virginia, at rallies on the National Mall and on bustling New York City street corners. \u201cI just wanted to be out there where things were going on, so I just went out in the street and started shooting,\u201d said Mr. Henderson, who bought himself a Kodak Brownie Hawkeye camera for his 12th birthday and later studied photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. \u201cI was looking for visual drama, something in the midst of the ordinary to catch my eye.\u201d Mr. Henderson, who has worked as a professor of photography at various local universities and as a photojournalist, has created impressionistic and poignant images that record history \u2014 both personal and national \u2014 with great intimacy. His social reportage is a part of a renowned African-American tradition of chiaroscuro image makers that includes Gordon Parks, Roy DeCarava, Ming Smith and the emerging photographer Andre D. Wagner. A 1970s image Mr. Henderson took in an old storefront church of three black women moved by the Spirit, is heightened by his dramatic play with light and shadow. Likewise, the darkness that covers the eyes of a distant cousin clutching a folded American flag at his father\u2019s funeral, underscores the bewilderment of colossal loss and coming-of-age too soon. Over the years, Mr. Henderson\u2019s photography has grown broad in gesture, humming with sublime symbolism: a woman with her hands on her hips who stands watching over her brood on a porch in midcentury Virginia is a vivid image of a mother\u2019s love; a black ballerina in repose before a traditional frieze is a contrast in beauty, then and now; and a picture of Muhammad Ali at a news conference surrounded by the Jackson 5\u2019s star presence, is an outsize sign of black power. Exposing the contractions of wealth is a somber 1968 scene of a lone civil rights protester sitting outside a sea of tents at \u201cResurrection City,\u201d the encampment the Poor People\u2019s Campaign set up in the shadow of the Washington Monument to shame a nation.

{"Headline": "Do Bees Know Nothing?", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResearchers say bees understand the concept of nothing, or zero. But do we understand what that means?What would it mean if bees could understand the concept of nothing?That would be really something. Bees? Really? It\u2019s not the results of the study I wonder about. There seems to be no question that bees do quite well at the standard understanding-zero experiment, clearly putting them in a cognitive elite. It\u2019s not the science, but the language that gave me pause. How do we understand the word \u201cunderstand\u201d? What is our concept of what \u201cconcept\u201d means?Obviously, this was not the problem the bees were asked to solve, yet. Some were rewarded if they landed on the displays with more shapes, like squares or circles, and some if they landed on the displays with fewer. The shapes were of different sizes and the displays with varying numbers of shapes were hung on a wheel in different places to avoid giving any spatial clues.Then, the researchers introduced a display with no shapes. Bees trained to land on a display with fewer shapes landed on the so-called \u201cempty set,\u201d the nothing display, the zero card. Bees trained to land on the display with more shapes did not.Furthermore, bees did better when the empty display was in a group with displays with larger numbers of shapes than with fewer. And that suggested the bees get the idea of more and fewer, of a numerical series in which one is closer to zero than five.There, I did it myself. I wrote \u201cthey get the idea.\u201d Does that mean bees have \u201cideas\u201d? I have no idea. I do know that scare quotes are the unavoidable curse of comparative cognition. Altogether, the results of the bee experiments show, Dr. Dyer said, that bees \u201cunderstood that zero was a number lower than one and part of a sequence of numbers.\u201dBut they weren\u2019t thinking the way we think, consciously, right? \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t use the word consciousness,\u201d in relation to bees, Dr. Dyer said. But, \u201cthe evidence is consistent with high-level cognitive abilities.\u201dI asked two other researchers what they thought about what was going on in the bee brains. Lars Chittka, at Queen Mary University of London, who has explored the capacity of bees to learn and manipulate tools, said the bees showed comparable ability to primates on the tasks the researchers set them. We\u2019re taking you on a journey to help you understand how bees, while hunting for pollen, use all of their senses \u2014 taste, touch, smell and more \u2014 to decide what to pick up and bring home.I told him that the word \u201cunderstand\u201d gave me the willies, and he said, \u201cIt is funny that we would hesitate to use the word understand. A primate researcher wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a minute to use the word.\u201dBut, he noted, humans are separated from chimpanzees by perhaps six million years of evolution and from insects by 500 million years or more. What the two species are doing could be computationally quite different. He does suspect, he says, that bees, with their many abilities \u2014 he trained them to put a ball in a hole and showed that they can learn from each other to pull a string for a reward \u2014 may have \u201ca kind of more flexible intelligence that allows you to solve all sorts of problems.\u201dI also turned to David Anderson at Caltech, who doesn\u2019t work on bees, and wasn\u2019t involved in this study. He studies fruit flies, but he is a champion of both sophistication in insect brains, and of caution in judging how far that sophistication goes.\u201cIt is difficult to know what such a task \u2018means\u2019 for the bees,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cfrom a \u2018conceptual\u2019 standpoint, because we do not understand the strategy that the bees\u2019 brains are using to solve the problem.\u201dThe eventual resolution of some of these questions, will come when researchers can see what is actually going in the brain, Dr. Anderson suggested. Ms. Howard also pointed to deciphering brain processes as a future goal. \u201cSo far,\u201d she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know how any animal represents \u2018nothing\u2019 in the brain.\u201dHow can we save the pollinators if we don\u2019t even recognize them? An earlier version of this article misstated the researcher David Anderson\u2019s institutional affiliation. He is at Caltech, not Stanford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Neither Male Nor Female Seems to Fit", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWhat happens when a transgender person, who fantasizes about having an androgynous body, falls for a straight man who loves female curves?But really, I wasn\u2019t like other girls. Not even a little. When I met Charlie, things started to feel more complicated.I was assigned female at birth, but as I got older I felt less and less feminine. I am not someone who always knew I was transgender. I knew it only when the body I loved \u2014 my androgynous child\u2019s body \u2014 turned into something unmistakably female.I got breasts. And suddenly I didn\u2019t recognize myself anymore.I thought my discomfort was because of the \u201clady tax\u201d female-bodied people pay for existing in a male-dominated culture. Who would want to be a girl when girls are treated so badly? After enough discrimination or ogling or groping or degradation, anyone may get sick of looking like a woman.Nothing fit me. Clothes for women are flimsy. The shoes are uncomfortable. Women are supposed to be clean, sweet and pretty. I had all of their problems along with the weird guilt of feeling like an interloper in female spaces \u2014 fitting rooms and locker rooms. But because I had breasts, I passed.Still, I did fine with the body I had. I modeled with it, played with it, learned with it, danced with it, worked with it, had sex with it, made a baby with it and even had a brief, unhappy marriage in it.I sweated in my skin when people called me \u201cshe\u201d or complimented my feminine features. But I also learned to camouflage my body in a way that honored my identity, wearing sports bras, men\u2019s jeans, Doc Martens and my boyfriends\u2019 clothes. I made the most of being six feet tall and strong looking. It worked: If I wore men\u2019s clothes, I noticed women crossing the street to avoid me at night.I did not correct people\u2019s assumptions about my identity because it was easier for them and for me. Walking around in a female body was hard enough.I didn\u2019t even have a word for why I felt different until a few years ago when I found someone I connected with in a way that made it impossible to deny that I was just like them. They were a they (claiming \u201cthey\u201d as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun) and proud of it. They had found a solution that made sense to me. Why should I stuff myself into binary gender terms when neither male nor female seemed to fit?As I became more accepting of my trans-ness, I nudged my body in that direction too. I never wanted to be a man, and I didn\u2019t want male parts. The word \u201ctrans\u201d doesn\u2019t stand for transition or even transformation. I simply wanted my outsides to match my insides.One morning I stood in front of the mirror and pushed my breasts down, apart, flat. I imagined what I would look like with double mastectomy scars. I didn\u2019t want my breasts anymore. I had fed my son with them, supported them with countless underwire bras and used them to get attention. But I didn\u2019t like them. It seemed like they didn\u2019t even belong to me.I fantasized about top surgery. Or maybe I would get some kind of cancer that wouldn\u2019t kill me but would require removing my breasts. I clicked through galleries of post-op women who decorated their surgery scars with henna and floral tattoos. I thought, \u201cIf I get cancer, I\u2019m not saving either one.\u201dIt was the perfect solution: no breasts and no need to explain my gender expression.I had already come out to my family as bisexual, queer, maybe gay, and a person in recovery from addiction. Every couple of years, I made the phone call or sent the card informing my parents of my newly discovered identity.Their response was always the same: We love you. This doesn\u2019t change anything. We\u2019re proud of you.For this reason, I was hesitant to drop the transgender bomb on them. What more did I want? Why bother telling them yet another thing that was weird about me when it didn\u2019t affect the way they loved me?I told myself labels don\u2019t matter. I was already too complicated and had dragged my parents through enough. Of course, I was also a coward.I settled in, waiting to get cancer while I thought about things like changing my name or my pronouns. I dated, usually telling my partners that I was queer without elaborating. If my partners complimented my body, I thanked them. It was a nice body, but they may as well have been praising my VHS collection.My body was a fact about me, but it wasn\u2019t me. I hunted online for images of androgynous, gender-fluid people. They tended to be thin, wealthy looking and white, occupying the spectrum between David Bowie and Tilda Swinton (when dressed like David Bowie). Not exactly me, but closer. Looking at these pictures helped me accept my weirdness as something unique, beautiful.But Charlie was straight. He liked women in sundresses, with cleavage, in knee socks. The women he had dated all had one thing in common: curves. He was attracted to women for their femininity.During our first time in bed, I could sense how attracted he was to me, to my lovely female body. He touched me everywhere, exploring. Would he still like me if I looked the way I wanted to, the way I saw myself? I imagined coming out to him and all the things that could change.We got more serious, and one day I asked him if he would still love me if I got cancer.He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m with you, no matter what.\u201dCharlie once told me he would be attracted to me even if I were a man \u2014 that he loved everything about me, all my complexity. But then I mentioned the top surgery and his face fell. Oh. He would miss my breasts.So it became like a game of queer chicken, trying to find the balance between my identity and his sexuality. I would still be transgender even if I didn\u2019t change a single thing about myself, right? I was trans even in a miniskirt and thick eyeliner, with Jayne Mansfield cleavage. I was trans when I was giving birth and drinking my coffee. Whether or not my identity and its presentation were acceptable to my partner was another issue entirely.As time passed, I stopped wearing makeup; he didn\u2019t complain. I wore the clothes I liked, not the ones that signaled, \u201cgirl.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything. My body, he said, was what he loved because it contained me. When he touched my breasts, I wondered: Could I deny him this part of me? Even though my breasts are mine, was I willing to give up the connection they created between us?Although my hair was growing out and I knew Charlie liked it, I went to the barber and asked for a man\u2019s haircut. Not a woman\u2019s version of a man\u2019s style or a soft butch cut. A man\u2019s haircut. Afterward, covered in loose bristles, I walked out grinning.Charlie smiled when he saw me and cupped his hand around the smooth back of my head.\u201cTwo people called me \u2018sir\u2019 today,\u201d I said.\u201cHow did that make you feel?\u201d\u201cSeen,\u201d I said.A month later I went to a sex shop to pick up some new toys for us, and in the back I found a white cropped, elastic, surgical-strength chest binder; it was like an extra-tight, extra-short tube top. Once I\u2019d struggled to get the fabric around my rib cage, my breasts practically disappeared. I looked at myself sideways in the mirror: flat. I saw myself for the first time since I was very young, before puberty hijacked my body, before I knew that I would one day need a different word to describe myself.I buttoned on a man\u2019s short-sleeve shirt, and there I was. I smiled at my reflection. For the first time in decades, I felt whole.\u201cShow me,\u201d Charlie said that night.I stood in front of him wearing only my underwear and the chest binder. I didn\u2019t know where to put my hands.\u201cWalk for me.\u201dI walked, feeling my body settle into itself. My awkwardness went away, and I stretched out, flexed, showed my biceps. He smiled, taking pleasure in my happiness.\u201cHandsome,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019re handsome.\u201dI sat on the bed next to him and he hugged me, kissed me, held me. Although I wasn\u2019t naked, I felt so exposed to him. He was finally seeing me the way I saw myself. Not girly. Not making an effort to catch his eye. No long hair, breasts or makeup. Just me. I was satisfied.\u201cI like you,\u201d he said.\u201cThis me? This version?\u201d\u201cAll versions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Staying Together by Living Apart (in a Duplex)", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWe were looking at duplexes in Los Angeles and our real estate agent had brought us to a small property, two side-by-side houses on a single lot.\u201cIt\u2019s a very popular situation now,\u201d he said. \u201cLive in one and rent out the other.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing,\u201d I said. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, but he wasn\u2019t quite taking it in.My girlfriend and I were interested in the two tiny houses but they sold to a different couple, who intended to live in one and rent out the other, as the real estate agent had suggested. We, on the other hand, intended to each live in our own little place. It was a plan that seemed to make people uneasy.\u201cIs this because you\u2019re an only child?\u201d one of Sara\u2019s friends asked her.\u201cYes,\u201d she said, which was simpler than explaining all the real reasons. At the time, we were living on opposite sides of San Francisco, and the commute between our places was soul killing. Writers and teachers could still afford to live in Los Angeles, so we started planning to move there.\u201cI so look forward to living near but not with you,\u201d Sara would say. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great when we\u2019re contiguous states,\u201d I would say.My stepmother, aware of trends, told us we would be \u201cLAT,\u201d for \u201cliving apart together,\u201d referring to couples that choose to live separately \u2014 even far apart \u2014 while remaining committed.Sara disagreed. \u201cWe\u2019re living together, apart.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s the same,\u201d my stepmother said.\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite.\u201dMy vote was with Sara. One roof, two households is a unique kind of commitment.My grandparents, who were together for more than 70 years, said that love is compromise. I think my grandfather said that because he was married to the least compromising woman on earth. My mother married twice and my father four times. I joked that I didn\u2019t come from a broken home; I came from scorched earth.And I was married once. My ex and I were together for 16 years, living in the shadow of my disastrous role models. When I got divorced, I felt like a failure for not avoiding my parents\u2019 fate. I wished love involved a little less compromise.I\u2019m older than Sara, a Pilates instructor with a full back dragon tattoo. At first it was a summer romance. She was funny, kind, intuitive and ambitious, and she made me feel like I could be my best self around her. I guess I did the same for her. But that didn\u2019t translate into either of us wanting to live together. If I have a singular concern, maybe a character flaw, it\u2019s my need for autonomy, for having my own space.Sara is the same way. She liked having me visit and liked it when I left. \u201cMostly,\u201d she said one day, \u201cit\u2019s about how you leave your sponge in the sink. You know there\u2019s a basket, right?\u201dNo matter how often she pointed it out, I kept leaving that sponge in a puddle. If we lived in a duplex, she would have her sponge and sink and I\u2019d have mine.\u201cAlso,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m a bad co-sleeper.\u201dSara sleeps like a starfish. Separate beds were crucial, and separate houses around them a luxury. I lose things. A lot. When I was married, the worst emotional roller coaster was when I reached for my keys, found them missing, and knew I hadn\u2019t moved them, so whose fault was it? It could only be my wife\u2019s, I\u2019d think, my anger pungent as sulfur, only to realize moments later that I had left them somewhere else. Followed by shame that I had briefly loathed the woman I lived with for a reason that had nothing to do with her.It was a double-edged message: Maybe living alone would keep me honest, or maybe my spiky anger would accompany me wherever I went.Eventually Sara and I found a small Spanish-style duplex with a huge succulent garden and deferred maintenance. There was a truckload of debris left by a previous occupant. I hired a hauling company, and one of the guys, on perhaps his third trip up the stairs, took in that the woman downstairs was my girlfriend. \u201cYou guys live separate?\u201d he said.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAdjacent?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHe extended his hand for a fist bump. \u201cI was married once,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all right.\u201dI could not quite take it as congratulations.I read biographies of authors because I\u2019m looking to not repeat their mistakes. You won\u2019t find me shooting an apple off my spouse\u2019s head. I note that after divorce, people have habit of finding the easier route, the less challenging follow-up, a way of maintaining distance to avoid pain. Sara was raised by a single mother who, before dying young, gave her pretty unimpeachable advice: Never depend on a man. It\u2019s been said that people are motivated by love or fear. So my question for us is: Are we doing this because we love each other or because we\u2019re afraid of each other?We\u2019ve been here almost five months. It turns out that most of what we predicted has come true \u2014 we love inviting each other over and also sending each other home. There is no design committee, so Sara has decorated her place in Klimt posters and religious icons, and mine is a little neurotically done up in comic book artwork.Weirdly, I have managed to keep my sponge in check now that the security of our love no longer depends on its location.The first time I went downstairs to see her, my hand was on her doorknob before I wondered if I should knock. Yes. She tends to sing out on my back porch before turning the knob. There haven\u2019t been a lot of other negotiations.Recently I celebrated a birthday. Sara gave me flowers and dinner at Musso & Frank\u2019s. That evening, we stood outside her door and kissed good night. Not to get too revealing, but we kiss better now than when we met, in part because we\u2019re saying a small goodbye each time. Nearly every night we still prefer to sleep in our own beds.I went upstairs and attempted to sleep but popped awake with worry. Is this arrangement good or secretly a ruin? Were Sara and I guaranteed to grow apart?No problem of the heart has been solved at 3 a.m. The truth was, I loved how we lived. My anxieties were about that being taken away. I knew I was making the choice to be here out of love, not fear. But when I\u2019m in need of comfort, I need skin contact. I thought about going downstairs, which would have involved unlocking Sara\u2019s door and startling her awake.It turned out that Sara and I were sharing experiences that night, if separately. In the morning I padded downstairs and learned that she had been awake in the night, too. Anxieties. She too loved this life and worried about it. She liked having me near, but sometimes the nights were hard. She noted the weird balance between wanting to depend on someone and feeling tentative about it. \u201cYou could have come up,\u201d I said.\u201cI could have?\u201dIt seemed obvious to me: Isn\u2019t it always a pleasure to be wanted?We sat on her couch for a while, drinking coffee. We held hands. After a few minutes, I stood up to go back to my place. I didn\u2019t really want to go, but I was being polite, and didn\u2019t want to lean too hard on this new intimacy.She looked at me, half-pouting. \u201cLeaving so soon?\u201dSo I sat back down. After a moment I remembered I had photos on my phone to show her, the cat and the squirrel, close together but slightly apart \u2014 and flirting. Glen David Gold lives in Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "Fighting Cancer by Chasing Tornadoes", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsMr. Saint-Pierre is a filmmaker.I often find my most interesting stories in unusual places. Last year I went to Duluth, Minn., from my home in Britain to film Chris Plys, an Olympic curler. On my last evening, Chris began telling a story about his young friend Mike Marz, an amateur storm chaser in Minneapolis. Another local man had just reached out to Mike to see a tornado after he\u2019d found out he had lung cancer. The man, Mark Zabawa, was a divorced, 60-year-old former serviceman and a recovering alcoholic. When I came back to Britain, I was determined to follow up and tracked Mike down on Facebook to discuss making a film about his experience of chasing storms with his new friend as he fought cancer.Tornado season is mainly in May and June, and it was already late April, so I took a gamble. Digging into my savings, I booked my ticket to Minneapolis and headed out for two weeks, wondering whether the storm gods would smile and the story would bear fruit. Though we\u2019d communicated only online, Mike (the amateur storm chaser) and Mark (recently finished with chemotherapy) were both welcoming, though I think they thought it was a bit odd for me to come all the way from London to film their antics.The first week the weather wasn\u2019t looking good, and the few storms we chased were a bust. (Not, I hoped, an omen for the fate of this film.) There was a lot of down time. Just as I was facing the possibility of going home empty-handed, three states away in Wyoming, the weather started looking good. Mike, overjoyed with anticipation of finally seeing a tornado, loaded up the car and we set out.Whether it\u2019s through hunting tornadoes or collecting stamps, we are all, I believe, searching for meaning in life. People find meaning in a singular love or passion, no matter how strange or dangerous it may be, that helps them to deal with the chaos of life. So while this film is about two men\u2019s search for a tornado, it\u2019s also about friendship. Adult men have long struggled to maintain meaningful bonds with other men, especially as they become older. Having a shared passion allows us to connect with others, even if it takes a tornado to do it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "6 Tips for Food Start-Ups ", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvice from a tasting and marketing guru.Many fledgling food makers try too hard, adding ingredients to their product just because they\u2019re new or popular. If you\u2019re calling your chocolate bar Raspberry Coconut Dream, those flavors should be easily identifiable when you take a bite. If you\u2019re marketing the product as healthy or wholesome, the ingredient list should follow suit. Ms. Masoni advises clients to \u201cput the food in a home, not a tomb.\u201d That means don\u2019t spend too much on packaging when you\u2019re just putting your product onto the market, or you\u2019ll end up without enough money to manufacture it. Start simple and plan for an upgrade as soon as you can afford it. If you submit your food to a formal judging or send samples to a potential buyer, make sure a skilled taster samples the batch you\u2019re about to ship, so you can catch rancidity, staleness or other defects. Buying perishable ingredients and processing them on a large scale is not the same as home or restaurant cooking; flavor and food safety can suffer. Many universities have food incubation or innovation centers that can offer advice. You can also ask a small-business development center at the local community college, or even the food-science department of any state university. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marc Benioff of Salesforce: \u2018Are We Not All Connected?\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bycorner officeA billionaire tech mogul with a spiritual side, Mr. Benioff riffs on his early days at Apple and Oracle, and what\u2019s wrong with Facebook. Salesforce may not be a household name like Facebook or Twitter, but the software company and its chief executive, Marc Benioff, are hugely influential forces in the technology industry. Salesforce is a cloud computing pioneer that helped popularize the software-as-a-service business model. And Mr. Benioff has fashioned himself as a benevolent chieftain who can make the world a better place while making hefty profits, too. An entrepreneur at an early age, Mr. Benioff became a star executive at Oracle before leaving to co-found Salesforce nearly 20 years ago. Today, Salesforce is worth roughly $100 billion, and Mr. Benioff is a billionaire many times over. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Salesforce headquarters in San Francisco.What was your childhood like? Do you want me to lie down? Yeah. Close your eyes and count backward from 100.O.K., great. I\u2019m happy to. I was born an entrepreneur. When I was about 12 years old, I would go around to people\u2019s homes and repair their antennas and their CB radios. Then I got a regular job at a jewelry store, cleaning the cases after school, which I did not really enjoy. But across the street there was a Radio Shack and that\u2019s where I found a computer for the first time. I wrote my first piece of software, and sold it when I was about 15 years old.In 1984, you interned at Apple. What was that like? I was at the University of Southern California, putting myself through school with royalties of my software company. And I was writing a bunch of adventure games for the Atari 800, the Apple II, the Commodore 64. Then when the Macintosh was introduced in 1984, I sold my other computers and bought the Macintoshes.The summer before my junior year, I worked for Apple. There was a pirate flag on the roof. There was a motorcycle in the lobby. Steve Jobs was running between the two Macintosh buildings. It was a big scene.What did you do there? No one was really paying attention exactly to what I was doing. I wrote this piece of software which was a game called \u201cRaid on Armonk,\u201d which was where IBM\u2019s headquarters were at the time. And my manager said to me, \u201cNo, no. You cannot do this.\u201dWhat did you do after college? I wrote a business plan for a network-type company based on something that Apple was working on called AppleLink. But U.S.C. was like, \u201cNo, no. You\u2019re not going to create a company when you graduate from school. We want you to go get a real job in a real company, and we want you to go into sales.\u201d So I asked around, and this person who I was working with at Apple mentioned this company called Oracle.What did you learn while you were at Oracle? Then Larry [Ellison, Oracle\u2019s co-founder] took notice of me, and I started working directly for him. That was a very powerful moment, when he started to shape how I thought about business. Larry took the long view. He was like, \u201cI want to think about this company over 50 years, not over 10 years or five years.\u201d Now he\u2019s been doing it for 40 years.Why did you strike out on your own? As I came into my 10th year at Oracle, I was really burning out, but I couldn\u2019t exactly figure out why. I didn\u2019t have a good feeling when I went in the building. I went into Larry\u2019s office and said, \u201cI need to take some time off.\u201d And right away he said, \u201cYeah, why don\u2019t you just take a sabbatical. You\u2019ve worked really hard for 10 years.\u201dFirst I went to Hawaii for a few months and really, really worked on my meditation practice. Then I went to India for six weeks with a friend of mine who was also going through a similar life transformation. We had these amazing experiences going to all of these different ashrams and meeting all these different spiritual masters. It was almost like a guru tour. I definitely came back from that trip as a different person. How so? I came back with a clear vision of what the future of the internet was going to be in regards to software-as-a-service and cloud computing. I also had a much deeper sense of my spiritual self. So I said, \u201cWhen I start a company, I will integrate culture with service.\u201d When I started Salesforce, on March 8, 1999, I said we\u2019re going to put one percent of our equity, product and time into a foundation and create a culture of service within our company. We\u2019ll be creating new technology, the cloud; we\u2019ll be creating a new business model, subscription services; and we\u2019ll create a culture built on philanthropy.How do you make sure new Salesforce employees get what the company\u2019s all about?On their first day of work, we take everyone and we show them the kitchen and the bathroom and their office and their desk. Then we take them out and they do service in the afternoon. They\u2019ll go to a homeless shelter or they\u2019ll go to the hospital or go to a public school. This is a very core part of our culture.I want a company where people are excited to come to work every day, where they feel good when they get here, where it doesn\u2019t take from them, but it\u2019s giving to them, it\u2019s giving to others. Why do people want to be here? It\u2019s not that we have more amenities than everybody else. We have less. We don\u2019t have a cafeteria. But we have a stronger purpose and a stronger mission. A reader, Ellen McBarnette, asks, \u201cDo public companies have a responsibility to contribute to the public good?\u201dThere\u2019s a shift going on. When I went to U.S.C., it was all about maximizing value for shareholders. But we\u2019re moving into a world of stakeholders. It\u2019s not just about shareholders. Your employees are stakeholders, so are your customers, your partners, the communities that you\u2019re in, the homeless that are nearby, your public schools. A company like ours can\u2019t be successful in an unsuccessful economy or in an unsuccessful environment or where the school system doesn\u2019t work. We have to take responsibility for all of those things. This idea that somebody put into our heads \u2014 that companies are somehow these kind of individuated units that are separate from society and don\u2019t have to be paying attention to the communities they\u2019re in \u2014 that is incorrect. We need to have a more enlightened view about the role of companies. This company is not somehow separate from everything else. Are we not all connected? Are we not all one? Isn\u2019t that the point?So what is Salesforce doing about it? Salesforce is the biggest tech company in San Francisco. We can unleash a power onto this city. All of these people can go into the public schools and volunteer, and they can work and make the city better. They can improve the state of the city, improve the state of the world. All I have to do is give them permission to do that.You\u2019ve been outspoken on issues like L.G.B.T.Q. rights and tougher gun laws. What issues are you focused on right now? We\u2019re working on the homeless programs here. We have a plan to get every homeless family off the streets within five years.That\u2019s a pretty ambitious goal. Are you setting yourself up for failure? We\u2019ve already moved hundreds of families back into society and into homes. But we cannot delegate these complex problems off to the government and say, \u201cWe\u2019re not all part of it.\u201d They\u2019re part of the solution, but I believe that for $150 million, we can get every homeless person in San Francisco into homes.Now when I say every single person, I actually don\u2019t believe it. There are some people in San Francisco who are intentionally homeless. They just want to be homeless. San Francisco is kind of the Four Seasons of homelessness. They all say this is the best place in the world to be homeless.His memo is very clear. He talks about putting growth above trust, and you can\u2019t do that. Never put growth before trust. If you put growth above trust, then all of a sudden you create a toxic culture. People don\u2019t want to work in that environment or use the product. Then you get these campaigns, #deleteuber, #deletefacebook. It\u2019s a referendum on the culture, not the product.Has your meditation practice influenced how you lead? Having a beginner\u2019s mind informs my management style. I\u2019m trying to listen deeply, and the beginner\u2019s mind is informing me to step back, so that I can create what wants to be, not what was. I know that the future does not equal the past. I know that I have to be here in the moment. Advertisement"}

In 1979, It Was Clips From the \u2018Morgue.\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Steve Lohr, a technology reporter in New York, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You\u2019ve worked for The Times for nearly 40 years, so you\u2019re like our in-house historian. Tell us a little about that history.I joined The Times when I was 28 years old, in December 1979. I spent less than two years in New York, and then a decade as a foreign correspondent, based in Tokyo, Manila and London. Then, I did a couple of years in two editing stints, before I was able to get back to being a reporter.How has using technology to report for The Times changed for you over the years?When I started at The Times, nothing was online. To research a story, you started by going to the \u201cmorgue,\u201d a large room where people cut out old stories and placed them in row after row of file drawers, grouped by subject.The files weren\u2019t just Times articles. They often included pieces from The New Yorker, Life, Esquire, New York and elsewhere.Personal computers were hobbyist curiosities, not yet used in newsrooms. We wrote on terminals linked to a central computer. The terminals were shared, two for every four reporters. Sometimes, that created problems.The most territorial reporters took a squatter\u2019s rights approach \u2014 get on a terminal and camp out, no matter how distant their deadline. Rather than fight, I managed to get a password for signing onto any terminal in the building. So I\u2019d just find an open terminal in some other part of the newsroom. But that meant you were away from your phone. No cellphones then.When I went to Tokyo, it was back to a typewriter and a small Underwood portable, which was the laptop of its day. We wrote stories, 200 words on a page, and hand-delivered them to the Reuters office across town, to be cabled to New York. Later, we moved to small word-processing computers \u2014 Tandy 100s and then Tandy 200s, with phone couplers for the modem connections. In some places, the phone service wasn\u2019t good enough to transmit by modem. Then, you\u2019d just call in your story and dictate it to the Times phone room.Then came the internet era. How did that change how you report?The internet, put simply, is a low-cost communications network. Everything else, like the web, builds on top of that. And having so much information online can be a gold mine for reporting. In my case, I report on technology and economics these days.Silicon Valley is a caldron of innovation. But all the big issues surrounding technology\u2019s impact on the world \u2014 like automation, economic opportunity and income disparity \u2014 are playing out outside the tech hubs, across the $20 trillion American economy. Tons of research is being done on those subjects, and it\u2019s all online \u2014 working papers from the National Bureau of Economic Research and the Social Science Research Network, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and scientific studies.What it means is you can test your assumptions for any trend or explanatory story. Is the lively anecdote you just came across an outlier, or representative of a broader phenomenon? Early in reporting a subject, you can get an answer to the question: What story do the numbers tell you? That is a powerful tool that applies to most fields today, including journalism.Outside of work, what tech products are you currently obsessed with?I live in an apartment with more than 4,000 books, and yet I\u2019ve also become a huge Kindle fan. It\u2019s just so convenient, a library in a lightweight tablet. For big books, like William Taubman\u2019s biography of Mikhail Gorbachev, published last year, I\u2019ll sometimes buy both the hardcover and the digital versions. Each has its advantages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Plan for NYC Schools Isn\u2019t Anti-Asian. It\u2019s Anti-Racist.", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt gives a diverse group of working-class kids a fairer shot, which shouldn\u2019t be controversial.Ms. Pham is a scholar of Asian-American studies whose child attends New York City public schools.Eventually, his goal is to eliminate the exam, called the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. Instead, top students from all of the approximately 600 middle schools in the city would be admitted to the elite high schools. This would make the student bodies of these schools \u2014 among them storied institutions such as Stuyvesant and Bronx Science \u2014 more closely resemble the city\u2019s wider public school population in terms of race and class.This is not just a good thing. It\u2019s the right thing.Unfortunately, some Asian-American parents in New York are protesting this proposal, arguing that it is anti-Asian because it would decrease the number of Asian children in elite schools. They are on the wrong side of this educational fight.The mayor\u2019s plan isn\u2019t anti-Asian, it\u2019s anti-racist. It would give working-class parents \u2014 including Asian-Americans \u2014 who can\u2019t afford and shouldn\u2019t have to find ways to afford expensive test prep programs a fairer chance that their child will be admitted into what\u2019s known as a specialized high school. True, taking a test prep course doesn\u2019t guarantee admission to such a school, but it does offer clear benefits and is widely understood to be essential to test-takers.That means that only five percent of kids are getting access to a valuable public resource. Frankly, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t fix this problem of inequality. Under his plan, even though the elite high schools would get a bigger range of students, the number of children getting access to this public resource will remain about the same \u2014 minuscule.To be against Mr. de Blasio\u2019s proposal is to be against a very limited attempt at giving more kids access to a limited resource. His plan doesn\u2019t add more seats. It just allows more kids a shot at one of those seats \u2014 kids whose families can\u2019t afford years of test prep classes and tutors, who live in under-resourced districts, and yet who still manage to excel in their own schools.Sadly, rather than fighting a system that undermines the principle that everyone has an equal right to public resources (while enriching the test prep industry), too many Asians have chosen to preserve the status quo by buying into racism against blacks and the white supremacist system built on it.The Specialized High Schools Admissions Test is an instrument for the uneven distribution of a public resource. It perpetuates and legitimizes the already uneven distribution of other public resources and services. Getting rid of it means that more kids will have a bit more access to the best of what this city has to offer.Opposing the mayor\u2019s plan isn\u2019t the right fight. The right fight is for the improvement of all of our public schools.Minh-Ha T. Pham is an associate professor at Pratt Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ladybugs, Aphids and the Toxic Combat That Might Be Happening in Your Garden", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAphids are a familiar sight in the garden, sucking the juices out of your rose bushes. Luckily, so are ladybugs, which prey on aphids and keep them in check. But the relationship between predator and prey is more complex than you might think. Aphids may be important to the survival of some ladybug species we have come to know and love by warding off another predator that has been moving in and feasting on them.The arrival about 30 years ago in the United States of the multicolored Asian lady beetle, or Harmonia axyridis, which gleefully devours other ladybugs\u2019 larvae, led to a drop in numbers of the seven-spotted lady beetle. Although the seven-spotted beetle is also an invasive species, it has been around longer than the Asian lady beetle, and exists alongside native ladybug species, which also take a beating. The aphids in the study, which are themselves invasive, are all from the same species and all look exactly the same. But some are toxic to the Asian lady beetle and others are not. Although researchers still don\u2019t know what the toxic substance is, whether aphids have it or not seems to depend on what plants they\u2019ve been eating, as well as their parentage, says Paul Lenhart, an entomology researcher at the University of Kentucky. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a refuge where there\u2019s no Harmonia that\u2019s going to eat them,\u201d Dr. Lenhart said.This suggests that there may be ways for prey to protect predators that are less damaging than the alternative. That may help explain why some native ladybug species have held on despite having many invasive species to compete with. \u201cThey\u2019ve declined, but they\u2019re still around,\u201d said Dr. Lenhart. \u201cSo there are probably very subtle ways that predators divide up food resources.\u201d\u201cThis is a hodgepodge of native and invasive species, which is becoming more and more common,\u201d said Dr. Lenhart. \u201cThese aren\u2019t natural systems, but these are the systems we have to deal with now.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Botched Statue Restoration in Spain: Is That St. George or Tintin?", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive hundred years in an alcove of a Spanish church is likely to leave any statue looking a bit cracked and faded, and the 16th-century wooden figure of St. George at St. Michael\u2019s Church in Estella, a town in northern Spain, was no exception.Instead of returning the statue to its original glory, the so-called restoration left St. George looking more like a childish model of a cartoon character than a precious piece of art.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was done with malice, but they obviously have not acted responsibly with the treasure they had in their possession,\u201d Koldo Leoz, the mayor of Estella, said on Tuesday.As news about what happened spread, Twitter users likened the St. George statue to Tintin or to a Playmobil character.\u201cI saw photographs of the atrocity they were committing,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a professional, I feel disconcerted and very offended. It takes years to acquire the skills necessary to carry out these kind of restorations, so imagine the frustration when something like this happens.\u201dMs. Us\u00faa said that the statue was a rare example of the use of \u201cpolychrome\u201d layers of paint, and that it had incredible detail to the armor. \u201cIt had everything,\u201d she said, adding that the result \u201creally hurts.\u201dMr. Leoz, the mayor, said that the restoration job had not been authorized by the region\u2019s heritage institution, and that the town\u2019s authorities had been notified only a few days ago, by which time most of the damage had been done.\u201cPeople are disappointed and sad,\u201d he added. \u201cEstella used to be known as a place that took care of its heritage, now we\u2019re famous for the opposite.\u201dMr. Leoz said the restoration, which started about a month ago, had been carried out by a workshop with more expertise in arts and crafts for children and basic furniture repairs than in professional restoration.Calls to the company that carried out the work went unanswered on Tuesday, and its Facebook page seemed to have been deactivated.\u201cWe have experts examining the statue now to see whether the damage can be undone,\u201d Mr. Leoz said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the detail of the armor and original colors have been lost forever.\u201dIn that case, an elderly parishioner, Cecilia Gim\u00e9nez, admitted repainting the fresco because she was upset that parts of it had flaked off as a result of moisture on the church\u2019s walls.Whether the St. George in Estella will have a similarly successful second act remains to be seen.Advertisement"}

But it was an assault by a man on the street, she said, that made her realize her life was truly in danger.So on a warm July night in 2013, she packed a bag and asked a friend to drop her off at the border in Tijuana.This Pride Month arrives at a peculiar moment for Ms. Ortega, who now resides in Corona, Queens: It\u2019s a time when part of her identity is being celebrated, even while the climate around refugees fleeing violence is rapidly shifting.\u201cIf you are cisgender and an immigrant, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Ms. Ortega said on a recent afternoon. \u201cIf you\u2019re transgender and an immigrant, it\u2019s even more difficult. And undocumented, even worse.\u201dWhen Ms. Ortega arrived to the border in 2013, she was put into detention with men, she said, where she was often harassed and denied resources.\u201cWhen I arrived, I went three days without being able to take a shower, being able to fix my face, shave,\u201d said Ms. Ortega. \u201cEveryone was laughing at me when they were looking at me.\u201dAfter nearly two months, Ms. Ortega was released. She moved to New York the next year, armed with a green card, ambition and multiple technical degrees. But even here, she encountered a problem that she said is common among transgender women.\u201cI applied to many places as a woman and they wouldn\u2019t hire me,\u201d she said, \u201cI realized that regardless if you\u2019re a citizen, or an immigrant or whatever, you\u2019re still very far behind just for being a trans woman.

{"Headline": "Confused About Last Night\u2019s \u2018Westworld\u2019 Season 2 Finale? Here\u2019s What to Read", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWestworld\u201cThese violent delights have violent ends\u201d was the de facto refrain of \u201cWestworld\u201d Season 1, which concluded with a revolt among the titular theme park\u2019s robotic hosts. But if, after one viewing, you could discern what the \u201cends\u201d of Sunday\u2019s incredibly complicated Season 2 finale comprised \u2014 and when in the show\u2019s multiple timelines they all took place \u2014 then that must have been pretty delightful in itself.For those of us who are, understandably, still baffled, here\u2019s a roundup of recaps, interviews and explainers that should help answer any lingering questions.Sophie Gilbert opens a conversation among The Atlantic\u2019s staff with the following handy summary of its last half-hour: \u201cDolores was reborn (born isn\u2019t quite the right word but we do the best we can) into Charlotte Hale\u2019s body, waved through security protocols by a (perhaps) in-on-the-secret Stubbs, and escorted onto a boat to her new life among humans on the mainland. Maeve made a triumphant escape, and survived long enough to usher her daughter to safety in a kind of robot paradise coded by Ford. Akecheta also made it to the other side, and a reunion with Kohana that was one of the most poignant moments of the season. Sizemore went out in a blaze of glory that seemed \u2026 unnecessary, logically? (He couldn\u2019t have bought Maeve that much time, and Hector died anyway.) Dolores somehow (it\u2019s unclear) brought Teddy back to life and dispatched him to Host Eden, even though the portal had already closed.\u201dSpeaking of Stubbs, did the finale establish that he was a Bernard-style secret host, too? Joanna Robinson reports that the episode\u2019s director, Fred Toye, supports the theory that it did \u2014 and Robinson goes on to explore the implications of this particular twist.If you still have a lot of questions about what transpired in the episode \u2014 who\u2019s alive, who\u2019s dead, who went to host heaven and what host heaven actually is \u2014 Scott Meslow provides thorough answers.In an interview with Jennifer Vineyard, Jeffrey Wright reveals that the ideas underpinning Bernard\u2019s character arc in Season 2 involved \u201cagency, self-determination, of creating himself in his own image, of freedom.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt really is about this patriarchal hierarchy that existed between [Bernard] and Ford. That\u2019s been his host\u2019s life\u2019s purpose. And when he\u2019s finally able to shatter that, when he rejects Ford and heads out into the desert on his own, that\u2019s where it begins.\u201dThe show\u2019s co-creator Jonathan Nolan connected its themes to contemporary politics in a conversation with Danielle Turchiano. \u201cYou turn on the news these days and it feels like there are at least two different types of human beings with different value systems, and it\u2019s frustrating in a democracy [but] they\u2019re almost in perfect opposition to one another, these values that we hold,\u201d Nolan tells Turchiano. \u201cSo we were very interested in this idea that Dolores\u2019 take on it, and I think Dolores would be a student of the game enough to understand, \u2018O.K. humans are the master of survival on this planet\u2019 \u2014 they outcompeted everything else \u2014 and one of those strategies, even if it\u2019s just a subconscious one or more of an accidental or evolutional one, is a selection of this team of rivals approach.\u201dPublished before the finale aired, Brian Barrett\u2019s observant piece teases out the parallels between Westworld\u2019s surveillance of its guests and recent user-data crises like Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal and last year\u2019s Equifax security breach. \u201cThe park\u2019s visitors literally sign away their DNA,\u201d Barrett reminds viewers. \u201cAnd while the Westworld ToS does guarantee \u2018absolute privacy while using The Service as outlined in this document,\u2019 it specifies only that other guests can\u2019t record your actions. Your brain-scan hat, though? Fair game.\u201dDevon Ivie writes: \u201cWith Host William now taking center stage, this leaves us with quite a few key questions going into the third season: Why was a host version of William created in the first place? Where is Human William? And when exactly is this scene happening?\u201dKatja Herbers, who plays Emily, isn\u2019t even certain that William can be called a host in the post-credits scene. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what he is,\u201d she tells Jennifer Drysdale. \u201cI think he might be something else entirely, but I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think he was the human that he was long ago, because I think that man would have been dead for some time. But, because I think it said, \u2018in the far future.\u2019 But I don\u2019t know what he is at this point.\u201dAlan Sepinwall was not a fan of the show\u2019s second season, either. \u201cMore and more as I watched Season 2, I found myself as incredulous about how Nolan and Joy were using their toys as so many people are about how Ford used his,\u201d he concludes. \u201cWith unlimited resources and imagination, they\u2019ve opted to continue making cold and largely impenetrable puzzle-box nonsense.\u201dAlthough she admits that she has never known quite what was happening on the show, Sonia Saraiya writes that its appeal lies in the fact that \u201c\u2018Westworld\u2019 offers not a broken, confusing, messy world like our own, but a world with a purpose \u2014 a world calibrated to unfold according to a gorgeous, lofty plan.\u201d She continues: \u201cIt\u2019s still bloody and terrifying, full of struggle like our own world. But then again, every moment of \u2018Westworld\u2019 seems laden with meaning, and the world comes together with a detail that suggests close attention.\u201dWill Season 3 take place in the real world? \u201cYes,\u201d says Nolan, in a revealing conversation with James Hibberd. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long buildup to get outside the park. And we\u2019re incredibly excited about what that looks like and sounds like and what exactly our hosts discover out there.\u201d Nolan also offers some insight into the post-credits sequence.Danny Heifetz concludes his sharp explainer on the finale with a concise summary of the challenges the show\u2019s writers are likely to face in Season 3. \u201cRecreating the Westworld park from Michael Crichton\u2019s original source material was a feat, but now the \u2018Westworld\u2019 writers have to flex their sci-fi muscles more than ever before by imagining the virtual utopia the hosts just entered,\u201d he notes, \u201cplus what society looks like 30 years from now (when the show takes place), where it is (Arnold\u2019s house could be in the South China Sea or a moon off of Saturn), and how their two main characters will interact with the world.\u201dTim Goodman found much of Season 2, including the finale, frustrating. But he has high hopes for the hosts\u2019 entry into the real world in Season 3. \u201cPart of the appeal of the television series has always been Nolan and Joy\u2019s willingness to expand its boundaries,\u201d Goodman writes. \u201cAnd if we didn\u2019t get quite enough Shogun World (or other worlds/parks for that matter) for my taste, the third season sets up a blueprint that would allow Dolores, Bernard and Charlotte \u2014 or at least the nonhuman version of Charlotte \u2014 to live in the real world, expand the number of hosts who will exist beyond the walls and, at the same time, keep those left behind (or dead) in the parks relevant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Snapchat Makes Mini Movies in Augmented Reality", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA.R. may change entertainment as we know it. For Snapchat, the revolution starts with 15-second cartoons.LOS ANGELES \u2014 On a cool, sunny day in April, a short Frisbee toss from Venice Beach, a team of seven animators sat around a conference table, workshopping a storyboard from an unusual cartoon series. In the storyboard \u2014 rudimentary, comic-striplike panels tracing the arc of a scene \u2014 a barefoot man in rolled-up jeans stands at the edge of a bed of flaming hot coals. The man gathers his nerve, walks across the coals without incident and does a little celebratory dance. But his celebration is premature; in a plot twist in the final frame, his feet burst into flames.Some of the notes in the room weren\u2019t far from what you\u2019d expect in any introductory art class. But other feedback was more peculiar. In lieu of a setting for the story, the animators discussed only how they could \u201cindicate an environment,\u201d perhaps using sand or grass. Later, there was a curious debate about whether or not the character \u2014 otherwise recognizable as a human male \u2014 had any toes. Everyone agreed that they didn\u2019t know for certain. The equivalent of blockbusters, which will rely on special headsets like Magic Leap\u2019s Lightwear and Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens, are in development. And Facebook (which owns the virtual reality company Oculus), Apple and Google have all moved in the last year to make it easier for third-party developers to create new kinds of A.R. experiences for mobile phones. In late 2016, the Libermans\u2019 unique background caught the attention of executives at Snap, which, one year earlier, had demonstrated A.R.\u2019s potential as a creative platform with the rollout of animated overlays on selfies. The company jointly hired the foursome to develop animated A.R. characters based on Bitmoji. \u201cThey\u2019d been there and done that,\u201d said Eitan Pilipski, vice president of camera platform at Snap, Snapchat\u2019s parent company. \u201cThere was an amazing opportunity to take their creative thinking and put it in the hands of our users.\u201dSharing an office with three of your siblings could be a recipe for disaster, but it seems to have the opposite effect on the Libermans. In Venice Beach, they were like different limbs of the same chestnut-haired, fair-skinned organism, finishing one another\u2019s sentences when not cracking up at inside jokes. The Libermans shared a house for a time when they moved to Los Angeles, too, then spread out to their current arrangement in three apartments on the same street. \u201cBefore college we were together constantly, and afterward it\u2019s been the same,\u201d said David, technology lead, 34.\u201cIt has the feel of being a little under the radar but on the cutting edge,\u201d she said. She also pinpointed something else that might explain Snapchat\u2019s appeal. \u201cA Pixar movie takes five years to make,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an artist, that\u2019s two films in a decade, whereas at a place like Snapchat you can create a lot more volume.\u201dEach of the Libermans handles different responsibilities, which Anna, production lead, 36, said were based on their individual personalities: \u201cDaniil is very creative and helps us to write jokes. Maria is verbal and good at understanding story structure. I\u2019m very good at talking to people and getting them committed to specific dates and times. And David is very technical and has a strong engineering background.\u201dIn the animation stage, the animators aim to \u201csell\u201d the idea of the story, which should be easily \u201cread\u201d by the viewer without the benefit of dialogue (recording multiple languages and voice styles would be too resource intensive). The animators often film themselves role-playing as the character, or pull reference videos from YouTube, in order to realistically portray body movement.Because 3D Bitmoji episodes are designed to be sent between friends, they aren\u2019t just entertainment \u2014 they\u2019re custom memes, conveying the sender\u2019s mood or status. The most successful tend to be those that capture a common experience or sentiment, sometimes indirectly. Anna described \u201cHot Coals\u201d as a universal story about facing your fears, leavened with the twist at the end (what Snap\u2019s animators call a \u201cbonus\u201d) when the character catches fire. That made Maria recall a sort of spiritual precursor, an earlier animation involving a pregnant pause at the top of a diving board. One user\u2019s caption: \u201cMe getting into a new relationship.\u201dWhen the technology is sufficiently mature, experts expect that most forms of entertainment will be reimagined for augmented reality. Mr. Lelyveld, of the Entertainment Technology Center, predicted a surge in sophisticated narrative A.R. experiences in 18 to 24 months, when glasses allowing users to circumnavigate fixed virtual objects in physical space are projected to be widely available. Hands-free A.R. (which may one day rely on contact lenses or cortical implants) could unleash the potential for stories that blur the line between fiction and lived experience. They may share elements with linear film and television, or task-oriented video games. \u201cYou could be watching a sitcom like \u2018Friends,\u2019 but instead of the \u2018Friends\u2019 kitchen table, the characters are all sitting around your kitchen table,\u201d Ms. Burnett said. But the medium\u2019s capacity for contextual awareness allows for hybrid forms unlike any that exist today.Experts cautioned that it was still too soon to say what shape they may ultimately take. \u201cOur language has always been 2D, and if your language can\u2019t express it, you can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d Mr. Lelyveld said. But Hollywood studios are already girding themselves for the new reality. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer science fiction,\u201d said Ms. Papagiannis, the A.R. researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dAfter making it through the gantlet of animation review, \u201cHot Coals\u201d was ready for the final stage of its production cycle before testing and publication: visual effects. The Libermans\u2019 VFX artists added dancing flames, floating embers and, for the climactic moment when the character catches fire, pillars of white smoke. \u201cThe characters are very cartoony, but because they inhabit a real-world environment, atmospheric elements need to be quite realistic in order to bridge the gap,\u201d Anna said.While Mr. Pilipski declined to outline the course of that journey, Snapchat recently rolled out an in-app product, called Snappables, which allows users to play simple A.R. games (How many digital strawberries can you catch in your mouth in 10 seconds?) and invite friends to join. The company also makes sunglasses with embedded cameras, called Spectacles, though they\u2019re not currently A.R. capable.One path Snap isn\u2019t likely to pursue is making 3D Bitmoji more closely resemble their flesh-and-blood analogues. Asked if the company would pivot to lifelike virtual avatars as technology advances, the Bitstrips chief executive, Ba Blackstock, a former cartoonist who joined Snap after the acquisition, balked.All animations courtesy of Snapchat.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the author of \u201cAugmented Human.\" She is Helen Papagiannis, not Pappagiannis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Search for Thai Boys Lost in Cave Hits Day 5, a Nation Holds Its Breath", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHAM LUANG CAVE, Thailand \u2014 Dozens of soldiers and park rangers lined up at the cave\u2019s mouth, carrying in supplies. Teams of navy divers worked their way through submerged passageways in the flooded cavern. The vigil of family and friends outside echoed across Thailand on social media and television.On Wednesday, the fifth day of an intense search for a young soccer team and coach trapped by rising waters inside the Tham Luang Cave in northern Thailand, there was still no indication where they were.But the search, spanning more than a dozen local and national government agencies, continues, along with the hope that they are still alive.\u201cIn whatever part the rescue team and officers play in the mission, I ask them to think of the boys as their own children because they will care so much about them,\u201d the governor of Chiang Rai Province, Narongsak Osottanakorn, told reporters at the scene on Tuesday night. \u201cWe won\u2019t abandon them. We are in this fully.\u201dTham Luang is an extensive network of chambers linked by passageways that flood during heavy rains. A sign outside warns visitors that in the rainy months starting in July, it is unsafe to go inside.From the entrance, a path leads about two miles into the cave complex before splitting into two directions, said Vernon Unsworth, a British spelunker who lives in Chiang Rai and has been exploring Tham Luang for more than six years.At that junction, he said, the path goes about a mile in one direction and more than four miles in the other. The trail rises and falls, and many sections are now submerged, said Mr. Unsworth, who is helping with the rescue operation.Footprints and handprints found within indicate that the boys passed the junction before the water rose and trapped them. But the divers have searched many of the chambers without finding any further signs of the group.The air in the cave is thin, but there are many places where they could have taken refuge that have enough oxygen to sustain them, Mr. Unsworth said.The United States Pacific Command said it had sent a search and rescue team to assist in locating the group, at the request of the Thai government. \u201cWe hope the players and their coach will be brought home quickly and safely,\u201d said Nicole Schwegman, a Navy lieutenant commander.The soccer team, called Moo Pa Academy and made up of boys ages 11 to 16, practiced as usual on Saturday morning. Afterward, a dozen players and their 25-year-old coach hopped on their bicycles and rode six miles to the cavern. They parked their bikes inside the mouth of the cave.Then the rain started.One teammate, Songpul Kanthawong, 13, didn\u2019t go to the cave because he didn\u2019t have his bicycle with him at practice.On Saturday evening, as worried parents searched for their missing children, someone asked him where his teammates were. The cave, he said.On Tuesday evening, after days of rain had made the mud outside the cavern thick and deep, the boy was worried. Everyone who lives in the area is aware of the danger, he said.\u201cThey should have known,\u201d he said. \u201cThey probably didn\u2019t think the water would come up.\u201dRelatives of the missing have been maintaining a vigil near the cave since Saturday, some of them spending nights there despite the rainy weather. Praying, they fill rows of plastic chairs under a temporary shelter. High-level officials come and go, with police escorts.King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, whose youngest son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, is 13, was said to be following developments closely. At one point, the king expressed concern through his secretary about traffic congestion and disorder at the scene. His sister, Princess Chulabhorn, donated $15,000 to the effort, Thai media said.After a night of heavy rain, divers spent Wednesday trying to get through narrow, flooded passageways. The hope was to reach remote chambers where the boys and their coach might have taken refuge.Irrigation workers began an operation Tuesday afternoon using more than a dozen large pumps and pipes to drain a small lake and make room for water from the cave. And the governor said Wednesday that crews were pumping water out of the cave, but that the water level was still rising.Teams were searching the rugged mountain above the cave for openings that would give them access.\u201cThere are only two ways to rescue the boys,\u201d the governor said. \u201cEither get them out from above or drain the water out.\u201dThe director general of the national park, wildlife and plants department, Thanya Netithamkul, said searchers had found a vertical shaft that appeared to lead into the cave, and had dropped in food and drinking water in case the group was nearby.\u201cWith all the work, we hope to find them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have hope.\u201dThe cave is in Tham Luang-Khun Nam Nang Non Forest Park, near the city of Chiang Rai. The entrance is about two miles from the Myanmar border.The park headquarters is serving as the rescue command center, and it is teeming with people there to help. Hundreds of soldiers were lined up along muddy paths or stood under trees with their units, ready for action.At the entrance to the cave, soldiers and workers carried in rope, communications equipment, cables and other gear. About 200 people were deployed deeper in the cave in three locations, the complex\u2019s first cavern and two staging areas farther inside, officials said.Experts are trying to determine where the water is entering the cave, in the hope of diverting it, but so far they have not able to find the source.\u201cIf we could find the source of the water coming in, we would have a better chance,\u201d said Mr. Unsworth, the spelunker. \u201cIt could even be in Myanmar for all we know.\u201dSeveral family members had kind words about the coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, and said they were not angry with him.

{"Headline": "South Pacific Nation Shrugs Off Worries on China\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTO ISLAND, Vanuatu \u2014 Australian officials have become increasingly concerned about China\u2019s influence in the small island countries of the South Pacific, especially around infrastructure like a gleaming new wharf in Vanuatu that was built by a Chinese construction company and financed by the Chinese government.But in a sign of the growing divide over China\u2019s role, Vanuatu\u2019s leaders are pushing back \u2014 sharing for the first time the contract this country signed with China for the wharf, and arguing they are perfectly capable of paying back the loans and making decisions on their own about when to work with China.\u201cThe loan was considered economically viable for such infrastructure as the main gateway for international trade between the northern part of the country and the rest of the world,\u201d said Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu of Vanuatu.His decision to share the contract was just the latest example of how Vanuatu, a nation of roughly 80 islands and 270,000 people, is trying to alleviate the concerns of Australia, New Zealand and the United States about whether China sees the archipelago as a vulnerable mark, and a potential military outpost.The wharf was built by the Shanghai Construction Group Co. Ltd. and opened last August. In recent weeks it has become a source of concern in Australia, where defense officials worry that Vanuatu and China have discussed a possible Chinese military base, which could make the wharf available for military and commercial use.Australian officials and experts have also questioned the terms of the financing deal, suggesting that in the case of default, China could seize the wharf directly through a \u201cdebt equity swap\u201d like what was used to take over Sri Lanka\u2019s main port when that nation fell behind on Chinese loans.But Mr. Regenvanu, sharing a copy of the contract signed in 2014, confirmed it did not include a debt equity swap clause. He said Vanuatu sees the wharf as valuable and necessary for hosting the fast-growing cruise ship and agricultural exports industries.In the wake of Australian news reports about a potential Chinese military facility, Prime Minister Charlot Salwai of Vanuatu personally assured Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia that Vanuatu was not in discussions with China about a base.Vanuatu, Mr. Regenvanu said, prefers neutrality. The country is a longtime member of the Nonaligned Movement \u2014 a group of countries not formally aligned with any superpower \u2014 and he cited that membership as a reason Vanuatu would never allow a Chinese military installation.Vanuatu, however, was the first Pacific nation to support China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea and its ties to China have been increasing. For several years now, China has been on a construction spree in Vanuatu, erecting government buildings, stadiums, convention centers, roads and extensions to Port Vila\u2019s runway to allow for larger planes.Direct weekly flights from Beijing and Shanghai are expected to start at the end of the year.The wharf on Santo Island has long been strategic. First built by Seabees during World War II, Vanuatu (then called the New Hebrides) was the second-largest American military base in the Pacific after Hawaii. More than half a million troops passed through the port on their way to fighting crucial battles at Guadalcanal in the neighboring Solomon Islands.Despite the government of Vanuatu\u2019s assurances, experts said the terms in the contract between Vanuatu and China\u2019s EXIM Bank, with Shanghai Construction Group Co. Ltd. as supplier or builder, are heavily weighted in China\u2019s favor in the event of a default.The terms are more restrictive than the loan provided by Japan for a similar wharf.Japan\u2019s loan provides a 10-year grace period, a loan with interest of .55 percent and a repayment schedule of 40 years.The Chinese EXIM Bank loan has a five-year grace period, interest of 2.5 percent and a 15-year repayment schedule.In the case of nonpayment, China can also call in the entire debt at once. And the contract is entirely subject to the laws of China and any arbitration must be done via CIETAC \u2014 the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee.But Vanuatu\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio \u2014 around 30 percent, with half the debt owing to China and the other half owed largely to the Asian Development Bank \u2014 is not out of line for what is typical in the region, experts said.The broader question, discussed openly in the dimly lit kava bars that locals frequent, concerns China\u2019s motivations and whether small countries can withstand its influence.\u201cSome of us are worried about Chinese taking over the economy since they run most of the trade stores already and they are bringing in workers to do basic jobs that locals can do,\u201d said Joseph Waiku, a local construction worker. \u201cWe hope our government is looking out for our long-term interests.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Unbound\u2019 Shows Transgender Men Ripping Up Old Scripts", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesAs a teenager growing up in the 1970s, the sociologist Arlene Stein learned about homosexuality in a medical textbook she found at the public library. It delayed her process of coming out by at least a decade, she writes in her new book, \u201cUnbound: Transgender Men and the Remaking of Identity.\u201d She was horrified by those \u201cscary pictures of naked people looking plaintively at the camera, arrayed like mug shots.\u201dThis story hovers over her book, which delves into the lives of transgender men and other \u201cgender dissidents.\u201d It feels as if Stein has written this book imagining it might fall into the hands of those who need such a primer \u2014 much as she once did \u2014 and she wants to give them the fortification she yearned for. She depicts her subjects with warmth and respect, and strains to include as much as she can about the social, emotional, medical and psychological dimensions of transitioning. The result is frantically overstuffed but earnest, diligent and defiantly optimistic.For a year Stein followed her four subjects \u2014 Parker, Lucas, Nadia and Ben \u2014 all patients at a Florida clinic world-famous for gender affirmation surgery, specifically chest masculinization. They are all young, affluent enough to afford the expensive surgery (the clinic doesn\u2019t accept insurance) but a varied group in other ways. Parker is unabashed in his craving for male privilege. (\u201cYeah, I want to be a white American male property owner. Really, it\u2019s a dream.\u201d) Lucas has \u201chuge problems with the idea of passing\u201d as a man. Nadia wants top surgery but still identifies as a woman. Ben wants to be out as transgender and for people to know he was assigned female at birth. All report a sense of calm and joy after surgery, but some are uncomfortable with their sudden elevation in status when they present as men. People suddenly \u201cremember my name,\u201d Lucas reports.\u201cA younger generation of transgender men are prying open many of our assumptions about what it means to be men and women,\u201d Stein writes. Old scripts are being discarded, including those about transitioning itself. Some of her subjects explain their desire to transition as a result of having been born in the \u201cwrong body,\u201d either because it feels accurate or out of necessity \u2014 \u201cin order for patients to gain access to surgery and hormones,\u201d Stein writes, \u201cthey must still use the language of suffering, pathology and cure.\u201d Others express more expansive notions of gender, a desire to bend and break the binary.Nor is there one script for life after testosterone and top surgery. Stein cites one study of the workplace experiences of transgender men in which two-thirds reported that they were perceived as more competent and were given more recognition, including higher salaries. These benefits are largely limited to white transgender men, she points out. \u201cChoosing to become a black male isn\u2019t exactly a wise career move right now,\u201d one black transgender man, a minister, tells her, describing a post-transition surge in harassment. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t absolutely imperative, who the hell would make this choice?\u201dTo be sure, any individual gains occur in the context of the great precariousness of transgender lives. More than 40 percent of transgender Americans have attempted suicide, compared to five percent of the general population. Following the election of Donald Trump, Obama-era protections for transgender students were rescinded, and several states have attempted to pass religious exemption laws \u201ceffectively allowing discrimination against LGBT people in relation to adoption, as well as to accessing health care and social services,\u201d Stein writes.Stein\u2019s project was motivated by a desire to learn \u201chow, collectively, transmasculine people are challenging popular understandings of gender.\u201d As it happens, what she also ended up exploring \u2014 and what gives this book its real heat \u2014 is more personal; it\u2019s the challenge posed to her own cherished beliefs.Stein came of age in lesbian feminist spaces in 1980s San Francisco, a cozy gynocentric universe where the San Francisco Bay Area Women\u2019s Pages could helpfully direct you to a female attorney, carpenter or dog groomer. \u201cThere were moments of goofiness, to be sure, but there was also a dreamy sense of possibility,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was a world comprising women of all races, classes and sexual preferences, who were dedicated to the radical proposition that women were better than men: kinder, less violent, more empathetic.\u201dIn researching \u201cUnbound,\u201d she had to confront additional preconceptions. \u201cI had to admit that I, too, found myself unnerved at times by the sight of handsome women transforming themselves into dudes with stubby beards, thick necks and deep voices, people who were passing out of the zone of my own attractions,\u201d she writes. \u201cOf course, I realize that it\u2019s not about me \u2014 it\u2019s about them. Still, at times it\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of loss.\u201dThis is a chilling claim, but Stein repeatedly allows herself to be impolitic and wincingly frank, almost using herself as a foil for the limitations of second-wave feminism. \u201cMy generation believed that gender is imposed on us by advertising, scientific experts, parents, teachers and other influences,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe thought we could undo gender\u2019s hold on our lives.\u201dToday, New York City recognizes 31 genders. Facebook includes 56 gender options. Stein notes ruefully that she is playing catch up. A scholar of gender and sexuality for 30 years, these days she attends conferences on gender identity only, she says, to feel like a dinosaur.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Dangerous \u2018Bigness\u2019 of the AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust and telecommunications.When Congress enacted the Anti-Merger Act of 1950, the law by which American courts still adjudge corporate mergers, it did so with the repeatedly stated goal of fighting excessive economic concentration. The \u201cdominant\u201d concern, as the Supreme Court wrote in a 1962 merger case that analyzed the law, was about \u201ca rising tide of economic concentration in the American economy.\u201d At the time, the court explained, a wave of corporate consolidation posed the threat of an \u201caccelerated concentration of economic power\u201d and also a \u201cthreat to other values,\u201d like the independence of smaller businesses and local control of industry. In particular Congress had said it intended the new law to stop a wave of mergers in its \u201cincipiency.\u201dJudge Leon\u2019s decision shows just how far the law has wandered from congressional intent. The law has become a license for near-uncontrolled consolidation and concentration in almost every sector of economy. Whether involving airlines, hospitals, the pharmaceutical industry, cable television or the major tech platforms, mergers leading to oligopolies or monopolies have become commonplace.Reading Judge Leon\u2019s opinion makes it clear how this has happened. The decision barely touches on Congress\u2019s concerns about excessive concentration of economic power or other guiding principles or values. Instead, the opinion is mostly a tedious dissection of whether customers might end up paying an extra 45 cents per month for pay-TV service. How did a battle over 45 cents become how we decide the future of the media industries? Yes, higher prices for consumers are a bad thing, but they are not the only thing, and certainly not what Congress cared most about. In fact, the law itself doesn\u2019t even mention prices: It instructs courts to bar mergers when the effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\u201dThe case could have centered on what Congress really cared about: competition, concentration and the direction of the industry. On its face, despite being a \u201cvertical\u201d merger between two companies at different levels in the supply chain, the marriage of such large and powerful players in the media industry looks anything but harmless. One of AT&T\u2019s defenses of the merger was that it wanted to take on internet companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix. But was that really a creditable goal of this deal? Was there good evidence of an effort to prevent new business models from taking flight? And what about the risk of setting off a wave of consolidations, leaving a fully integrated industry immune to new competition?These kinds of considerations would have yielded the question Congress wanted answered: Was the likely effect of the merger to diminish the level of competition in the media industries? Yet in vain pursuit of numerical certainty about the monthly cost of pay-TV service, the ruling never really came to address this broader question.What Congress cared about in 1950 is even more important today. The public cares about the aggregation of wealth in the top echelons, the suppression of wages and the shrinking of the middle class, all of which are linked to industry concentration. That\u2019s why Congress, in the wake of repeated affirmations that the anti-merger laws no longer work, needs to act. It should reassert that Congress in 1950 really did intend to preserve a competitive economy \u2014 one that is free, if possible, from what the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201dTim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Each infinitesimal advantage counts, and unfathomable amounts of money and prestige are at stake. It\u2019s hardly surprising that the pressure to seek illegal advantage, through artificially increasing stamina, may at times feel overwhelming.And yet it sometimes seems that football and its fans have a \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy in place when it comes to doping. Like the consumers of delicious fast-food chicken nuggets, we may be less than comfortable knowing how our meal has been produced. There may come a time when authorities take a more pragmatic view, assume that doping has become an inescapable part of the game, and seek not to outlaw it but to regulate it. Until then, though, it looks as if we may have to maintain the veil of innocence around the beautiful game, even as it continues to unravel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Capital of Electronic Music, Women Rule the Scene", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Not long after 4 a.m. on a recent Sunday, Kerstin Egert (a.k.a. Tama Sumo), a resident D.J. of the revered techno club Berghain, was playing to a raucous, packed dance floor in the club\u2019s upstairs Panorama Bar. As is usual at that hour, the line outside was long and getting longer, in this case for a lineup that included the Dutch-born producer Steffi; the Munich-bred D.J. Virginia; and Avalon Emerson, an American techno producer who has emerged as one of the most sought-after D.J.s on the international touring circuit.All across the city, women were on the decks, from About:Blank, where the Italian D.J. Madalba was playing a closing set, to Tresor, one of the city\u2019s oldest techno clubs, where the resident D.J. Barbara Preisinger was headlining her own monthly event.Women have long been active as D.J.s in Berlin, arguably the world capital of underground electronic music, but they have surged in prominence and visibility in the past few years. A growing network of booking agencies and community groups run by women have helped bring female artists out of the shadows, dispelling the boy\u2019s club atmosphere of the past. All-male club lineups are largely gone, while influential music publications like Pitchfork, Mixmag and Fader are rich with praise for female artists based in Berlin. And with international tours, those artists, in turn, are helping to diversify festival lineups and club scenes throughout the world.\u201cNow a woman on a main stage is normal, but when I started it was, like, no one,\u201d said Nina Kraviz, the eclectic Russian techno producer who perhaps more than anyone embodies the increased status of women in Berlin\u2019s electronic music scene. She\u2019s been busy lately, with projects like a remix album for the American artist St. Vincent and new releases on two labels she founded.\u201cI\u2019ve seen the level of respect for women change,\u201d said Melissa Taylor, who in 2006 founded Tailored Communication, a public relations firm that represents many prominent women in electronic music. In Berlin, she added, \u201cthere are a lot more women running things independently.\u201dSeveral D.J.s have started labels in recent years \u2014 like Paula Temple, a British-born techno artist whose Noise Manifesto label focuses on projects by women and queer artists. But Berlin has also spawned a crop of artist agencies run by young women with female-heavy rosters, like Poly Artists, Futura and Odd Fantastic.\u201cNow a lot more agencies represent women, but this wasn\u2019t the case a few years ago,\u201d said Keira Sinclair, a co-founder of Poly Artists, which also works with several men who will play only on diverse lineups.\u201cI feel something different when I see a woman D.J.ing,\u201d Ms. Sinclair said. \u201cI get this extra sense of \u2018Wow, this looks like me, this could be me.\u2019 \u201dAs public appetite has grown, projects like Creamcake, a label and event series that holds D.J. workshops and diversity-focused panel discussions, and the party collective Room 4 Resistance have helped draw attention to women who struggled until recently to make an impact.\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the women weren\u2019t there; they were just being ignored by the media,\u201d Ms. Taylor said, citing 1990s-era trailblazers like the D.J. Ellen Allien, and Gudrun Gut, the West German electronic music artist who was part of the influential industrial band Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, before going on to found the label Monika Enterprise.But as the internet and social media have become more important, Ms. Taylor said, \u201ca lot of women have been able to control their image better and gain visibility without relying on these male media gatekeepers.\u201dMs. Egert, a.k.a. Tama Sumo, is a respected figure in Berlin\u2019s club scene who spent a decade as a Tresor resident and was one of the original D.J.s to play at Berghain. She said in an interview that she often hears in discussions of gender the argument that quality must be the first consideration.Ms. Egert said the gender balance had undoubtedly improved, but that there was more work to do: \u201cThere is still far too little visibility of queer and nonwhite people,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is a huge problem I think, especially considering the history of the music.\u201dThough house and techno were nurtured in Europe, both genres were born in the black and gay clubs of Detroit, Chicago and New York. \u201cI think you cannot speak about women in a vacuum, because race plays a huge role as well,\u201d said Lerato Khathi (a.k.a. Lakuti), a South African D.J. now based in Berlin.But in the world of underground electronic music, in which Berlin predominantly traffics, it\u2019s undeniable that women have come to the fore.\u201cPeople are getting recognition and chances that they didn\u2019t have before,\u201d Ms. Kraviz said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, but I also think there is a risk that instead of integrating them with the current artistic flow, we will always create this topic of \u2018female artists.\u2019\u201cI just want them to be artists.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Efforts to reach the other fraternity brothers were not immediately successful.Mr. Avenatti said the four other men were named because they were known to have viewed the video, while the fraternity \u201cfostered this environment.\u201dIn a statement, Delta Sigma Phi said that it had suspended its chapter at the University of Central Florida.\u201cWhile we cannot comment on specific allegations made in the lawsuit, these claims are disturbing and antithetical to our organization\u2019s values and mission,\u201d the fraternity said.The university said in a statement that the allegations were \u201ccontrary to our core values.\u201d\u201cAlthough U.C.F. is not a party to the suit, we are gathering information,\u201d it said.Mr. Simpson and Ms. Novak were in a long-distance relationship from October 2017 to February 2018, seeing each other a few times per month, according to the lawsuit. While the sexual encounters were consensual, and Ms. Novak had sent her boyfriend intimate photos and videos, she had not given him permission to share her images, the lawsuit said. At least one sexual video was recorded without her knowledge, Mr. Avenatti said.She was nude with her face identifiable in one video, which Mr. Simpson sent to five fraternity brothers and later showed to others during a house meeting, according to the lawsuit. The video was seen by more than 200 people, none of whom suggested Mr. Simpson delete it, according to the lawsuit.The images were shared to the Facebook group, which Mr. Avenatti said contained images and videos of sexual activities with \u201cmany\u201d other women.Social media has become an additional problem for fraternities, already under fire for deadly hazing and underage drinking practices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Human Trafficking Report, State Dept. Warns Against Separating Children From Parents", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The State Department warned in a report on Thursday that separating children from their parents can cause lasting psychological damage that leaves them vulnerable to trafficking, a cautionary tale that comes amid an uproar over a Trump administration immigration policy that has temporarily broken up migrant families as they enter the United States.\u201cChildren in institutional care, including government-run facilities, can be easy targets for traffickers,\u201d the department\u2019s annual Trafficking in Persons report concluded.It added: \u201cEven at their best, residential institutions are unable to meet a child\u2019s need for emotional support that is typically received from family members or consistent caretakers with whom the child can develop an attachment.\u201d\u201cCan you believe this? In this day and age, we\u2019re talking about child smuggling,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week in a speech to the National Federation of Independent Businesses. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about women smuggling in this day and age. The worst it\u2019s been in history because the internet has led to this.\u201dThe conclusions in the State Department\u2019s trafficking report, one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive, did not specifically address the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on the southwestern border. It also gave no indication that trafficking is peaking, or that an enormous child smuggling ring is responsible for thousands of children attempting to enter the United States from Mexico.In a briefing for reporters, a top department official referred questions about children\u2019s treatment on the southwestern border to the health officials who have responsibility for their care. The official also sought to draw a distinction between child smuggling and trafficking. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity under the terms of the briefing.John Sifton, an advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, called the report \u201can indictment of the Trump administration\u2019s own policies, with respect to asylum seekers and others seeking entry into the United States.\u201dAt a ceremony on Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s eldest daughter and senior adviser, handed out awards to advocates who fight human trafficking. Mr. Pompeo did not mention the controversy over the administration\u2019s border policies, focusing instead on how countries have improved, worsened or stayed the same in their efforts to fight trafficking over the past year.Among the countries he praised were Estonia, Argentina, Bahrain and Cyprus. Those he criticized included Libya, Myanmar, North Korea and Iran.\u201cThe world should know that we will not stop until human trafficking is a thing of the past,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.At a similar event last year, former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson criticized North Korea for forcing 50,000 to 80,000 of its citizens to work overseas \u2014 and then using their wages to fund weapons programs.This year, Mr. Pompeo mentioned North Korea only briefly. The administration has in recent weeks played down Pyongyang\u2019s poor human rights record as it seeks an agreement for North Korea to surrender its nuclear and missile programs.Generally, human rights have not been viewed as a high priority for the Trump administration. Mr. Tillerson had cautioned while in office over distractions to national security or economic interests.But human trafficking issues have been a notable exception, which is why the report\u2019s release is part of an elaborate ceremony. Ms. Trump did not offer remarks; her shoe brand came under criticism for its use of Chinese labor and the disappearance last year of three labor activists investigating conditions at the plants manufacturing her products. China ranks among the worst offenders on human rights and trafficking.The next day, Mr. Pompeo issued a statement on World Refugee Day \u201ccommemorating the strength, courage and resilience of millions of refugees worldwide who have been forced to flee their homes due to persecution and conflict.\u201d Many of the families caught on the southwestern border are escaping violence and persecution, only to be imprisoned and charged as criminals for illegally entering the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can \u2018Illuminati Tinder\u2019 Save Us All?", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe founder of Raya, an exclusive dating app, has some lofty utopian goals.LOS ANGELES \u2014 If you\u2019ve felt a lingering disturbance in the internet\u2019s social order \u2014 a vague and unsettling sense that there is a raging party happening just out of view, that all the people cooler, richer and better looking than you are blowing off steam together in some V.I.P. hideaway while you waste your life on Twitter and Instagram \u2014 I have some bad news. Raya first appeared several years ago as a dating app aimed at people in creative industries. It has expanded into an invitation-only social network populated by movie stars, fashion designers, pro athletes, tech executives and too many Instagram models to count. \u201cIt\u2019s the Soho House of dating apps,\u201d said Hayley Greenberg, 27, a social media manager in Los Angeles who joined Raya in 2016 and used it for several months. \u201cThey have the really good-looking guys, the athletes, the actors, the guys that have like 500 followers on Instagram but got accepted because they\u2019re a D.J.\u201d On Raya, Ms. Greenberg said, \u201ceveryone\u2019s someone.\u201dThe app costs $7.99 a month, but joining is no small ordeal. Prospective members are evaluated by an algorithm and human gatekeepers, who consider factors like the size of an applicant\u2019s Instagram following, how many Raya members he or she knows and other, less quantifiable attributes. About 8 percent of applicants are accepted, making Raya a slightly harder nut to crack than Harvard Business School.Its website contains no mention of investors, founders or staff members, and the company has never spoken about its origins. For years, members have speculated about who was behind it. A Hollywood superagent? A lonely tech billionaire?The man said that telling Raya\u2019s story would be cathartic, and that it was time to set the record straight on what the app was really about \u2014 what kinds of people it was meant to bring together.Daniel Gendelman, 34, is handsome and thinly bearded. He wore a white T-shirt and ordered plain oatmeal when I met him recently in a Venice Beach restaurant. Mr. Gendelman had hung around the creative upper crust and he knew that online dating didn\u2019t work for everyone. Celebrities avoided it out of embarrassment. Artists and musicians didn\u2019t necessarily want to be on a platform that lumped them in with bankers and lawyers. Instead, Mr. Gendelman thought, what if there were an app that felt more like a dinner party \u2014 an intimate, thoroughly vetted collection of interesting people having candid conversations? He put together a small team and began to build. He called the app Raya, after the Hebrew word for friend, and seeded it with a group of his friends in Los Angeles.\u201cI tried to solve a big problem for a small amount of people,\u201d Mr. Gendelman said.Raya went live in February 2015 and took off quickly, boosted by an early user base that reportedly included the actresses Raven-Symon\u00e9 and Kelly Osbourne. (Mr. Gendelman would not confirm or deny any users\u2019 names, such as John Mayer, Ruby Rose, Zach Braff, Jeremy Piven and Cara Delevingne, who have all reportedly been spotted there.) Their suspicion may have stemmed from his eight-pack abs and frankly ridiculous jaw line. He did not have that problem on Raya, where everyone has eight-pack abs and ridiculous jaw lines.\u201cIt\u2019s way better,\u201d said Mr. Telle, who is now dating someone and has stopped actively using Raya. \u201cI matched with a lot of models, and even one celebrity.\u201dC\u00e9line Bossart, 26, a freelance wine and spirits journalist, said that during the time she used Raya actively \u2014 she now has a boyfriend \u2014 the app lived up to its reputation for civility.Keeping up Raya\u2019s values and mystique is partly why Mr. Gendelman, a self-described introvert, has chosen to stay quiet. For years, he avoided publicly identifying himself, even hiding his job from some friends and family. He has kept the company small \u2014 Raya has just 13 full-time employees \u2014 and has raised only a few small investment rounds.And it has expanded into professional networking, adding a \u201cwork\u201d section that allows users to match with each other for platonic collaborations. (Come for the models, stay for the deals.)Mr. Gendelman would not share financial information but said that he expects Raya to become profitable this year. Most of Raya\u2019s revenue comes from its monthly subscription fees, but there are lots of ways it could make money, by throwing sponsored member events, or introducing paid extras for power users. There is already a feature called \u201cdirect request,\u201d which is similar to Tinder\u2019s \u201csuper like\u201d and prioritizes your profile on another member\u2019s feed for $2.99. Ultimately, though, Mr. Gendelman is in the rare position of running a social network that doesn\u2019t need to be huge to succeed. In fact, Raya probably shouldn\u2019t scale too quickly, given the risk of losing its cachet and allure. Mr. Gendelman is frustrated by the notion that it\u2019s just a hookup app for jet-setters. \u201cI want to have people not feel what you felt \u2014 \u2018it\u2019s for people that look a certain way or do a certain thing,\u2019\u201d he said. Raya, he said, is \u201cfor passionate people anywhere in the world who have something they want to share with other members, and can do it in a respectful way.\u201dThe heart of Raya is its screening process, which is overseen by a secret committee of about 500 trusted members who vote on every application. People who meet the committee\u2019s standards are notified that they\u2019re in, while rejects are placed on the wait list. Mr. Gendelman said that Raya has more than 10,000 members spread across dozens of countries.Having a big Instagram following is not a prerequisite for being admitted. Neither must you be ridiculously attractive, or have lots of money. Mr. Gendelman said instead that conspicuous displays of wealth are a red flag.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of applications where it\u2019s just a Lamborghini, a yacht and a private plane, and we\u2019re just like, \u2018See you later,\u2019\u201d he said. I asked Mr. Gendelman to show me some Raya applications. After swearing me to anonymity, he pulled out his iPhone and navigated to a special section of Raya\u2019s app filled with aspiring members.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Mr. Gendelman said. He voted yes on the photographer but left a note on his application, asking for other committee members\u2019 opinions.Next up was a musician, a young guy with ratty blond hair. He didn\u2019t have a ton of Instagram followers, but he did have 68 phone contacts on Raya. A Google search turned up some recent high-profile media hits for his band. The musician also got a yes.Why? \u201cI think this person looks rad,\u201d Mr. Gendelman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to say it.\u201d Mr. Gendelman wanted to show me that I was wrong about his app, that it\u2019s not just a play place for beautiful snobs. To that end, Raya recently started opening its doors with the introduction of \u201cfriend passes,\u201d a feature that allows members to get one friend fast-tracked for admission. Friend passes will make Raya more democratic, Mr. Gendelman said, a point that is directionally if not factually correct. (There is a word for a private club that admits people based on referrals from friends; it\u2019s not \u201cdemocracy.\u201d)Mr. Gendelman shook his head. \u201cIs Tony decently interesting? Is he passionate?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding \u2014 we\u2019re interested in curating digital dinner parties, so to speak, and that comes in all forms.\u201dWithin the first day of use, I spotted an A-list musician, several TV news anchors, a household-name comedian, two N.F.L. players and a high-ranking tech executive. I saw lots of nonfamous people too \u2014 college students, designers, seemingly the entire editorial staff of Cond\u00e9 Nast. Everyone was either very attractive or the kind of person to whom very attractive people would be drawn.There is something thrilling, and a little embarrassing, about this rarefied air. To go on Raya is to enter a strange and alluring world filled with thirsty elites, a place where fame is measured in Instagram followers and humble-bragging is a high art (\u201cI direct things,\u201d reads the profile of one successful filmmaker; a well-known television actress describes herself only as a \u201ccarb enthusiast\u201d), and where the average B.M.I. seems to hover in the high teens.I spent several weeks glued to Raya, looking for as many familiar faces as possible. And while the experience created a distinct urge to go to the gym and start moisturizing, it didn\u2019t exactly make me long for my single days. But, oddly, it did make me nostalgic for an earlier, more Balkanized era of communication.Then social media companies came along, broke up the clubs and forced all the gamers and sports fans and Instant Pot moms and neo-Nazis onto the same three apps, then acted surprised when nobody got along.It\u2019s not shocking, in other words, that Raya exists as an elite response to the homogenization of digital culture. The popular and beautiful have always had private parties, invite-only conferences and V.I.P. rooms. Why would the internet be any different?What\u2019s stranger is how little of the internet works like Raya, a digital space that is designed for its users\u2019 specific wants and needs. It\u2019s genuinely odd that in an age of plenty, when we have 300 varieties of mustard and lifestyle brands for every conceivable micro-demographic, we\u2019re still satisfied feeding all of our digital communication into a handful of giant, boring platforms. Whether or not Raya fulfills its utopian ambitions, it is at least dangling the possibility that not all digital products have to connect the entire world \u2014 that the internet may still allow for some secrets.Advertisement"}

After about five minutes of breathing the same air as the plant, we needed a break. Our stomach started to turn.A blooming corpse flower in North America is a rare sight. It can take a decade or more for the temperamental flower, accustomed to the hot and steamy jungles of Sumatra, to bloom.Ten immature corpse flowers arrived at the Nolen Greenhouses a decade ago from a specialty nursery in Florida, and now the seven surviving mature plants are beginning to bloom for the first time.And when they do, the clock starts ticking.\u201cIt\u2019s like a relay race,\u201d said Marc Hachadourian, the director of the Nolen Greenhouses.With so few active plants, there is a limited amount of pollen, so botanical gardens across the nation share theirs with one another when a flower opens. Pollen packets from the plant currently in bloom in the Bronx were sent to gardens in San Diego, Chicago and Buffalo via FedEx, Mr. Hachadourian said.\u201cWhen one blooms, we all congratulate each other, like it\u2019s a birth announcement,\u201d he added. \u201cWhere\u2019s a picture of yours?

The list price at many private colleges, including tuition, fees, room and board, has reached the bewildering sum of $70,000 a year. But the real price, taking into account financial aid, is often vastly lower.How much lower? We\u2019re here to help answer that question.Our central finding is that top colleges are more affordable than many people realize \u2013 not only for poor students but also for those from the middle-class.Typical lower-income students \u2013 from a family earning $50,000 or less, for example \u2013 face an annual bill of $6,000. Students can often cover that cost through part-time work and a small annual loan, without their parents having to pay additional money.Middle-class families pay a higher price, but nothing like the list price. Only affluent families pay something close to the list price. It\u2019s true that many of these families don\u2019t think of themselves as affluent. But they are \u2013 part of roughly the country\u2019s richest 10 percent, with an annual income of at least $175,000 and a net worth of a half-million dollars or more. For them, a college bill approaching $70,000 can be decidedly unpleasant, yet it doesn\u2019t reorder their lives.The bottom line is that the cost of college is a serious issue in this country, but not quite in the way that many people think. Colleges with intimidating list prices aren\u2019t the biggest problem, because they often offer substantial financial aid and have very high graduation rates. Low-income students at these colleges certainly don\u2019t have it easy. Many initially struggle to fit in on elite campuses. Yet the bulk of them go on to graduate, emerge with manageable amounts of debt and get good jobs.To conduct this exercise, we created six representative families, each with an income and net worth based on the national distribution for families with college-age children.Very AffluentLower-MiddleUpper-MiddlePoorMiddleAffluent$20,300$0$0$010th$40,000$0$500$7,00025th$75,000$35,000$5,000$25,00050th$122,700$115,000$15,000$90,00075th$186,000$300,000$75,000$375,00090th$246,000$500,000$150,000$1.1 million95thIncome: HOME Equity:Cash:Investments:PERCENTILE:HOMEEquityIncomeCashInvestmentsPoor$20,300$40,000$75,000$122,700$186,000$246,000$0$0$35,000$115,000$300,000$500,000$0$500$5,000$15,000$75,000$150,000$0$7,000$25,000$90,000$375,000$1.1 million10th percentileLower-Middle25thMiddle50thUpper-Middle75thAffluent90thVery Affluent95thThe middle-class family, for example, earns $75,000 \u2013 about the median (or 50th percentile) income for families in this age range \u2013 and has a modified net worth of $65,000 \u2013 also about the median figure nationwide. The most affluent family has an income at the 95th percentile and a modified net worth at the 95th percentile. (\u201cModified net worth\u201d excludes retirement accounts, as most colleges do when calculating financial aid.)One striking pattern is the similarity of college costs for a given family across different selective colleges. Prices do vary from one college to another, but often not radically so.Look, for example, at the Kelly-green dots congregated around $16,000. They depict the total cost of college for a family with median income and wealth. A student from one of these families would take out a loan of about $2,500 and earn another $5,000 through a summer job and part-time work during the school year. The parents would then owe the remaining $7,500 or so.As similar as the costs are from top colleges to the next, they are not identical. Mount Holyoke and the University of Rochester are among those that charge a higher average price to lower- and middle-income students, via both larger student loans and higher parent payments.For anyone thinking about applying to a selective college, it\u2019s important to remember that the numbers here are estimates. We are showing the \u201cbest estimate\u201d for each college. The MyIntuition calculator also provides a \u201chigh estimate\u201d and a \u201clow estimate\u201d for any student at any college. Often, the range of these estimates overlaps across colleges:Total annual college costs, by family profilePoor familiesRich families$60K40KRange20K0MountHolyokeUniversity ofRochesterBatesJohns HopkinsUniversityTotal annual college costs,by family profilePoor familiesRich families$60KRange40K20K0MountHolyokeUniversity ofRochesterBatesJohnsHopkinsUniversityThe beauty of the calculator is its simplicity. In about 60 seconds, you can receive an estimate from it. But this simplicity means it can\u2019t take into all of the nuances of a family\u2019s financial situation \u2013 which colleges will consider when determining financial aid. Many colleges also give scholarships based on academic record.We agree with that, and we\u2019ll add another piece of advice: Don\u2019t assume that any college is too expensive for you to attend. For a large majority of Americans, college \u2013 public or private, elite or more typical \u2013 doesn\u2019t cost anywhere near $70,000 a year.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Research by Jeremy Bowers. Graphics by Stuart A. Thompson and Jessia Ma.MethodologyThe data on college costs are all based on families with only one child in college. Families with more than one child in college at the same time would pay substantially less for each one (as you can see by experimenting with the MyIntuition calculator).Consistent with colleges\u2019 policies, we assumed that all students would be expected to earn up to $2,000 through a summer job. When telling students about their annual costs, colleges typically fold this $2,000 into a category known as Expected Family Contribution, which consists mostly of parent payment. We instead combined the $2,000 with the money students are expected to earn during the school year through a work-study job. This combined category is called Student Job.All averages apply to only the 31 private colleges and exclude the University of Virginia. In the first chart in this article, the range of costs is based on the average \u201clow estimate\u201d and the average \u201chigh estimate\u201d across all colleges.Advertisement"}

Now, there\u2019s another reason they aren\u2019t reading their textbooks and aren\u2019t paying attention in class: the siren song of the smartphone. Traditional-age college students are now iGen, the post-1995 generation who were the first to spend their entire adolescence with smartphones.They are spending an extraordinary amount of time on electronic devices \u2014 according to Common Sense Media, nine hours a day. Perhaps as a result, many students have a difficult time focusing, are distracted by devices during class and are sleep-deprived. As with many things, however, the solution is education.To help them focus while studying, we can tell students about the truth of \u201cmultitasking\u201d \u2014 it doesn\u2019t exist, because the human brain can only consciously focus on one thing at a time. Advise students to try setting aside their devices and reading their course materials for 10 minutes straight before doing anything else. The next day, it can be 15 minutes, and then 30, and then an hour.To improve classroom engagement, tell students about the research showing that students who take notes longhand, on paper, do better on exams than those who take notes on laptops. Consider having them put their laptops away during class time \u2014 laptops, with their temptations of social media sites and web surfing, are a distraction much more often than they are useful.Tell students to shut down their phones an hour before bedtime. In addition to being psychologically stimulating, phones are also physiologically stimulating. The blue light they emit inhibits the sleep hormone melatonin, making sleep significantly more elusive. Not sleeping enough is linked to not just the inability to focus but to unhappiness, depression, and poor physical health. None of this means giving up our technology \u2014 it just means using it for what it\u2019s good for, and then putting it away.A senior editor at Bloomberg News and the author of \u201cTrue Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America\u2019s Fraternities\u201dHistorically white Greek-letter organizations typically have few minority members, and some chapters have none at all. It\u2019s a legacy of their civil rights-era resistance to integration. This is no small matter. At many universities, these organizations offer grand houses \u2014 in some cases, on public land \u2014 that dominate the social scene. The rich returns on this social capital include student-college presidencies, internships and success in business and politics.African-American and other minority Greek organizations \u2014 separate and unequal \u2014 generally don\u2019t have houses of their own.A 2014 study of F.B.I. hate-crime statistics from 349 colleges found that campuses with large populations of historically white fraternities are more likely to report verbal and physical assaults involving bias against blacks and other minorities. Another study found that Greek life inhibits friendship across racial lines and promotes opposition to policies promoting diversity.Still, colleges often embrace fraternities and sororities for their philanthropy and leadership. There needs to be more oversight. Deans should require each chapter to demonstrate its openness by disclosing its demographics, including race and socioeconomic background. The resulting public pressure on segregated fraternities and sororities could help achieve the vision of inclusion enshrined in law and the Constitution.President, Pennsylvania State UniversitySociety\u2019s benefits from the innovations of higher education are priceless. The research, both fundamental and applied, holds great promise for everything \u2014 promoting economic vitality, protecting life and property and improving the quality of life.Yet universities today are operating in a relentlessly difficult fiscal environment. Public universities have experienced a decade of weak state support, and more tuition increases are in direct conflict with our mission of access and affordability. Major research universities are facing a huge issue with aging research infrastructure because many of our buildings were built as part of our nation\u2019s competitive posture more than 50 years ago.Continual belt-tightening is creating a number of negative outcomes. Harry Houdini was never bound this tightly.The challenge for colleges and universities, private and public, is to find funding for innovation in such a constrained fiscal environment.First, innovation has to be a core priority, as important as paying for salaries, health insurance, deferred maintenance and unfunded mandates.Second, we need to ensure that innovation deliberately drives job creation, economic development and student career success by bringing research discoveries to the marketplace. We must develop a culture that nurtures and rewards entrepreneurship \u2014 not just in STEM, but in the arts, health and human development, education and more.Third, we need to foster the power of partnership \u2014 with local government leaders, legislative representatives, communities, business leaders, faculty and students.Innovation is inspiring. It\u2019s also a wise investment with an even better return. Economists at Deloitte found that technology has been a \u201cgreat job-creating machine,\u201d increasing spending, creating a new demand and boosting jobs in knowledge-intensive sectors.Research and education have always opened doors that benefit the nation we serve. This is a challenge we are well equipped to conquer.Founder, Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies; mayor of New York City, 2002-13One of the biggest challenges in education today is an ideological disagreement over whether we should focus on getting every student accepted to a four-year college, or whether we should place far more emphasis on career preparation.The truth is, we need to do both \u2014 and the problem is, we\u2019re not doing either one very well.Right now, too many students are not prepared to enter either college or the work force \u2014 and too often, those who are ready for college don\u2019t go to competitive schools that match their abilities. Less than half of 1 percent of students from the poorest 20 percent of families attend a selective college, even though many have the grades to do so. At the same time, about four in 10 teenagers do not enter college immediately after high school, and many are left with few career choices and nowhere to turn for help.We need to do better for our kids, and our foundation is working to deliver for them.Bloomberg Philanthropies is supporting local leaders around the country who are adopting changes that have proven to raise student achievement and put more students on track for college. We have also launched the American Talent Initiative, a coalition of 100 of the most selective colleges and universities that are committed to increasing the number of lower-income, high-achieving students that they accept and graduate.Our goal is to have an additional 50,000 students at these schools by 2025. And through a second initiative we created called CollegePoint, which guides students through the application and financial aid processes, we\u2019re helping ensure they apply to and enroll in the kinds of schools they have earned the right to attend.Career and technical education is an even more difficult challenge. Many vocational programs across the country are trapped in the 1960s and \u201970s. We need states and districts to invest in new, higher-quality programs that train students for a wide variety of industries \u2014 from construction and advanced manufacturing to health care and information technology. Creating pathways to careers also requires forming partnerships with local employers, who can provide training and skill development in growing fields.Hopefully, more political leaders will step up to support these kinds of changes that will prepare students for college and careers, and we will support those that do.Director of college counseling, NYC Lab SchoolFueled from the top and fed by social media, anti-intellectualism challenges the core of higher education.And somehow, the fuel and fire have become indistinguishable. Social media honors the quick opinion, the lightning-fast response, the emotionally charged declaration. Every millisecond, anyone can weigh in on any conceivable matter. The writer, often anonymous, is inconsequential. Expertise is meaningless. Thoughtfulness, considered and informed opinion, hard-earned by those who have studied, debated, read and written, is suspect. Where is this feared hotbed of intellectualism? At today\u2019s colleges and universities.Of course, anti-intellectualism has been brewing before tweets; well before the days when my 12-year-old nephew and the president joined forces to weigh in on crucial world issues. Nor are we in a unique time and place where intellectuals have become the enemy of the people. So what can we do to honor the intellect \u2026 to tamp down the notion that intellectual rigor is detrimental to society?While we accept excellence and, dare I say, elitism in our athletes, and artists, so must we learn to honor, and not be afraid of intellectual excellence. These are lessons we learn young: paying homage to an extraordinary soccer player or a talented singer, while the exceptional thinkers and learners toil in obscurity, often ridiculed as socially inept.Professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple UniversityAs colleges and universities try to raise graduation rates, college presidents, policymakers and philanthropists often focus on what students know when they enter college, how they perform on tests and what courses and majors they choose. Rarely do they consider whether their students have enough to eat or a safe place to sleep.Higher education neglects Abraham Maslow\u2019s lessons at its peril. Without their basic needs secured, large numbers of today\u2019s undergraduates are struggling to learn. Sleepless nights and empty stomachs distract them from going to class and passing their courses, prolonging or even preventing degree completion.Sizable numbers of students are also coping with homelessness. Two recent national studies suggest that 12 to 14 percent of community college students experienced homelessness in the last year.Delivering emergency aid to students in small amounts just when they need it can help keep them in school and connected to their institutions. These efforts yield strong returns on investments for both colleges and their partners \u2014 a housing dollar spent helping a displaced worker complete a technical certificate and obtain a job improves his or her earning potential and reduces the likelihood of needing public benefits in the future.College has always been a challenge for people without substantial resources, but now even students from middle-class families are struggling. Work opportunities are scarce, the value of the minimum wage is down, and college prices are higher than ever and continuing to rise.Colleges that want students to not only enroll but also graduate need to acknowledge this hidden crisis and take the lead in addressing it.Professor of history, race and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Suzanne Young Murray professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.Affordability is the most significant challenge facing higher education. Year after year, tuition increases outpace the cost of inflation and growth in most sectors of the economy. Higher tuition means fewer people can afford to go to college. This isn\u2019t just a problem at the most elite, private universities: At every type of school, from community colleges to state universities, rising costs not only raise barriers to entry but decrease completion rates.Getting into college is one thing, but experiencing college at the precipice of financial insolvency is another. For too many middle- and low-income students, coming up short a few hundred dollars can send them over the cliff.In an economy of unprecedented wealth inequality, the affordability crisis further exacerbates social and racial stratification. Affluent white families leverage their resources, networks and legacy status on behalf of their children. Privilege begets privilege.Poorer families have few of these advantages, especially among historically marginalized populations. These students are at the mercy of debt schemes, too few scholarships, and poor-performing for-profit schools. More and more, where you go to school is becoming as predictive of your future as your ZIP code is.With globalization and automation, college is not just about a decent job. Despite widespread anti-intellectualism and state legislative divestment policies, higher education should be the foundation of a universal experience of civic participation that promotes cultural literacy, a fairer distribution of wealth and the common good. The very health of our democracy is at stake.What to do?Higher education leaders can fix affordability by building advocacy networks among alumni and mobilizing them to pressure state legislatures to reinvest in public higher education for all. This is an untapped reservoir of political muscle.Chief executive, Robin Hood FoundationI can\u2019t overstate how important my college education was to changing my trajectory. Raised by a single mom in Baltimore and the Bronx in the \u201980s and \u201990s, I joined the Army at 17, and enrolled in junior college on a journey that would take me to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Today, families across the country know what my family knew: College can change lives.The data bears this out. A study highlighted in The New York Times shows that college graduates earn 71 percent more than Americans who only graduate high school.But while this path to prosperity may still exist in America, it is far more precarious than many realize. We\u2019re promising too many young Americans a pathway to success, and instead setting them up for failure.Today, most students don\u2019t finish college in a traditional fashion. This is the untold college crisis in America \u2014 the college completion crisis. In today\u2019s America, the majority of college students do not graduate on time, racking up debt, and undermining the investment and potential that college is designed to offer. At the majority of public universities, just 19 percent of students earn a four-year degree in four years.This crisis constitutes a collective and systemic failure of our academic institutions. High schools, while graduating historic numbers of students, are not equipping them with the skills they\u2019ll need in college. Every year, 1.7 million students need remedial courses as they enter college. Just one in 10 of these students will ever graduate. Tuition costs raise at a rate far higher than inflation and wages, and throw families seeking opportunity into debt. Too many colleges are unprepared for the nontraditional students filling their classrooms.Addressing this collective breakdown will require a collective buildup with how we approach postsecondary education. We must do a better job preparing students for college in high school. We must also provide wraparound supports for students in their first years of college so they don\u2019t fall through gaps that are deceptively wide. We must make it easy to receive financial aid, as every year, nearly $3 billion in federal financial aid is left unclaimed because people don\u2019t fill out the paperwork correctly. And we must offer effective trade schools and training programs for those students for whom traditional college is not the right fit.We\u2019re promising too many young Americans a pathway to success, and instead setting them up for failure. We can and we must fix this. President, University of North Carolina; United States secretary of education, 2005 to 2009.When it comes to accountability in education, we\u2019re losing ground. After nearly three decades of bipartisan work, the effort to close achievement gaps and push for steady improvement in school performance has stalled.This drift away from accountability is hurting our most vulnerable students \u2014 those most in need of a strong education. And it\u2019s already eroding trust in our schools and universities.There\u2019s no question that measuring educational progress is complicated. But the only thing worse than imperfect accountability is none at all.Past administrations helped build a broad coalition of business leaders, civil rights advocates and policymakers from across the ideological spectrum to support high standards for all students. There was a shared recognition that honest assessment is needed for real progress. No more hiding underserved populations within statistical averages; no more acceptance of inequity as inevitable.My experience as a university president these past few years underscores the need to align policies and expectations. In a state, like all others, where minority college completion lags, where rural students are underrepresented and where low-income students graduate at far lower rates than their wealthier peers, our universities had excellent intentions but poor incentives.Only through straightforward accountability measures can we focus on our greatest challenges. In North Carolina, that\u2019s meant brokering performance agreements with each of the U.N.C. System\u2019s chancellors to outline goals that are measured publicly and tied back to our state\u2019s Strategic Plan.Chairman, Faith and Freedom CoalitionHigher education faces many daunting challenges: relevance to millennials seeking opportunity in a global, high-tech economy; rising costs and exploding student debt; big-money athletics crowding out the core educational mission. But the greatest challenge may be the need to inculcate character.The financial crisis of 2008-9 painfully reminded us that great wealth without integrity always goes up in smoke. The easy credit that fueled massive profits on Wall Street led to a loss of $8 trillion held by U.S. households. The same could be said for the privacy and advertising scandals that have lopped billions off the market cap of Facebook and other social media companies. When greed comes before character and the common good, we are all the losers.If colleges and universities teach the young people that are their charge how to think well but not how to act ethically, how to grow a business but not how to do so with moral standards, if they shape the intellect but fail to inculcate integrity, they fail in their ultimate mission.How best to do this? Universities should integrate instruction on ethics and morality into business and other curriculums. In most cases \u2014 though not all \u2014 these ethics derive from a faith tradition. The joint M.B.A. degree program between the Yale Divinity School and the Yale School of Management provides a good model. Man does not live by bread alone.That is as true today as it was when Jesus of Nazareth taught it 2,000 years ago.Theodore Roosevelt, who graduated from Harvard, once observed, \u201cA thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education.\u201d The pioneers of American higher education understood this fact. Roughly two-thirds of American colleges founded in the 18th and 19th centuries were affiliated with a religious denomination and undergraduate curriculums for much of our nation\u2019s history included instruction in the Bible as well as the ancient languages of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew in which it was originally written.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Critic Sells Books Down by the Seashore", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "Critic\u2019s NotebookA bookstore in the village of Wigtown, Scotland, allows people to run the shop while renting an apartment upstairs. A book critic for The Times recently took his turn at the till.Supported byWIGTOWN, Scotland \u2014 Isak Dinesen had a farm in Africa. Recently, if only for a day, I had a bookstore in Scotland.It wasn\u2019t easy to get to Wigtown, in the remote Dumfries and Galloway region of Scotland, in time for my shift. Though the village is only a two-hour drive from Glasgow, a GPS sent me through 33 miles of the desolately beautiful Galloway Forest Park on a single-track road that rattled the nerves.The nerve rattling was compounded because I was driving on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of the road and with a stick shift installed on my left rather than my right. This felt like trying to use a mortar and pestle with my good arm tied behind my back. While in oncoming traffic.Best of all, Wigtown offers a literary experience unlike any other I\u2019m aware of. In town there is a good used bookstore called the Open Book, with an apartment up above, that\u2019s rentable by the week. Once you move in, the shop is yours to run as you see fit.I was handed the keys and a cash box. I was told I could reshelve and redecorate. I could invite Elena Ferrante and Thomas Pynchon to speak, and Sly Stone to play, if I could find them.The Open Book is run by a nonprofit group. It has touched a chord with so many people, from every continent, that it\u2019s booked through 2021, which is as far as Airbnb will take reservations. There\u2019s a waiting list after that. I managed to wedge myself in for a single night by begging and whining like a dog that\u2019s lost a piece of andouille sausage under the refrigerator.I opened the Open Book at 10 a.m. on a cool and overcast Monday in the spring, while nursing a generous hangover. For this I must blame Shaun Bythell, the shaggy-haired owner of Scotland\u2019s largest secondhand bookshop \u2014 helpfully, it is called the Bookshop \u2014 just down the street. He\u2019d kept me up late the previous night. The Facebook page for Bythell\u2019s shop prominently features an Amazon Kindle, mounted as if a deer head, that he blasted with a shotgun.My first task as proprietor of the Open Book was one I hadn\u2019t anticipated. What to write on the slate sandwich board that sits out front?A favorite exhortation came to mind. With chalk I scrawled: \u201cRead at whim! Read at whim! \u2014 Randall Jarrell.\u201d For the opposite side, after a bit of puzzling, and given my physical and mental state, I shakily wrote: \u201cOf course it\u2019s all right for librarians to smell of drink. \u2014 Barbara Pym.\u201d I set my board outside.It was time to get a look around. The Open Book is not entirely my kind of used bookstore in that its literature section is modest, dwarfed by the sections for miscellaneous subjects like birds and Scotland and garden design. But there was a nice shelf of Penguins under the register.My first customers were a middle-aged couple who seemed to be casing the joint for a robbery. I felt sure they would mark me out instantly as an American interloper and groan, but they merely grunted hello and set to browsing.After 10 minutes, the man brought two well-thumbed paperbacks to the register: Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s science fiction novels \u201cThe Garden of Rama\u201d and \u201cRama II.\u201dMy first sales! Together they were 8 pounds. I vaguely felt I should save the 10-pound note he handed me for framing. I made change from the cash box, noted the titles and prices in a spiral notebook left for that purpose, and my day had commenced.I\u2019ve worked in many bookstores in my life, and I hadn\u2019t realized how much I missed them. It\u2019s surprising what you learn, as if by osmosis, a daily mental steeping, about every possible subject.Often you learn more than you want to know, when people bring to the register books about hemorrhoid care, loneliness or coping with the death of a child. To this day, when a young person asks me for advice about finding employment in the word business, I say (after telling them to read like lunatics): Work in a bookstore if you can find one, or a library, all through high school and college.My second customer was a wiry and distraught-seeming woman who didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge me as she entered. She seized upon an illustrated book titled \u201cShrubs and Climbers\u201d and bought it for 2 pounds.After this, there was a drought. No customers for a half-hour or more. I sipped my coffee and stared out the window, as if scanning for tumbleweeds.Then something excellent happened. A young couple, Beth Porter and Ben Please, arrived with their infant daughter, Molly. They had musical instruments in tow: Beth, a cello; Ben, a ukulele; Molly, a toy glockenspiel.Porter and Please are the core members of the Bookshop Band. They write songs inspired by books and play them in bookstores. I\u2019d met them the night before at Bythell\u2019s apartment, which is above his store. They\u2019d decided to welcome me to Wigtown by performing an impromptu concert.My hangover dissolved in the bliss. If America\u2019s independent booksellers can\u2019t figure a way to get these two, plus Molly, to tour America, they\u2019re doing something wrong.All day, kind and eccentric locals popped in to say hello. One woman brought me shortbread. Others inquired worriedly about our American president, as if I might have a copy of the famous Russian tape.It was Jessica Fox\u2019s idea to allow guests to stay in and operate The Open Book. She\u2019s an American filmmaker who first arrived in Wigtown in 2008, possessed by the romantic dream of working in a used bookshop in Scotland.She landed at Bythell\u2019s store and the two fell in love. When word got out in 2013 that a local bookshop was going to close, she had a thought about what to do with it. Bythell\u2019s parents purchased the shop, and they arranged for a small nonprofit volunteer group to operate it. The Open Book is rentable for 28 pounds (about $37) a night.\u201cI remember thinking to myself, I can\u2019t be the only person who would love to run a bookshop by the sea,\u201d Fox told me. The store was an almost instant success. For many visitors, running the shop is the fulfillment of a lifelong fantasy. Fox tries to accommodate people with special circumstances, such as life-threatening illnesses.Fox and Bythell are no longer a couple but remain friends. She now lives in Edinburgh, but keeps a hand in the shop\u2019s operation. She\u2019s written a memoir, \u201cThree Things You Need to Know about Rockets,\u201d about her Wigtown experience.Bythell has written his own memoir, \u201cThe Diary of a Bookseller,\u201d which will be published in the United States this fall. It\u2019s among the most irascible and amusing bookseller memoirs I\u2019ve read. Sample line: \u201cI am putting together a mental jigsaw of what a hobbit looks like, based on a composite of every customer I have ever sold a copy to.\u201dIf this all sounds like a romantic comedy, it may become one. Fox\u2019s and Bythell\u2019s books were recently optioned together by Annapurna Pictures (\u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d) for a possible television project.Fox and her group have no plans to open a second Open Book. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to feel like a franchise,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to dilute the specialness of it.\u201dThough there were many browsers while I ran the shop, and as many as six people in the store at once, I sold only three books in the afternoon.I did buy a small pile of books myself \u2014 so many that, when added to other books I\u2019d bought while traveling, Norwegian Airlines charged me for overweight luggage flying home.Before I closed up the shop, I pulled my sandwich board inside, locked the front door and dropped the keys through a slot. Mentally, I was making plans to run this place, in 2022 or 2023, for as long as they will allow me. With luck, Bythell will take me out for some Kindle-shooting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "She Became a Face of Family Separation at the Border. But She\u2019s Still With Her Mother.", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe photograph of a Honduran toddler, sobbing as she stares up at her mother, became a symbol of outrage this week at the Trump administration\u2019s practice of separating children and parents detained for illegally crossing the border.But the child\u2019s father, reached by phone in Honduras on Friday, told The New York Times that the mother and daughter were in fact never separated after being stopped at the border, and that they remain detained together in a family residential center in Texas.In a front-page caption published June 14 with a similar photo from a series by John Moore of Getty Images, The Times said only that the girl was crying while her mother was searched. The family\u2019s status and whereabouts could not be determined.It was a related image by Mr. Moore of the isolated toddler staring up at her mother and a border agent, both visible only from the waist down, that in subsequent days became a potent symbol in the angry debate over the family separation policy, along with video and pictures of children in chain-link cages and pens taken at Border Patrol sites.The father, Denis Javier Varela Hernandez, 32, who lives in Puerto Cort\u00e9s, Honduras, said in an interview in Spanish on Friday that his daughter Yanela, who turns 2 next month, and her mother, Sandra Maria Sanchez, are together and fine. He said Ms. Sanchez, with whom he has been in a relationship for 14 years, left for the United States three weeks ago.Children who crossed the border alone or who were separated from their parents are being held in an estimated 100 facilities in 17 states.\u201cShe was looking for a better quality of life, a better future,\u201d Mr. Varela told The Times on Friday. \u201cShe had mentioned to me that she wanted to leave. But she never told me about taking our daughter.\u201dThe couple has three other children: a son, Wesly, 14, and two daughters, Cindy, 11, and Brianna, 6.\u201cShe wanted a house and she wanted to have her own business,\u201d said Mr. Varela, who works as a boat captain in Puerto Cort\u00e9s. \u201cEveryone here wants those things. I always told her to not leave, but everyone makes their own decisions.\u201dBut the magazine issued a correction to an online article, saying that Border Patrol agents had not carried the girl away screaming. Instead, the correction said, the mother had picked the toddler up and they left together.They set a goal of $1,500 and were astonished to bring in more than $19 million. On Friday afternoon, the picture was still at the top of their Facebook page.Mr. Varela said he had been in contact with his partner\u2019s family. If she is able to seek political asylum and stay in the United States, he said, \u201cI will support her. If she gets status, then maybe we can visit and also get a positive status.\u201dFor now, he said, he is glad to see that the photograph of his daughter had made an impact. \u201cI feel sad because of the image, but at the same time, happy,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cLook at what my daughter has come to mean to immigrants and the topic of immigration worldwide.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Babajan in Melbourne, Australia", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare8 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 New York has its pizza, Paris its baguettes, Tokyo its ramen bars. Melbourne has cafes.Australia is celebrated for its cafe culture, but that is one of those phrases that obscures the meaning behind it. What is \u201ccafe culture\u201d? Why does it matter? Does it matter? You can get good coffee in almost any city in the world these days. And what differentiates the cafes of Melbourne from anywhere else\u2019s?This small neighborhood spot in Carlton North does not need a tasting-menu gimmick. Babajan is not Instagram famous; there is no line around the block. It is a simple operation with an open kitchen in the back, a handful of tables and some sidewalk seating out front. And yet, it represents the kind of approachable pleasure typical of the city\u2019s best cafes, an abundance of goodness that\u2019s imminently accessible.Mr. Tosun is no longer with the restaurant, but the benefits of the two chefs\u2019 collaboration remains. The magic of Babajan \u2014 and other cafes of its ilk \u2014 is in its ability to take all the care of fine dining, combine it with the ease and love of ambitious home cooking, and bring it into the realm of everyday eating; to allow moments of transcendence over a Tuesday morning meal.The bread is the first thing that inspired my slight obsession with Babajan: a warm roll of pita that comes alongside a dish of ground lamb cooked with baharat over a pool of tangy hummus, with a fried egg and a shock of magenta pickled vegetables. The bread was soft and pliant and dusted with za\u2019atar, better than the stiff pita I\u2019ve had at much fancier Middle Eastern restaurants around town.At lunch, a crisp-skinned snapper came in a cast-iron skillet, swimming in tomato spiked with olives and anchovy. Simit, a Turkish bread that resembles a wide bagel crusted with sesame seeds, was for sopping up the sauce. Chewy but not too dense, and slightly warmed in the oven, the bread was the highlight of the (already very good) dish.Intensely juicy, slow-cooked lamb shoulder makes its way onto a number of plates, often as an optional add-on. You can have it on your Aleppo eggplant toasted sandwich (or toastie, in Australian parlance) with fermented chile and sumac onions, or on your Turkish baked eggs where it swims in the spiced tomato, topped with pistachio dukkha.Behind the glass counter on one side of the room, a sea of deliciousness piles up over the course of the morning. It begins with pastries like Persian love cakes \u2014 dense with almond flour and lightly aromatic from rosewater \u2014 among cookies, croissants and pies. Then platters arrive, heaped with food to go: rice salads; vegetable salads; a pile of slow-roasted lamb muddled with hunks of sweet pumpkin, black-eyed peas, yogurt and hazelnuts.In April, Babajan began serving dinner two nights a week, after years of customer requests. Dinnertime in the cafe has the feel of a pop-up, and the food isn\u2019t that different from what\u2019s available at breakfast and lunch (though there are fewer eggs by far).There was a lovely slump of eggplant kizartma, cooked down to its soft essence with tomato and topped with yogurt and pomegranate. Kingfish sat in a pool of tomato and Kalamata olives, with a drizzle of tahini \u2014 it\u2019s strikingly similar to the snapper dish served at lunch. The braised lamb shoulder used to enrich so many breakfast dishes can be ordered on its own, for four or more people, as a meaty feast.Babajan is exceptional, but this level of quality is not unexpected. We pride ourselves on this way of life in Australia, especially in Melbourne, where good food is everywhere, at every time of day and at every price point.I enjoyed eating dinner at Babajan. I appreciated drinking a bottle of wine with a longer meal and the camaraderie of spending a couple of hours with a service staff that had time to shine. But Babajan is built for breakfast and lunch.It\u2019s those meals, with the sun streaming in and the controlled chaos of cafe service, that stand out. I am someone who eats constantly, daily, in every type of restaurant. I eat a ton of precious, expensive food \u2014 yet my meals at Babajan have been imminently more memorable than most of the pricey fare. That\u2019s a gift that deserves wild applause, no matter the time of day.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Supreme Court\u2019s Janus Decision Means for Teacher Unions", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, teachers unions could lose up to a third of their members and funding as a result of the decision, labor experts say, some of the same money that fueled the walkouts.\u201cMembers and money are power in politics,\u201d said Terry Moe, a Stanford political science professor who has written critically of the unions. \u201cThis will weaken the teachers unions nationwide as a political force.\u201dThe walkout movement began in West Virginia, where agency fees are already outlawed, and was largely driven by rank-and-file teachers, not union leaders. While union members pay dues, agency fees cover the costs of representing nonmember teachers in contract negotiations and disputes with management.The decision in the Supreme Court case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, \u201cwill affect us, because it\u2019s going to hurt the national\u201d unions that provided crucial support, said Jay O\u2019Neal, a West Virginia teacher and a leader of the protests.States with agency fees and public sector collective bargaining, he said, tend to have higher teacher salaries and school funding than right-to-work states like West Virginia and the others where teachers went on strike.Nonmembers can already opt out of paying for political lobbying. But because unions engage in politics even at the bargaining table, on issues such as how public dollars are spent on salaries and benefits, five of the court\u2019s justices said such fees violate workers\u2019 free-speech rights, by forcing them to give money to organizations whose views they may not support.Public sector unions have been under attack for years. Several states, including Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin, have passed laws aimed at weakening them, and membership has declined, even in places where unions continue to represent teachers and other public sector workers in contract negotiations.About 70 percent of the nation\u2019s 3.8 million public school teachers belong to a union or professional association, according to a 2015-16 survey by the National Center for Education Statistics, down from 79 percent in the 1999-2000 school year.Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union, said that the Janus decision could mean a loss of up to 200,000 members: $28 million less in the organization\u2019s $366 million budget.The union is preparing a campaign to mitigate the fallout, in particular reaching out to younger teachers who do not have deep loyalties to organized labor.\u201cWe know it will have an impact, and we know we will come back,\u201d Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said.The National Education Association does not plan to curb its political activities, which are largely on behalf of Democrats and liberal groups. Among the union\u2019s priorities is mobilizing teachers to vote in this year\u2019s midterm elections, Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said.Neal McCluskey, director of the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Educational Freedom, said the Janus decision reversed a \u201cfundamentally unjust\u201d requirement that forced teachers to pay for the union\u2019s political agenda.\u201cThis restores teachers\u2019 ability to say, \u2018I will not support speech or political activity that I don\u2019t agree with,\u2019\u201d he said.For union allies stung by the court decision, the walkout movement offered a glimmer of hope. The protests occurred in states crippled by education funding cuts since the recession, and where unions are already weak and working without agency fees. Union affiliates in several of the states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia, said they had signed up hundreds or even thousands of members since the movement began.In many of the walkout states, the teachers who led the protests first gathered supporters on Facebook, sometimes with little help from union officials. But the state and national unions stepped in with organizing and lobbying muscle \u2014 and money \u2014 that sustained the movement as it grew. That support could wane if teachers in strong-union states like California or Illinois choose not to pay dues and fees.\u201cTeachers starting off, the salary is so low,\u201d Mr. Morejon said. Foregoing union fees means \u201cone less thing you have to pay for. A lot of younger teachers I know, they\u2019re not joining because they need to save every dollar they can.\u201dAnticipating the decision, some leaders have sought countermeasures. In April, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, where public sector unions remain powerful, signed a law freeing the unions from the legal requirement to represent workers who have not paid dues in disputes with management. Labor experts say this will likely encourage teachers to maintain their union membership. Other liberal states may follow.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation for Teachers, the other national teacher\u2019s union, remained optimistic: Of 800,000 members in 18 states affected by the Janus decision, the group said it had secured more than 500,000 \u201crecommitments\u201d to retain membership since January. About 90 percent of the A.F.T.\u2019s 1.8 million members are school educators.\u201cThese folks that have huge power over their lives have tried to cut school budgets, tried to hurt their health care, cut retirement benefits, privatize hospitals and schools, are now having the chutzpah to say, \u2018Give up your union to get a quick raise,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are getting it big time, and are basically trying to stick with the union.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll mean that teachers can now hold union officials accountable,\u201d Mr. Semmens said. \u201cIt allows them to say, \u2018If you want my money, you have to earn it now.\u201d\u2019Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Saying #MeToo Changed Their Lives", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "Turns out it was just the beginning. People passed me notes on airplanes thanking me. Men and women. I actually just reread three notes that I kept on my bedside table. The themes are similar: thank you so much, I\u2019ve had my own experiences with harassment and sexual assault, you\u2019ve been so brave, you made it easier for me.One woman was on her way to her sister\u2019s college graduation. The sister was graduating with her rapist. On one flight, I had my Time\u2019s Up T-shirt on, and when I got off the airplane people had lined up to thank me.[On her lawsuit] Sexual harassment in the workplace damages economic opportunity. The power dynamics at play are revealed in a worker\u2019s trajectory and in her paycheck. Being able to have the legal basis for remedy is crucial. The promotion that doesn\u2019t materialize, the shift that\u2019s reassigned, the opportunities for advantageous overtime \u2026 those are all ways that women are punished. Bringing that to light and having economic and legal remedy is an integral part of the strategy of moving the American work force forward.A few months ago, I was driving in rural Tennessee, listening to a report on #MeToo in the Russian Parliament. I had such wonder, knowing that in some way it started with our conversation. I did what I did because it was the right thing to do and I trusted that things would fall into place.Now I want joyfully to shout from the rooftops, everyone come forward, everyone come forward. Everyone has to make their decisions, but I think we can safely say millions of others are here to offer support and hope. Nobody can do it for me, but I don\u2019t have to do it alone.I think my favorite responses have been from men who say hearing my story inspired them to make company changes. That has made it really worth it for me.My phone has been ringing off the hook. I had an invitation to close out the Women\u2019s March in Chicago, which was phenomenal. I take every opportunity that comes my way because I know right now, in this moment, there are women who are still working in the plant and across other industries that are fearful of speaking.The apology from Ford was important because it is a recognition, but now the work has to happen.Ms. Walsh, who had been a guest on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Reilly broke his promise to make her a contributor after she declined an invitation to his hotel suite in 2013. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has vehemently denied the allegations of sexual harassment against him. Ms. Walsh now works as an adjunct professor of psychology at California State University, Channel Islands, and as a radio host for KFI AM 640 with iHeartMedia.I was stunned by positive messages that came at me on social media. The best part is that I received an enormous amount of support from men. They told me awful stories of having to watch lecherous men manipulate women and because of the male code or their rank, they were powerless to complain.Although I worried that this would hurt my business (I work in radio and sponsors are everything), somehow this increased my credibility. Suddenly all kinds of ethical companies wanted me to represent their brands.I didn\u2019t want it to be just about me and my validation and my revenge. I wanted others to have a sense of resolution and relief from the trauma, the harassment, the fear and the blame and the self-shaming. These are vulnerable young women who depend on him for their paycheck.It was really about power and domination of women. There were women who really liked him and were flirty with him. A lot of women did love him back. I think he would call himself a feminist, if you asked him. It doesn\u2019t really shock me any more. It fills me with sadness.Ms. Dixon said she was later sexually harassed repeatedly while working under another record label boss, L.A. Reid, subsequently driving her from the music industry. Mr. Reid did not respond directly to Ms. Dixon\u2019s claims, but apologized generally in a statement for ever saying \u201canything capable of being misinterpreted.\u201dIt was like a bomb going off.These are incredibly powerful men. They\u2019re cultural icons, they\u2019re business icons. So just the idea that I was kicking the hornet\u2019s nest with these two really huge people, I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.It\u2019s very hard as a black woman to call out powerful black men because we have no heroes to spare. We are always, still, fighting this uphill battle, always trying to overcome this myth of the predatory black man. So the last thing you want to do is contribute to that in any way. It\u2019s complicated as a black woman \u2014 do you take it for the team? Which is what I did for 22 years. Or do you insist that you, too, deserve dignity, physical safety and respect? That was very hard for me and it\u2019s literally why I kept the secret for all these years. I didn\u2019t want to tear down a black man, let alone two. But what they did was wrong.On the other hand, I didn\u2019t want black women to be left out of the #MeToo moment. And I did not want to miss this opportunity to be heard and believed.I would say that it certainly has been an impetus for me to make music again. It\u2019s a huge source of joy and personal satisfaction for me. And I think I\u2019m good at it. So it\u2019s been a loss for me not to be able to make records. Because of the article I\u2019ve been contacted by aspiring artists, one of whom I\u2019m signing to a label I am setting up specifically to make her record. That would not have happened if I hadn\u2019t resurfaced and reminded myself \u2014 and have others reminded of \u2014 what I do.A selection of Pulitzer-winning investigationsWeinstein\u2019s Complicity MachineDEC. 5, 2017The producer Harvey Weinstein relied on powerful relationships across industries to provide him with cover as accusations of sexual misconduct piled up for decades.Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of HarassmentJUN. 30, 2017More than two dozen women in the tech start-up industry spoke to The New York Times about being sexually harassed by investors and mentors.Bill O\u2019Reilly Settled New Harassment Claim, Then Fox Renewed His ContractOCT. 21, 2017In January, the Fox News host was said to have agreed to a $32 million settlement with a former network analyst, the largest of his known payouts.Louis C.K. Is Accused by 5 Women of Sexual MisconductNOV. 9, 2017As the powerful comedian found success by talking about his hang-ups, he was also asking female comics and co-workers to watch him masturbate.Although Vornado, the Armory Show\u2019s parent company, acknowledged at the time in a letter to Ms. Harris that Mr. Genocchio had \u201creferred to another female employee as arm candy and previously referred to others as sweetie,\u201d the company said that Mr. Genocchio had apologized and ceased his behavior; it also eliminated Ms. Harris\u2019s job. Mr. Genocchio, who denied acting inappropriately, was ultimately removed from his position and has since become a partner at Galerie Gmurzynska.I couldn\u2019t really say what had happened when I left; I just kind of slipped out. I did not want to say anything because I did not want to jeopardize any negotiation.You do what you have to do just to get out of a situation. I didn\u2019t have anything to lose at this point. I\u2019m really not looking for a big full-time job. But let\u2019s say you\u2019re in your 30s, you\u2019re still in the business and you don\u2019t want to be ostracized, there is that stigma. The worst thing for me was I didn\u2019t get the support from other women in the office, even though they had come and complained to me. They didn\u2019t want to lose their jobs. I get it.After the article, my daughter posted on Facebook: \u2018My mother, social justice warrior.\u2019 I really kind of got elevated in her eyes. I\u2019m proud of myself.This is a system that has existed for thousands of years, and now you cannot behave that way. The psychological implications for those of us who have been exploited by men in power are so much to process, because we\u2019ve built our identities and defense systems and strength out of protecting ourselves against this kind of system. For a mother of a 14-year-old girl, it\u2019s overwhelming to know we\u2019re living in a culture where ramifications exist for this kind of thing.There\u2019s a veil of shame that\u2019s been lifted off this whole thing. There\u2019s this amazing feeling of knit-togetherness in the female community. [Many] women don\u2019t have anything to leverage to protect themselves. That\u2019s why it felt so urgent and upsetting and I felt na\u00efve for not having gone through the mental exercise of postulating what the version was for a single woman trying to make ends meet.I was not prepared for what it would feel like to feel silenced, especially once I saw structurally how that\u2019s actually the problem.I can\u2019t talk about what happened, I can\u2019t tell you if it happened more than once, I can\u2019t tell you who else was there when it happened or if I was alone. I can\u2019t tell you how it made me feel, I can\u2019t tell you about the power dynamic between myself and the person or persons the incident happened with.I can\u2019t tell you who I reported it to at the company, nor what their response was. I can\u2019t even tell you if or how their response changed over time. I can\u2019t tell you who I asked for advice, or what they told me. I can\u2019t tell you what conditions I signed the agreement under, and I can\u2019t tell you what was said to me before or after I signed the agreement.I would love to share with other people out there, men, women, whoever, encourage everyone to view NDAs with care. Because when you sign one, you\u2019re signing away your constitutional right to free speech.The question is maybe less about, Should we expect humans to behave perfectly, and more about, What are those mechanisms in place when things don\u2019t go perfectly, and when someone has their rights infringed on?Some who wrote me said they had been abused at home or elsewhere, the article motivating them to want to share their own experiences. I have gained a lot of satisfaction from the grown men that have come up to me, resonating, because men need so badly to do just that \u2014 resonate together, to express their feelings.Though the article provided a deep sense of relief and brought more closure to the abuse I went through, it has in the meantime opened up other issues that were exacerbated by the abuse, though not directly related. Issues such as my own sense of confidence, and why I was one of the ones chosen.The aftermath has provided a new search, one where I am learning to forgive myself for all that I have not accomplished and instead be thankful for what I have done.It\u2019s been about 10 1/2 months now, and I\u2019m finally for the first time starting to come around and understand the role that I was able to play.Now I walk around being able to look people in the eye and acknowledge a sincere compliment. A few days, weeks, and even months after these stories were written I carried a lot of shamefulness around. I couldn\u2019t have predicted that it would take this long. My voice and my story helped to ignite what became this global cause and movement, and it took on such a life of its own that I really didn\u2019t have time to breathe, or think about it, or come up for air.In my case, there was really overwhelming evidence, and whether I knew it at the time, I would be able to eventually do something with all of the text messages, the emails, the voice messages.I was sure glad that I had that paper trail because it made me realize as I looked back to see that yeah, what I had gone through was not just in my head.One of the most satisfying things was to see my daughter\u2019s reaction, because she was just like, \u2018Wow, Mom, this is so cool, this is so badass, you did the right thing and more power to you.\u2019 She is 23 now and she just started to work. The young women today have a different attitude. They are much less willing to put up with things.Back then you said, \u2018I don\u2019t have anywhere to go with this and that\u2019s just the way guys are,\u2019 but now things are different. Now people will finally listen to these stories instead of dismissing them. Now we talk because now the culture is listening to us.When the article dropped, my anxiety skyrocketed. Strangers recognized me from the internet, and people I hadn\u2019t spoken to in years texted me. But I have fewer friends at Vice than ever. Only one man I worked with at Vice reached out to me in the days following, and it was expected \u2014 a good friend who knows me very well. The rest were women. And even then, far fewer than I\u2019d hoped. It was incredible because all of these people I\u2019d considered family at one point just \u2026 weren\u2019t there.A few other former co-workers reached out in time, but even so, it was like every straight man I\u2019d worked with at Vice was terrified that perhaps they, too, had harassed me at some point, so best to not say anything at all, best not to apologize lest it looks like an admission of guilt, I suppose. I think men are so used to the office-place power dynamic they don\u2019t realize what they\u2019re doing is permanently damaging to women.I choose not to have even moderately close relationships with co-workers now. I go to work, do my job and go home. The last time I made my work my home and my colleagues my family, I lost everything. And I lost myself. That\u2019s not happening again.I just finished directing this new play, called \u2018How to Defend Yourself,\u2019 at a new play festival here [in San Diego], about a college student who has been raped by a fraternity member and one of her sorority sisters starts a self-defense class. It\u2019s been amazing to work on it, and ultimately it\u2019s healing, but there were times when I\u2019d have to take a break and go outside and cry or be mad.It feels like this was a moment where a huge veil came off, and when we have been able to see what we could not see before. I\u2019m really grateful for that. It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s the way we evolve.It feels terrifying to speak on the record. Once you jump off the cliff and you say it, you realize that actually there is no cliff. It turns into a door that\u2019s open and there\u2019s all these people standing on the other side and they\u2019re literally saying, \u2018Me too.\u2019I was absolutely shocked by some of the stories I heard from ballerinas I thought were untouchable. That floored me. These were queens. You\u2019re conditioned to not complain. You\u2019re conditioned to accept a certain style of communication and a certain way of being treated. Now that company is going to turn into something we never thought it could be. We all want to change it; it needs to change.She said it was the final act in a long string of incidents with both men that that included attempts by Mr. Batali to touch her breasts and engage her in lewd conversation. Mr. Batali said at the time of publication in December that he didn\u2019t remember specific incidents, but \u201cthere is no question I have behaved terribly.\u201d In a statement, Mr. Friedman acknowledged behavior that was \u201cabrasive, rude, and frankly wrong\u201d but also said that \u201csome incidents were not as described,\u201d without responding specifically to any woman\u2019s account.Before this happened I\u2019d invested five years in seeing a therapist on a weekly basis and now it\u2019s become clear that what I really needed to do in order to heal myself was end the oppressive silence that I\u2019ve been shaming myself with and speak \u2014 more like, shout \u2014 my truth.I feel like I\u2019ve finally been given permission to hang up an extremely worn-out pair of tap dancing shoes, the shoes I used to dance around the bloated egos and salacious behavior of power-driven men for decades. I finally feel like myself again.Related coverageFord Apologizes for Sexual Harassment at Chicago FactoriesDEC. 12, 2017The company\u2019s chief executive released an apology two days after a New York Times article detailed decades of misconduct.Chuck Close Is Accused of Harassment.

They don\u2019t want to make me uncomfortable with things I\u2019m not comfortable disclosing to them. I talked to one of my friends before I talked to you and she was really supportive. She felt really bad in a good way. She just wouldn\u2019t want that to happen to anybody and she let me know she was really happy I was talking about this and coming out with this, because if we\u2019re not standing together these same kind of people are going to keep doing what they are doing over and over.The thing that\u2019s most weird for me is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s garnered enough attention of famous people. People who claim to be activists in the community and are part of the #MeToo movement still associate with this person. I think it\u2019s really weird.

Ms. Baker is now a tech industry lawyer leading a 45-person firm in London.

And then at the party, one of our male associates said he was very upset and he felt very bad for me. And he was also upset because he loves hip-hop.A very good friend, a man, I told him about it and he looked upset. He said: \u2018I need to ask you this question: I don\u2019t understand how such a strong woman like you, how this could have happened to you?

{"Headline": "On Facebook, a Place for Civil Discussion", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Russian trolls wielding ads and memes used Facebook as a tool to darken lines of division. More recently, one corner of Facebook has emerged in pursuit of the opposite: civil conversation, even among those who disagree. It has become part of Bethany Grace Howe\u2019s morning routine, right alongside her yogurt and cup of tea.\u201cIt was like, O.K., this is too good to be true,\u201d she said.And it soon became clear that the group was a lot more than just a place to talk about the Gray Lady.\u201cI joined because I thought I was going to learn a lot about The New York Times from the people who work at The Times,\u201d Ms. Howe said. \u201cWhat\u2019s ended up happening is I\u2019ve learned an amazing amount about this country by talking to the readers of The Times.\u201dIt has come to mean enough that she is now working to organize a real life meet-up of group members near her in Oregon, where she is a doctoral student of mass media studies examining questions of transgender identity and depictions in media.These are different from The Times\u2019s institutional Facebook page, or pages run by sections like Styles or Science, which you might follow to see their news articles show up in your feed. In these groups, people at The Times \u2014 and collaborators \u2014 guide discussions and often engage with group members. Administrators must approve people before they can join, and must sign off on individual posts, too. They can also delete comments or remove members if things get nasty or inappropriate.When asked about their involvement in the groups, a half-dozen other active members gave reasons similar to Ms. Howe\u2019s. People joined the groups looking for a place to talk about an interest (books, podcasts, the media, the news around the world), and for the most part, they\u2019ve stuck around and become regulars because of the wide range of tastes and perspectives they encounter within them. For Ms. Howe, one such encounter stood out.In mid-March, she jumped into a discussion about a Democrat, Conor Lamb, winning a special House election in a Pennsylvania district that Donald J. Trump had won easily in 2016. The conversation had turned to the idea of being willing to compromise on certain values to support a candidate with broad appeal from a party that aligns generally with your beliefs.Ms. Howe grappled with that idea but eventually grew frustrated, explaining that while she understood the necessity of compromise in politics, to her, something like protections for transgender people felt non-negotiable. How could she compromise on her civil rights?But then a Latina member of the group chimed in, explaining how she twice voted for Barack Obama even though she found his position on undocumented immigrants to be draconian. Ms. Howe called it an \u201cepiphany moment\u201d that helped her understand the limitations of any one person\u2019s viewpoint, including her own.That conversation, and others in the group, changed her perspective and gave her an \u201cunderstanding of the types of moral, internal debates that people have every day in this country,\u201d she said.She had been angry at people in her life for not being more upset about issues that mattered to her. The group, she said, helped her understand \u201cwhy people think the way they do,\u201d and \u201cwhy they reach decisions that are different than your own.\u201dShe is still angry about structural injustices, but she is not angry at the people she has a beer with to discuss them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Costs to Be Smuggled Across the U.S. Border", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "Bribes and shakedowns. Days in hideaways without food. For many fleeing violence in Central America, this is what thousands of dollars gets them on the journey to the United States.MATAMOROS, Mexico \u2014 Shortly before dawn one Sunday last August, a driver in an S.U.V. picked up Christopher Cruz at a stash house in this border city near the Gulf of Mexico. The 22-year-old from El Salvador was glad to leave the one-story building, where smugglers kept bundles of cocaine and marijuana alongside their human cargo, but he was anxious about what lay ahead.The driver deposited Mr. Cruz at an illegal crossing point on the edge of the Rio Grande. A smuggler took a smartphone photograph to confirm his identity and sent it using WhatsApp to a driver waiting to pick him up on the other side of the frontier when \u2014 if \u2014 he made it across.The nearly 2,000-mile trip had already cost Mr. Cruz\u2019s family more than $6,000 and brought him within sight of Brownsville, Tex. The remaining 500 miles to Houston \u2014 terrain prowled by the United States Border Patrol as well as the state and local police \u2014 would set them back another $6,500.It was an almost inconceivable amount of money for someone who earned just a few dollars a day picking coffee beans back home. But he wasn\u2019t weighing the benefits of a higher-paying job. He was fleeing violence and what he said was near-certain death at the hands of local gangs.\u201cThere\u2019s no other option,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cThe first thought I had was, \u2018I just need to get out of here at whatever cost.\u2019\u201dThe stretch of southwest border where he intended to cross has become the epicenter of the raging battle over the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. One clear consequence of the tightening American border and the growing perils getting there is that more and more desperate families are turning to increasingly sophisticated smuggling operations to get relatives into the United States.Mr. Cruz\u2019s story provides an unusually detailed anatomy of the price of the journey. The money paid for a network of drivers who concealed him in tractor-trailers and minibuses, a series of houses where he hid out, handlers tied to criminal organizations who arranged his passage, and bribes for Mexican police officers to look the other way as he passed.Even with his family\u2019s payment, he slept amid filth and vermin. He watched guides abandon some migrants who could not keep up, and guards prod others to become drug mules. Sometimes the smugglers identified him by a numeric code, other times by an assumed name. But as often as not, they simply called him \u201cthe package,\u201d to be moved for profit like an illicit good.For Mr. Cruz, it was worth it. \u201cThey can build as many walls as they want,\u201d he said, referring to American officials. \u201cThey can send as many soldiers to the border as they want, but a people\u2019s need and desire for a better life is stronger.\u201dPresident Trump and his supporters have called for greater vigilance along the border to keep out people like Mr. Cruz, a low-skilled worker who followed in the path of other family members who also arrived illegally, and who hopes those left behind will join him.The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, told lawmakers in May that migrants paid $500 million a year to groups fueling violence and instability in the region. A decade ago, Mexicans and Central Americans paid between $1,000 and $3,000 for clandestine passage into the United States. Now they hand over up to $9,200 for the same journey, the Department of Homeland Security reported last year. Those figures have continued to rise, according to interviews at migrant shelters in Mexico.To trace Mr. Cruz\u2019s journey from El Salvador, The New York Times relied on extensive interviews with him and his family, and reviewed contemporaneous photographs, text messages, receipts and GPS positions.UNITEDSTATESHoustonSanAntonioTEXAS$6,500MEXICOMcAllenMonterreythat Mr. Cruz\u2019s family madeat each stage of his trip.Matamoros$180$2,800TAMAULIPASMr. Cruz\u2019srouteSAN LUISPOTOS\u00cdGulf ofMexicoHIDALGOGuadalajara$450Mexico CityPueblaVERACRUZ$1,900MalpasoDamCHIAPASPacificOceanGuatemalaCity$800GUATEMALAEL SALVADORSan SalvadorSan DiegoU.S. \u2014 MEXICO BORDEREl PasoUNITEDSTATESHoustonSanAntonioTEXAS$6,500MEXICOMcAllenMonterreythat Mr. Cruz\u2019s family madeat each stage of his trip.Matamoros$180$2,800TAMAULIPASMr. Cruz\u2019srouteSAN LUISPOTOS\u00cdGulf ofMexicoHIDALGOGuadalajara$450Mexico CityPueblaVERACRUZ$1,900MalpasoDamCHIAPASPacificOceanGuatemalaCity$800GUATEMALAEL SALVADORSan SalvadorUNITEDSTATESHoustonMr. Cruz\u2019srouteMEXICOTEXAS$6,500MonterreyBrownsville$2,800MatamorosNUEVOLEON$180TAMAULIPASSAN LUISPOTOS\u00cdHIDALGO$450Gulf ofMexicoMexico CityPueblaVERACRUZMalpasoDam$1,900CHIAPASPacificOceanGuatemalaCityHONDURASGUATEMALASan Salvador$800EL SALVADORUNITEDSTATESHoustonMEXICO$6,500MonterreyMatamoros$180$2,800Mr. Cruz\u2019sroute$450Mexico CityGulf ofMexicoPuebla$1,900MalpasoDamGuatemalaCityPacificOcean$800SanSalvadorHis uncle in the United States checked in constantly by Facebook Messenger during his weeks on the road.

Reporters reviewed more than 200 recent criminal complaints in smuggling cases along the southwest border, including those brought against drivers, stash-house operators, foot guides and migrants.That day at the Rio Grande last summer, a guide prepared to lead Mr. Cruz and some two dozen other migrants to the far side of the river while three lookouts perched in trees, scanning the horizon for any hint of the Border Patrol.When he arrived at the crossing, Mr. Cruz found that the river wasn\u2019t wide, at most a few hundred feet, but the water was murky and full of debris. The smugglers had gathered the migrants at the water\u2019s edge, with giant inflated inner tubes for those who couldn\u2019t swim. They said the makeshift rafts were slower than swimming, so Mr. Cruz pulled off his skinny-leg khakis and T-shirt and paddled to the other side in his boxer shorts.After climbing up the bank, his first tenuous toehold in the United States, he crouched, wet and shivering, in the brush and got dressed. Mr. Cruz\u2019s face had lost much of its roundness as he had shed 30 pounds over a month of hard travel. A life of skateboarding, tinkering with computers and eating his grandmother\u2019s cooking had not prepared him for the demands of the road.Mr. Cruz had climbed halfway up the fence when he heard a helicopter overhead and saw patrol cars converging. Agents grabbed those already over the fence and began to arrest them.\u201cWhen I saw that, I slid down and I ran back,\u201d Mr. Cruz recalled. He dived again into the Rio Grande, his only hope to escape back to Mexico.Mr. Cruz grew up in San Miguel, the fourth-largest city in El Salvador. Gang violence is virtually endemic in the country, and Mr. Cruz dropped out of high school when the infamous MS-13 became too dangerous there. His family relocated to Berl\u00edn, about an hour\u2019s drive away, which had less of a gang problem than the big cities.Mr. Cruz\u2019s mother lived in the United States, but he was much closer to her brother there, an uncle he considered a father figure and called \u201cPapi.\u201d Mr. Cruz lived with his grandmother and younger sister. He also had a 2-year-old son to provide for, though he and the boy\u2019s mother had broken up.During coffee-picking season he rose at 4 in the morning, walked an hour to the farm where he worked, then plucked ripe red coffee cherries until dark. He usually earned $15 to $20 a week. Outside harvest season, Mr. Cruz painted murals and cleaned streets for the local government. He briefly worked as a bartender at a restaurant an hour\u2019s bus ride away.The police had all but declared open season on gang-age men, Mr. Cruz said, and he and his friends were harassed and beaten by the security forces. Meanwhile, gang members regularly threatened him and shook him down for money because they realized he received support from his uncle in the United States.One night, Mr. Cruz and his friends were walking home when they noticed a blue Honda creeping behind them. When the young men started to run, the car accelerated, then followed Mr. Cruz as the group split up.\u201cI got to my house and it was locked,\u201d he recalled. He considered climbing over the front gate but worried the men who were following him might kill his grandmother and sister too. Over his shoulder he saw the gang members draw guns as he fled across a soccer field before taking refuge in a nearby health clinic.After that night, he resolved to leave. \u201cThat is the reality of El Salvador,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are scared of both, the gangs and the police.\u201d He did not consider trying to enter United States legally to seek asylum; even under the more lenient asylum policies a year ago only a fraction of gang-violence victims won that status.Mr. Cruz had never gone farther than neighboring Honduras. But in some Central American cities, smuggling services to the United States are openly promoted on the streets, with hawkers luring customers the way agents at tourist destinations advertise sailing or snorkeling excursions. They take potential customers to a back room of a nearby store, where salesmen pitch them on a smuggling route. Some would-be migrants give up homes, cars, livestock and even farmland tilled by their families for generations and take on debt to pay the fees.Mr. Cruz\u2019s uncle, who now has legal status in the United States after arriving illegally years ago, spoke to a woman in his local Salvadoran community. She told him of smugglers who brought her three children over for a flat $20,000 fee after gang members back home killed her husband. The uncle used WhatsApp to contact a woman in Mexico representing the smuggling network, who became the point of contact throughout Mr. Cruz\u2019s journey.\u201cWould it be possible to pick up my nephew as close as possible to the edge of San Salvador?\u201d the uncle asked her in one message. \u201cThe boy is 22 years old but acts more like 12.\u201d The uncle spoke on the condition of anonymity because he, like other relatives of unauthorized immigrants, feared he could be prosecuted for trafficking a family member.Mr. Cruz worried about the trip. His best friend had made the same journey the year before only to be kidnapped near the American border and held for two months. His family paid $20,000 to free him, and he ended up back in El Salvador. And a female friend of Mr. Cruz had been raped by smugglers on the American side of the border, caught by the authorities and then deported.His uncle assured him over Facebook Messenger that everything would be fine.Mr. Cruz\u2019s aunt and uncle earned enough to advance him the money for the journey, but Mr. Cruz would have to pay them back. They wired $800 to El Salvador the day he set out on the initial leg of the trip. \u201cAny opportunity you have to connect, send me a message with your location,\u201d the uncle wrote.\u201cActivate Find My iPhone so you can find out my location from the iCloud,\u201d Mr. Cruz answered. \u201cThat way you\u2019ll know the route I\u2019m taking.\u201d Mr. Cruz set off for the United States with a backpack carrying three changes of clothes, deodorant, cookies and a charger for the iPhone 5 that would be his connection and lifeline.His trip began with an idling pickup truck outside a mall in Soyapango, on the edge of San Salvador. The smuggler who would accompany him through El Salvador and Guatemala sat behind the wheel.MEX.GuatemalaCityHONDURASLa HachaduraGUATEMALASanSalvadorEL SALVADORPacific OceanIn the beginning, it was almost like being a tourist. Mr. Cruz crossed into Guatemala legally at La Hachadura, close to El Salvador\u2019s Pacific coast, with his national identity card. He even received a printed receipt.The driver left the pickup truck behind in El Salvador and chaperoned him by bus to the capital, Guatemala City. The two of them transferred buses and traveled a few hours further to Huehuetenango, in the western highlands, which serves as a jumping-off point for the Mexican border.They spent a night in a cheap hotel and traveled the next day to La Mesilla along the Mexican frontier. Vendors under colorful umbrellas sold drinks and snacks at the crossing. A blue sign wished travelers a \u201cfeliz viaje,\u201d or nice trip, above the gate separating the two countries.To skirt the border police outpost, the smuggler directed Mr. Cruz to a nearby industrial area where he walked alone up a gravel path and into Mexico. For the first time, he became an illegal immigrant.Mr. Cruz boarded a minibus, filled with local passengers, to begin his trip through the southern state of Chiapas. As instructed by the driver, at toll plazas he hunched down between the seats and covered himself with the passengers\u2019 backpacks, suitcases and packages. The driver whistled when it was safe to come out.He was vulnerable to criminals who might try to kidnap him, police officers seeking bribes and the more robust immigration enforcement that has taken root in recent years in southern Mexico. Under pressure from Washington, the Mexican government has cracked down on migrants passing through its territory. Because of the greater vigilance along the smuggling routes, between 80 and 95 percent of migrants bound for the United States used so-called coyotes in recent years, compared with fewer than half in the early 1970s, Border Patrol surveys of captured migrants found.Just two days into Mr. Cruz\u2019s journey, his family had to wire the smuggling network $1,900 to get him through southern Mexico.Mr. Cruz spent several days in a small house near Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, the capital of Chiapas, sleeping on a sofa. It was comfortable enough, but he wondered what the holdup was. \u201cThey want to move you even more than you do,\u201d his uncle assured him, \u201cbecause they have to pay for every day that you\u2019re there but I don\u2019t pay extra.\u201dWhen the smugglers finally continued the trip, Mr. Cruz spent a night on a hammock at an isolated spot near the Malpaso Dam, surrounded by trees. \u201cI was headed for Puebla yesterday, but immigration stopped two people who had gone ahead,\u201d he texted his uncle. \u201cSo they moved me here instead.\u201dThe next morning, Mr. Cruz climbed into the cab of a tractor-trailer and rode alongside the driver. At a toll area, he had his first run-in with the police. Officers stopped the truck for a routine check, and after seeing Mr. Cruz\u2019s Salvadoran ID, realized that he was in Mexico illegally. They demanded money or else they would deport him, Mr. Cruz said.Gulf ofMexicoPueblaPUEBLAVERACRUZMEXICOMalpaso DamOAXACATuxtla Guti\u00e9rrezHe fished out $170 he had hidden in his shoes. Mr. Cruz remembered one of the police officers telling him it was his lucky day. \u201cI was getting out of trouble. I was able to get away because I had this money on me,\u201d he said.The officers stole the truck driver\u2019s cash as well. Once they left, the driver threatened to hand the migrant over to violent drug traffickers unless Mr. Cruz got him $600. Panicked, Mr. Cruz called his aunt and uncle in the United States for help, but they didn\u2019t answer.Thousands of miles away, the couple emerged from a water park \u2014 a rare day off with their young daughter \u2014 to find the missed calls. They had been observing Mr. Cruz\u2019s progress on their smartphones and computers, watching him move northward through small towns, streets full of pastel houses and parking lots for Walmarts and Pemex gas stations.On the phone with his relatives, he described the police theft and the driver\u2019s threat. His uncle quickly turned to the Mexican woman at the smuggling network, who found another driver to carry Mr. Cruz to Puebla. The uncle asked Mr. Cruz to remain calm.\u201cStay calm, stay calm, everyone keeps saying that,\u201d Mr. Cruz responded in a Facebook message. \u201cKnowing I\u2019ve never been away from home. That I\u2019m easily frightened in a situation like this. And you want me to keep calm and keep calm. I can\u2019t.\u201dOn subsequent traffic stops, the bribe for the police was always the same: 1,500 Mexican pesos, or about $84. At first Mr. Cruz tried to lie, saying he wasn\u2019t a migrant but was on his way to Monterrey to make a delivery. Eventually he dropped any pretense. The fourth time he was stopped for a payoff, the cop simply said, \u201cYou already know how much this is.\u201dMr. Cruz made it as far as Puebla, southeast of Mexico City and a pivot point on the journey. His family wired $450 to the smugglers, including pocket money for Mr. Cruz for food and bribes.The woman he stayed with in Puebla treated him well, feeding him the local delicacy \u201cchiles en nogada,\u201d chiles in cream sauce with pomegranate seeds: green, white and red like the Mexican flag. She took him to buy soap, shampoo and toothpaste, but also got rid of his shoes \u2014 Bracos, a brand that the Mexican authorities would recognize as Salvadoran \u2014 and gave him another pair.After four days there the smugglers tried to move him north, but word came that some migrants had been killed near Monterrey, his next stop, so they brought him back to Puebla. After waiting three more days, Mr. Cruz hid with a young woman and her infant son in the sleeping compartment of a tractor-trailer for the overnight drive to Monterrey.The driver insisted they each take a pill, saying it was to keep them alert in case they were stopped. He then ground another pill into powder and mixed part of it in the baby\u2019s bottle before snorting the rest himself. Mr. Cruz said that he did not know what was in the pill but that after taking it he couldn\u2019t have slept even if he had tried.He arrived in Monterrey, the third-largest metropolitan area in Mexico and an industrial and commercial hub. Far from the booming downtown, behind a metal front gate, the windows and doors were shut and barred on the cinder-block house where Mr. Cruz was kept. Trash was everywhere. The small courtyard was filled with mud and debris. Ants and cockroaches crawled indoors. The only water ran brown and unfiltered from the faucet. A terrible smell wafted from the bathroom.U.S.TEXASMEXICOMcAllenMatamorosMonterrey\u201cIt was like a prison,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Migrants like Mr. Cruz had to pay their captors to bring them bottled water or snacks, if they even had the cash to pay prices that were triple those at the local convenience store. Otherwise food arrived only every other day, in the form of a carton of 30 eggs to feed the dozen or so people typically there. At night, Mr. Cruz said, he lay on a thin mat on the floor but couldn\u2019t sleep with mice and insects running over him.Every day smugglers dropped off and picked up migrants, who were kept locked inside. A Guatemalan man everyone called \u201cel due\u00f1o,\u201d \u201cthe owner,\u201d was in charge because he had been there the longest. He had run out of money to continue his journey a month and a half earlier.Mr. Cruz was stuck there for four days. His uncle sent $2,800, and they carried him onward to the eastern Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, just below southern Texas. His journey took him first to Ciudad Miguel Alem\u00e1n, across from Roma, Tex., before he boarded a bus for Matamoros, two and a half hours away, with the assumed name Carlos Hernandez on his ticket.Tamaulipas has become known for violent confrontations between organized crime groups, and migrants caught in the middle have been massacred. In the summer of 2010, the corpses of 72 migrants killed by cartel members were discovered there in San Fernando. The message was clear: Crossing into the United States without permission from the drug traffickers, or narcos, who controlled the border territory could be lethal.Rodolfo Casillas, an expert on illegal migration at the Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales in Mexico, estimated that up to $1,000 of the total smuggling price went to pay off the narcos for the \u201cderecho de paso,\u201d or right to pass. One migrant testifying in a human-smuggling case in Texas last year told the authorities that he had paid 11,000 pesos, or about $630, for protection from the Zetas criminal organization, and just 1,500 pesos for assistance with the river crossing.The house where Mr. Cruz was kept in Matamoros was better maintained than the hovel in Monterrey. He and the 30 other migrants could bathe with buckets of water from a pair of concrete basins with spigots outside. The men watching the house, tied to the narcos, brought them beers and even offered them drugs from bundles of cocaine and marijuana.\u201cIf you ran out of money, that\u2019s when they would offer to cross you as a mule,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Some migrants at the house agreed to ferry drugs.After sending off the migrants with drugs one day, the traffickers returned to the stash house seething. \u201cThey were extremely angry,\u201d Mr. Cruz recalled, not because the migrants had been arrested but because they had lost their shipment of drugs.Mr. Cruz was sick. The temperature along his journey had yo-yoed 40 degrees as the altitude climbed to 7,000 feet in Puebla before dropping to sea level in Matamoros. The unsanitary conditions in Monterrey probably hadn\u2019t helped.Mr. Cruz was eager to leave the house in Matamoros, but his coughing spasms gave the smugglers pause. They didn\u2019t want him giving their position away as a group tried to slip past Border Patrol agents.His uncle asked Mr. Cruz if the Mexican woman from the smuggling network could insist that they move him anyway. But Mr. Cruz realized she had little sway at the border. \u201cSomeone else decides who leaves,\u201d he told his uncle, \u201cand she pays them.\u201dHis family sent $180 to the smugglers, who said half would go toward medicine and half for a backup phone. Doses of cough syrup, along with several days of rest, seemed to help. That Saturday night Mr. Cruz wrote to his uncle, \u201cThey\u2019re going to say if I leave in the morning.\u201d Shortly after midnight he wrote again, saying, \u201cAt 4 o\u2019clock in the morning I go.\u201dThe region, where the Rio Grande coils and bends in switchbacks, has become the central battleground of the southwest frontier for illegal entries. Some 138,000 people were caught trying to cross here in 2017, close to half of all those apprehended from the California coast all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.For all the debate about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed wall, a virtual barrier was steadily strengthened under previous administrations. Doughy blimps equipped with cameras provide video surveillance, with thermal imaging for nighttime. Migrants unknowingly trip advanced seismic sensors with their first steps on American soil. The number of Border Patrol agents has grown to about 20,000 from roughly 9,000 in 2001, while budgets have quadrupled, spent on everything from all-terrain vehicles and horse patrols to helicopters and advanced reconnaissance drones.That gives the Border Patrol a much better chance of combating criminal smuggling networks, which use Facebook and Craigslist to recruit drivers, satellite phones and encrypted communication applications to direct them, night-vision technology to scan for patrols, and off-the shelf tracking devices to monitor moving vehicles.\u201cThey have evolved as the technology has evolved, and we have as well,\u201d said Benjamine Huffman, chief of strategic planning and analysis for the Border Patrol.Early that morning, the smugglers gathered Mr. Cruz, one of two dozen migrants from two stash houses in town, and crammed them into the back of an S.U.V., stacking them like cordwood. Wedged into a corner of the trunk with the weight of his fellow migrants crushing down on him, Mr. Cruz struggled to catch his breath.Once at the Rio Grande, he swam to the other side, while those who couldn\u2019t swim were pulled on the inner tubes. The migrants in his group began to mount the border fence. But the Border Patrol descended, grabbing some of the first arrivals. He realized he had to turn back.\u201cThere was no other alternative but to cross the river,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.As was customary, the smugglers would give him three tries to make it across safely. One chance was gone. Mr. Cruz steeled himself to try again at a different bend along the river.The temperature had climbed to 93 degrees by midday Sunday when Mr. Cruz made his second illegal visit to the United States, at another crossing nearby. It was even shorter than his first.Border Patrol agents swarmed the group as they made landfall on the north bank again. One agent got a hand on Mr. Cruz\u2019s back but, instead of arresting him, sent him sprawling into the river. Swallowing water and struggling to stay afloat, Mr. Cruz said, he barely managed to swim back to Mexico.The sun was low and dusk approaching by the time the coyotes brought the migrants to their third crossing point. The smugglers said the spot, more isolated, was usually reserved for moving drug shipments, more valuable than migrants. Mr. Cruz would have to swim across the Rio Grande for the fifth time that day.Of the 17 people left from the two dozen in the morning, Mr. Cruz recalled, five were women, including one who appeared about eight months pregnant and another in her 50s, he guessed. He wondered how they would make it, but his family had warned him: Worry about yourself. Do not stop for anyone.Mr. Cruz could hardly believe the determination of the pregnant woman as they emerged from the river again and started to run. But the older woman slipped behind and fell to the ground. The guide did nothing. \u201cHe just left her there,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.The driver of the waiting S.U.V. honked his horn to get their attention. He was angry, expecting just a few migrants to crawl out of the South Texas field and instead finding 16 people. In a region full of Border Patrol agents, it was a risky load to carry.The driver told Mr. Cruz to ride shotgun, and he saw bundles of cocaine on the passenger seat. But it was only a short drive to a parking lot where the smugglers separated the group into different cars, depending on their destinations. Mr. Cruz and five others got into a Cadillac headed an hour northwest to a stash house in McAllen, Tex.Drop-offs and pickups are often meticulously planned so that migrants are ready to jump in as soon as the car pulls up. Smugglers sometimes mark migrants with colored tape to quickly sort who is going where. Smugglers often drive two cars, using one to draw the attention of law enforcement and another to carry the migrants.At the stash house in McAllen, the caretakers took away phones and even migrants\u2019 shoes so they wouldn\u2019t run away. \u201cOne particular person, they beat him up and kicked him because he wasn\u2019t paying attention,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.He estimated there were 70 people inside. They were given no food and were not allowed to speak to one another or even move without permission. Neighbors in border regions can be quick to report suspected stash houses. More than a third of all those busted by Customs and Border Protection last year \u2014 140 out of 407 in the Southwest \u2014 were in the Rio Grande Valley, where Mr. Cruz was.After just a day and a half in McAllen, Mr. Cruz huddled with four other migrants in the sleeping compartment of a tractor-trailer headed to San Antonio. They were nearly discovered by agents during a routine search at a highway checkpoint, cowering under blankets as they felt someone check the bedding they were hiding under. Mr. Cruz was transferred to a minivan with a concealed compartment built under the back seat, where he hid for part of the ride.Mr. Cruz was brought to one last stash house, stripped to just his boxer shorts in a room \u201cwith no electricity, no light coming through, no windows and one big bed with four men,\u201d as he described it, essentially a hostage until the final payments were made. Two days passed.Even with the precautions, one of the payments was flagged, canceled and had to be re-sent to a different recipient. Only when the final installment arrived in Mexico could Mr. Cruz go. \u201cThey gave me my clothes to put back on, and they blindfolded me again,\u201d he said.The smugglers drove him to a gas station. There he saw the familiar face of his uncle. Mr. Cruz began to cry.Relief at finishing his journey did not last long. Mr. Cruz was now in an unfamiliar country, where he did not speak the language and could not legally hold a job. He would have to hide in plain sight. He was $12,630 in debt. But, he said, at least he didn\u2019t fear for his life. \u201cHere I know I\u2019m safe,\u201d he said.His uncle found him tougher and more mature after the journey\u2019s hardships. Mr. Cruz looked ahead to earning enough money to begin the cycle again, paying for his son, his sister and his grandmother to join him in the United States. \u201cI dream of bringing them over here,\u201d he said.June 26, 2018June 24, 2018June 12, 2018Feb. 5, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is There a Smarter Path to Artificial Intelligence? Some Experts Hope So", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past five years, the hottest thing in artificial intelligence has been a branch known as deep learning. The grandly named statistical technique, put simply, gives computers a way to learn by processing vast amounts of data. Thanks to deep learning, computers can easily identify faces and recognize spoken words, making other forms of humanlike intelligence suddenly seem within reach.Companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft have poured money into deep learning. Start-ups pursuing everything from cancer cures to back-office automation trumpet their deep learning expertise. And the technology\u2019s perception and pattern-matching abilities are being applied to improve progress in fields such as drug discovery and self-driving cars.But now some scientists are asking whether deep learning is really so deep after all.In recent conversations, online comments and a few lengthy essays, a growing number of A.I. experts are warning that the infatuation with deep learning may well breed myopia and overinvestment now \u2014 and disillusionment later.The danger, some experts warn, is that A.I. will run into a technical wall and eventually face a popular backlash \u2014 a familiar pattern in artificial intelligence since that term was coined in the 1950s. With deep learning in particular, researchers said, the concerns are being fueled by the technology\u2019s limits.Deep learning algorithms train on a batch of related data \u2014 like pictures of human faces \u2014 and are then fed more and more data, which steadily improve the software\u2019s pattern-matching accuracy. Although the technique has spawned successes, the results are largely confined to fields where those huge data sets are available and the tasks are well defined, like labeling images or translating speech to text.The technology struggles in the more open terrains of intelligence \u2014 that is, meaning, reasoning and common-sense knowledge. While deep learning software can instantly identify millions of words, it has no understanding of a concept like \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201cdemocracy\u201d or \u201cmeddling.\u201dResearchers have shown that deep learning can be easily fooled. Scramble a relative handful of pixels, and the technology can mistake a turtle for a rifle or a parking sign for a refrigerator.While that program and other efforts vary, their common goal is a broader and more flexible intelligence than deep learning. And they are typically far less data hungry. They often use deep learning as one ingredient among others in their recipe.Kyndi has been able to use very little training data to automate the generation of facts, concepts and inferences, said Ryan Welsh, the start-up\u2019s chief executive.The Kyndi system, he said, can train on 10 to 30 scientific documents of 10 to 50 pages each. Once trained, Kyndi\u2019s software can identify concepts and not just words.In work for three large government agencies that it declined to disclose, Kyndi has been asking its system to answer this typical question: Has a technology been \u201cdemonstrated in a laboratory setting\u201d? The Kyndi program, Mr. Welsh said, can accurately infer the answer, even when that phrase does not appear in a document.And Kyndi\u2019s reading and scoring software is fast. A human analyst, Mr. Welsh said, might take two hours on average to read a lengthy scientific document, and perhaps read 1,000 in a year. Kyndi\u2019s technology can read those 1,000 documents in seven hours, he said.Kyndi serves as a tireless digital assistant, identifying the documents and passages that require human judgment. \u201cThe goal is increasing the productivity of the human analysts,\u201d Mr. Welsh said.Kyndi and others are betting that the time is finally right to take on some of the more daunting challenges in A.I. That echoes the trajectory of deep learning, which made little progress for decades before the recent explosion of digital data and ever-faster computers fueled leaps in performance of its so-called neural networks. Those networks are digital layers loosely analogous to biological neurons. The \u201cdeep\u201d refers to many layers.Vicarious, whose investors include Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, is a prominent example of the entrepreneurial pursuit of new paths in A.I.The Pentagon\u2019s research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, has proposed a program to seed university research and provide a noncommercial network for sharing ideas on technology to emulate human common-sense reasoning, where deep learning falls short. If approved, the program, Machine Common Sense, would start this fall and most likely run for five years, with total funding of about $60 million.Advertisement"}

Dozens of faces lined my bedroom wall \u2014 boys modeling expensive clothes, young lesbian couples, big, shirtless men leering at the camera \u2014 declared by XY Magazine to be \u201cThe Future of Young Gay America.\u201dThey were all white. Every morning I\u2019d wake to see them, a reminder of the mythical gay adulthood that awaited after high school, after Detroit, far away from there.Now, over a decade later, I\u2019m an editor on The Times\u2019s digital transition team. My job involves thinking about the future of our publication: How can our journalism better serve \u2014 and reflect \u2014 a younger, more diverse and digitally savvy audience? With this mandate, I felt emboldened to pitch a visuals-heavy piece for The Times\u2019s Pride special section.The project began with a question: Why do I, like so many of my friends, consider finding a partner, someone who looks like us, such an impossible task? I can\u2019t think of a single high-profile example of a loving relationship between two queer black people. I\u2019ve had countless conversations since high school with peers about how this dearth of representation has affected us. (Many people on Twitter have pointed me to Omar Little of \u201cThe Wire\u201d and his three boyfriends, but fictional characters on an HBO crime series weren\u2019t quite what I had in mind when I wrote that sentence.)So I took the question to Facebook. I didn\u2019t think much of the post; just a few words I typed before going for a jog: \u201cAre there any gay/queer black/Latinx couples who\u2019re down to be photographed? I grew up never seeing representations of queer black/brown love and this is my first step in trying to change that.\u201dWhen meeting the couples, I heard a refrain of resentment toward \u201cthe media.\u201d Hassan Williams, one of my subjects, was generally gregarious, but when asked about representation, became quiet and lost in thought before saying, \u201cThe media will have you believe that it\u2019s literally impossible to see two queer black folks in love.\u201dSeeing the response to the piece was surreal. I heard from parents of queer children, elder members of the L.G.B.T. community, even straight people who saw their love in ours. One parent told me that she felt inspired to take her daughter to a Pride parade after seeing the story online. Another told me that she sought out a print copy of The Times to give to her son, fresh out of the closet, as inspiration. I heard from one man in his 70s who said he wished he could\u2019ve seen these images growing up.It also served as a personal reminder of the importance of telling these kinds of stories. When I saw the first hard copy of the story \u2014 my words printed on a full page of New York Times broadsheet \u2014 I imagined younger Jamal, one of the last avid customers of my local Barnes & Noble, tracking down the issue, buying multiple copies and tacking one on his wall and one in his locker; smiling people, who looked like him, in love, a stark contrast to anything else he\u2019d ever seen.Advertisement"}

Maybe it was Grandma\u2019s recipe, or a life-changing trip to Vietnam.Ms. Masoni is not a trained chef, a food scientist or even a typical food fanatic, though she can master most recipes and identify rancid ingredients with a single sniff. Remarkably, it comes without a million-dollar attitude.

Now she works as the \u201cwizard of Oz behind the curtain,\u201d as she put it, for paying companies large and small.The Food Innovation Center, a multidisciplinary partnership with the Oregon Department of Agriculture, is one of several similar extension programs at universities like Rutgers and Louisiana State. With Ms. Masoni\u2019s help, Oregon\u2019s is extremely successful, luring not just food makers and farmers from the Northwest, but also international conglomerates that keep their work there hush-hush. While every client pays the same hourly rate set by the university, Ms. Masoni gives smaller producers a lot for little money through one-hour consulting sessions. They leave with \u201ca huge list\u201d of resources and to-dos, she said, and a request to report back once those have been completed. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the center \u2014 just across the street from the Willamette River, in this city\u2019s booming Pearl District \u2014 is in the heart of one the country\u2019s most innovative food cities, where word of Ms. Masoni\u2019s skills has spread by word of mouth.You won\u2019t find her name on the package of any product, Ms. Masoni said, but she is fine with that. \u201cIt\u2019s really my job to help people make their dreams come true.\u201dWhat was most impressive, Ms. Malek said, is that Ms. Masoni could go directly from blue-sky brainstorming \u2014 \u201cthis is the spirit of flavors and what we want to be about\u201d \u2014 to pitch-perfect recipes for ice creams that have become nationally known.\u201cShe\u2019s an evil genius,\u201d Ms. Malek said. \u201cIn a good way.\u201dHer Proustian-madeleine moments reveal that food production was probably her path from the start: She recalls watching an episode of the 1960s sitcom \u201cThat Girl\u201d when she was about 5; a penniless Marlo Thomas made tomato soup at the Automat using only packets of ketchup and hot water. (\u201cI was like, \u2018Woah, that is so cool!\u2019\u201d)As an undergraduate, Ms. Masoni minored in food science, but her major was art. That has served her well. \u201cI look at food ingredients as colors,\u201d she said. \u201cI know the flavors of things and the textures, and I can just sort of pull it together. Half the time, I don\u2019t even know how I know.\u201dWhat she doesn\u2019t know, others at the center likely do: Her colleagues include professors with expertise in food packaging or toxicology; a sensory-science team that conducts blind consumer product testing; and international trade managers who travel the world on behalf of the Oregon agriculture department.It\u2019s perhaps easier to be honest as an outsider, one of the advantages of working with many companies rather than running your own. \u201cOh, my god,\u201d Ms. Masoni recalled thinking, \u201cthis is way too much responsibility.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the university where Sarah Masoni's father, Edmund Zottola, was a professor of food science. It was the University of Minnesota, not St. Paul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Disgusted\u2019 by Video of Fatal Stabbing of Teen, Callers Flood Police Tip Line", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySunday marked two days since the police first asked for help finding the men shown on video last week dragging a 15-year-old boy out of a Bronx bodega and stabbing him to death in a gruesome attack that may have been a case of mistaken identity.Since then, police investigators have been overwhelmed by a \u201ctorrent of tips\u201d aimed at identifying Lesandro Guzman\u2013Feliz\u2019s attackers, the chief of detectives, Dermot F. Shea, said on Sunday.\u201cThere\u2019s just a tremendous outpouring and I think that people are disgusted by what they saw,\u201d Chief Shea said. Hours later, the police announced the arrest of a suspect, Kevin J. Alvarez, 19, of the Bronx, on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter, gang assault and assault. Officials did not specify his role in the attack and said they had mistakenly reported more arrests.The Police Department said in a statement that it was \u201cvigorously investigating\u201d Lesandro\u2019s killing, and expected to make additional arrests.Social media users speculated that Lesandro had been mistaken for another teenager who shared video of himself having sex with one of the suspects\u2019 female relatives. Chief Shea, in an interview, would not discuss potential motives for the killing, but he said there was no information to indicate that Lesandro, who wanted to be a police detective, was \u201canything but an innocent kid.\u201dNews of the arrests drew cheers from social media users, who praised the police and asked for stiff penalties for the suspects.After video of the attack began circulating on social media, there were so many calls to the Police Department\u2019s 1-800-577-TIPS hotline that supervisors assigned extra staff members to answer the phones. Many more tips flowed in from social media, where police officials\u2019 posts have been viewed and shared more than 100,000 times on Twitter and Instagram, according to police metrics.The tips identified several suspects by name and included their addresses, photos, hangout locations and gang affiliation.The response highlighted the combined power of social media and video to help the police solve crimes, especially in places where many people are afraid to be seen talking to detectives for fear of reprisals by violent street crews and gangs.Too often after crimes occur, the police discover that it is difficult to get much help in solving them. Tips trickle instead of pour, if they come at all, and detectives find their door-to-door efforts bear little fruit because people sometimes fear being seen talking to law enforcement.But where detectives might have encountered a closed door before, social media has given them nearly unbridled access to discreet tipsters and outraged sleuths. Lesandro\u2019s case showed officials were just beginning to harness its potential, Chief Shea said.\u201cBeyond this case, I think we\u2019re scratching the surface of what we can achieve and how we can interact,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to, nor do I want to, replace the face-to-face. But in terms of getting tips, this is going to be a game-changer.\u201dAs his attackers fled in a light-colored sedan, Lesandro, who was known as \u201cJunior,\u201d ran in the direction of St. Barnabas Hospital a block away but collapsed on the pavement as blood ran from his neck. Soon, video of the incident began circulating on social media under the hashtag #JusticeforJunior, and the police appealed for help identifying six men believed to be Lesandro\u2019s attackers.Several social media users blamed the killing on the Trinitarios, a violent Dominican gang based in New York. Chief Shea said that was a \u201cstrong possibility.\u201dRamon Paulino, 21, was arrested in connection with the earlier stabbing and charged with attempted murder and gang assault.Video has proved pivotal in helping the police solve a number of cases. But as in the police chokehold death of an unarmed Staten Island man named Eric Garner in 2014, it has also raised questions about their practices.The police in New York have long used social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to track criminal activity and gangs. But Chief Shea said Lesandro\u2019s case highlighted for officials the potential reward of engaging with communities on social media beyond collecting tips.\u201cI think the world is going to get very small for some of these gangs in the near future,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think social media is going to be a big part of it.\u201dLesandro lived in a two-bedroom apartment in the Belmont neighborhood with his mother, Leandra Feliz, 48, and sister, Genesis, 17. In the living room on Sunday, his mother showed photos of him celebrating his 15th birthday and graduating from kindergarten. In one widely circulated image, he is wearing a jacket for the police Explorers, a program he participated in that caters to youth who are interested in law enforcement.\u201cHis dream was to be a detective,\u201d Ms. Feliz said. \u201cSince he was 5 years old, he used to love to play with the police toy cars and always said he wanted to be a detective.\u201dMs. Feliz said she was pleased that people were trying to help the police solve her son\u2019s killing.The last time she saw him alive, he had been playing a game of Fortnite on his PlayStation before telling her that he was going downstairs to lend $5 to a friend. When he took too long to come back, she called and told him, \u201cMijo\u201d\u2014 Spanish for \u201cmy son\u201d \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re taking too long. Come back.\u201dHe never did.\u201cI feel destroyed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took away my life.\u201dA block away from the family apartment, near the Cruz and Chiky bodega on the corner of East 183rd Street and Bathgate Avenue where Lesandro was mortally wounded, hundreds of candles lined the ground, heating an already warm afternoon. Dozens of neighbors showed up to pay their respects, light candles and console each other. Mourners wrote messages on several pieces of cardboard hung on the store\u2019s brick wall.\u201cA beautiful soul is never forgotten,\u201d read one message. Another, written in Spanish, translated to: \u201cHow could they take away your smile, your happiness? You were a respectful, caring boy. We\u2019ll miss you forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nan Goldin Survived an Overdose to Fight the Opioid Epidemic", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe photographer is known for her gritty images of New York City life. Now she\u2019s become a leading activist in the struggle against addiction.ON A RECENT April morning, the artist Nan Goldin and around 100 protesters entered the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Arthur M. Sackler Gallery on the south side of the National Mall in Washington. The Sackler Gallery is a squat, geometric building that unspools into a subterranean museum beneath one of the Smithsonian\u2019s public gardens. Its founding collection of some 1,000 works of Near Eastern, Asian, and Southeast Asian art was donated along with $4 million in 1982 by a physician, Arthur M. Sackler, whose name is carved on the building\u2019s exterior gray granite walls. Goldin and the group marched past an exhibition called \u201cEncountering the Buddha\u201d and positioned themselves along the atrium\u2019s staircase and around a shallow fountain that sits at the bottom of the building. A lacquer wood sculpture called \u201cMonkeys Grasping the Moon\u201d by the Chinese artist Xu Bing dangled above, 72 feet long. The few visitors already present that morning observed the proceedings with curiosity. A tense hush had spread through the cool and dark gallery, which Goldin shattered, leading the group in a gravel-voiced chant: \u201cArthur\u2019s skills was marketing pills! Pills for profit! Addiction equals profit!\u201d When she finished, the gallery fell silent. Suddenly, everyone pulled oversize prescription pill bottles labeled as OxyContin, MS Contin and Valium from their bags and threw them across the floor, down the stairs, and into the fountain \u2014 the sound of their falling like rain on a roof. Goldin and the protesters around her briefly staged a \u201cdie-in,\u201d lying down on the stone floor. Then they assembled outside, placing more bottles atop a pink granite marker also bearing Arthur M. Sackler\u2019s name. Goldin spoke about the opioid crisis. Then she called out the people she believes are largely responsible for it: the Sacklers. It is rare these days to see a lone artist like Goldin \u2014 especially one both critically and commercially successful, whose work is in dozens of important museum collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art \u2014 step into the ring as an activist. By giving her name to this cause, Goldin has helped legitimize it and has become a figurehead for a group of people \u2014 those all too often dismissed as addicts \u2014 who have largely been treated as invisible. The fight against the opioid crisis is not one that draws easy sympathy. There are no breathtaking photographs of glaciers melting into the Arctic Ocean to pull at your heartstrings, and there aren\u2019t any fresh-faced high school students on CNN demanding better gun laws. Opioids are perceived as an embarrassing blight in already depressed areas of the country, and addiction is largely seen as a metaphor for weakness, a failure of the will. The movement\u2019s numbers are haunted by the ghosts of the most ordinary of people \u2014 an injured high school football player, an unemployed single mother, a former heroin addict. Which makes Goldin\u2019s story, and her involvement, all the more crucial. IF GOLDIN IS best known for romanticizing underground subcultures, there has long been a political subtext to her work. Her early photographs of drag queens were presciently unconcerned with gender. Her documentation of her own sexual abuse is profound, most notably in \u201cNan one month after being battered\u201d (1984). It is a deeply uncomfortable image: Goldin\u2019s left eye is still bloodshot, her face still bruised. The image is alarming, but most markedly, it is without shame. Because of the AIDS crisis, \u201cThe Ballad\u201d is also, however accidentally, a relic of a lost age. It serves as a hypothetical fork in the road, a bacchanalian path onto which the culture could have turned had AIDS never arrived.One of the show\u2019s catalog essays, called \u201cPost Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell,\u201d was written by the artist David Wojnarowicz, who would also die of AIDS-related complications in 1992. The piece provides the clearest bridge to Goldin\u2019s current work, summarizing the tragedy of a country\u2019s indifference to a generation left to die. \u201cMy rage,\u201d Wojnarowicz wrote, \u201cis really about the fact that when I was told that I\u2019d contracted this virus it didn\u2019t take me long to realize that I\u2019d contracted a diseased society as well.\u201dI MET GOLDIN again two weeks after the Smithsonian protest in her Brooklyn studio overlooking the East River. She greeted me from a brown velvet couch that looked as if it were an artifact from her Bowery apartment and studio of 38 years. (The novelist and essayist Darryl Pinckney once wrote of it: \u201cNan\u2019s Bowery loft had no windows or else they were covered and this made her parties long, hilarious, dangerous events. You had no idea what time it was or how light the sky was getting out there.\u201d) She moved in 2014. Petite, with cropped red curly hair, and dressed in black, Goldin was smoking a cigarette and drinking a ginger beer. An eclectic assortment of books were stacked on a shelf nearby: \u201cA Concise History of Posters,\u201d \u201cBorderline Personality Disorder: A Clinical Guide,\u201d monographs on Eva Hesse, John Kelly, and Joseph Cornell. Three skateboards from a recent collaboration with Supreme were still wrapped in plastic, leaning against a box.In the last few years, Goldin has been painting and drawing in addition to taking photographs. When she does take pictures, she uses a Fuji 6x7 camera, but she also takes a lot with her iPhone. \u201cEveryone is a photographer who takes a picture,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the most accessible medium in the world.\u201d She showed me a selection of paintings she made while sober. There is a surreal quality to them, an artful gentleness to the lines and colors that resembles that of her photographs. In a self-portrait from February, the canvas has been scratched so that the lips appear sewn shut \u2014 an echo of Wojnarowicz\u2019s iconic image from Rosa von Praunheim\u2019s 1990 documentary \u201cSilence = Death.\u201d \u201cI was alone for a while over New Year\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone for a few days,\u201d Goldin explained. In \u201cCleopatra Masturbating,\u201d a nude Cleopatra touched herself while a snake bit her left nipple, which bleeds. In the background are cats and dogs.Goldin asked if I ever tried an opioid. I told her that in college, I took OxyContin once; it made me feel sick. She nodded. I asked her what opioids felt like for her. \u201cThey make everything all right. They\u2019re like a padding between you and the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s this round warmth that\u2019s covering you.\u201d She looked away. \u201cEverything is bearable suddenly.\u201dThe drawings she made while high are shakier, and also, she said, more automatic, as if being high made it more easy to access the part of herself that her more conscious mind couldn\u2019t touch. \u201cAn Unknown Species With Unknown Substances\u201d depicts a four-legged creature smoking a cigarette surrounded by prescription bottles. (\u201cOxyContin?\u201d I asked. \u201cUnknown substances,\u201d she responded.) Despite the misery they were borne out of, the drawings were both bizarre and amusing.Two of Goldin\u2019s photographs were exhibited at the Matthew Marks Gallery booth at the Frieze art fair in May. I asked her if she felt that her critique of the source of cultural donations made her feel a responsibility to manage who buys her own work. Wasn\u2019t it possible that someone who profits from Purdue Pharma \u2014 or from any other variety of human misery \u2014 could buy one of her photographs? There are artists today who refuse to sell their work to the Zabludowicz family, whose wealth has historical roots in arms dealing. After the election of Donald J. Trump, Richard Prince disavowed one of his artworks depicting a screen grab from Ivanka Trump\u2019s Instagram feed and returned the $36,000 payment he received for it. Goldin deflected the question: \u201cSomebody said when I started this, they\u2019re going to deaccession you [at the Met], but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to.\u201d She shrugged. At first, this struck me as an unsatisfactory answer. The Sacklers\u2019 support of the arts is still a net good \u2014 their money has supported generations of artists over the decades, including, arguably Goldin. Goldin doesn\u2019t deny this: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking museums to give back money. We\u2019re asking them to refuse future donations. And to make statements.\u201d The firmness of her stance on the matter made me realize that the only responsibility an artist like Goldin has is to her own work. The same can\u2019t be said for the Sacklers.Goldin was pleased with how the Washington protest went, but her anger at Purdue Pharma was palpable. \u201cSupposedly, the brain can\u2019t tell the difference between emotional pain and physical pain,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are deeply connected, and Purdue has preyed on both.\u201d She indicates that she was afraid of being targeted by the Sacklers. The day before the Smithsonian protest, she attended the screening of a documentary by Madeleine Sackler, whose father Jonathan is on the Purdue board of directors. Goldin was escorted out of the screening by security. \u201cThey call me out by name,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are big people with a lot of power.\u201d\u201cI lost everybody who carried my history,\u201d she said, not really speaking to me anymore, but to the space in front of her. \u201cWe were supposed to grow old together. There is no one for me to even talk to about those years.\u201dI thought of her friends I\u2019ve seen in her pictures: Mueller, her husband Scarpati, Wojnarowicz. \u201cIt was like the plague,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bubonic plague.\u201dAs Goldin spoke about P.A.I.N., she suddenly changed, grew steely and distant. She began to talk about how she wants to put pictures on bus shelters of people who have recovered from opioid addiction \u2014 to \u201cbreak through the shame,\u201d she said. There was a protest she wanted to attend in front of the federal courthouse in Cleveland later that week, where hundreds of lawsuits by United States cities and counties against Purdue and other opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers have been consolidated. Many of the protesters would like to see the potential settlement money go directly back into treatment. Goldin has been making a film about P.A.I.N. that includes visiting clinics in rural areas of the country. She threw out some statistics on overdoses, and how fentanyl can be found these days not just in heroin, but in cocaine as well. I got the distinct sense that all of this \u2014 the work of turning the personal political \u2014 had also helped make the world a little more bearable for Goldin, too.One of the story lines in \u201cThe Deuce\u201d follows Vincent Martino, an entrepreneurial working-class man played by James Franco who ends up running a bar called the High Hat, which is directly modeled after Tin Pan Alley. The bar was a watering hole for artists, prostitutes, pimps, drunks and whoever else might have walked in that night. For this particular episode, the High Hat\u2019s walls were hung with a small selection from \u201cThe Ballad.\u201d In the scene, Goldin, as a patron, regarded them, including one of herself called \u201cBuzz and Nan at the Afterhours, New York City\u201d (1980). Franco stood beside her. They were strangers to each other, yet they enacted that inexplicable moment that happens in art viewing, where a sense of familiarity can grow between two people and compel them to speak. (Goldin: \u201cThey call that art? I coulda done that.\u201d) In the photograph, Buzz, a pimp, leans toward Goldin, who is wearing a madras dress and pearls. There is a reluctant intimacy between the two. The black leather of the booth behind them is imposing, and the glasses on the table imply a night that has already passed into the next day.There is an obvious nostalgia for the late \u201970s in a show like \u201cThe Deuce.\u201d By the end of the \u201980s, the party was over. The city had ceded its bohemianism to its newfound wealth as the toll of the AIDS epidemic climbed higher and higher. Goldin will always be remembered for that period because of her work about it, but also because she survived it. Perhaps now she will be seen as standing for something else \u2014 for epitomizing the opioid crisis, for sticking up for those too poor or too weak to fight a shadowy corporation for themselves. As she put it earlier: \u201cI can\u2019t stand by and watch another generation disappear.\u201d Advertisement"}

Each technology goes through a cycle of development and weaponization, followed only later by the formulation of doctrine and occasionally by efforts to control the weapon\u2019s use. The newest technological means of mayhem are cyber, meaning anything involving the electronic transmission of ones and zeros. The development of cyber capabilities has been rapid and is continuing; doctrine is largely yet to be written; and ideas about control are only beginning to emerge.A common trait of books (including this one) that seek to sound an alarm about a growing threat is overstating what the authors see as inattention, especially official inattention. Even the most well-connected journalist cannot be expected to know everything that national security bureaucracies are worrying about. And whatever may have been cybersecurity\u2019s status in the public consciousness a few years ago, it has since graduated to being a trendy topic, with a plethora of university programs catering to those wanting to enter the field.The paucity of strategy and doctrine on cyberwarfare is less a product of inattention than of the still-early stage of this latest technology of destruction. The lack of doctrine and especially the lack of consensus on controlling destructive use of cyber tools also reflect the trade-offs and complexities that Sanger\u2019s book lays out well. Chief among these is a reluctance to forgo, in the name of defense and security, methods that could be useful offensively, especially when their use occupies a gray area between peace and war. American officials may see implants in someone else\u2019s computer networks as a prudent step given the possibility of war, even though when the same kind of implants have been discovered in United States systems, Sanger notes, \u201cthe U.S. was outraged \u2014 understandably \u2014 and assumed the worst.\u201dAnother complication concerns the role of the private sector, as not just a developer and supplier of the technology but as an operator. Corporate America once believed that what was good for General Motors was good for the country, and vice versa. Today Silicon Valley \u2014 burned by leaks about past cooperation with government agencies that have raised users\u2019 concerns about privacy \u2014 doesn\u2019t see things that way.Sanger displays a journalist\u2019s bias against secrecy and repeatedly blames what he calls the intelligence agencies\u2019 \u201cparanoia about protecting sources and methods\u201d for an insufficient public discussion of cybersecurity, which he sees in turn as the prime reason for insufficient strategy and doctrine. But showing more leg while risking those sources and methods would not improve public understanding of the core issues involved.And there are other valid reasons not to reveal everything Washington knows about other governments\u2019 cyber activities. Sanger criticizes Barack Obama for not making more of a public case about Russia\u2019s election interference but does not explain how Obama could have done so without appearing to interfere in the election himself. Today, making public whatever the United States knows about North Korea\u2019s cyber mischief would not improve the chances for success in the already dicey nuclear diplomacy with Pyongyang.The great value of \u201cThe Perfect Weapon\u201d is less in its specific policy prescriptions than in its being the most comprehensive, readable source of information and insight about the policy quandaries that modern information technology and its destructive potential have spawned.Paul R.

{"Headline": "Do You Know What Lightning Really Looks Like?", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaintings by artists over centuries have consistently underestimated the number of root-like veins in a lightning strike, researchers found.Here are paintings that incorporate lightning made by artists at various points through history. Which do you think looks most accurate? Below is a photograph, which comes closer to capturing lightning in reality.Notice the difference between the imagined and actual renderings: There aren\u2019t enough veins of electricity in the paintings. Their research points to how cultural legacies can distort our perceptions of natural phenomena, even those that we encounter with our own eyes. Using a computer program, G\u00e1bor Horv\u00e1th, head of the environmental optics laboratory at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest, and his colleagues examined 100 paintings and 400 photographs of lightning. They found the pictures and paintings differed mainly in the number of root-like offshoots, which occur when charged particles try to carve the path of least resistance through air. While painted lightning strikes had 11 arms at most, photographs showed lightning splitting into as many as 51 fingers. Actual numbers could be even higher, the authors noted, because some tendrils may be too dim for cameras to register.In a follow-up experiment, the researchers asked ten people to rapidly evaluate 1,800 photos each. They found that participants could accurately gauge up to 11 lightning branches. As the number of branches increased, people strongly underestimated the number of branches, with an exponentially growing gap between actual and perceived figures. Simplified, zigzag images of lightning are also culturally ingrained (think of the lightning emoji or the common symbol for electricity). The imagery originated with ancient Greek and Roman depictions of Jupiter\u2019s and Zeus\u2019s thunderbolts, Dr. Horv\u00e1th said.The new work fits into a long history of scientists drawing a boundary between artistic and photographic representations of lightning \u2014 and an even longer history of scientists and artists pitting their fields against one another, said Jennifer Tucker, a history professor at Wesleyan University who was not involved in the study.In the mid-19th century, meteorology was a new discipline, and its practitioners struggled to move people\u2019s understanding of weather away from superstition and folklore. \u201cThey wanted to replace what they derisively called \u2018weather fallacies\u2019 with \u2018weather truths\u2019 or \u2018facts,\u2019\u201d Dr. Tucker said. Among such myths was the idea that thunderbolts were material objects that fell from the sky. Meteorologists embraced this new medium as a more objective way to catalog the sky. They exhibited lightning pictures at scientific meetings and shared standardized methods for photographing lightning. At the same time, they blamed landscape artists for \u201cspreading false rumors\u201d about weather phenomena, Dr. Tucker said. While Dr. Horv\u00e1th sees value in debunking \u201cthe scientific errors of well-known artworks,\u201d not everyone believes art always needs to be scientifically accurate. Lorraine Daston, director of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, said that scientific accuracy and artistic goals of \u201cwhat a painting should do\u201d are moving targets.

{"Headline": "Reaching Out to Younger Hearts and Minds About L.G.B.T.Q. People", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The author M.G. Hennessey remembers the moment a few years ago, after reading a book with a disappointed 9-year-old. \u201cHe wished there was a book about a kid like him,\u201d she said.The child was transgender, and although born female was living as a boy.Ms. Hennessey decided she would write the book the child needed. \u201cThe Other Boy,\u201d published by HarperCollins for young readers, follows the life of Shane, a fictional transgender boy. Ms. Hennessey, who is heterosexual, hoped the book would enlighten children to be accepting of others.\u201cThe more you see representations in the media, the more familiar it becomes,\u201d Ms. Hennessey said.\u201cThe Other Boy\u201d is part of a new battleground for rights for people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer. As the L.G.B.T.Q. community has gained greater acceptance in America, some advocates now see an opportunity to prevent bigotry from taking root by reaching out to the youngest hearts and minds.The fight is being waged in state legislatures and schools, but perhaps the most visible efforts are in the media, building on the \u201cWill & Grace\u201d effect, an acknowledgment that the TV sitcom has helped normalize L.G.B.T.Q. people as part of the nation\u2019s fabric.Bringing gay-friendly messages to young children has faced opposition, and L.G.B.T.Q. advocates admit that gains have been tough to achieve in the current political climate.At a glance, however, some recent L.G.B.T.Q. content for children has had such a high profile that one might think the rainbow flag had replaced the Stars and Stripes.Though introduced on a satirical adult show, the book was written with young readers in mind. To date, 800,000 copies have been published.Natalie Ponte of Weston, Conn., read the book to her 4-year-old son, Milo, and wrote on Facebook that the experience was transformative.\u201cWe are pretty open and progressive and this kid still had reservations at the beginning about two boy bunnies getting married,\u201d Ms. Ponte wrote. \u201cAfter reading this book twice he was ready to run for office on a gay rights platform.\u201dOther recent mainstream media efforts have reached huge audiences of children and families.And critics have pointed out that Mr. Calrissian\u2019s sexuality is not exhibited on screen, unless you count a flirtatious moment when he refers to Han Solo as \u201cadorable.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been called a tool of the gay agenda,\u201d Ms. Harris said in an interview. But she said that children had questions, and that her book answered them. \u201cIf it\u2019s in the best interest of the child, I\u2019m going to put it in there.\u201dTeri Topham, a French teacher at a local charter school whose own children attended the Fremont public schools, opposed the proposed curriculum as not age appropriate. She said the teachings conflicted with her Mormon beliefs, and she noted that the city has large Muslim and South Asian communities, some with conservative traditions.\u201cThe public school system has to err on the side of caution,\u201d Ms. Topham said in an interview.The decision troubled Sameer Jha, 16, a Fremont resident who self-describes as \u201cqueer, still figuring it out, a gender flux.\u201dSameer said there was no mention of L.G.B.T.Q. people in fourth grade before. \u201cAll I knew was that it was a bad thing,\u201d Sameer said. Having since transferred to a \u201cmore inclusive\u201d private school in Oakland, Sameer has become a public activist, helped Gay-Straight Alliance organizations and raised funds to buy L.G.B.T.Q. books for libraries.\u201cRepresentation is important,\u201d Sameer said.\u201cWe have been responding to more fires than I have ever seen in K through 12,\u201d said Johanna Eager, an organization director. She said that since the election of President Trump, she had heard of \u201csome of the most horrible hateful situations in schools that I have not experienced in the past almost 30 years.\u201dMs. Eager said that teacher training was needed, but that she also recognized the power of storytelling.\u201cIf you really hear a compelling story about someone suffering as an L.G.B.T.Q. person,\u201d she said, \u201cthat can change someone\u2019s heart or mind quickly.\u201dEven after the defeat in Fremont, Sameer saw opportunity. \u201cWe\u2019ve made waves,\u201d Sameer said. \u201cIt\u2019s being talked about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On paper, the Red Devils, as the national team is known, is packed with stars and could be this year\u2019s champions. But few in Belgium have faith they will win. They expect matches against tougher opponents to lead to disappointment \u2014 and they would cope just fine with it. Still, crowds gathered in front of large screens in bars and squares cheering Belgium\u2019s easy victories over Panama and Tunisia. Fans started appearing in red plastic devil horns and flying the country\u2019s black, yellow and red flag from cars and windows, albeit sometimes the wrong way (the black panel should be on the left).Historically, the land on which the modern state sits was frequently invaded, with bigger powers fighting wars on its territory. The Belgian landscape still bears the jagged scars of the battles of World War I. Even independence (from the Dutch) after the revolution of 1830 was largely the work of outsiders. \u201cWe were constructed as a sort of buffer zone between English, Germans and French,\u201d the Flemish novelist Ivo Victoria told me recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been this small country almost surprised to find ourselves an independent country.\u201dThis feeling of insecurity was exacerbated by Belgium\u2019s relationship with its self-confident neighbors in the Netherlands. The Dutch-speakers of Flanders, in particular, used to look up to these neighbors. (The feeling was not reciprocated. The Dutch told jokes about supposedly stupid Belgians and saw the country merely as a place to pass through on the way to France.) This dynamic also persisted on the soccer pitch. From the late 1960s onward, Holland produced superstars of the game; played daring, stylish \u201ctotal football\u201d; and reached three World Cup finals. Belgium, by contrast, tended to do poorly and deployed a dour, defensive game. In their best tournaments \u2014 they reached the World Cup semifinal in 1986 and the European championship final in 1980 \u2014 they played a hardworking, defensive, counterpunching style.In the past decade, their positions have reversed. The Dutch failed to qualify for the current tournament in Russia and find themselves bereft of stars. Belgium, meanwhile, has adopted a quasi-Dutch offensive style and boasts what has been described as a \u201cgolden generation\u201d of world-renowned talents, such as Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne.\u201cIf the Red Devils won, I suppose it could cause an existential crisis of national identity,\u201d Beddington said to me. \u201cWhat even is Belgium if it\u2019s actually winning?\u201d\u201cNothing would change fundamentally,\u201d she predicted. \u201cThe victory bus would get lost in Brussels\u2019s eternal roadworks, or someone would sing the wrong national anthem.

{"Headline": "In Ruling on Cellphone Location Data, Supreme Court Makes Statement on Digital Privacy", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe decline to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless carrier\u2019s database of physical location information,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority.The 5-to-4 ruling will protect \u201cdeeply revealing\u201d records associated with 400 million devices, the chief justice wrote. It did not matter, he wrote, that the records were in the hands of a third party. That aspect of the ruling was a significant break from earlier decisions.The Constitution must take account of vast technological changes, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, noting that digital data can provide a comprehensive, detailed \u2014 and intrusive \u2014 overview of private affairs that would have been impossible to imagine not long ago.The decision made exceptions for emergencies like bomb threats and child abductions. \u201cSuch exigencies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cinclude the need to pursue a fleeing suspect, protect individuals who are threatened with imminent harm or prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.\u201dIn general, though, the authorities must now seek a warrant for cell tower location information and, the logic of the decision suggests, other kinds of digital data that provide a detailed look at a person\u2019s private life.The decision thus has implications for all kinds of personal information held by third parties, including email and text messages, internet searches, and bank and credit card records. But Chief Justice Roberts said the ruling had limits.\u201cWe hold only that a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party,\u201d the chief justice wrote. The court\u2019s four more liberal members \u2014 Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 joined his opinion.Each of the four other justices wrote a dissent, with the five opinions running to more than 110 pages. In one dissent, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the distinctions drawn by the majority were illogical and \u201cwill frustrate principled application of the Fourth Amendment in many routine yet vital law enforcement operations.\u201d\u201cCell-site records,\u201d he wrote, \u201care uniquely suited to help the government develop probable cause to apprehend some of the nation\u2019s most dangerous criminals: serial killers, rapists, arsonists, robbers and so forth.\u201dIn a second dissent, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the decision \u201cguarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.\u201dWitnesses said that Timothy Ivory Carpenter had planned the robberies, supplied guns and served as lookout, typically waiting in a stolen car across the street.Prosecutors also relied on months of records obtained from cellphone companies to prove their case. The records showed that Mr. Carpenter\u2019s phone had been nearby when several of the robberies happened. He was convicted and sentenced to 116 years in prison.The nation\u2019s highest court faced a far-reaching list of cases that renewed its central role in American life.Mr. Carpenter\u2019s lawyers said cellphone companies had turned over 127 days of records that placed his phone at 12,898 locations, based on information from cellphone towers. The records disclosed whether he had slept at home on given nights and whether he attended his usual church on Sunday mornings.Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the information was entitled to privacy protection.\u201cMapping a cellphone\u2019s location over the course of 127 days provides an all-encompassing record of the holder\u2019s whereabouts,\u201d he wrote, going on to quote from an earlier opinion. \u201cAs with GPS information, the time-stamped data provides an intimate window into a person\u2019s life, revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his \u2018familial, political, professional, religious and sexual associations.\u2019\u201dIn dissent, Justice Kennedy wrote that GPS devices provide much more precise location information than do cell towers. Chief Justice Roberts responded that cell tower technology is developing quickly.\u201cAs the number of cell sites has proliferated,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe geographic area covered by each cell sector has shrunk, particularly in urban areas. In addition, with new technology measuring the time and angle of signals hitting their towers, wireless carriers already have the capability to pinpoint a phone\u2019s location within 50 meters.\u201dChief Justice Roberts left open the question of whether limited government requests for location data required a warrant. But he said that access to seven days of data is enough to raise Fourth Amendment concerns.In a pair of recent decisions, the Supreme Court expressed discomfort with allowing unlimited government access to digital data. In United States v. Jones, it limited the ability of the police to use GPS devices to track suspects\u2019 movements. And in Riley v. California, it required a warrant to search cellphones.Chief Justice Roberts wrote that both decisions supported the result in the new case.As his opinion in Riley pointed out, he wrote, \u201ccellphones and the services they provide are \u2018such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life\u2019 that carrying one is indispensable to participation in modern society.\u201dAnd the Jones decision, he wrote, addressed digital privacy in the context of location information.\u201cThe question we confront today,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis how to apply the Fourth Amendment to a new phenomenon: the ability to chronicle a person\u2019s past movements through the record of his cellphone signals. Such tracking partakes of many of the qualities of the GPS monitoring we considered in Jones. Much like GPS tracking of a vehicle, cellphone location information is detailed, encyclopedic and effortlessly compiled.\u201dRelying on the Smith decision\u2019s \u201cthird-party doctrine,\u201d federal appeals courts have said that government investigators seeking data from cellphone companies showing users\u2019 movements do not require a warrant.But Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the doctrine is of limited use in the digital age.\u201cWhile the third-party doctrine applies to telephone numbers and bank records, it is not clear whether its logic extends to the qualitatively different category of cell-site records,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAfter all, when Smith was decided in 1979, few could have imagined a society in which a phone goes wherever its owner goes, conveying to the wireless carrier not just dialed digits, but a detailed and comprehensive record of the person\u2019s movements.\u201d\u201cWhen the government tracks the location of a cellphone,\u201d the chief justice wrote, \u201cit achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone\u2019s user.\u201dThat was insufficient, the court ruled. But Chief Justice Roberts emphasized the limits of the decision. It did not address real-time cell tower data, he wrote, \u201cor call into question conventional surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras.\u201d\u201cNor do we address other business records that might incidentally reveal location information,\u201d the chief justice wrote. \u201cFurther, our opinion does not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Confronting Asian-American Stereotypes ", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor example, Chinese immigrants in the United States are 12 times as likely to have graduated from college than Chinese who did not immigrate. They are also almost twice as likely to have a college degree than the average American. The hyper-selectivity has resulted in the stereotype that Chinese-Americans (and Asian-Americans more broadly) are smart, competent and hard-working. But they are also vilified for being too smart, too focused on academics, one-dimensional and lacking personal skills.What perpetuates these stereotypes? What can be done to change the thinking? At the same time, Asian-American employees can also do more to signal that they are \u201cleadership material.\u201d They can build up a portfolio of leadership opportunities outside of work through charitable and philanthropic activities, and they can also do more to start challenging the stereotype of Asians as quiet by questioning decisions more, and offering constructive criticism on managerial and executive decisions. Thinking more broadly about the qualities that make a good leader and recognizing that different leadership models may be just as effective (if not more so) than traditional ones will broaden leadership opportunities for not only Asian-Americans, but also women, and other minorities. It would also benefit the members of the organization, who may respond more positively and work more effectively by seeing more diverse leaders at the helm.And how do these stereotypes affect Asian-American candidates in politics? It seems like it would be a high hurdle for any candidate to overcome. Even so, there are important limitations. First, it\u2019s problematic if these model-minority stereotypes are used to contrast Asian-American candidates with negative stereotypes of opponents from other racial groups. In fact, many would argue that, even in isolation, model-minority stereotypes give an unfair advantage to candidates who should be judged on their records and not on stereotypes about them. Finally, the stereotype of being calm and technically competent can hurt candidates when they run for other types of offices, as John Chiang found out when he failed to make a name for himself and capture the excitement of primary voters in the California governor\u2019s race. Democrats\u2019 preference for affirmative action is well established. Will this support affect Asian-American voting patterns?Here in New York, the mayor recently recommended changing the admissions criteria for elite public schools, where Asian-Americans are vastly overrepresented. The number of spots for Asian-Americans would most likely be cut. Your thoughts?There are many ways to define merit, but we need to admit to ourselves that not every student has the same chance to show how meritorious she is because some metrics favor some groups over others.\u201cNormally, Asian women keep their heads down and stay very quiet.\u201d Those words have been branded into my brain for life by a former boss. I was a budding producer on a national news program, and I had just diplomatically expressed my strong desire to be promoted in the future. \u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d he told me.\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\u201cYou\u2019re so good at what you do. I thought you wanted to stay in your position forever ... I\u2019m also not used to hearing you speak up like that.\u201d And then, he uttered those words that stopped me from breathing. He spoke so matter-of-factly. Though I was stunned, I gave him a weak smile and went back to work, as if validating that pernicious stereotype. I knew he violated some kind of rule but my younger, na\u00efve self didn\u2019t know how to fight back. I left the network months later with bigger dreams. I\u2019m not taking sides on the case. I recognize the value of evaluating the wholeness of an applicant apart from hard data, like G.P.A. and test scores. Though we should also acknowledge that any measurement of something subjective, like personality, risks implicit bias. My former boss clearly made presumptions about my own personality. This renewed national debate surfaces stereotypes that many of us have confronted over the years: We\u2019re worker bees who get the job done. We don\u2019t have the personality it takes to manage people. We\u2019re just duds, who keep our \u201cheads down and stay very quiet.\u201d But we can\u2019t be neatly contained within the model minority myth. We are not a monolithic group. Many of us have our heads and hands up high, asking for a seat at the table.Now I know what to do when confronted with egregious stereotypes: Look directly into their eyes and flatly demand an apology.

It\u2019s not crime tape in their way \u2014 it\u2019s a production assistant on a film set, trying to block off the intersection.That a camera crew set its sights on the cobblestone streets of Dumbo is not at all surprising. Tourists searching for the perfect selfie have rendered Washington Street borderline unpassable.Wedding and engagement shoots, camera-toting tourists, models needing head shots \u2014 this stretch under the Manhattan Bridge has become the outdoor runway for the chic and the shabby alike. Situated in a neighborhood that's almost a caricature of urban grit \u2014 where the city's early-20th-century streetscape meets the Instagram-era \u2014 Washington Street has become a must-visit because of the way the buildings frame the Manhattan Bridge and the bridge, in turn, frames the Empire State Building beyond it.As visitors began posting pictures of the spot on social media profiles, blogs and websites took notice, pointing even more tourists to the location where could get the perfect photo of #brooklyn.Looking at people looking at a bridge is a surprising delight. The promise of social media glory provokes inexplicable antics.Visitors hoist loved ones in the air, flip their hair relentlessly and gaze longingly at their unfiltered selves in their phone\u2019s camera app.George Senior Jr. of Long Island pulled up to Washington Street at the end of May in a 1955 Chevy Bel Air convertible.

Cameras here point one direction: toward the bridge. Looking through those viewfinders, you\u2019d never know that happy brides like Deborah Furtado, of Brazil, were in fact posing next to hulking, graffitied cherry pickers.Like any good New York City attraction, it\u2019s become part tourist trap, part commercial venture. Ekaterina Murphy looked primed for her wedding day. But Ms. Murphy is in fact a model, donning the outfit for a Ukranian dressmaker using the backdrop, along with shoots earlier in the day in Times Square, to sell the product. As a stylist cinched her dress, Artem Kubinskij huffed from a vape pen and livestreamed the whole ordeal, panning between Murphy and the bridge above. The real moments here happen between the people without the cameras in their hands. Something about this place lets visitors shed insecurities and mug for a picture in a way that shows their connection not only to the city, but also to one another.Horacio Gonzalez took notice of the photo-opportunities and decided to turn it into a side hustle, selling Polaroid-style photos \u2014 $5 for a pair of them \u2014 to visitors.

{"Headline": "No Ethnic Group Owns Stuyvesant. All New Yorkers Do.", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s plan would destroy the best high schools in New York City.Mr. Weinstein is a graduate of Stuyvesant High School and is on the board of its alumni association. Like many alumni of Stuyvesant, the city\u2019s premier public specialized high school, I believe that admission to the school was one of the seminal events of my life. I came from a public middle school; my father was an insurance broker on Coney Island Avenue and my mother was an immigrant who worked as a translator. On weekends, I walked around Brooklyn placing fliers advertising my father\u2019s business under the windshield wipers of cars.Admission to Stuyvesant was and remains determined by a single test available to all middle school students in the city. There are no soft criteria for admission: no interviews, no favoritism for legacies, no strings to be pulled. It\u2019s all about whether you do well on the test, which best determines whether or not you can do the academic work.You would think that Mayor Bill de Blasio would celebrate Stuyvesant as the crown jewel of the city\u2019s school system. Instead, he has announced a plan that will destroy it in all but name.This month, the mayor said he would seek legislation that would eliminate the test completely. Instead, he\u2019d guarantee automatic admission to Stuyvesant \u2014 and the seven other specialized high schools in the city \u2014 for the top students at every middle school, regardless of their abilities.The mayor says he is trying to address what is undoubtedly a heartbreaking problem: the gross underrepresentation of black and Latino students at Stuyvesant and schools like it. In 2016 black and Latino students constituted 44 percent of the kids who took the test (and 65 percent of the New York City school population). Yet they make up just 4 percent of Stuyvesant students and 15 percent of students at the specialized high schools overall.But the mayor\u2019s solution is no solution at all.These students have been in the mayor\u2019s charge since they were 9 years old. Instead of complaining, as he has, that the admissions test invites so-called gaming in the form of preparing for it after school and during summers, we should be demanding answers from him as to why middle schools themselves are not teaching the basic math and reading skills that are its subject.The mayor says he is worried about poor students\u2019 lack of access to Stuyvesant. (His interim plan, as a stopgap before he gets the legislative change he wants, is to expand an existing program so that 20 percent of seats will be set aside for low-income students from high-poverty schools who just missed the test\u2019s cutoff score.) But already, according to the Department of Education\u2019s own measure of poverty, 44 percent of Stuyvesant students are poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch or are eligible for Human Resources Administration benefits. The school is diverse in other ways, too: 36 percent of Stuyvesant students self-report speaking a language other than English at home.The issue, of course, is sufficient racial diversity. Asians make up 75 percent of Stuyvesant students and 62 percent of specialized high school students overall. Last week Richard Carranza, the mayor\u2019s new schools chancellor, put it this way: \u201cI just don\u2019t buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admission to these schools.\u201dThere is so much that is disheartening about that sentence. It pits minority groups in our city against one another. It imagines a cabal. And by describing the majority populations of these schools as \u201cone ethnic group,\u201d it fails to appreciate the socio-economic and other diversity among these students and internal to Asian communities. It\u2019s no surprise that Asian alumni, students and activists have protested that the mayor\u2019s plan is punitive toward them and are angry and demoralized by the way they are being described.It is hard to talk about why some communities have resorted to self-help in the face of the lousy education their children get in the city\u2019s public schools, where they should be learning the reading and math that the test \u2014 and life \u2014 requires. (The test is similar to the SAT, which is so critical for college admissions.)Rather than lead us through that difficult conversation, the chancellor\u2019s response is to build a straw man because no ethnic or racial group could possibly claim entitlement to Stuyvesant. Not even the school\u2019s biggest critics can seriously allege that the admissions test is racially or ethnically biased, or that it calls for special knowledge better known to some groups.What the protesters stand for \u2014 and I stand with them \u2014 is the universal principle that talent and hard work should be rewarded. I wish that more children across the city had the opportunities they deserve to demonstrate their talent and hard work. It is worth fighting for this principle \u2014 in our public schools perhaps most of all.An earlier version of the biographical notes with this article misidentified an affiliation of the author, Boaz Weinstein. He is on the board of the Stuyvesant High School Alumni Association, not of the school itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coming Tech Battle With China", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sharma is\u00a0the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Arriving in Beijing last month, I knew I would not be able to connect to Google, Facebook or Uber. As strange as it was to go without these staples of online life in the West, it was even stranger to find that local Chinese didn\u2019t seem to feel deprived at all. They search through Baidu, get their social media fix on WeChat, hail rides on Didi, curate news through sites like Toutiao. And while they know Beijing is watching, they accept this surveillance as normal.The Chinese government has carved out an alternative internet universe with its own brands, rules and culture, in which privacy doesn\u2019t exist. But its real ambition is to break out of this parallel universe and dominate not just the internet but the technology industry worldwide. To contain Beijing, the United States and its allies are fighting back with a campaign of technoprotectionism, opening a perilous new front in the global trade battles.President Trump is the unlikely leader of the fight against Chinese tech dominance. Widely seen as a champion of rust belt industries, he recently slapped heavy tariffs on all the leading aluminum and steel exporters, drawing fierce protests not only from China but also from American allies like Germany and Canada. But steel is a side show compared with the emerging tech battle with China.Technology will decide which country emerges as the world\u2019s dominant economic power in the long run. While about 20 percent of per-capita gross domestic product growth is driven by labor and capital, the remaining 80 percent is determined by how rapidly an economy is developing and applying new technology to increase production. China\u2019s ambition to catch up to Western living standards thus depends largely on how rapidly it can match or surpass Western technology.Mr. Trump is both accelerating and expanding trade battles that began before he took office. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries around the world began to restrict cross-border flows of trade, capital and migrants. Globalization\u2019s champions predicted that borders would continue to fall in at least one area \u2014 digital tech and the internet \u2014 but China has shown that a determined government can build walls in the virtual sphere, too.The president\u2019s tough stand on trade with China may be more popular than he is. The overwhelming consensus in the West is that Beijing is catching up illegitimately, by forcing companies that invest in China to share their best technology, or dispatching hackers to steal it. Though borrowing from the leading tech power is a standard development strategy \u2014 think of 19th-century America copying British industrial technology and Japan\u2019s great success replicating American technology \u2014 the scale and organization of China\u2019s campaign makes the threat feel new.Beijing has banned some foreign competitors like Google and Facebook outright, and regulated others so heavily that they have been compelled to sell themselves to Chinese rivals (Uber) or forced to consider pulling out of China (Amazon). In essence, China has created domestic internet monopolies that are generating enough cash in their vast local market to finance aggressive expansion abroad. I have been told, for example, that Toutiao already sells its novel content curating service to one in 10 Japanese.Last year Beijing rebranded the manufacturing centers of the Pearl River delta as the \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d and began urging the main cities there \u2014 Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong \u2014 to cooperate to become China\u2019s rival to Silicon Valley, which the Chinese would like to make the lesser Bay Area.In Beijing, the buzz was about how \u201cCreated in China\u201d is replacing \u201cMade in China,\u201d with some claiming that Shenzhen is now more innovative than Silicon Valley in key industries. Instead of just assembling simple goods from parts built elsewhere, China is now increasingly seen as a cutting-edge designer and developer of artificial intelligence, drones and other advanced technologies.Mr. Trump was willing to lift the ban on ZTE after the company paid a $1 billion fine and fired its top executives, but Congress was not. The Senate voted to reinstate the ban, which is likely to fuel trade battles to come. When I was in Beijing, many Chinese were talking about how the humiliation of ZTE was inspiring an official push to reduce China\u2019s dependence on the United States for semiconductors, software and other critical tech imports.The European Union recently imposed new data protection rules written largely to give consumers more control of information now in the hands of corporate giants like Facebook, but also to guard against the spread of a China-like surveillance state. The European Union is also pondering a new digital single market, in part to give European companies a market in which they have a chance to grow as large as Chinese rivals.This is how a digitally interconnected world could die by a thousand cuts, and technoprotectionism may get a further push during the next global downturn. From the United States to Europe and Japan, public debts are high and deficits are rising, which means these governments are poorly positioned to spend their way out of any slowdown. Central banks can\u2019t help much, either, since interest rates are still very low, with little room or reason to drop further right now. In this environment, governments may see protectionism as the only lever they have left to pull.For most of the postwar era, the consensus in support of free trade was so strong that governments rarely resorted to raising tariffs even when times were tough. The trade wars that broke out after 2008 have involved mainly nontariff or \u201cstealth\u201d trade barriers, including cheap state loans and subsidies for favored industries. But in the last two years, the rise of Mr. Trump and other antiglobal populists has given new currency to protectionism in all its forms, including technoprotectionism.The global financial markets had largely ignored the brewing trade battles, until recently. As the tariff threats grow in scale, and the battleground shifts from rust belt industries to new technologies, the markets are growing more skittish. So far, stocks have been hit harder in China than in the United States, but there will be no winners. The latest surveys of American investors and manufacturers show that their biggest concern is the threat of a trade war.The risks from deglobalization are growing. If the current skirmishes turn into a full-blown trade war, blame will fall heavily on the thousandth cut. But the real fault will lie with the 999 that came before.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Chief Scott Freeman fired Officer Saulters on Saturday after initially placing him on administrative leave, said Eppi Rodriguez, a police spokesman.The Georgia State Patrol is investigating the crash and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is conducting a criminal investigation, Mr. Rodriguez added.

{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Hardball Politics Get Even Harder as PRI Fights to Hold On to Power", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s attorney general, who is appointed by the president, has publicly accused one of the main opposition candidates of serious crimes without offering much evidence. Similarly, decisions by a special court overseeing the election, which was appointed by a PRI-dominated congress, have been roundly criticized.Hardball tactics are nothing new in Mexican politics, but the PRI\u2019s abuse of state institutions are a staggering escalation for a party in power.The PRI reviewed the proposal for months, but eventually decided it didn\u2019t need to pay millions of dollars to an outsider to wage a dirty campaign, according to three people familiar with the negotiations. The party could do that itself. But in a preview of the extreme measures the party was willing to take to secure its position, it paid Cambridge anyway so that the company would not work for anyone else, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.The decision, made in the early months of 2017, was an informal start to what has, to some, been a period of misuse of government resources for electoral purposes.\u201cWhat they are doing is taking what little credibility and confidence there is in our institutions and throwing it away,\u201d said Ignacio Morales Lechuga, who was the country\u2019s attorney general during the 1990s, when the PRI was also in government. \u201cIt underscores the weak rule of law we have here and points to their desire to do whatever it takes to stay in power.\u201dThe special court has rejected two audits into improper campaign spending by the governing party, overruled regulators trying to scrutinize potential vote buying and allowed a tainted presidential campaign onto the ballot \u2014 a move that could draw votes away from the opposition, pollsters say.Beyond that, money for election observers has taken a nose-dive, while spending on gift cards for voters and social services has surged in recent months. Those tactics have long been used to win poor people\u2019s votes in Mexico, election observers say.For more than 70 years, the PRI has dominated the nation\u2019s political landscape. But now the party appears to be heading toward a searing defeat in the elections next month amid corruption scandals and soaring levels of violence.The PRI\u2019s frantic search for an edge helped lead to its discussions with Cambridge Analytica, the full details of which have not been previously reported.The company\u2019s proposal began circulating in 2017, when Enrique Ochoa, the PRI\u2019s former president, was hunting for solutions to keep the party from falling apart. By that time, Cambridge Analytica, a campaign data consultant to the Trump campaign in the months before the 2016 election, had set up shop in Mexico. The PRI was an obvious choice: It was the biggest party, and it badly needed help.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was suffering the lowest approval ratings of any Mexican president in a quarter century, and Cambridge promised to help the party pull off a stunning upset.In its pitch, the company vowed that in return for $7.2 million, it would raise the PRI\u2019s sagging image \u2014 and destroy the reputation of its biggest competitor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the leader in the polls. \u201cUsing similar techniques that were employed against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US Presidential election,\u201d Cambridge Analytica promised to wage \u201ca powerful negative campaign strategy to undermine\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.The proposal included a \u201cfeel good\u201d component to change voters\u2019 negative views of the governing party. But the main tactic was simple: an \u201cAnti Lopez Obrador Campaign.\u201d\u201cThere is no better example of this than Hillary Clinton,\u201d the company said in its proposal, adding: \u201cThe front-runner considered by many to have an unassailable lead, and who significantly outspent her Republican opponent, was nevertheless defeated in just this way.\u201d The company even showed mock-ups of how the \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d campaign could work as a template for anti-L\u00f3pez Obrador ads.But PRI officials determined that the sort of targeting the company claimed to have done in the United States would not work in Mexico, according to the people familiar with the discussions. The data on voters in Mexico was not granular enough, they said.The company declined to comment about the negotiations with Mexico. And the PRI denied having any relationship whatsoever with Cambridge Analytica.But the PRI did use a battery of media strategies, law enforcement institutions and judicial bodies that it controlled, independent election observers and former party members say.In February, the nation\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office announced an investigation into Mr. Anaya, an opposition candidate who was polling better than the PRI candidate. It accused him of laundering money and later released a video of Mr. Anaya meeting with prosecutors in their offices (an encounter the candidate had actually requested).When Mr. Anaya cried foul, the attorney general\u2019s office justified its decision by saying it was responding \u201cto public interest shown by the media.\u201dThe PRI\u2019s tactics have stirred a backlash. Several prominent Mexicans \u2014 including academics, activists and even former officials \u2014 have publicly urged the president to stop intervening in the elections. A powerful consortium of businesses did the same.\u201cWhen you cross a line like that in this country, there is really nothing left to stop you,\u201d said Gustavo de Hoyos Walther, the head of the business group, known as Coparmex.Line crossing is a common occurrence in Mexican politics, and goes far beyond one party in one election. But Mr. de Hoyos Walther and others raised concerns about the effect on Mexico\u2019s institutions.Money for election observers has dropped 81 percent since the last presidential election, in 2012, according to a recent study by a nonprofit group, Citizen Action Against Poverty.And many Mexicans argue that the most important election authority in the country has been compromised: the special court appointed to oversee election authorities and, ultimately, validate the voting. At nearly every turn, that tribunal has decided against the regulators responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the vote.One case that caused an uproar involved Jaime Rodr\u00edguez, an especially colorful candidate known as \u201cEl Bronco.\u201dTo get onto the ballot as an independent, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez turned in nearly 900,000 signatures. But the national election authorities found that more than half of the signatures were fraudulent and threw him out of the race.Then the election tribunal, which was appointed in 2016 by the PRI-dominated Senate, reversed the decision, claiming that the candidate had not been given due process.The decision raised objections across Mexico. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez is a state governor who, like Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, positions himself as an outsider who can take on the entrenched interests of the political system. Experts say his presence in the race could siphon votes away from Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.Another contentious decision by the election tribunal involved prepaid gift cards handed out to voters.Under Mexican law, the handouts are not illegal unless a party uses them explicitly to buy votes. The cards, which are used at all levels of government and by nearly all political parties, cover things like a free lunch or $25 in groceries.But in recent years their role in voting has become undeniable. Time and again, citizens have come forward to say they were promised benefits in exchange for votes.It happened after the 2012 election, which brought Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to power. Then in 2017, after the PRI won in elections in the states of Coahuila and Mexico, regulators investigated questionable spending in the campaigns. They conducted audits and announced last July that they had found irregularities in campaign spending on advertising, payments to field organizers and gift cards.The repercussions could have been severe. Such findings can invalidate an election. But before it could come to that, the special electoral tribunal dismissed the audits, declaring them flawed.\u201cThe Tribunal always makes decisions within the letter of the law,\u201d it said. \u201cOur sentences and statistical data are proof of this: in this process, none of the political forces have been favored by resolutions in a disproportional way.\u201dThe controversy over the tribunal soon came up again. Last September, election regulators announced that they would more forcefully regulate the use of the gift cards for the 2018 presidential race. Then they went further, declaring that spending on social programs was also being manipulated for electoral purposes.But the effort to regulate the spending was stopped before it could start \u2014 by the same electoral court.Analysts worry that the court\u2019s decisions are already being felt, with campaign spending allowed to go unchecked.On the outskirts of Mexico City, for example, the walls of homes glisten with fresh coats of paint, while trucks carrying rooftop cisterns roll into communities with water shortages, compliments of political parties vying for votes.Government spending often surges as programs meant to curb hunger or help the poor are transformed into vote-buying machines during election years. This year appears no different. Overall spending for Mexico\u2019s main social services program jumped 20 percent in the first four months of this year, according to an analysis by Citizen Action Against Poverty, the nonprofit group.But for all of its efforts, the gains have been marginal for the governing party, which appears to be limping toward a crushing defeat this July. Its candidate, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, remains a distant third in polling.In fact, the party\u2019s aggressive election strategy seems to have backfired and may have actually helped Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.\u201cThe use of public offices, resources and institutions for electoral purposes is so visible in this campaign and points to the weakest flank of our democracy,\u201d said Guillermo Cejudo, a professor of public administration at CIDE, a university in Mexico City.\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201claw enforcement institutions are tools used by the economic and political elite not to defend and protect Mexicans, but rather used to beat each other with a stick.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Some 200 to 500 feet below the surface is the mesophotic zone, where ancient reefs once drowned, leaving behind empty bodies now inhabited by new corals and colorful mystery fish. Much of this zone remains unexplored: It is often skipped by scientists on their way to the ocean bottom. Just as we begin to discover this slice of the sea, climate change, overfishing and other human activities may be threatening its very existence. Those who study the zone have long needed a safer way to bring its fishy residents to the surface without killing them. It\u2019s basically a portable decompression chamber, protecting fish from the same damage that humans experience when we dive deep into the ocean and return too quickly to the surface.Agile, observant divers are best for the task, but bringing up the fish is a physics problem.If you\u2019ve ever traveled with snacks from the bottom of a mountain to the top, you may have noticed that an unopened bag of chips will expand as you ascend. They developed transparent collection jars two feet long that fit into chambers, small and simple enough for divers to carry and manipulate.

Most survived the journey. \u201cThat chamber becomes the world\u2019s deepest aquarium,\u201d said Mr. Shepherd. \u201cNow in our exhibit we have eight undescribed species of fish on the public floor that people can see that they\u2019d have no opportunity to see anywhere else in the world.\u201d With this technology, Mr. Shepherd hopes that more people will gain a better understanding of these unusual and understudied aquatic environments that are often not included in marine protected areas or sanctuaries.\u201cI want to shine a light into the twilight zone and show people that these ecosystems exist, are under threat, and there\u2019s something we can do about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They couldn\u2019t see any improvement 10 days after an earlier exam. Replacement of the degenerating joints isn\u2019t an option for a goose. Maybe acupuncture could help?This was a typical morning for three veterinarians at the Franklin Park Zoo. But it was a fairly unusual one for the Harvard Medical School student alongside them.Although medical students usually stick to the human species, Harvard med students have been signing up for rotations at the zoo during their final months of training. The clinical elective, offered for the last three years, is also intended to reinforce the idea that animals and people share the same environment.\u201cMost medical students don\u2019t get that side of the picture,\u201d Dr. Baitchman said, noting that it is often human logging, bushmeat consumption and other man-made habitat changes that trigger such crises. \u201cHuman activities can have direct influences on our own health,\u201d he said.Dr. Sharon Deem, director of the Institute for Conservation Medicine at the St Louis Zoo, said zoos and medical specialists have worked together for decades, but there have only been modest collaborations between zoos and medical schools.What Harvard Medical School and Zoo New England are doing is more formal and longstanding than any other program she\u2019s aware of. \u201cEric and his team are at the forefront of what is hopefully going to be a common thing, but it\u2019s not right now,\u201d she said, speaking of Dr. Baitchman. \u201cI feel like the wick is lit now and it\u2019s got enough momentum that it will light the candle at the end.\u201dPeople also have a profound need for animals and nature, Dr. Deem said, citing things like therapy dogs and the restorative power of a walk in the woods. \u201cThese have positive physical and psychological impacts that we shouldn\u2019t overlook,\u201d she said.Several students who completed the rotation said they were surprised by how much they learned during a month at the zoo. One tested a gorilla for heart disease, another treated a bat who had broken a wing in a fight, and another spent part of his first day struggling to keep an African tortoise from ambling out of an X-ray machine while he tried to check it for bladder stones.\"I would never have predicted that I would spend my final month of medical school performing fetal ultrasounds on a pregnant gorilla, phlebotomizing a 500-pound tapir with hemochromatosis, caring for a meerkat in heart failure, and investigating medical mysteries across the animal kingdom,\u201d he wrote in the article.He also observed: \u201cFor nearly every disease I saw at the zoo, the simple question of why certain species, human or nonhuman, are susceptible to it, while others are not, raised immediate possibilities for research. Nearly every day at the zoo, the veterinarians and I would make fascinating, unexpected connections between human and veterinary medicine.\u201dIn an interview, he said the stint at the zoo inspired new respect for the complexity of veterinary medicine. \u201cI really had to overcome some bias that I think pervades much of medicine, that human physiology and disease is unique and that veterinary medicine does not have much to teach us,\u201d Dr. Evrony said.He and other students in the elective said they were repeatedly struck by how much they learned from treating species other than their own.\u201cWe think of these as human diseases, but they\u2019re really diseases that occur across the animal kingdom,\u201d said Dr. Zack, who also has a doctorate in biophysics, and works at the Broad Institute, a genetics research institute affiliated with Harvard and MIT.Of course, Drs. Zack, Evrony and their peers are not the first to realize that there\u2019s a lot to learn from the animal kingdom. The vaccine for smallpox, for instance, was developed after Edward Jenner at the turn of the 19th century recognized that milkmaids were protected against smallpox because they\u2019d already been infected with a related disease from cows.Flies, worms, fish and mice have long been research laboratory staples. But many of those animals don\u2019t naturally develop the same diseases as humans, so the ailments have to be created through genetic manipulation or other means, some of which raise ethical concerns.Dr. Elisa Walsh, another student who did the rotation, said she was impressed by the range of evolutionary changes among animal life, solving problems in different ways. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible how much diversity there is,\u201d she said.She collaborated on a project with a nearby hospital that is using ultrasounds to test gorillas for heart disease \u2014 aimed at learning more about the disease in humans and other great apes.She also learned about tricky diagnoses, and how to to improvise, she said. Among other animals, Dr. Walsh treated an aging Macaw named Henry that suddenly couldn\u2019t fly. Rolling him into an MRI machine to figure out what was wrong was an \u201cinteresting experience,\u201d she said. After diagnosing him with a small stroke, she and the veterinarians devised a physical therapy regimen to help him recover his ability to fly. \u201cThankfully it had a good ending,\u201d she said.But testing cortisol levels requires several exams over time, which is tricky for an animal that won\u2019t pee in a cup or stay still for a blood draw. Medical tests cause animals tremendous anxiety, which drives up their cortisol levels. And taking them out of their social environment for repeated testing can upset the social dynamics and hierarchy of all five of the lemurs that share a habitat.Dr. Ebina, who also has a doctorate in stem cell biology, offered several suggestions, based on what he knew from human treatments, but allowed that none was a great option for a lemur.In the end, Dr. Megan Watson, an associate veterinarian, decided they would get a urine sample first, by strategically placing a plastic sheet under her. Then Sofina was briefly anesthetized to get a blood sample. The results didn\u2019t suggest Cushing\u2019s disease, so the vets have tried another form of insulin that seems to be helping. Hoppy, the male red panda who is now 3 years old, taught Dr. Ebina different lessons. The student helped the vets carry the sedated animal in a dog crate. Inside the zoo\u2019s hospital, they slid Hoppy carefully out onto the metal exam table. A veterinary technician slipped a mask over its face, and positioned the tongue out of the way.Dr. Ebina gingerly inserted a tube down Hoppy\u2019s throat, intubating him to make sure he could breathe.\u201cHow much to push the tube in is very different\u201d than in human patients, Dr. Ebina said.As a technician took Hoppy\u2019s temperature, the medical team checked his eyes: his pupils were constricted but looked healthy; his ears, no problems; his abdomen: \u201cNo obvious masses. Not distended.\u201d They moved each of his limp limbs to ensure he had a full range of motion, and squeezed his furry paws to poke out and inspect each extended claw.\u201cIt\u2019s all the same anatomy,\u201d Dr. Ebina said, a few minutes later with the exam successfully completed, and Hoppy\u2019s X-rays displayed on a nearby computer. \u201cSeeing an animal that looks completely different but is actually similar reinforces the anatomical concepts that we learn, which is very helpful for my education going forward.\u201dLater, driving the red panda back to his exhibit space at the front of the zoo, Dr. Alex Becket, an associate veterinarian, reported that Hoppy seemed to be recovering well from the anesthesia. He hadn\u2019t vomited, appeared aware of his surroundings, and had begun grooming himself to get back to normal. Although the elective program is supposed to teach species interdependence, Hoppy hadn\u2019t quite gotten the message. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get the stink of human off of him,\u201d Dr. Becket said.Advertisement"}

Now What?", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKatie Lowsley-Williams, a 30-year-old yoga instructor living on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, likes listening to the Chainsmokers and Bon Iver. Her husband, Daniel Lopp, 47, who works for a hedge fund, prefers the Who and the Grateful Dead.In their three years of marriage, they\u2019ve come to expect other differences, too: She doesn\u2019t get tired until around midnight; he usually calls it a night before 9. And while Ms. Lowsley-Williams likes to text and check her Instagram feed on her cellphone while doing just about everything, Mr. Lopp has no trouble putting his phone away.\u201cIf I don\u2019t have a screen next to me, I get antsy,\u201d Ms. Lowsley-Williams said. \u201cI always need to be doing something else \u2014 I can\u2019t even watch a movie, and it drives him crazy.\u201dSo it\u2019s not too surprising that when a millennial marries a member of Gen X or even someone older, their age difference can stir up some funny (and maybe frustrating) intergenerational drama. (Of course, there are plenty of older spouses who are just as obsessed about their phones and social media, and younger people who eschew Facebook or Twitter.)Kathleen Johnston, who is 32 and a development officer for Cornell University, says she often checks her \u201cmillennial tech habits at the door\u201d when she\u2019s with the family or friends of her husband, Neal Johnston, 44, an owner of a flour mill in Ithaca, N.Y.Ms. Johnston, who goes by the name Kaki, says she doesn\u2019t want to be considered rude and be \u201cone of those millennials who is always on their phone.\u201d Yet when she and her husband are alone \u2014 when her stepdaughter is asleep and she\u2019s finally winding down after a long day of work and commitments on two local nonprofit boards \u2014 she will sometimes pick up her smartphone. Mr. Johnston will then encourage her to put it down. She often obliges.On their Hawaiian honeymoon in Kauai this past January, she decided to leave her phone in their hotel room when they went to the pool or hiking. Even at home, she never brings her phone to restaurants. \u201cI\u2019m trying to meet him halfway,\u201d she said.Typically, however, Ms. Johnston spends lots of her downtime while she\u2019s alone on her phone, looking at memes or texting with friends. If she\u2019s not with her husband, she\u2019s texting him, too. Mr. Johnston will text her back, but he\u2019s often puzzled when she sends him bursts of texts in a row rather than just pick up the phone.\u201cI\u2019ll be up on a ladder at work, and then she\u2019ll wonder why I\u2019m not responding right away,\u201d he said, chuckling. Still, she says, at least she\u2019ll get on the phone now and talk. When he called her after one of their first dates, she cringed. \u201cI was like, O.M.G. What\u2019s wrong with him? Why is he calling me?\u201d she said.But communication isn\u2019t the only sticking point. Social media can put pressure on marriages, too. Many millennials are accustomed to posting edited photos of themselves for friends to see at every life stage. And just because they marry someone who is older hardly means they\u2019ll stop.\u201cGeneration X is more private \u2014 they are more careful about what they share online,\u201d said Jason Dorsey, the president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, a research firm that studies generational differences in baby boomers, Gen Xers and millennials. \u201cThey don\u2019t look for that same external feedback that millennials do.\u201dVeronica London, a 35-year-old photographer living in Manhattan\u2019s Soho neighborhood, says she \u201ccould take selfies all day.\u201dWhen Ms. London and her husband, Patrick Michael Wickham, a music composer and part of Generation X, went on their honeymoon in the Italian island of Capri, she was snapping photos of them on her camera phone at every turn. She was particularly thrilled when they hiked up a mountain. At the summit, she immediately took out her phone and began posing with Mr. Wickham, trying different filters.Mr. Wickham would have preferred she live more in the moment. \u201cMy private life is private,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to share everything with everyone.\u201dThe couple\u2019s differing approaches to social media couldn\u2019t have been more obvious than when Mr. Wickham refused to change his relationship status on Facebook. Ms. London wanted him to switch from \u201csingle\u201d to \u201cin a relationship,\u201d but Mr. Wickham didn\u2019t think it was important. He resisted until they tied the knot in 2017. That\u2019s when he changed it to \u201cmarried,\u201d much to Veronica\u2019s relief.\u201cIt really bothered me,\u201d said Ms. London, adding that she and Mr. Wickham had numerous conversations about why he wouldn\u2019t change the designation. \u201cI wanted him to be more transparent about us on social media.\u201dTechnology isn\u2019t the only way generational differences play into a marriage. For some, it\u2019s coming into the relationship from different life stages.Kate Bittman, a 40-year-old public relations consultant from Manhattan, says that as happy as she was after falling in love with her husband, Nick Traverse, 32, she was worried that he wouldn\u2019t want to have children soon enough. They met in 2010 while working at The New Yorker; she was a 32-year-old public relations associate and he was a 24-year-old editorial assistant. Sparks flew, and as things grew more serious, she dreaded the idea of bringing up marriage and children so early, but she felt like she needed to.\u201cDeep down, I was worried, \u2018My eggs! My eggs!\u2019 I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted to have kids, but when you fall in love, you need to at least talk about it,\u201d she said.Mr. Traverse, now an editor at Architectural Digest, felt he was too young at that point, but he said he would begin to consider it, which eased her fears that she\u2019d get too old to have a baby. After he proposed in 2014, Ms. Bittman was thrilled and said yes. But something nagged at her: When would he be ready for children? She asked him, heart racing.\u201cI\u2019m all in,\u201d he reassured her after the proposal, adding that he was ready to try for a baby right after the wedding in 2015. Today, they have a 2-year-old son.\u201cMillennials are approaching marriage differently than previous generations,\u201d said Laura Heck, a licensed marriage therapist in Salt Lake City and a host of \u201cMarriage Therapy Radio,\u201d a podcast that counsels couples online. She\u2019s also a 33-year-old millennial. \u201cThey don\u2019t think their parents got it right, so they\u2019re saying: How can we do this better?\u201dMr. Dorsey of the Center for Generational Kinetics said that his research has found many millennials are looking to become more established in their careers and finances before committing to a life partner. A Gallup poll published in 2016 showed that only 27 percent of millennials were married at the time, versus 62 percent of Generation Xers.Jared Stanisci, a 39-year-old lawyer from Manhattan, says he envies the way that his husband, Chad Newman, 34, has sought out work that feels meaningful to him. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a more traditional path,\u201d Mr. Stanisci said.Mr. Newman, who works in the development office of the Picture House Regional Film Center, a nonprofit organization based in Pelham, N.Y., says his career has been a direct reflection of the economy.\u201cWhen I got out of school, there wasn\u2019t a clear path waiting for me, like there was for Jared,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t as much opportunity.\u201dSo he had to get creative, he says. He worked at a public relations firm, then went back to school for a master\u2019s degree in film studies. He applied for dozens of jobs in the entertainment sector, then after a \u201csoul sucking\u201d experience at a talent agency, decided he would rather make less money and do something he believed in.\u201cIf I\u2019m feeling restless, I\u2019m always up for something new,\u201d said Mr. Newman, who recently started taking guitar lessons just for fun.Satya Doyle Byock, a psychotherapist in Portland, Ore., whose practice specializes in treating people in their 20s and 30s, notes that many of her millennial clients also aren\u2019t willing to endure an unhappy or stagnant relationship. And that, she said, is a good thing.\u201cSome might view that as entitled,\u201d Ms. Doyle Byock said, \u201cbut I see that as hopeful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Not Quite Like That.", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveStung by romantic rejection, a woman finds acceptance and catharsis in a man who leaves her with bite marks and bruises.\u201cAre you left- or right-handed?\u201d Dan asked, walking me down the subway steps.\u201cRight-handed,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy?\u201dWhen we stopped at the bottom, he put his arms around me and hugged tightly, nuzzling his lips into my neck. Suddenly, my vision blurred in a flash of blinding pain as I felt his teeth sink into my right shoulder.I had experienced my share of pain over the years \u2014 a broken arm, a split chin \u2014 but not like this. Never intentionally.As we had wrapped our third date earlier that night, he had asked if he could mark my foray into B.D.S.M. by biting me, and I\u2019d said yes. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually do it.After unclenching his jaw, he kissed me on the cheek and said good night. Then he was gone.I walked through the turnstile in a daze, only faintly aware of the people around me. My skin pulsed.I arrived at the subway platform drunk on endorphins, running my fingers under my coat to feel the tiny grooves in my shoulder his bite had left. Only later would I realize he had asked if I was right-handed so he could bite where my handbag would rest \u2014 the pain reminding me of him.Man, that had hurt. What the hell was I getting myself into?\u201cYou O.K.?\u201d Dan texted, minutes later.I stared at the blinking cursor. If I wanted to back out, now was the time. \u201cSee you in two weeks,\u201d I replied.I hadn\u2019t been looking to date. I was still recovering from the demise of my previous relationship with a journalist who broke up with me after I told him about my struggles with alcohol and family issues.The journalist and I had met on OkCupid while I was touring the Southeast with my band. Every day we would text each other a single photo from our oddball work lives: a Nascar race in Charlotte; a tricycle factory in Queens.Meanwhile, I hid what I preferred he didn\u2019t see: Me relapsing on cheap merlot in Raleigh. Crying at a truck stop in Duluth. It was a tough time. My father was hospitalized and dying. But I wanted to be \u201cfun,\u201d so why burden him with unnecessary details?We went through the motions of building a relationship: cooking dinner and watching movies. But when he asked why I didn\u2019t drink, I made excuses about early morning meetings. Concealing the messy parts of myself came naturally. I had done it my whole life.As a child, I had learned to hide who I was to avoid upsetting my father, an Egyptian immigrant. In my teens I was chronically depressed, but he didn\u2019t talk about feelings, so I started sneaking shots of the Tanqueray he kept in the freezer. I became a touring musician, and on my short visits home we maintained an unspoken agreement: I wouldn\u2019t bother my father with who I really was, and he wouldn\u2019t ask.I told all of this to the journalist the night before I boarded a plane to Texas. It was too much for him. Then my father died, and I sank into despair. When it came to dating, I felt hopeless. I thought: Why even bother? As soon as a guy finds out about my baggage, he bolts. I may as well walk around with a \u201cDanger: High Maintenance\u201d sign strapped to my chest.Around this time I received an OkCupid notification that someone had \u201cliked\u201d my profile. I logged on, saw a black-and-white photo of a man\u2019s jawline and clicked.\u201cAbout me,\u201d it read. \u201cI\u2019m a feminist. I respect women while simultaneously enjoy dominating them.\u201dGreat. One of those \u201cFifty Shades\u201d opportunists. I was appalled, of course, so I kept reading.\u201cFavorite things: Sending you to work with marks, the fragrance of your hair lingering on my hands, photography and Dan Savage.\u201dOr could I? I was an adult. Just because I wasn\u2019t dating didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t reply.I opened up a message box and typed: \u201cBig fan of Dan Savage. I\u2019m intrigued.\u201d I hit send and then ran out of the room, screaming.One week and dozens of emails later, Dan and I agreed to meet at Prospect Park. He was handsome, mid-30s, dark brown eyes and hair. Very fit. He told me he\u2019d been a \u201cdominant\u201d for years and lived with his girlfriend in an open relationship. They had rules: no unprotected sex, no sleepovers, no kissing. I had never met a man who communicated his needs so confidently.\u201cWhere would we meet?\u201d I asked.\u201cYour place, before work. 6 a.m.\u201d\u201cYou need to tell me everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of your baggage. Any triggers. I want you to keep a journal and send it to me, too. I have to know what might come up.\u201dLater, after that third date, we agreed on a set of rules and boundaries. I shared everything I was usually too afraid to tell a new partner.\u201cMy dad died three months ago,\u201d I said, \u201cso maybe we avoid the \u2018daddy\u2019 stuff?\u201d\u201cGot it. What else?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a blackout drunk, but if I drink I get really depressed. I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t drink around me.\u201d\u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like you to be fully aware anyway.\u201dFor the next two months, Dan texted me constantly. His aura of calm control was a revelation for me. Rather than fleeing from my emotional baggage, he welcomed it without fear or judgment.The nights before his visits I would stay up until 4 a.m. cleaning, eager to please him. He would ring my doorbell as the garbage trucks blared down the street, and it was exhilarating \u2014 until it was exhausting. Though Dan wouldn\u2019t admit it, he was a sadist. He would leave me with bite marks and bruises that lasted for weeks.And I was not a masochist. I hated the pain but found catharsis in how undeterred Dan was by my outbursts. I would cry when his leather belt stung my thighs, but he never tried to curb or deny my feelings. I could sob from the physical pain and then about everything else I had been too afraid to talk about: the relationship I would never have with my father, my impulse to deaden everything with a drink. None of it fazed him.Then Dan would leave and I would sit alone in my bedroom, his sweat still fresh on my skin, wanting so badly to be held.I wasn\u2019t the only woman he visited. He would tell me stories of other women he was sleeping with, and I\u2019d repress any feelings of jealousy. I thought he was more evolved than I, as if attachment were some sort of moral failing on my part.Then an old fling of mine came to town and asked me out to dinner.\u201cUh-oh, he might want to come home with me!\u201d I texted Dan, playfully.\u201cCareful,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t like to share.\u201dI stared at my phone, startled. Since we weren\u2019t romantic, I had assumed he wouldn\u2019t care.\u201cDates are fine, but I don\u2019t want you sleeping with other men,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf that\u2019s a problem, we may need to reassess.\u201dI told Dan I needed time to think about it, and then I went on the date.My friend and I stayed out until 2 a.m., laughing and making out, and I saw how much I missed being kissed and the warmth of another body. Dan had a partner to go home to, and I was on my own. Was this really what I wanted?In the end I kept coming to the same conclusion: This would never be enough. If I had worked up the courage to be forthright with him at the beginning, then I could walk away, too.A few days later, I texted: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just need more.\u201d\u201cIf you change your mind,\u201d he replied, \u201cyou know where to find me.\u201dI had found a strange liberation in submitting to Dan, but it was only a first step. I wanted the domination, but I needed lazy Sundays and walks in the park, too. I wasn\u2019t sure what that kind of relationship would look like. I just knew I couldn\u2019t continue hiding \u2014 from myself or others.So I went back on OkCupid and created a new profile. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a monogamous long-term partner whose natural dominant qualities complement my submissive,\u201d I wrote. \u201cThat kind of trust takes time to build, but I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But if fuzz gets you down, take it off with a paring knife or vegetable peeler. Or substitute smooth-skinned nectarines. In any case, use the juiciest fruit you can find.

I tugged on my pilly cardigan and patted down my frizzy bangs.When a waiter presented a tray of sliced cucumbers and prosciutto and asked, \u201cCrudit\u00e9?\u201d I resisted the temptation to shove three of them into my mouth and instead smiled and replied, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d I was focused on the task at hand: pretending not to be a fraud among this crowd of professionals. This is not a unique feeling, and it hits many of us at some point in our lives. But some researchers believe it hits minority groups harder, as a lack of representation can make minorities feel like outsiders, and discrimination creates even more stress and anxiety when coupled with impostorism, according to Kevin Cokley, a professor of educational psychology and African diaspora studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Cokley said he was inspired to study impostor syndrome after experiencing it in his own field, where he was in the ethnic minority, too.\u201cI felt like an impostor, I felt like people were looking at me and that I was going to be found out as not belonging there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I became interested in it.\u201dHe and his colleagues found that African-American college students had higher levels of anxiety and discrimination-related depression when they had significant levels of impostorism.Rosanna Durruthy, the head of global diversity, inclusion and belonging at LinkedIn, said that as a minority, you can begin to dismiss your own perspective, credibility and authority.\u201cBeing alone puts you in a circumstance where you\u2019re not only questioning yourself, but also looking for agreement in others,\u201d she said.Ms. Durruthy added that minority workers should remember that they bring a different, unique perspective, which is a valuable asset.Learning to be assertive is easier said than done, especially when you feel like an outsider, and Ms. Durruthy added that the issue is a systemic one that companies should be willing to address themselves. On an individual level, however, she and Dr. Cokley suggested a few \u201cimpostor-slaying\u201d tactics.It\u2019s important to find workers with similar backgrounds and experiences. \u201cPeople high in impostorism typically struggle alone, silently,\u201d Dr. Cokley said. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling that way, you are most certainly not the only person feeling that way.\u201d He recommends joining or creating an affinity network, \u201ca group of people who are similar to you, based on gender or ethnicity, and you can talk about your vulnerabilities and insecurities.\u201dMany workplaces offer their own affinity groups, also called employee resource groups or shared interest groups, for employees who may need the support of peers with shared experiences. You may also be able to find affinity alumni networks through your college, and on social media platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook, or just create a more intimate group with a few friends dealing with the same issue. You just want to surround yourself with other people who can relate. A mentor is especially helpful for those dealing with impostorism because he or she can serve as a professional anchor, Ms. Durruthy said. Your mentor will ideally have experiences similar to your own and be willing to share advice on how to deal with those experiences. \u201cLook for someone whose accomplishments and approach to how they perform, how they interact with people, how they think about things, you find valuable,\u201d she said.A mentor should also encourage you to hone your own unique perspective and skills, Ms. Durruthy said.Keep a daily diary and record every instance in which you receive positive feedback, Dr. Cokley advises.\u201cDo that over the course of a week or a month and go back and look at all those instances in which you\u2019ve gotten good feedback, where you\u2019ve been told you\u2019ve done a good job and done something well,\u201d he said.When your impostor feelings take over, this daily diary can serve as a reminder that you\u2019ve earned your way to this position. A work diary can also help you identify discrimination.\u201cYou don\u2019t really know whether your feelings of impostorism are due to being a minority \u2014 i.e., being underrepresented \u2014 versus being treated differently,\u201d Dr. Cokley said. Another benefit to keeping a work diary: You can use it to keep track of your own progress and accomplishments. That way, when it\u2019s time to negotiate your next raise, you\u2019ll have evidence to make the case for a pay increase. Ms. Rae said that while she still occasionally battles with feeling like an impostor, it helps to have a mantra reminding herself that she\u2019s worked hard to earn her spot.\u201cI made it here,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t just get lucky, and no one is going to tell me I don\u2019t belong here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Means to Be Loved by a Dog", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 There\u2019s a story my husband has been telling for nearly 15 years, since not long after United States forces invaded Iraq. In a news report, American soldiers were going door to door with bomb-sniffing dogs, trying to persuade the citizens of Baghdad to adopt a well-trained pet.The Iraqi homeowner in the story looked at the G.I. and shrugged. \u201cThen you would be loved by a dog.\u201dMy husband thinks this story is hilarious because it reminds him of the small-town Southerners and country people he grew up among \u2014 and also because it is so deeply at odds with the attitudes of suburban America, with its pet strollers and doggy day cares and canine pulmonologists. Iraqi soldiers would have no better luck persuading suburban Nashvillians to banish their dogs to the yard than American soldiers had in persuading Iraqis to invite a dog into the house.The outpouring of kindness reminded me of the days just after my mother\u2019s sudden death, when it seemed that everyone I knew brought flowers and food and sweet notes. It might seem disrespectful to compare the loss of even the dearest animal companion to the loss of a beloved mother, but it makes a particular kind of emotional sense. Everyone has a mother, and the profound grief of losing her is one most people instinctively understand, even if their own mothers are alive and well. Everyone who\u2019s ever loved a dog knows the true depth of that loss, even if they\u2019ve never met the specific dog being mourned.As it happens, Emma was my mother\u2019s dog first, and losing her has been a double grief. I miss her inimitable sandwich-snarfing, bookshelf-climbing, purse-raiding, cabinet-unlocking, smoothie-stealing, ever-grinning rascal self. I miss the way, even in her nearly blind, completely deaf, partially paralyzed old age, she wanted to be right beside me, tugging her little bed till it was directly under my feet while I worked.That little dog caused my lonely mother untold exasperation and delight. Emma would drag Mom\u2019s purse under the bed to a place Mom couldn\u2019t reach even lying on the floor. Mom would get up from her chair for half a minute and turn around to find Emma in her place, lapping up the coffee she\u2019d left on the table beside the recliner and finishing off the oatmeal too. Half the stories Mom told her grandchildren at supper every night were stories about me as a little girl. The other half were about Emma.A dog loves a person the way people love each other only while in the grip of new love: with intense, unwavering focus, attentive to every move the beloved makes, unaware of imperfections, desiring little more than to be close, to be entwined, to touch and touch and touch. For my mother, who never ceased to miss my father and who must have felt herself to be on the margins of her children\u2019s busy lives, it was nothing less than a godsend to be loved by that little dog.Every time Mom went to visit my sister or my brother, she would leave Emma with me. For days, the dog would sit before our back door, the same door my mother used every night when she and Emma came over for supper. The window in that door is the only one in our house that reaches low enough for a dachshund to see through. She would sit in front of the door and wait. She waited and waited \u2014 she had endless reserves of patience and time \u2014 and three days later, a week at most, my mother always came back to her.Two weeks after the funeral, Emma went missing when she was outside with me. That tiny, dapple-colored dog was both willful and invisible: She never once came when called, and she could disappear beneath the lowest bushes, behind the smallest fallen branch. I turned that yard inside out looking for her. When I finally thought to check at Mom\u2019s house across the street, I found her at the back door, jumping up and scratching to be let in. She had been scratching so urgently, and for so long, the paint was chipped away from the doorjamb.That\u2019s what it means to be loved by a dog.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Retreats on Separating Families, but Thousands May Remain Apart", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump caved to enormous political pressure on Wednesday and signed an executive order meant to end the separation of families at the border by detaining parents and children together for an indefinite period.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have strong \u2014 very strong \u2014 borders, but we are going to keep the families together,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.\u201dBut ending the practice of separating families still faces legal and practical obstacles. A federal judge could refuse to give the Trump administration the authority it wants to hold families in custody for more than 20 days, which is the current limit because of a 1997 court order.And the president\u2019s order does nothing to address the plight of the more than 2,300 children who have already been separated from their parents under the president\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy. Federal officials initially said those children would not be immediately reunited with their families while the adults remain in federal custody during their immigration proceedings.\u201cThere will not be a grandfathering of existing cases,\u201d said Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Wolfe said the decision about the children was made by the White House.But later Wednesday evening, Brian Marriott, the senior director of communications for the agency, said that Mr. Wolfe had \u201cmisspoke\u201d and insisted that \u201cit is still very early, and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter.\u201d Mr. Marriott said that \u201creunification is always the goal\u201d and that the agency \u201cis working toward that\u201d for the children separated from their families because of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy.His statement left open the possibility, though, that the children could be connected with other family members or \u201cappropriate\u201d sponsors living in the United States, not necessarily the parent they were separated from at the border.The president signed the executive order days after he said that the only way to end the division of families was through congressional action because \u201cyou can\u2019t do it through an executive order.\u201d But he changed his mind after a barrage of criticism from Democrats, activists, members of his own party and even his wife and eldest daughter, who privately told him the policy was wrong.Mr. Trump had previously been told by advisers that there was no way for the policy to be changed through an executive order, and it was unclear what the genesis of the measure he signed was. But the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, had concerns about moving ahead with an executive order that would face an uphill battle in the courts.The president\u2019s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, did not voice major objections, according to a White House official. The move also helped alleviate pressure on Kirstjen Nielsen, Mr. Kelly\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and handpicked successor at the Department of Homeland Security.Stories of children being taken from their parents, audio of wailing toddlers and images of teenagers in cagelike detention facilities had exploded into a full-blown political crisis for Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans, who were desperate for a response to those who have called the practice \u201cinhumane,\u201d \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cevil.\u201dThe president\u2019s four-page order says that officials will continue to criminally prosecute everyone who crosses the border illegally, but will seek to find or build facilities that can hold families \u2014 parents and children together \u2014 instead of separating them while their legal cases are considered by the courts.But the action raised new questions that White House officials did not immediately answer. The order does not say where the families would be detained. And it does not say whether children will continue to be separated from their parents while the facilities to hold them are located or built.Officials on a White House conference call said they could not answer those questions.Justice Department officials said the legal authority to end family separation relies on a request they will make in the coming days to Judge Dolly M. Gee of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles, the daughter of immigrants from China who was appointed by President Barack Obama. She oversees a 1997 consent decree, known as the Flores settlement, which prohibits immigration authorities from keeping children in detention, even if they are with their parents, for more than 20 days.The 1997 case imposes legal constraints on the proper treatment of children in government custody, which stopped Mr. Obama after his administration began detaining families together during a similar flood of illegal immigration several years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s on Judge Gee,\u201d said Gene Hamilton, the counselor to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cAre we going to be able to detain alien families together or are we not?\u201dMr. Hamilton said the judge\u2019s previous rulings prohibiting extended detentions of families has \u201cput this executive branch into an untenable position.\u201dWith Republicans in the House and Senate pursuing different approaches to put a stop to the heart-wrenching scenes at the border, no legislative breakthrough seemed imminent.Republicans in the Senate have proposed narrow legislation that would end the practice, while House Republican leaders are focused on a broader bill, though its passage was in doubt on the eve of Thursday\u2019s vote.In the meantime, legal experts said it seems highly unlikely that the courts will agree to the request by the Trump administration. That would mean the president is almost certain to face an immediate legal challenge from immigration activists if the government tries to detain families for more than the 20-day limit.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to see little children detained for long periods of time,\u201d said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the Trump administration\u2019s separation of families. \u201cIf they start detaining families and kids in tents or other places, I think you will see immediate lawsuits.\u201dKevin Appleby, a senior director at the Center for Migration Studies, predicted such a challenge.Advocates said officials should jail only those immigrants who have committed other crimes, are a flight risk or pose a danger to others.\u201cIt is outrageous that the president is pushing the criminal detention of innocent children as a solution to his own evil act,\u201d Mr. Appleby said. \u201cThe best solution would be releasing families to sponsors or placing them in community-based alternatives to detention programs, which are less expensive and much more humane.\u201dUntil Wednesday, Mr. Trump had refused to simply end his government\u2019s zero-tolerance policy that was announced last month and led to the separation of more than 2,300 children from their parents, saying that the alternative would be to fling open the country\u2019s borders and allow immigrants who cross the border illegally to remain in the United States.But the president, furious about the pummeling he has taken in the news media in recent days, began casting about for a solution to the politically damaging situation, people familiar with his thinking said.He made his announcement flanked by Vice President Mike Pence and Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, and vowed not to relent in his administration\u2019s prosecution of people trying to enter the country illegally.\u201cWe are keeping a very powerful border, and it continues to be a zero tolerance,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally.\u201dBut he added, \u201cThe border\u2019s just as tough, but we do want to keep families together.\u201dIn signing the order to end the separation of families, Mr. Trump also abandoned the positions that he and his allies had stuck to for weeks: that Democrats were to blame for the wrenching scenes of kids being torn from their parents, and that the administration was helpless to fix the problem without action by Congress to overhaul immigration laws.In effect, though, the president was caught between his messaging and the likelihood of inaction on Capitol Hill. That became clearer on Tuesday when Republicans in the Senate and House moved in different directions on confronting the family separation issue.The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.Mr. Trump acknowledged his position during remarks to reporters before his announcement on Wednesday.\u201cThe dilemma is that if you\u2019re weak, if you\u2019re weak, which some people would like you to be. If you are really, really pathetically weak, the country\u2019s going to be overrun with millions of people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re strong, then you don\u2019t have any heart. That\u2019s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I\u2019d rather be strong.\u201dIn addition to the public condemnations of his policy \u2014 including by Pope Francis on Wednesday \u2014 Mr. Trump had been lectured by the first lady, Melania Trump, and Ivanka Trump, his eldest daughter, according to White House officials.Melania Trump had been pushing her husband about the family separation policy from the beginning, an official said, arguing that there was a middle way between opening America\u2019s borders and tearing children away from their parents. Separating children from their mother and father, she told him, is wrong.Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were also pressing the president to find a way to end the political crisis caused by the family separations at the border, according to people familiar with their conversations.But it is not clear what the political damage may be to Mr. Trump from having taken actions that he repeatedly said he was not allowed to do.As recently as Tuesday, in a speech to the National Federation of Independent Business, the president insisted that there were \u201conly two options: totally open borders or criminal prosecution for law breaking.\u201d\u201cAnd you want to be able to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people pouring into our country.\u201dThe president has also opened himself up to charges of hypocrisy. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly slammed Mr. Obama for abusing his executive authority when he issued an executive order to protect the young immigrants known as Dreamers.As a candidate, Mr. Trump said he would use executive orders sparingly, adding that \u201cObama, because he couldn\u2019t get anybody to agree with him, he starts signing them like they\u2019re butter. So I want to do away with executive orders for the most part.\u201dMr. Obama, whose administration also grappled with how to handle massive flows of illegal immigrants from Central America, has remained mostly silent during the controversy over the separation of children from their parents at the border. But in a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr. Obama denounced the lack of morality in a policy that leads to the kinds of scenes that have played out across television screens during the past several weeks.\u201cTo watch those families broken apart in real time puts to us a very simple question: are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents\u2019 arms, or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together?\u201d Mr. Obama wrote. \u201cDo we look away, or do we choose to see something of ourselves and our children?\u201dMichael D. Shear and Abby Goodnough reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Katie Benner and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Texas Man\u2019s Near-Fatal Lesson: A Decapitated Snake Can Still Bite", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is a widely known fact that a chicken with a severed head can still run, but a decapitated snake? It can still bite.Jeremy Sutcliffe, a 40-year-old Texas native, found this out the hard way. He and his wife, Jennifer, were outside doing yard work on the morning of May 27 when Ms. Sutcliffe discovered a four-foot-long, dirt-colored rattlesnake in their garden. She screamed. Her husband abandoned his lawn mower and ran to her, grabbing a shovel and lopping off the creature\u2019s head with a single swing.After about 10 minutes, her husband tried to dispose of the snake\u2019s severed head, Ms. Sutcliffe, 43, said in an interview. When he reached down, the snake \u2014 a Western diamondback \u2014 sank its fangs into his hand and held on for about 30 seconds.\u201cFinally he got the snake head pulled off,\u201d said Ms. Sutcliffe, who is a nurse. \u201cI called 9-1-1 and just started driving because I didn\u2019t know where to go exactly, what hospital carries antivenom.\u201dAs she drove, her husband started having seizures and fading in and out of consciousness, she said. After transferring him to an ambulance, the authorities called a helicopter to take him to a hospital in Corpus Christi, Tex., about 40 miles from their home city of Sandia, that carried antivenom.\u201cHe said, \u2018If I die, I love you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sutcliffe recalled. \u201cI think he knew it was bad.\u201dBy the time Mr. Sutcliffe reached the hospital, his right hand \u2014 its middle and ring fingers punctured by the snake\u2019s venomous fangs \u2014 had swelled and was covered in dark blisters. The doctors told Ms. Sutcliffe that her husband was in septic shock and suffering from internal bleeding and low blood pressure.Eventually, even with 26 doses of antivenom in his body (the average treatment is between two and four), the doctors had to put him in a medically induced coma.Four days later, on May 31, Mr. Sutcliffe woke up, clueless about how he had wound up in a hospital bed. Later in the week, when his memory of the attack returned, he said he wished he could go back in time and do things differently.\u201cJust knowing a snake head could still bite after it dies would\u2019ve prevented him from getting bit,\u201d Ms. Sutcliffe said. \u201cA lot of people at the hospital had no idea. There\u2019s not a lot of education out there about what you\u2019re supposed to do with a snake.\u201dA bite from a decapitated snake can be even more deadly than a bite from a living one, said Christine Rutter, a veterinarian at Texas A&M University\u2019s Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences. If possible, a decapitated snake head will try to empty out its glands, Dr. Rutter said. It\u2019s almost like a Hail Mary pass in football.\u201cAll the hormones, adrenaline, is maximized,\u201d she said, \u201cso whenever they bite, they give it all they have.\u201dQuentin Remsburg was 19 when he got a little too close.On Aug. 18, 2016, he was on his way home in Shade Gap, Pa., when a neighbor flagged him down. She needed help removing a timber rattlesnake from her backyard.With a three-foot shovel, Mr. Remsburg and another neighbor managed to chop off the snake\u2019s head. Mr. Remsburg went to scoop the head up, but he somehow managed to fling it onto his hand, where it latched onto his left index finger. About three seconds passed before he pried it off. His whole hand was swollen.He was hospitalized for three days before returning home. Nearly a week later, his hand started throbbing and burning. His mother drove him back to the hospital, where he learned his blood platelet level had fallen to around 10,000. A normal count is at least 150,000.Mr. Remsburg, now 21, learned his finger, which had turned dark blue, had developed gangrene and had to be amputated. It took him nearly a month to relearn everyday tasks, like tying his shoe and turning a doorknob.When he heard about Mr. Sutcliffe\u2019s injuries, he reached out on Facebook to let the Sutcliffes know they weren\u2019t alone. \u201cI know exactly what he feels,\u201d Mr. Remsburg said.Although Mr. Sutcliffe has Medicare, the couple will still shoulder about 20 percent of the costs, his wife said. Her husband qualified for the insurance program in 2011, after he was temporarily paralyzed by Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body\u2019s immune system attacks the nervous system. He hasn\u2019t been able to work since.Ms. Sutcliffe said she and her husband have marveled at his unusual medical history: \u201cHe says, I\u2019ve got to be either the unluckiest person or the luckiest person, because I\u2019ve survived both.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Wins Exclusive U.K. Rights to Broadcast Some Premier League Matches", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A generation ago, Sky, then an upstart satellite broadcaster, outbid rivals for the rights to televise the Premier League. The deal revolutionized the fortunes of the TV service, and helped turn the British soccer league into one of the world\u2019s most watched \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 in sports.Another transformation now appears to be underway. Amazon, which is increasingly pushing beyond its e-commerce origins, won rights on Thursday to broadcast Premier League games in Britain for the first time.Amazon\u2019s deal highlights the seismic shifts happening in sports and television entertainment, as deep-pocketed digital outlets compete with traditional broadcasters like NBC, Disney and, in Europe, Sky. The fierce battle between Silicon Valley companies and historically dominant studios and broadcasters has extended from developing new scripted shows to broadcasting live sports.The matches that Amazon will broadcast, available to its Prime members in Britain, are relatively minor. It will showcase 20, scheduled at times when there tends to be lower viewership than normal. But Amazon\u2019s victory was in how it can deliver the games: While digital companies have typically bought only the digital streaming rights to sporting events, Amazon\u2019s deal includes the exclusive rights for the matches it shows.\u201cPrime Video continues to drive Prime member adoption and retention,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote.The company has also sought to develop scripted entertainment, earning awards and acclaim with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d though it still lags behind competitors like Netflix.In Britain, Amazon will share the broadcast rights to the Premier League with two British heavyweights \u2014 Sky Sports and BT Sport. Sky and BT will televise the vast majority of matches on offer, totaling 180 in all. Those matches will be at times that are more likely to garner high levels of viewership.The auction for Premier League broadcast rights was held in February, but only Sky Sports and BT won partial rights at the time.\u201cWe welcome Amazon as an exciting new partner, and we know Prime Video will provide an excellent service on which fans can consume the Premier League,\u201d Richard Scudamore, the Premier League\u2019s executive chairman, said in a statement on Thursday.Digital media companies have long proclaimed an interest in sports rights, but they have largely failed to enter competitive bids for marquee properties. And while sports leagues are eager to increase the number of bidders, they have shown a reluctance to turn over rights wholesale to digital partners, preferring instead to craft deals that include digital streaming on top of traditional TV broadcasting.But the format of the Premier League\u2019s auction makes it easier for digital media companies to compete. While most large rights packages in the United States are for seven seasons or more, the Premier League offers only three-season blocks, lowering the get-in cost. The 200 Premier League games on offer were also split into seven packages of 32 or 20 games each, making it easier for Amazon to dip a toe in the water, albeit in a smaller market than the United States.The revenue for the Premier League rights in Britain is supplemented by income from broadcast deals elsewhere, including in the United States, where NBC televises the matches, and in China, where the digital broadcaster PPTV holds the rights.An earlier version of this article misstated when Amazon took over streaming rights for some N.F.L. games. It was in April 2017, not this year.Prashant S. Rao reported from London, and Kevin Draper from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Christian Colleges, a Collision of Gay Rights and Traditional Values", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySPRING ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 It\u2019s no secret that Christian colleges do things differently than their secular peers. There are behavior codes, required Bible study, Christian-infused curriculums (think: environmental protection as \u201ccreation care\u201d) and weekday chapel.But where these campuses once existed in a bubble, new economic, social and cultural realities are letting outside air rush in \u2014 and with it, controversy.For a generation of students that is connected, inclusive and risk-averse, Christian colleges present an interesting puzzle. On one hand, they offer \u201csafety\u201d in contrast to drinking and hookup cultures (alcohol and sex are forbidden) and take seriously their call to produce \u201cdeeper souls,\u201d as Shirley Hoogstra, president of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, put it.But they are also grappling with a giant generational rift over what it means to be Christian \u2014 from students\u2019 more accepting views of L.G.B.T.Q. individuals and the conviction that faith demands social justice activism, to their comfort with using social media to organize a counter movement.Unlike their elders, many students want to use their love for Jesus not to uphold traditional values, but to engage with and change the world, pushing Christian campuses to a careful openness.Stephen Mortland, vice president for enrollment management and marketing at Taylor University in Upland, Ind.,said that unlike the past when campuses protected students\u2019 faith from outside tampering, Christian colleges now help them explore, even challenge beliefs.\u201cThis is not some Christian Disneyland,\u201d Mr. Mortland said. The goal \u201cis not to indoctrinate. I\u2019m not afraid that God is not real.\u201dColleges discuss evolution (an alternative theory), science, refugees and the role of women.\u201cIf we want our alums being the hands and feet of Jesus, we can\u2019t have them scared to talk about the things that everyone is talking about,\u201d said Mary Hulst, pastor at Calvin College, in Grand Rapids, Mich.In some ways, Christian colleges look on trend. Their sweet spot of missions abroad and deep community service speak to a generation seeking not just a future paycheck but meaning and impact.Certainly, most applicants to Christian colleges are \u201calready familiar with religious things,\u201d Dr. Hoogstra said. But competition for enrollments at all colleges has Christian schools working harder to get more of the flock to campus.That means reaching students with interests beyond what have traditionally been schools\u2019 strengths \u2014 like ministry, nursing, social work and education. Christian colleges are beefing up or highlighting offerings in STEM fields like engineering and computer science. They are partnering with secular medical, law, and pharmacy schools to ensure slots for graduates.And they are facing declining teen demographics head on, borrowing secular tactics like targeting prospective students when they are younger and hiring recruiters in growing markets like Texas and Florida.Then there is the personal attention that many colleges can\u2019t offer: Mr. Mortland last year began inviting emailed prayer requests. \u201cI want parents to know we are with them in this process,\u201d he said.But while Christian colleges are outwardly projecting a more open, contemporary tone, on campus they are grappling with perhaps the most divisive issue they have faced in years \u2014 treatment of L.G.B.T.Q. individuals. Being gay barely warrants a shrug at secular colleges, but it is setting off bottle rockets at Christian ones. (After interviewing Dr. Hulst about L.G.B.T.Q. issues and making plans to hear her preach \u2014 she suggested a pizza gathering and discussion with students \u2014 this reporter was told by a college official not to visit).At some Christian colleges, L.G.B.T.Q. students meet in secret and form clubs, communicating on Facebook with code names. Some feel isolated, caught in families who view as troubled their \u201cstruggles with SSA,\u201d or same sex attraction as one parent put it on Facebook, or are kicked out of homes for coming out, as a student from Texas described to me.The values guidance that students come for \u2014 to help them prepare for life and relationships as well as careers \u2014 can be alienating to L.G.B.T.Q. students. It is partly the ban on L.G.B.T.Q. faculty, but it is also the constant grooming of students for heterosexual marriage that leaves gay students like Gwyneth Findlay, who just graduated from Calvin, with \u201cno framework for the future I am going to have.\u201dThe career center workshop on balancing work and life \u201cof course, it is three heterosexual couples,\u201d Ms. Findlay said. And when professors share stories of dating, spouses and children that \u201ca lot of students learn from,\u201d she said, it\u2019s a reminder that she is not fully part of the community.Divisions on Christian campuses spring from divergent views over homosexuality and what it means to be Christian. Where an older generation focused on sharing the gospel, as one Calvin student put it, now \u201cthere is more than spreading the message. There is living out the message.\u201dYouth consider L.G.B.T.Q. fairness a social justice issue where elders see \u201ca morality issue, an obedience issue,\u201d Dr. Hulst said. \u201cWhich is why we are talking past each other.\u201dStudents see no conflict between their faith and their L.G.B.T.Q. identity. \u201cI am a gay Christian. That is how I identify,\u201d said Erin Green, who majored in Biblical Studies and just graduated from Azusa Pacific University in California.Yet on some campuses, acknowledging or supporting L.G.B.T.Q. students is controversial, partly because of conduct codes and official faith statements, which typically define sex as reserved for marriage between one man and one woman for life.In February, Everett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, posted a long, vitriolic response to stories in The Pulse, a student news source at his alma mater, Spring Arbor University in Michigan, in which gay students were seeking affirmation and conversation.\u201cHow about \u2018a conversation about how to bring feelings of white supremacy and faith into the light\u2019 at the local Christian college?\u201d he wrote. Why, he asked, \u201cdo we \u2018normalize\u2019 one sinful habit and predisposition but yet still condemn another?\u201dOn a sunny Sunday in April, she stood before a park pavilion, picnic tables piled with hot dogs (vegan and not), buns, cookies and fixings, and spoke to 60 people \u2014 supporters from Hope College and Soulforce, a Christian gay rights activist group, had driven hours \u2014 for a groundbreaking event: a walk to support L.G.B.T.Q. students at Spring Arbor.Reading from her iPhone, Ms. Stout, wearing a jean jacket with a rainbow scarf knotted at her neck, sought forbearance as she quoted from the apostle Paul, thanked those who came, and apologized for the need. \u201cQueer S.A.U.,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry this event is necessary.\u201dAfter the walk, a professor approached to speak said, \u201cI\u2019d better not.\u201dBrian Kono, university chaplain, said he was there, \u201cbecause I love our S.A.U. students.\u201d Kim Hayworth, vice president for student development and learning, said any fears students expressed about not being accepted on campus or not being allowed to show support for L.G.B.T.Q. students \u201cis a misinterpretation of the handbook.\u201dMark Yarhouse, director of the Institute for the Study of Sexual Identity at Regent University, said that in his recent longitudinal study of 160 gay students at 14 Christian colleges, 80 percent found a way to reconcile their identities.\u201cVery few reject one in order to have the other,\u201d said Dr. Yarhouse, adding that his sample was students who are both \u201chighly religious\u201d and gay.This is feeding an L.G.B.T.Q. Christian movement \u2014 from the Reformation Project, to recast church teaching, to the Brave Commons, activists on Midwestern campuses \u2014 pursuing visibility and inclusion. They are comfortable with social media and thrusting the issue into the public arena, casting themselves as \u201cnot far-off from the wild-eyed radicals who started Christianity in well-heeled Rome,\u201d said Joshua Kam, a Hope College graduate, and Brave Commons leader at the Spring Arbor walk.And they are using Scripture to make their case, challenging Bible translations, including \u201cclobber passages\u201d casting homosexuality as a sin, with \u201cSide A theology\u201d that says the Bible affirms same-sex relationships.Austen Hartke, a transgender author who spoke at Calvin in March, said Genesis did not explain everything. God created light and dark, \u201cbut we have dawn and dusk,\u201d he said. God created land and water, \u201cwe have swamps and estuaries.\u201dUntil recently, most Christian colleges didn\u2019t admit to having L.G.B.T.Q. students. But the increasing visibility of gay marriage plus the mingling of Christian colleges with mainstream institutions is changing that.Azusa Pacific \u2014 which competes for students with the University of Southern California and University of California, Los Angeles \u2014 is working to broaden its appeal. There are tuition discounts and new agreements with area high schools to attract students. Shino Simons, dean of students, said prospective students \u201cneed to know that we are faith-based.\u201dYet, that no longer means silence around sexual identity. \u201cWe do have L.G.B.T.Q. students on campus,\u201d Dr. Simons said, \u201cand we want to support them on their journey.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The administration is scheduled to release on June 15 a final list of Chinese products covered by $50 billion of tariffs. It said that it will impose the tariffs shortly thereafter. China has threatened to retaliate.The Trump administration has two choices. It can settle for relatively unambitious gains and try to spin them as significant. Investors would welcome that outcome. Voters may, too. Alternatively, Mr. Trump can keep demanding big changes in China, and possibly plunge the U.S. into a drawn-out trade war. The imposition of the metals tariffs shows that he is willing to follow through. But it\u2019s still not clear how he will respond when his trade measures do significant harm to businesses or the financial markets.That moment may not be far away.-- Peter EavisReplacing him will be Hans Vestberg, currently the president of the company\u2019s global networks.\u2014 Michael de la MercedDuring his tenure as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam helped reshape the telecom giant \u2014 and part of that was through deal making. Not all of the transactions were particularly flashy, but they tended to follow one of two paths: Overhauling the company\u2019s network operations or building up its digital media division (which is now called Oath).Here are Verizon\u2019s top transactions since Mr. McAdam became C.E.O. in 2011, according to data from Thomson Reuters:\u2022 Verizon had asked Shari Redstone, the media company\u2019s controlling shareholder, if it would ever come up for sale, according to CBS\u2019s lawsuit against Ms. Redstone last month.\u2022 It briefly looked at buying the assets of Fox that Walt Disney ended up agreeing to acquire for $52.4 billion, including the 20th Century Fox movie studio and cable channels like FX.We\u2019ve looked at that over the years, and we made our decision to go digital. That\u2019s why we bought AOL and Yahoo, and we talk now about superchannels of sports and finance and news and some entertainment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn his seven years as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam was known for his relentless focus on his company\u2019s wireless network and his aversion to striking big, splashy deals.As Verizon prepares for the telecom industry\u2019s future \u2014 where the only certain things are the rise of 5G wireless technology and online video streaming \u2014 here\u2019s what two research analysts think about what the company has done and where it\u2019s headed.Craig Moffett, MoffettNathansonMr. McAdam will be defined by the deals that he didn\u2019t do. Unlike AT&T \u2014 which paid nearly $50 billion for the satellite TV service DirecTV and is trying to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion \u2014 Verizon never struck splashy acquisitions, aside from those of Yahoo and AOL (combined purchase price: $9.2 billion).But that conservatism has worked in Verizon\u2019s favor. DirecTV has steadily lost customers in this age of cord-cutting, dragging down AT&T\u2019s financial health.\u201cI think he deserves a lot of credit for avoiding some of the traps that some of his peers have fallen into,\u201d Mr. Moffett said of Mr. McAdam.As for the fear underpinning many telecom companies\u2019 deal-making \u2014 that sticking to basic internet and phone service is boring \u2014 Mr. Moffett said Verizon has shown that worry to be unfounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about being a distribution channel?\u201d he told me. \u201cVerizon fully understood and embraced that there will always be a place for an advantaged network \u2014 and people will pay a premium for it.\u201dAmy Yong, MacquarieMr. McAdam\u2019s relentless focus on making Verizon\u2019s network the best in the U.S. has paid off handsomely, with the company earning a premium from investors based on the strength of its core business.The big question is whether that will be enough going forward, as rivals AT&T and T-Mobile pursue bold moves.Verizon\u2019s cautious strategy may ending up costing the company. Though AT&T\u2019s bet on wireless video streaming hasn\u2019t paid off yet, if it works, it will make that company a formidable creator and distributor of content. And T-Mobile and Sprint could prove to be a strong new rival if their proposed union works out.\u201cThe future is looking very different,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat worked in the past may not be what works in the future.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedA new report suggests that Apple is preparing to sell fewer phones later this year. It may sound worrying. But we\u2019ve seen similar news before, and the fallout is unlikely to be all that bad.But Apple\u2019s phones are getting more expensive, so every sale counts for more. And its services businesses \u2014 things like Music and Pay \u2014 are becoming an increasingly valuable revenue stream, meaning that the company can make more money off existing users even if they don\u2019t upgrade to the latest device.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe job faced by investigators of car collisions is getting more difficult as autonomous car features become more advanced, and the way they do their jobs might need to change to accommodate that.In March, a Tesla Model X collided with a concrete lane divider as it was driven down a highway in Mountain View, Calif. A new report by National Transportation Safety Board investigators suggested that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology played a role in the death of a Tesla owner.The driver was using the advanced driver assistance features traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer lane-keeping assistance, which Tesla refers to as \u201cautopilot.\u201d As the Tesla approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of US-101 from the SH-85 exit ramp, it moved to the left and entered the gore area. The Tesla continued traveling through the gore area and struck a previously damaged crash attenuator at a speed of about 71 mph.Information isn\u2019t recorded in most cars\u2019 event data recorders, the automotive equivalent of airplane black boxes. Instead, the boxes show more basic information such as steering-wheel input and throttle.While automakers commonly provide the information if it is requested by the vehicle owner, accident investigators\u2014typically contractors hired by insurance companies\u2014say they sometimes have to seek a court order to obtain crash data.An update to the rules published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could change that situation, by demanding that automakers log more details about the vehicle\u2019s behavior.The complexity of the mathematical calculations involved means it\u2019s not straightforward to take the network apart to understand how it makes its decisions. This can make unintended behavior hard to predict; and if failure does occur, it can be difficult to explain why. If a system misrecognizes an object in a photo, for instance, it may be hard (though not impossible) to know what feature of the image led to the error.Many artificial intelligence researchers are trying to develop ways to make it easier to understand the inner working of A.I. systems. But for now, that\u2019s likely to involve looking at complex computer code. That suggests that crash investigation teams, as well as the regulations that are applied to automakers, might require an update in the near future, too.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeComcast is threatening to challenge Walt Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox. Behind the scenes, it\u2019s playing down investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 fears of an antitrust response. We may have just gotten a clue about whether it\u2019s right.The head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, appears unruffled about a Disney-Fox deal, at least. From an interview at The Deal\u2019s conference yesterday:\u201cThey had good advice and carved out surgically what a transaction is that might be doable and who knows where that transaction leads.\u201dBut Mr. Delrahim also defended his team\u2019s effort to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, saying it was a merger of a kind that federal regulators had sought to block for decades. (A federal judge is expected to rule on the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against the deal on Tuesday.)Mr. Trump is the black sheep of this family, the estranged sibling who decided to pick fights with his relatives just before arriving to dinner. The dispute, Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, acknowledges, is \u201cmuch like a family quarrel.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 any of that will affect America\u2019s trade policies. But diplomatic tensions look set to rise, and economic uncertainty would rise with them.Elsewhere in trade:The Trump administration removed crippling penalties on the ailing Chinese telecom company in exchange for $1.4 billion in fines and other measures. But did some other big gain drive the deal?Getting Beijing to approve Qualcomm\u2019s takeover of another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors? Maybe. China\u2019s latest trade concessions, which were linked to the Trump administration not imposing certain tariffs? Unlikely.More from Jane Mayer:A business associate who declined to be identified, in order not to jeopardize his ties to the family, told me, \u201cCharles pushed David out. It was done with a wink, and a nod, and a nudge.\u201dSF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group, a company controlled by top executives at the billionaire\u2019s investment firm, has a 15 percent stake in the horse, which is the heavy favorite to win tomorrow\u2019s Belmont Stakes.SF Bloodstock, which according to court filings is owned by SF Agricultural Holdings L.L.C., employs a for-profit model and focuses on the breeding side of the industry, purchasing stallions, or shares in them, and broodmares while selling yearlings at auction. In 2015, it entered into a three-year partnership with WinStar Farm and China Horse Club that allowed them to spend big while spreading risk at yearling and 2-year-old sales. That is how the group partly acquired Justify.Elsewhere in business and sports: An earlier version of this briefing misstated the name of the race that Justify is the heavy favorite to win.

DeepFarhad isn\u2019t quite ready yet, but our engineers are confident that it will attain Farhad-level insights fairly soon.But while you\u2019re still here in human form, let\u2019s talk about the year\u2019s biggest overarching tech narrative: the \u201ctechlash\u201d against companies like Facebook and Google over issues like privacy, data protection and antitrust concerns. As someone who has been mercifully spared from every twist and turn of the techlash, does it feel like a lot has changed since you left?When I left, Facebook was under the gun, Amazon was getting hit by President Trump, and Apple and Google were trying to stand clear of the fallout. Three months later, Facebook is still under the gun, the president still regards Amazon as a pariah, and Apple and Google still would very much like to be excluded from these narratives.I\u2019m not saying I was expecting wholesale structural change among entrenched businesses over the course of a season. But, still: For all the fireworks in Washington, there\u2019s been little movement on regulation or legislation to curb some of the excesses in tech. I don\u2019t see much of an advance toward stricter antitrust scrutiny of the large tech firms. And their most recent earnings reports show they\u2019re all going gangbusters; Americans may harbor growing worries about the power of tech companies, but not enough to make us quit them.Which isn\u2019t to say the techlash isn\u2019t real, just that change will come slowly. We\u2019re all living in a world where most communication and commerce is ruled by a handful of nearly unregulated oligopolies. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t change quickly, I guess.Techlash indeed!And then there was the bit about how we\u2019re all staring at our phones too much. The tech industry has been consumed recently by new worries over \u201ctech addiction,\u201d and both Facebook and Google recently announced plans to tackle digital \u201cwell-being.\u201d Now Apple\u2019s jumping in, too. In the next version of iOS, your phone will give you detailed stats about how often you use your phone and what you do on it, and it will even let you block yourself and your children from using certain apps.It seems slightly opportunistic to kick a social network while it\u2019s down, but Apple\u2019s aggressive criticism also highlights the real and growing philosophical differences between the two companies. Facebook is an advertising-supported communications conglomerate aimed at the masses, and dead set on remaining free so that all seven billion humans on Earth can eventually be connected (and monetized) through its platform. Apple is predominantly a high-end hardware business that caters to an increasingly privacy-conscious consumer base, and thinks that security will be a differentiating factor when people choose which smartphones, tablets and laptops to buy.Maybe it was inevitable that these two giants would clash, but to a tech writer who lives for drama, it\u2019s still interesting to watch.Anyway, that\u2019s all for now. Here\u2019s hoping that DeepFarhad is ready for next week\u2019s newsletter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Makina Cafe, Ethiopian Takeaway With Buoyant Injera", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City9 PhotosInjera is a certainty at every Ethiopian meal and the measure of every Ethiopian restaurant: floppy, featherweight flatbread as thin as a kerchief, with the sepia tinge of an old photograph. One side is smooth while the other has almost more holes than dough, from the bubbles that swell and pop as the batter settles on the mitad (griddle). In Amharic they are known as ain, or eyes, and the more of them, the better.The identity of its maker is a prized secret. Eden Gebre Egziabher, the truck\u2019s owner and chef, said simply, \u201cI have a lady. She\u2019s the best.\u201dTwenty years ago, war broke out between Ethiopia, Ms. Gebre Egziabher\u2019s home country, and neighboring Eritrea, where her parents were born. The Ethiopian government expelled residents of Eritrean descent, even those who were Ethiopian citizens, and refused to allow her mother, who had been visiting friends in the United States, to return.\u201cOne minute everyone was living together,\u201d Ms. Gebre Egziabher said. \u201cThe next, families were ripped apart.\u201d While she fled with her father and older sister to Kenya, her mother applied for asylum in the United States. A year later, they were reunited in Charlotte, N.C.Now, Ms. Gebre Egziabher hopes to turn the food of her childhood into an American staple \u2014 \u201cto bring my culture to Main Street,\u201d she said. Makina means truck in Amharic and Tigrinya, languages widely spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea, and has an echo of macchina, or automobile, from the Italian spoken by the countries\u2019 occupiers.For her menu, she intentionally chose dishes whose ingredients would not be intimidating to diners unfamiliar with the cuisine, she said, as in fossolia, a gingery simmer of string beans and carrots, and tikel gomen, cabbage gently broken down with carrots and potatoes \u2014 although not too much, so it keeps a memory of crunch.Most of the vegetables are mild, at times overly so, like collard greens, dark and tender but leaking too much water. I preferred misir, whole red lentils cooked briefly so they don\u2019t lose structure, humming with berbere, a spice blend whose sulky heat is tempered by warming cardamom and clove and the faintly scolding bitterness of fenugreek.Tibs, a celebratory dish made with nubs of chicken (dark meat only) or beef, is forthright in flavor, bearing swallowed smoke from the grill. Ms. Gebre Egziabher foregoes the traditional gloss of niter kibbeh, spiced clarified butter, for oil infused with the same spices, to make the food healthier but still rich.Three sauces are available: lemon and olive oil, a non-indigenous concoction without a trace of heat; awaze, fueled by berbere, albeit slightly toned down (\u201cit\u2019s usually much hotter\u201d); and the house Makina sauce, based on Ms. Gebre Egziabher\u2019s mother\u2019s recipe, a jalape\u00f1o inferno that bestows divinity on all it touches.At restaurants, injera is typically brought to the table sprawling to the edges of a gebeta, a round metal tray. Stews are spooned over it, and strips of injera are torn off to scoop them up. But a lunch truck can\u2019t package food this way; how would it survive the jostling trip back to the office, without the separate dishes merging into one?So Ms. Gebre Egziabher uses aluminum containers with three compartments, lining the largest one with a fold of injera and tucking an extra roll of it alongside. Where a restaurant might crowd a platter with ten dishes, the truck offers, for less than $10, a simple equation of meat and two veg \u2014 or no meat and three veg, if you prefer, in keeping with Orthodox Christian fasting traditions followed by close to half the population of Ethiopia and Eritrea, who abstain from meat for up to 250 days a year.For diners wary of injera, Ms. Gebre Egziabher offers rice, although in her household it was virtually unknown. \u201cI wanted to be authentic, but I had to face reality,\u201d she said. \u201cThe majority of the world eats rice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly Italy\u2019s involvement in Ethiopia. Italy occupied Ethiopia; it did not colonize it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comcast and 21st Century Fox in Focus After AT&T-Time Warner Approval", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle for the future of media has begun.How quickly are things changing? Netflix recently surpassed Disney to become the most valuable media company at $158 billion.That helps set the stakes for the pending clash between Comcast and The Walt Disney Company as each seeks to own the bulk of 21st Century Fox.The contest will pit Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, against Disney\u2019s Robert A. Iger in what could be a fierce bidding war for a significant chunk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire.Comcast, which already owns NBCUniversal, has put together a bid of slightly more than $60 billion in cash and contractual assurances that Fox would be paid what is known as a reverse breakup fee \u2014 perhaps as much as $2.5 billion \u2014 in the event a transaction is blocked by the government, the people said. But any regulatory concerns may be allayed by the straightforward approval of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington said the agreement could go through without either company divesting any assets.It is hard to overstate how closely Comcast was monitoring the situation. Executives at NBCUniversal had dispatched people to wait in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Mr. Roberts waited at his executive offices at Comcast\u2019s headquarters in Philadelphia, tuned to CNBC and keeping an eye on Twitter. According to a person familiar with the matter, Comcast\u2019s board met Tuesday evening to discuss its revamped bid for Fox, which rebuffed an overture last year.In November, Mr. Roberts traveled to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s estate in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to two people familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because it has not been made public. There, over glasses of wine produced from vineyards on the estate, Mr. Roberts broached the possibility of Mr. Murdoch making a deal with Comcast. Mr. Murdoch explained that talks with Disney had already begun, but that the companies were still $4 billion apart on price.Mr. Murdoch said he had wanted $56 billion, which Mr. Roberts then offered, according to the two people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Murdoch said he would take it to the board.The businesses that Mr. Murdoch has agreed to sell include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, almost two dozen regional sports networks like the Yankees\u2019 YES channel, a lineup of cable networks that includes FX and a 30 percent ownership stake in the streaming service Hulu.A deal would also include Fox\u2019s 39 percent ownership stake in the European pay TV operator Sky. Comcast has already made an offer to buy the other 61 percent of Sky in a separate deal. (The Fox News cable network, the Fox broadcast stations, the Fox Business Network and the sports network FS1 would not be part of a transaction.)Mr. Murdoch sees Disney\u2019s stock as ultimately more valuable than Comcast\u2019s, according to two people familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was still in process. Since Disney\u2019s bid is in stock, Mr. Murdoch is banking on a rise in the company\u2019s value over time. Comcast\u2019s all-cash offer would also mean an immediate tax hit.Each man vying for a piece of Fox is an accomplished dealmaker.Mr. Roberts spends a great deal of time analyzing merger possibilities and is always on the hunt. One of Comcast\u2019s most successful transactions was for control of NBCUniversal in 2011. In 2014, he bid for Time Warner Cable but walked away after the Justice Department said it was leaning toward blocking the deal.As the head of Disney, Mr. Iger has completed several major acquisitions, including the purchases of Pixar Studios, Lucasfilm and Marvel Entertainment, though all were private transactions that did not require approval of public shareholders.The Fox board has scheduled a shareholder meeting for July 10 to vote on the Disney offer, but that meeting could be moved back if Comcast makes its bid, as it is expected to do as a result of Tuesday\u2019s ruling.AT&T\u2019s victory shows the way forward for the media industry, which has grappled with a sharp slowdown in the past few years. The decline in pay TV subscribers has blunted businesses once thought to be invincible. ESPN, owned by Disney, has seen a significant drop in viewership as younger viewers spend more time on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.Mergers will allow companies to compete for costlier rights to professional sports, seen as perhaps the only way to keep viewers from cutting the cable cord, and to build out their streaming services.The pay TV industry may not be dying, but it is \u201cslowly grinding down,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a founder of research firm MoffettNathanson.Mr. Nathanson said he thought Disney will ultimately succeed in its pursuit of Fox because it has less debt than Comcast.\u201cBut at some point, if the bid is too high from Comcast,\u201d he said, \u201cthen Disney will have to walk away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Roberts Court Protects the Powerful for a New Gilded Age", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Purdy is a professor of law at Duke.Faith in courts runs deep in the American liberal imagination. Remembering Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade and the recent marriage-equality decisions, we keep hoping that wise and fair-minded judges will protect the vulnerable and lead the country toward justice.When it comes to economic inequality, today\u2019s Supreme Court is not only failing to help but is also aggressively making itself part of the problem in a time when inequality and insecurity are damaging the country and endangering our democracy.Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has consistently issued bold, partisan decisions that have been terrible for working people. Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, decided on Wednesday, was one of them.Just hours after that decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. With this \u201cswing\u201d vote gone, Chief Justice Roberts is now likely to take even more control over the direction of issues related to economic inequality \u2014 a direction that is earning him a legacy as chief justice of bosses, not workers.It\u2019s the kind of knotty technical issue \u2014 one type of fee for nonmembers of one variety of union \u2014 that makes law boring. Unlike the Masterpiece Cakeshop case the court decided in June, Janus isn\u2019t an obvious morality tale: Even many liberals often have mixed feelings about the public-sector unions that represent bureaucrats, subway employees, police officers and teachers.But Janus is big. As Justice Elena Kagan explained in her dissent, allowing employees to opt out of paying union fees while getting the benefits of representation risks starving the unions of resources, leading to ineffectiveness and collapse. Moreover, knifing unions at a time of intense controversy over state austerity budgets and widespread teachers\u2019 strikes suggests, as Justice Kagan wrote, that the court \u201cwanted to pick the winning side\u201d in these fights by \u201cweaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.\u201dThe New Deal shook American law. Its triumph brought new attention to economic power. Antitrust law worked to cut back corporate concentration and control. Labor unions were essential to what the Progressive-Era jurist Louis Brandeis called \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d \u2014 democracy adapted to a complex modern economy.Some people still imagine \u201cworkers\u201d as white men, but the American working classes are increasingly female, immigrant and nonwhite. There\u2019s no separating these hierarchies.The 1970s court also returned to its old habit of dressing economic power in constitutional principle. The dominance of the very rich in American politics is often attributed to the Citizens United decision of 2010, but that case only amplified a 1976 opinion, Buckley v. Valeo, in which the court shredded post-Watergate campaign-finance regulation and announced that private individuals could spend unlimited sums on candidates (including themselves). When the Roberts court used the First Amendment to protect corporate (and union) political spending in Citizens United, it was extending a longer-running trend. This is part of what Justice Kagan means when she observes that the conservative majority is weaponizing the First Amendment.These cases have the potential to make economic and political inequality significantly worse. Take the mandatory arbitration cases. In 1992, as the Supreme Court began to allow arbitration to enter employment relationships, only 2 percent of non-unionized companies imposed arbitration on their workers. Today the figure is 54 percent and sure to grow because it conveniently ties the hands of disgruntled or mistreated workers. These cases have replaced a majority of employees\u2019 legal protections with a system of private agreements that replicates the unequal bargaining power of workers and companies. Arbitration agreements will become only more important as \u201cgig\u201d employers such as Uber devise their contracts to get around labor law.And as the court used to recognize explicitly, there is no keeping economic power separate from political power. The remaining (disproportionately public-sector) unions are bastions of support for Democrats. The partisan overtones of suits seeking to weaken union influence are uncomfortably overt: The court was asked, in effect, to shift the rules in favor of Republican constituencies, and the votes fell out along squarely partisan lines.It is especially damaging for the court to rule with such unmistakable partisan implications when many still hope to see it stand as a forum of principle against the Trump administration\u2019s self-dealing, attacks on immigrants and other vulnerable groups, and general disregard for the procedural regularity that is the day-to-day life of the rule of law.But the challenge is deeper than partisanship. Democracy treats people as equals. An economy that makes them increasingly unequal undermines it.Justice Frankfurter was right. Economic and political matters are inseparable, and the law decides how they are stitched together. The Supreme Court can defend bosses\u2019 bargaining power, the political spending power of the very wealthy and the prerogative of states to deny health care to their low-wage workers \u2014 or it can curb these powers to support a modern safety net. It can tilt organized labor closer to a death spiral, as it did with Janus; but with different justices, it might recognize the importance of unions to postindustrial democracy, as previous courts did.These are choices. A different law of economic power is possible. In a time of significant economic inequality, we need campaign-finance laws that limit the influence of wealth and treat citizens as equals. We need a labor law that helps workers organize in new kinds of workplaces, such as home health care and the gig economy. We need antitrust law that can wrestle with the new quasi-monopoly power of platform-based companies such as Amazon and Facebook. We need forms of social caretaking and security that are even stronger and more universal than Obamacare.These aren\u2019t tasks for the Supreme Court. They are jobs for better legislators and presidents \u2014 and for scholars, unions and mobilized citizens. What is at stake is whether American democracy can overcome the new Gilded Age of inequality and insecurity. The justices, meanwhile, are part of the problem: In Janus and other rulings, they have retrenched on the side of private power and budgetary austerity. A different law of economic power will have to wait for a different court, and that will come only through winning elections. Those victories get more uphill every year, thanks in no small part to the current court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Some in Tunisia, Ramadan Is a Test of Personal Freedom", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTUNIS \u2014 Ramadan ends this week, and that comes none too soon for some in Tunisia \u2014 not least the hundred or so protesters who began the Muslim holy month demonstrating against the closing of most cafes and restaurants by drinking water and eating sandwiches in central Tunis in the middle of the day.The protest did not produce any change in the rules. But it did succeed in highlighting a still-taboo debate in Tunisia: how to govern life during Ramadan in a country where the Constitution, which was put in place after the overthrow of the country\u2019s dictatorship in 2011, enshrines individual liberties.Tunisia has less strict rules than other countries in North Africa, but for those who do not fast, the authorities still do not make it easy.Most of the members are atheists who have come together through online communities and have sought recognition of their individual freedoms in Tunisia through several previous protests, especially during Ramadan.\u201cLast year, we were only 20 in the street; this year we were a hundred,\u201d Mr. Kosksi said. \u201cPeople are scared to come and protest with us because it is difficult to own up to the act of nonfasting in Tunisia.\u201dIn Tunisia, the rules for cafes and restaurants about opening during Ramadan have been debated for years.There is no specific law in Tunisia forbidding the businesses to open, only an administrative memorandum, known as the Mzali, which gained its name from the prime minister who enacted it in 1981. It states that only cafes in \u201ctouristic areas\u201d can be given authorization to open, without defining where or how many.According to several nongovernmental groups, only about 600 cafes open in Tunisia during Ramadan. At the beginning of the holy month, the interior minister declared that no further cafes would be authorized to open this year.\u201cNinety-nine percent of Tunisians are Muslims, so the minority of the nonfasting must respect the majority,\u201d said the minister, Lotfi Brahem, who has since been dismissed for other reasons.His declaration caused the Freethinkers Movement to take to the streets, and it also stirred controversy on social media, which has been used by the nonfasting community to raise awareness about its cause.A similar movement, called Fater, which means nonfasting, started in 2013, when a blogger, Abdelkarim Ben Abdallah, created a Twitter hashtag, #Fater, to help nonfasting people find a place to drink coffee or have lunch.\u201cThe page has 90 percent activity, which means that people are sharing, reacting and commenting every day,\u201d Mr. Ben Abdallah said.During the first week after the release of the new version of the app, the option that got most clicks was the \u201cFater\u201d one, Mr. Chebbi said.\u201cWe also, out of Ramadan time, indicate restaurants that serve alcohol, and we put the prices of beer as well,\u201d Mr. Chebbi said. \u201cIt has been a choice of ours since the beginning, because we are inclusive.\u201d\u201cOur goal is to rally a lot of support so we can really advocate for a change in the law and also to push authorities to apply our constitutional rights,\u201d said Jabeur Ouajah, a coordinator for the collective.There is also nothing in Tunisian law to stop people drinking or eating in public during Ramadan, but most avoid doing so.\u201cI took the train to go to Tunis for a job offer; it is a long trip for me because I live on the coast,\u201d Rania Said, a Ph.D. student, said. \u201cI was so hot and I wanted to drink a bottle of water, but I did not dare to because you always fear the bad looks people can give you or even insults.\u201dThe cafes and restaurants that are open often do so discreetly, with windows blocked by curtains or newspapers, even if cigarette smoke and chatter still seep out to the street.It has not always been like this, however. After Tunisia gained independence in 1956, President Habib Bourguiba embarked on a relaxation of the conservative rules in the country, and most cafes in the \u201960s would open during Ramadan.\u201cI urge you, in the interest of Islam, to work harder to increase national production,\u201d Mr. Bourguiba said in a speech in the coastal city of Sfax, in eastern Tunisia, in 1964. \u201cShould you renounce the practice of fasting, you will not stop being Muslim.\u201dHe also prompted shock by drinking a glass of water on national television during Ramadan.Ezzeddine Ben Mbarek Hazgui, a left-wing opponent of Mr. Bourguiba who was jailed in 1973 for his political activities, recalled the atmosphere back then.\u201cI used to sit in a terrace of a cafe in Sfax, one of the most conservative cities in Tunisia, during the day, during Ramadan, and drink my coffee with no one staring or caring,\u201d he said.But Mr. Bourguiba\u2019s encouragement not to fast during Ramadan set off a religious reaction. By the time Mr. Ben Mbarek was freed from jail, in 1979, things were very different.As Mr. Bourguiba\u2019s power crumbled in the late 1970s under pressure from a resurgent Islamist movement, the president began to make an appeal to religious values. The Mzali circular restricting cafe openings was enacted as he tried to gain favor with the Islamists.\u201cReligion in Tunisia has always been used either as a threat or as a support for political goals,\u201d said Hmida Ennaifer, a religious scholar who taught at the Zitouna University, a religious college. \u201cThere has never been a rational public debate about how we want to live our religion and how the government should regulate all this.\u201dSome cafe owners do not ask for authorization to open during Ramadan \u2014 they just go ahead and do it. But bypassing the rules can cause problems.\u201cI had my cafe closed as soon as I opened it, and the police said it was because I had no authorization,\u201d said Naoufel Sanhaji, a cafe owner in Ariana, a northern district of Tunis. \u201cI went to every administration \u2014 there is no authorization. It is completely up to the police to decide to close your cafe or not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Long Can We Live? The Limit Hasn\u2019t Been Reached, Study Finds", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe mortality rate flattens among the oldest of the old, a study of elderly Italians concludes, suggesting that the oldest humans have not yet reached the limits of life span.A number of critics lambasted that research. \u201cThe data set was very poor, and the statistics were profoundly flawed,\u201d said Siegfried Hekimi, a biologist at McGill University.Anyone who studies the limits of longevity faces two major statistical challenges. There aren\u2019t very many people who live to advanced ages, and people that old often lose track of how long they\u2019ve actually lived. \u201cAt these ages, the problem is to make sure the age is real,\u201d said Dr. Barbi.Dr. Barbi and her colleagues combed through Italy\u2019s records to find every citizen who had reached the age of 105 between 2009 and 2015. To validate their ages, the researchers tracked down their birth certificates.The team ended up with a database of 3,836 elderly Italians. The researchers tracked down death certificates for those who died in the study period and determined the rate at which various age groups were dying. If the death rate kept exponentially climbing in extreme old age, then human life span really would have the sort of limit proposed by the Einstein team in 2016.But that\u2019s not what Dr. Barbi and her colleagues found. Among extremely old Italians, they discovered, the death rate stops rising \u2014 the curve abruptly flattens into a plateau.The researchers also found that people who were born in later years have a slightly lower mortality rate when they reach 105. \u201cThe plateau is sinking over time,\u201d said Kenneth W. Wachter, a demographer at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-authored the new study. \u201cImprovements in mortality extend even to these extreme ages.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not approaching any maximum life span for humans yet,\u201d he added.Brandon Milholland, a co-author of the study finding a limit to human life span, questioned the new paper. The research, he noted, was limited to just seven years in one country. \u201cYou\u2019re reducing yourself to a narrow slice of humanity,\u201d he said.Dr. Milholland also took issue with how the team analyzed their data. They only examined two possibilities: that the death rate continued its exponential climb, or that it turned into a flat plateau.The truth might be somewhere in between, he said: \u201cIt seems rather far-fetched that after increasing exponentially, the chance of dying should suddenly stop in its tracks.\u201d Dr. Hekimi, on the other hand, praised the study for the quality of its data and called its conclusions, \u201cvery interesting and surprising.\u201dThe new research doesn\u2019t explain why death rates flatten out in the oldest of the old. One possibility is that some people have genes that make them more frail than others. Frail people die off sooner than more resilient ones, leaving behind a pool of tough seniors. But Dr. Hekimi speculated that there might be other factors at play.Throughout our lives, our cells become damaged. We only manage to partially repair them, and over time our bodies grow weak.It\u2019s possible that at the cellular level, very old people simply live at a slower rate. As a result, they accumulate less damage in their cells, which their bodies can repair.\u201cThis is a reasonable theory for which there is no proof,\u201d Dr. Hekimi said. \u201cBut we can find out if there is.\u201dA flat death rate doesn\u2019t mean that centenarians have found a fountain of youth. From one year to the next, the new study suggests, they still have a much higher chance of dying than someone in her nineties.Exactly how long centenarians live may simply be a roll of the dice each year.But even if this turns out to be the case, Jeanne Calment\u2019s age won\u2019t be easily matched, said Tom Kirkwood, associate dean for aging at Newcastle University, who was not involved in the new study.\u201cThe higher the ceiling gets set as records are successively broken, the harder it gets to break it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Reality of a Migrant Shelter: Clean, Orderly and Devoid of Answers", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect as I walked from the security guard post to the biggest migrant children\u2019s shelter in the country on Wednesday. The site, a former Walmart Supercenter, rose before me in the late-afternoon South Texas heat.I\u2019ve been in both prisons and immigrant detention centers before. In 2012, I toured Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, where unaccompanied youths apprehended at the border were being housed temporarily. But I could not visualize what was inside this old Walmart: an indoor tent city, perhaps, with rows of cots and folding chairs? The mystery was heightened by the experience of Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, who tried but failed to get a tour and live-streamed every moment on Facebook Live.What, many asked, were they hiding?After spending roughly 90 minutes inside the shelter on Wednesday as part of a media tour, the answer was simple: nothing suspicious at all. But the brief visit raised more questions than it answered.The shelter, known as Casa Padre, was clean and orderly. The children \u2014 nearly 1,500 migrant boys aged 10 to 17, most of them from Central America \u2014 were well fed and well supervised. \u201cBuenas tardes,\u201d several of the teenagers told me, smiling.Nothing was out of place in Bedroom 53, one of more than 300. A picture posted on the wall appeared to show the children how their beds should be made. The boys\u2019 clog-style shoes were placed neatly next to the beds, awaiting lights out at 9 p.m.Casa Padre was not an indoor tent city. The interior was redesigned and reconstructed with classrooms and medical offices. It was crowded but not overcrowded. It was as if a small school and medical center had been airlifted and dropped into the middle of the world\u2019s cleanest Walmart.But the immediate visible condition masked larger issues.It was a place on the front lines of a border crisis. Twin forces \u2014 a surge in illegal border crossings and the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration, including its new zero-tolerance and family-separation policies \u2014 have made it necessary to turn Walmarts into shelters for some of the most vulnerable children in the world. These children seemed happy, and resilient, but their needs and their stories are complex, and they certainly need more than a bed, a haircut and a medical exam. Some crossed the border unaccompanied by any parent or guardian, but others became unaccompanied at the hands of the government, which separated them from their parents.And any detention center, especially for children, effectively feels like a prison. The shelter staff members admitted that they have had cases where kids have tried to run away. Time outside the building is limited: Officials said that the children get two hours of outdoor time a day on weekdays, and three hours a day on weekends. They also take field trips, including to beaches and parks.Weeks ago, the shelter had been licensed by the state to house 1,186 children. Now, after seeking a variance, it had a new capacity of nearly 1,500. One of the beds in Bedroom 53 was a newly added cot. The other four beds were on bed frames. I don\u2019t know if the boys felt hemmed in or uncomfortable now that they were five to a room instead of four: We were not allowed to interview the children.There were other ground rules, too: No cellphones inside. No cameras or recording equipment. No interviews with staff members. No interruptions of programs. The only photos and video of the tour were supplied by federal officials.The operators of Casa Padre \u2014 Southwest Key Programs, which receives federal dollars to run this and 26 other shelters in Texas, Arizona and California \u2014 were proud of their facility. Throughout the tour, a group of federal and Southwest Key officials led reporters around, answering questions as we walked but spending only a few minutes in different sections. Signs on the walls reminded staff members that the first thing to do if approached by a reporter was to call the police. We were welcomed, but we were carefully handled.As I left, I thought about 2012. I remembered the spotless, orderly rooms at the San Antonio base and the two calls allowed per week per child, the same as at Casa Padre. The faces and names of the youths had changed, the president in the White House had changed, the size of the housing had changed. But so much else was the same.Much has been made about the mural on a shelter wall depicting President Trump and a quote of his: \u201cSometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.\u201d But it was the quote on former President Barack Obama\u2019s mural that seemed the most on point: \u201cMy fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Remnants of the Disappearing Red Revolution", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSJan Banning sought out the local meeting places and day-to-day operations of the dwindling communist parties around the world. In the 20th century, communism swept across a third of the world and challenged global capitalism. In the 21st century, the movement\u2019s power is greatly diminished. Only five countries \u2014 China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam \u2014 claim to be communist states. Few, if any, of them embody the ideology Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels described in \u201cThe Communist Manifesto.\u201d \u201cI wanted to see what is left of this ideology, which, in its plea for social justice, has deeply influenced one and a half centuries of history but then seems to have evaporated within a few short years,\u201d he wrote. Readers won\u2019t find any evidence of teeming crowds or grand demonstrations in Mr. Banning\u2019s photos from Russia, Nepal, Italy, Portugal and India. In fact, they\u2019ll notice few people at all. Instead, they\u2019ll see modest local meeting places featuring party iconography, piles of books and binders, and the occasional individual sitting at a desk. \u201cI was more interested in the living rooms of these communist parties, the non-spectacular places where they\u2019re doing their day-to-day business, their everyday work,\u201d he said. That approach won\u2019t surprise those familiar with Mr. Banning\u2019s own work. In 2008, he gained wide recognition for his book \u201cBureaucratics,\u201d which depicts tax officers, clerks, police officers and other public officials from eight countries at their desks. In 2016, he published \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d a look at criminal justice in four countries. The intent of those projects was to explore one kind of system through cross-cultural comparisons.In \u201cRed Utopia,\u201d the similarities and differences among parties are likewise illuminated visually. A red color scheme and an unmistakable brand of drabness pervade most of the offices. But small distinctions \u2014 the specific selection of communist leaders whose images adorn the walls, for example \u2014 stand out upon closer inspection.Mr. Banning\u2019s subject choices reflect his personal interests. He chose Russia because it is Communism\u2019s birthplace. He chose Italy because its Communist Party was once uniquely powerful in Western Europe. He picked India, Nepal and Portugal because their parties still garner sizable support. In each country, he chose to include individual parties that appealed to him aesthetically.But in making those particular choices, Mr. Banning perhaps inadvertently captured a representative cross-section of communists today. In Russia and Portugal, he wrote, he encountered \u201cmostly disappointed elderly people.\u201d In Italy, he met many \u201cwell-educated young people\u201d and in Nepal, he found a \u201cjumble of young idealists and older seasoned executives.\u201d In the Indian state of Kerala, he wrote, party members more closely resembled \u201cold-fashioned social democrats\u201d than communists.\u201cAll in all, the Red Revolution seems to have disappeared beyond the horizon,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Banning has never been a communist \u2014 he\u2019s long associated the movement with authoritarianism and murder \u2014 but he is anticapitalist. Still, his eagerness to immerse himself in modern-day communism, he said, stemmed more from his interest in history rather than any sort of ideological curiosity.The time Mr. Banning spent among communists over four years did little to change his political views, he said. But it did make him wish for a day when people could have a robust alternative to neoliberalism, a force he describes in the book as a \u201cdangerous specter.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying we need the kind of communism we saw in the 20th century,\u201d he said. \u201cBut by God, we need something more revolutionary than we see around us now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revisiting the Images of Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s Camera Work Magazine", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLensTwo photographers have spent years compiling a complete set of Camera Work, Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s groundbreaking publication that helped shepherd photography into the art world.Sometimes you just don\u2019t want to botch the original. Cotton gloves protect from only so much and photographs fade every time they\u2019re exposed to light. So, how do you leaf through the 50 hand-printed issues of Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s Camera Work without distraction or fear of causing a disaster?The idea came to him in the spring of 2016 when he met Mr. Vreyen at the Photography Hall of Fame in St. Louis and the two discussed how nice it would be to hold a complete set of Camera Work \u2014 without worrying about destroying it. Camera Work, where Gertrude Stein published her first essay, marked a turning point for modern art. First created in 1902 and distributed in 1903 as a product of the Photo-Secession movement, the publication featured photogravures with text layouts based on the designs of William Morris, advertisements designed by Stieglitz and issues dedicated to prominent artists, including eventually, those outside the medium, like Picasso. Stieglitz also opened a gallery, \u201c291,\u201d to go with his periodical, until a decline in subscriptions brought on by World War I eventually did it in.It was not easy for Mr. Katzman to find his complete set. Individual issues are not often bound to their original covers. And because 75 percent of the images were created as photogravures, some of the plates have been detached from their original bindings.

{"Headline": "Stick Insects Are Easy Bird Food, and That Might Help Them Reproduce", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tough eggs carried by bugs that mimic plants may be spread by hungry birds to new locations where they hatch.It\u2019s obvious why a stick insect\u2019s wardrobe is the way it is. Look like a stick, avoid getting eaten. But scientists in Japan noticed that despite their camouflage, stick insects became bird food quite frequently. And they also wondered: why do their eggs look like seeds?Because plants can\u2019t move around on their own, one way they disperse their seeds is by creating seed-containing fruits that animals eat. Thus, as animals travel, relieving themselves along the way, the plants travel too \u2014 through their seeds. But many birds also eat insects. So the researchers reasoned, that just like the fruits, the insects could be a means for dispersal, as long as their eggs can pass through the birds unharmed.One thing that makes stick insect eggs different from most other insects is that they resemble seeds \u2014 same shape, size, color and texture. And they\u2019re coated in a chemical layer of calcium oxalate, the stuff humans find in kidney stones. As you might imagine, it doesn\u2019t dissolve easily. Some of these eggs, carried inside females in certain stick insect species, also don\u2019t need to be fertilized to hatch into viable offspring. An earlier hypothesis is that the thickness and shape of stick insect eggs protects them from parasitic wasps. But the researchers also wondered whether these hard-shell, every-ready eggs survive a bird\u2019s digestive tract.In 2015, Dr. Suetsugu and his team mixed dozens of these eggs into bird food and fed it to brown-eared bulbuls, birds that eat stick insects in Japan. Within three hours they were scavenging through bird excrement, looking for intact bug eggs under a microscope. A small percentage of the eggs from three species of stick insects made it through intact. But two years later, none had hatched. It\u2019s possible that the temperature and chemical environment inside the digestive tract \u201cmight have annihilated them, in spite of a lack of mechanical damages,\u201d they wrote. However, they repeated the experiment in 2017, with 70 eggs from a single species. Twenty percent made it through, and two of those hatched, proving that it was possible for birds that consumed stick insects to drop their eggs like seeds to new locations. Perhaps not coincidentally, the insects\u2019 egg production season overlaps with the birds\u2019 migration season. But even with flocks adding up to hundreds of birds eating stick insects and excreting their eggs, dispersal would be a rare occurrence, given that stick insects don\u2019t carry many fully developed eggs inside them, and so few make it through the brown-eared bulbul\u2019s digestive tract intact and viable. They now want to determine whether stick insects share similar genes in different locations along the birds\u2019 migration flight paths. They also want to know if stick insects might have some of the same genes as plants that rely on birds for seed distribution, which could be another sign that they\u2019re even more plantlike than we think. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of stickbug eggs that hatched following consumption by birds. It was two, not 14.Advertisement"}

In Times Square, where the movie was showing at the Regal Cinemas, a sign did not go up on Monday until this reporter asked where it was; that theater\u2019s manager declined to comment.The foundation posted its own warning: \u201cFor those who have been diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy \u2014 or are simply sensitive to flashing lights \u2014 and are planning to watch the movie, they should be advised that the flashing lights may trigger seizures in some people.\u201d\u201cThere are certain things that send an input into the brain that gets a little excitable,\u201d said Dr. Jacqueline French, the chief scientific officer of the foundation. \u201cAnd that input triggers a seizure.\u201dTo do so, the flashing lights have to occur at specific frequencies, the most common being between 10 flashes per second to about 25 to 30 flashes per second.

{"Headline": "Magnetic Sense Helps Billions of Moths on an Australian Migration", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResearchers say this is the first reliable evidence that insects can use Earth\u2019s magnetic field for navigation.Every spring in Australia, billions of bogong moths migrate from the arid plains of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to the meadows of the Australian Alps to escape the impending heat. There, they congregate in caves like living shingles, and go dormant over the summer. Autumn arrives, and they return to their birthplaces to mate, lay eggs and die. The eggs hatch into caterpillars that develop underground through winter. The cycle continues.How these animals complete this epic journey to a place they\u2019ve never been and back, traveling hundreds of miles at night, for days to weeks each way, has long been a mystery. But scientists have now discovered that bogong moths have a magnetic sense to help them. Australia\u2019s small, brown, ordinary-looking bogong moths are the only known insect besides the monarch butterfly to manage such a long, directed and specific migration. So the researchers captured bogong moths during their migration, tethered them to a metal rod in the center of a plastic drum and recorded what direction they rotated in response to a moving felt cutout of a mountain and a synthesized magnetic field, the same strength as Earth\u2019s.The moths flew toward the cutout, but got confused after a few minutes with the magnetic field pointing in a different direction. \u201cThey become completely disoriented, almost as if the landmark\u2019s disappeared,\u201d said Dr. Warrant. He thinks that the bogong moth integrates visual cues and magnetic signals, checking in every now and then to make sure they align. It\u2019s similar to how a hiker uses a compass, locating and relocating reference points like trees or peaks, as they appear and disappear from view. Whether the moths use celestial, terrestrial or a combination of beacons, remains unclear. And the big mystery remains: How do na\u00efve moths, coming from different directions, all know to go to these caves in the first place? The researchers are testing how the moths respond to projections of the Milky Way, how their brains\u2019 navigation center responds to magnetic fields and how genetics might allow young moths to access some kind of inherited map of their migration route.Then they\u2019ll just need to find the animal\u2019s magnetic sensor \u2014 the holy grail of magnetoreception. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a needle in a haystack,\u201d Dr. Warrant said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instagram Allows Longer Videos in Challenge to YouTube", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Expanding further beyond its origins as an app for sharing pretty photos, Instagram said on Wednesday that it will now allow users to post videos up to an hour long, a feature that will thrust it into direct competition with YouTube and its own parent company, Facebook.At an event in San Francisco that was delayed about 45 minutes because of technical issues, Instagram said it was debuting IGTV, a new video section for videos that are shot vertically \u2014 which is how people typically record things on smartphones. The company said it would also begin offering IGTV as its own stand-alone app in the next few weeks.Instagram made the announcement at a morning event that had the look and feel of a late-night rave.For nearly an hour, tech industry reporters and social media stars waited in a neon-lit room pulsing with music spun by a live disc jockey. Food was served with Instagram-worthy presentations, including a do-it-yourself a\u00e7a\u00ed station featuring the on-trend breakfast smoothie bowl, and a toast bar which, naturally, featured avocado toast.A company spokesman attributed the long delay before the presentation started to \u201ctechnical difficulties,\u201d and just minutes before Instagram unveiled its push into longer videos, its own blog published the news first.In many ways, Instagram is what Facebook is not. Instagram is native to smartphones, attracts a younger, thought-to-be cooler audience and is popular among celebrities and influencers \u2014 all traits that serve as catnip for advertisers.The new push from Instagram is an acknowledgment of the changing nature of online video viewing. IGTV will feature videos shot vertically to fill the screens of smartphones versus the landscape orientation of televisions and computer monitors. In addition, it was reaching out to the new stars of today\u2019s digital video world \u2014 social media stars with millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram.\u201cVideo is the way we hang out with friends, the way we pass the time, but the way we watch it is changing,\u201d said Kevin Systrom, Instagram\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTeens might be watching less TV, but they\u2019re watching more creators online.\u201dInstagram and YouTube are the two main platforms where creators build an audience to make money from advertising, sponsorship deals or merchandise. As Instagram adds longer videos to its platform, YouTube has been adding social-network-like features to allow creators to communicate more easily with fans.YouTube splits advertising revenue with content creators, something that Instagram does not offer. Mr. Systrom said IGTV will not do advertising at first, but he noted that it wants to do what\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d for creators in the future.Lele Pons, who has 25 million followers on Instagram, took the stage at the event and said she will host a new cooking program for IGTV. At a news conference after the event, Ms. Pons said it was hard to predict how the longer video format on Instagram will change the viewing habits of her fans. She said she will continue to split her efforts \u201c50-50\u201d between YouTube and Instagram.Earlier this week, Facebook announced that it would allow video creators to work more directly with the company. It introduced Brand Collabs Manager, a platform to connect video creators with sponsorship opportunities, opening the door for those with popular followings to earn more through advertising revenue.Whereas Facebook and YouTube are plowing money into buying original content for their video platforms, Mr. Systrom said Instagram had no such plans, because it wants to remain \u201cneutral\u201d for creators.Mr. Systrom said Instagram already employs people to monitor inappropriate content, but would add employees because of the longer videos. He declined to say how many people would be added. (YouTube has been plagued by a deluge of troublesome videos that have driven some advertisers from the platform.)Instagram said it was limiting the number of users who can post hourlong videos, with most users capped at 10 minutes. But the limits are temporary, the company said, and the long term goal is for users to face no time limits.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$16 Million vs. $4: In Fatal Police Shootings, Payouts Vary Widely", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a police officer fatally shoots a person, there are usually reasons offered: The officer was afraid for his life. The victim was reaching for his waistband or refused to show his hands. A glint looked like a gun.But when Robert Rialmo, a Chicago police officer, killed Bettie R. Jones, 55, there were no reasons to give. Officials acknowledged that Ms. Jones had not only been innocent, but had died while trying to help the police.Ms. Jones was not the only person killed that evening in December 2015 by Officer Rialmo. During the same incident, he fatally shot Quintonio LeGrier, a 19-year-old college student.Although a city review board found that Officer Rialmo\u2019s actions in both shootings were unjustified, Chicago could hardly have treated the two deaths more differently.Ms. Jones\u2019s family stands to receive one of the largest settlements ever in a fatal police shooting \u2014 $16 million, pending City Council approval.The difference, say lawyers who have represented families of shooting victims, is that in Ms. Jones\u2019s case the facts are unusually clear cut, while in Mr. LeGrier\u2019s, they are more in line with typical police shootings: murky, complex and disputed.In such cases, much depends on the word of the officer, who is usually given the benefit of the doubt. Much depends on whether the officer is deemed to have been reasonably afraid, whether or not there was an actual threat.The police say Mr. LeGrier had been charging at them with an aluminum baseball bat. His family says he may have been in the midst of a mental health crisis. Officers were responding to a 911 call from Mr. LeGrier\u2019s father, who said he feared his son was going to harm him. Ms. Jones opened her door to direct the police to the LeGriers\u2019 apartment upstairs. Accounts suggest that the police retreated, Mr. LeGrier came down the stairs, and he was near Ms. Jones\u2019s apartment door when Officer Rialmo began to fire.Although the review board said the LeGrier shooting violated department policy, Eddie Johnson, Chicago\u2019s police superintendent, determined it to be within use-of-force guidelines.On Wednesday night, the jury found that Officer Rialmo had reasonably feared for his life when he killed Mr. LeGrier, but still awarded $1 million before the judge voided it. Officer Rialmo remains on desk duty while a police panel determines his future.In the LeGrier case, the city opted to take its chances at trial. Settlement offers, like the one in the Jones case, come when those chances are not good for a variety of reasons, including the culpability of the officer, the degree of sympathy for the victim, the amount of publicity surrounding the death and whether the episode was captured on video.But there was another possible factor: the fact that the shooting took place in Chicago, said Robert Bennett, a civil rights lawyer who has represented the families in police shootings. In more conservative areas of the nation, where support for the police is typically robust, jury members can be loath to approve large government payouts to victims, Mr. Bennett said.But in diverse, liberal Chicago, police-community tensions remain high after a series of questionable police shootings. And jury awards in Chicago can be large \u2014 last year a man was awarded $44.7 million after his friend, a Chicago police officer, shot him in the head after drinking heavily.Below is a list of settlement amounts in other high-profile police shootings. In all of these cases, the person who died was black.LaTanya Haggerty, Chicago, 1999Ms. Haggerty, a 26-year-old computer analyst, was a passenger in a car that fled a police traffic stop and was chased for 31 blocks. Her family received what is still believed to be the highest settlement in a fatal police shooting.The officer who fired the fatal shot, Serena Daniels, said she mistook a cellphone Ms. Haggerty was holding for a gun. Officer Daniels and two other officers involved were fired after officials said they had ignored orders and fired without justification, but they were not prosecuted.Sean Bell, New York, 2006Sean Bell, 23, was fatally shot by the police on what would have been his wedding day. Five police officers fired a total of 50 shots into the car Mr. Bell was driving. The police said they believed, wrongly, that someone in the car had a gun because they had heard Mr. Bell\u2019s acquaintances discussing a firearm while leaving his bachelor party, which took place at a club that was under investigation. The total settlement was $7.15 million; about $3.9 million went to two passengers who were wounded. Three of the officers were acquitted of manslaughter; the other two did not face criminal charges.Walter L. Scott, North Charleston, S.C., 2015Mr. Scott was stopped for a broken taillight and fled on foot, possibly because he feared arrest for failure to pay child support. A video appeared to show the officer, Michael T. Slager, shooting Mr. Scott in the back as he was running away. Mr. Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison.Tamir Rice, Cleveland, 2014 Tamir Rice, 12, was carrying a replica handgun in a public park when an onlooker reported him to 911. Within two seconds of his arrival in a police cruiser, Officer Timothy Loehmann had shot the boy, later saying he feared for his life. The pellet gun was missing the orange safety tip that indicated it was a toy. The 911 caller had said the gun was \u201cprobably fake,\u201d but that information was not relayed to the officers. A grand jury declined to indict Officer Loehmann, who was later fired for lying on his police application.Laquan McDonald, Chicago, 2014Laquan McDonald, 17, was killed by a Chicago police officer as he was walking away from officers. He was armed with a knife that he had refused to drop. The officer, Jason Van Dyke, shot Mr. McDonald 16 times. Officer Van Dyke is facing charges of murder and aggravated battery.Philando Castile, Falcon Heights, Minn., 2016During a traffic stop for a broken taillight, Mr. Castile told the officer, Jeronimo Yanez of the St. Anthony Police Department, that he had a gun in the car (he was licensed to carry it). The officer told him not to reach for it, but then fired, later saying he thought that Mr. Castile was disobeying his order. The aftermath of the shooting was streamed live on Facebook by a passenger, Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, whose young daughter was in the back seat. Officer Yanez was acquitted of manslaughter charges but left the police department.Amadou Diallo, New York, 1999Mr. Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was killed by four plainclothes officers who fired a total of 41 bullets, 19 of which struck Mr. Diallo. Officers said they believed Mr. Diallo had a gun. He was unarmed.The officers, who were on patrol, said Mr. Diallo fit the description of a serial rapist. They said they mistook a wallet Mr. Diallo was holding for a gun. The officers were tried for second-degree murder and acquitted.Oscar Grant, Oakland, Calif., 2009Officers of the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Department were responding to reports of a fight when they ordered Mr. Grant, 22, to lie down on a subway platform. It is not clear whether he was involved in the fight. Though he complied with the order, one of the officers, Johannes Mehserle, shot Mr. Grant \u2014 who was unarmed \u2014 in the back. The officer said he thought Mr. Grant was reaching for a gun. Officer Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served 11 months in jail. The shooting was the basis for a film, \u201cFruitvale Station.\u201dMichael Brown, Ferguson, Mo., 2014 Mr. Brown, 18, was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a police officer who confronted him for walking in the street. The officer said Mr. Brown attacked him. The authorities found Mr. Brown\u2019s DNA inside the driver\u2019s door of the police vehicle, and on Officer Wilson\u2019s clothes and weapon. The shooting sparked protests across the country and unrest in Ferguson, but several investigations ended with no charges filed against Officer Wilson, who resigned.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Musical Beach Chairs", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesMy father\u2019s new wife occupies my mother\u2019s spot on the sand, but she can\u2019t know that when I put my hands in the dirt, I\u2019m communing across space and time with my mom.\u201cDo you like to garden?\u201dThe woman who asks this question is my father\u2019s new wife. To call her my stepmother feels too reminiscent of the wicked Disney characters that fill my daughters\u2019 bedtime stories. But it also feels too familiar, like there\u2019s something unearned about marrying into the title of \u201cmother.\u201dThe sagging beach chairs we\u2019re sitting in are holdovers from before my own mother died seven years ago, before I had daughters to read Disney fairy tales to, back when a little condo six blocks from the beach held the promise of sandy grandchildren and growing old. The chairs are still here, the house is still here, I am still here \u2014 but sometimes I blink and wonder what happened. How am I sitting here with my mother\u2019s former college roommate \u2014 just a face in 40-year-old photographs \u2014 until a few condolence emails turned into lunch with my newly widowed dad. It feels as if an understudy is suddenly filling in for the lead role. I want to tell my father\u2019s new wife that this privacy wall of Leyland cypresses now reaches above our rooftop. How two years ago, I had to call a tree service to top them off. I want to tell her about the crepe myrtles we planted that same September weekend \u2014 the ones Mom bought as garnish for my wedding reception \u2014 that blossom each August. And I want to tell her that I still remember the incongruous technicolor of the June flowers that stirred in the breeze outside my front porch as my world unraveled. It was a Sunday afternoon, less than a year after we\u2019d planted those Charlie Brown trees. My brother \u2014 visiting for the weekend \u2014 came outside with me, our ears pressed to the same cellphone so that our parents could tell us about a small spot on Mom\u2019s lung. That her persistent cough wasn\u2019t just a winter holdover. I want to tell my father\u2019s new wife that the biggest reason I resist moving from our little starter rowhouse in Baltimore is that my mother helped me plant this garden. I want to tell her that I garden because when I put my hands in the dirt, I\u2019m communing across space and time with my mother. How, on a recent spring afternoon after I had received some challenging news, the only person I wanted to call was my mom. And so, I rushed to the garden. If I couldn\u2019t talk this problem out with her, I would weed. All morning, I went at it. Sweeping piles of leaves from the patio, trimming hedges, and pulling thorny weeds by their roots, knowing that otherwise, they return only stronger. My mother taught me that. My mother taught me almost everything.But I say none of this to my father\u2019s new wife. I simply say, \u201cYes, I garden.\u201d She shimmies forward in her chair, in my mother\u2019s beach chair, and excitedly begins to tell me about a hydroponic gardening system she purchased from Bed Bath & Beyond. No soil required. How it\u2019s doing wonders for her basil and parsley. How she is strictly a container gardener. How she might start experimenting with lettuce varietals. This woman knew my mother when they were barely adults, before an age of Facebook and Instagram. She never saw what flourished under my mother\u2019s green thumb. I wonder if my father has told his wife about those gardens, left behind when he sold the family home. This shore house, with its slim landing strip of grass, forced Mom to relax and leave the shovel and gloves behind each weekend. I wonder how you grow a new marriage in soil where the old roots run deep. It\u2019s not her fault, this new wife. She can\u2019t possibly understand that, with a simple conversation starter, she\u2019s lobbed a grenade. She\u2019s just ad-libbing here. She is not a Disney villainess. Years from now, my children will remember her as a grandmother \u2014 even if they don\u2019t use that word. And so, I\u2019ve found myself redoubling efforts to make my own mother relevant to my young children. \u201cAre you excited that we get to spend the weekend at MM and Pop Pop\u2019s house?\u201d I ask my oldest daughter, now almost 6.Once, my mother and I arrived at the hospital\u2019s emergency department after another collapsed lung. A young female nurse triaged us, balancing compassion with humor. No sooner had she pulled the privacy curtain closed than my mom whispered, \u201cWhat do you think about her for Colin?\u201d referencing my brother\u2019s best friend. She was able to cut through the beeps and confusion and terror of an emergency room to see the bigger picture: That the world is filled with great people, and they all deserve to be brought together.Maybe my father\u2019s second chance at love would make her happy. Maybe she had some sort of heavenly hand in its inception. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. On my best days, that is how I explain our new paradigm to myself, this game of musical beach chairs. But on my worst days I\u2019m terrified that my vibrant mother will be the one to recede into old photographs. That my daughters will never know the grandmother who once knocked on a stranger\u2019s front door armed with tomato cages after noticing the novice farmer\u2019s struggling vines. It is my responsibility to tell her story, and I am consumed by the crippling fear that I will not tell it well. We leave the shore on a Sunday afternoon to drive back to Baltimore, to our city garden in summer bloom. My oldest daughter \u2014 who is not usually one for caution \u2014 slowly dips a measuring cup into a solution of fertilizer, delivering it to every flower in the garden as if each drop is sacred. \u201cMM and I used to do this,\u201d I say. I can\u2019t give her the grandmother she never met, but I can teach her to garden.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Timehop", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationSometimes my memory fails me: I miss the right turn, botch my bank\u2019s security questions, try and fail to picture Massachusetts on a map. Or I close my eyes, think \u201cthird grade\u201d and see nothing at all, backlit by the candles on a birthday cake.I used to think this stuff was gone forever, junked to make room for shiny new facts. My average teenage weekend was more thoroughly documented than all 94 years of my grandfather\u2019s life, and yet none of those iPhone photos or status updates seemed to have made it past my short-term memory. The pictures were forgotten in the very act of taking them, and on social media there was always so much going on \u2014 everyone I\u2019d ever met cracking jokes, promoting Etsy stores, threatening to strangle their shift supervisors \u2014 that I\u2019d log off, trembling, before I ever thought to look back into the past. Only recently have I learned that large amounts of what I thought I\u2019d forgotten did, against all odds, survive; they just needed to be coaxed out of hiding.Timehop is an app with a criminally simple premise. You grant it access to your photos and your various social-media accounts, and it culls from them a record of what you posted or snapped a year ago, and two years ago, and three, and so on. It is a beneficiary of the odd fact that as our digital footprints expand, Silicon Valley\u2019s major players must spend more and more money maintaining enormous digital garbage dumps, full of moldering tweets and flip-phone mirror selfies and old Facebook statuses composed in the third person.In the last week alone, that electronic landfill has produced some amazing things. There was a photo of my childhood dog gazing stoically out the window on his way to be put down, looking like Dorothea Lange\u2019s \u201cMigrant Mother\u201d as reinterpreted by a dying poodle. There was a play, in 56 near-identical photos, about a guy (me) who wants a decent Tinder profile pic but can\u2019t figure out what to do with his hands. There were countless Facebook wall posts from dimly remembered schoolmates \u2014 lines like \u201cim finee and yourselff?\u201d and \u201chahah not too good man, not too good\u201d \u2014 suggesting I spent much of 2006 just asking acquaintances how they were doing.These Timehops have become a key part of the routine by which, each morning, I try to restore my sense of self. Like millions of others, I live in an almost constant state of mild hysteria, cut at intervals with bottomless despair and the narcotized quasi-pleasures of public-radio podcasts and binged television. Friends and relatives and bosses mean well, but all their emails and texts can be a lot. Online, an army of braying hucksters \u2014 digital-branding specialists, celebrities in the middle of breakdowns, the president \u2014 saw away at my capacity for complex thought. I wind up pincered by the present, stuck in a stage right before object permanence: If something isn\u2019t directly in front of me, it doesn\u2019t exist.Compared with, say, books, or meaningful human interaction of literally any kind, Timehop might seem like a strange solution to this problem. After all, you\u2019re still looking at your phone \u2014 at posts studded with share buttons and interleaved with ads. But these posts are different, the Facebook statuses in particular. Wrung of their original value \u2014 a dopamine hit for me; granular user data for Mark Zuckerberg, various poorly regulated third-party merchants and Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 they seem somehow purified. Through them, I again become a person with a history, as opposed to a present-dwelling bundle of needs, responsibilities and resentments.I worried at first that my lack of new posts might ruin Timehop for me. Without fresh material, would my Timehop calcify, become rote? Would I come to expect certain posts on certain days? But I had forgotten, apparently, my immense talent for forgetting: I\u2019m on my fourth go-round now, and it\u2019s all brand new. I remember absolutely none of it.Daniel Kolitz is a writer who lives in Brooklyn.Advertisement"}

Filled with ricotta, topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked until bubbly, they\u2019re easier to make than lasagna and just as satisfying.But for a recent dinner party, I wanted something a bit lighter: still stuffed shells, just more summery. So I came up with a version that dispenses with the tomato sauce in favor of a lighter pesto. (Though if you miss that pop of red with your pasta, some sliced ripe tomatoes on the side would be more than welcome, as would a salad of dressed arugula or other greens.)The filled shells are drizzled lightly with olive oil, dusted with grated pecorino and bread crumbs, baked briefly in a hot oven until nicely browned, then napped with a bright green, garlicky pesto sauce.A quintessential party food, the resulting dish is more akin to crispy ravioli than a juicy, long-baked casserole. A word of fair warning: These shells can be addictive. For a fancier meal, serve 2 or 3 shells as a first course, followed by something from the grill. But it\u2019s also a satisfying as a main (5 to 6 shells will do).When it\u2019s time, I like to take the whole dish to the table and serve it family-style, passing the pesto in a small bowl.If you\u2019d rather spend a hot afternoon in some cool or shady spot instead of in the kitchen, you can easily get everything ready in the morning. Truth be told, you could even do it a day in advance. But, for those who are loath to boil a pot of water or turn on the oven when the summer heat is at full force, let me just say three little words: They\u2019re worth it. Advertisement"}

Where did it come from? It has indistinct antecedents in the adventure novel, the spy novel and the hybrid midcentury experimentations of Elmore Leonard, but realistically, the answer isn\u2019t pretty: Its pure form was the invention of Robert Ludlum and Frederick Forsyth, who set their lone heroes loose against immense forces in the 1970s and haven\u2019t come back for them yet.

{"Headline": "When Mild Hake and Bold Asparagus Meet, Opposites Attract", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrizzled with aioli, the two make for a one-pan meal that\u2019s fast, fresh and extremely green.As the season progresses, I will somewhat grudgingly include other ingredients on the plate \u2014 proteins, for example, like fillets of hake.Hake and asparagus are not necessarily an intuitive combination: In fact, they\u2019re practically a study in opposites. The fish is mild, pale, delicate and saline, while asparagus is forthright, grassy, verdant and earthy.But served together, they balance each other, bringing out the best in both. The soft fish and crisp stalks \u2014 all cooked in butter \u2014 make for a fine weeknight meal that\u2019s light, convenient and very fast.The convenience comes from being able to cook everything in stages in one large skillet. The asparagus goes first. Give it a quick saut\u00e9 while the seasonings have a chance to sink into the fish.Then, the fish gets its buttery turn, accompanied by scallions that caramelize and sweeten. The thin hake fillets will be ready before the asparagus even has a chance to cool down \u2014 though tenting the stalks with foil will give you a little more time, or a chance to drink some of the wine you opened for dinner.If you can\u2019t get hake, use whatever mild fish fillets are available, adjusting the cooking time depending on their thickness. For the purest of dishes, you could garnish with a few lemon wedges and stop right there. But, garlic lover that I am, I take things a step further with a simple homemade aioli. This particular recipe gives you a thin mixture, acting more like sauce than dip, adding richness without heaviness.Then drizzle it generously over asparagus and fish, and enjoy the way these two opposites can so happily share one plate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Coral Must Die", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a lab in Philadelphia, scientists are studying what it takes to kill \u201csuper coral\u201d to understand the impact of human activities on the mysterious reefs of the deep ocean.Getting here wasn\u2019t easy. They were clipped from reefs a thousand feet down in the Gulf of Mexico, and then housed inside a special refrigerated van which traveled by ship before an overnight express delivery to the lab. When the van broke down, some stayed in a chilled cattle trough. They were even packed into Mason jars on ice. Not all the jars made it, but the corals did.\u201cWe get really invested in them,\u201d said Ms. Weinnig. \u201cAnd then we kill them.\u201d Humans are pretty good at killing corals. Over the past thirty years, overfishing, pollution and climate change have knocked out about half the shallow-water reefs on the planet. The tentacled niblets being studied in this cold room are Lophelia pertusa. These widely abundant \u201csuper corals\u201d build huge reefs in cold waters around the world, as deep as 3,280 feet below the surface. They support as much biodiversity as tropical reefs and are home to brittle stars, octopuses, sharks, crabs and fish. But Dr. Cordes and Ms. Weinnig want to know just how much Lophelia can take. The survivors of today\u2019s death match will be candidates for unprecedented efforts to restore deep-sea environments affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Their results will also help inform future efforts to conserve vast areas of the deep sea. \u201cNow that we understand something about how it responds to climate change, we want to know how does it respond to oil spills, and how will it respond to future oil spills under climate change?\u201dIn today\u2019s experiment, six different types of Lophelia from the Gulf of Mexico, which are expected to respond differently to the stressors, will face oil, dispersant, and a combination of the two. Back in the cold room, Ms. Weinnig begins by jotting down the corals\u2019 health scores (all healthy) and noting the normal pH and temperature of the water. The tank that gets the oil acquires a sheen and highway-esque scent. The dispersant tank clouds up. She removes the remaining corals from their clean tanks and places them into the exposure tanks and waits. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find what makes it super,\u201d said Dr. Cordes. \u201cYou can\u2019t just look at them and tell. They\u2019re not wearing little capes.\u201d But to see which corals definitely are not super, it only takes a couple hours: In the dispersant exposure tank, a few fragments are already spitting out their guts (or filaments). Some make excess mucus, like humans when they\u2019re sick. The other stressors, including increased acidity, don\u2019t seem to bother the corals too much, alone or combined. Some corals even seem to investigate the oil with their tentacles. As sick as the corals got in any condition, only two fragments died \u2014 and that was in a tank with elevated temperatures and dispersant. This suggests that while Lophelia may be able to recover from an oil spill and cleanup under current climate conditions, coping with an environmental accident in a warmer ocean of the future may be too much for even this super coral to handle. Less toxic dispersants that exist but aren\u2019t widely used may reduces stress on the corals in the case of a future disaster.\u201cMost species can handle one stressor or a couple of stressors,\u201d said Dr. Cordes, \u201cbut when you really start piling on like that, it makes it tough \u2014 just like people.\u201dThe next step for the Gulf is restoration \u2014 something new in the deep sea. Every reef ecosystem is a little different: certain problems require corals with certain superpowers. Dr. Gates says restoration of deep-water reefs threatened by drilling will be a challenge, because poorly understood reef ecosystems are difficult and costly to access. Dr. Cordes worries that Lophelia, which takes forever to grow, won\u2019t mature quickly enough or fare well in new habitats. And he is concerned that taking even a few corals from healthy reefs during the transplantation process may cause more harm than good. If those reefs suffer and the transplants don\u2019t grow elsewhere, then \u201cthe total net could be less than what you started with,\u201d he said. If scientists decide to go this route, he adds, restoration will start with small pilot studies before embarking on anything large-scale. That these long-lived, charismatic animals command attention at the surface gives him hope.\u201cThere\u2019s some sort of inherent sense of the fact that they should be protected,\u201d Dr. Cordes said. \u201cThese are also in the deep water. They\u2019re doing a lot of the same things the shallow-water reefs are doing, so we should be protecting these too.\u201d A picture caption in an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a biologist. He is Sam Vohsen, not Vhosen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Firefox Is Back. It\u2019s Time to Give It a Try.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixDo you ever feel that the web is breaking?When shopping online for a toaster oven, you can expect an ad for that oven to stalk you from site to site. If you have just a few web browser tabs open, your laptop battery drains rapidly. And don\u2019t get me started on those videos that automatically play when you\u2019re scrolling through a webpage.The web has reached a new low. It has become an annoying, often toxic and occasionally unsafe place to hang out. More important, it has become an unfair trade: You give up your privacy online, and what you get in return are somewhat convenient services and hyper-targeted ads.Mozilla recently hit the reset button on Firefox. About two years ago, six Mozilla employees were huddled around a bonfire one night in Santa Cruz, Calif., when they began discussing the state of web browsers. Eventually, they concluded there was a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the web.\u201cIf they don\u2019t trust the web, they won\u2019t use the web,\u201d Mark Mayo, Mozilla\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. \u201cThat just felt to us like that actually might be the direction we\u2019re going. And so we started to think about tools and architectures and different approaches.\u201dMost notably, Firefox now offers privacy tools, like a built-in feature for blocking ad trackers and a \u201ccontainer\u201d that can be installed to prevent Facebook from monitoring your activities across the web. Most other browsers don\u2019t include those features.After testing Firefox for the last three months, I found it to be on a par with Chrome in most categories. In the end, Firefox\u2019s thoughtful privacy features persuaded me to make the switch and make it my primary browser.Here\u2019s why you should consider it, too.Firefox especially stood out for some privacy features that are baked into the browser. Inside the privacy settings, you can turn on tracking protection, which blocks online trackers from collecting your browser data across multiple websites. With Chrome, you can install a third-party extension to block trackers \u2014 but the fewer add-ons you have to tack onto your browser, the better.Security experts applauded Mozilla for stepping up its efforts on privacy.\u201cFirefox does seem to have positioned itself as the privacy-friendly browser, and they have been doing a fantastic job improving security as well,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights nonprofit. \u201cOn the other hand, Google is fundamentally an advertising company, so it\u2019s unlikely that they will ever have a business interest in making Chrome more privacy friendly.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t have privacy without security on the web,\u201d said Parisa Tabriz, a director of engineering for Google who specializes in security.In fact, both Chrome and Firefox have tough security. Both include sandboxing, which isolates processes of the browser so a harmful website doesn\u2019t infect other parts of your machine. So if you loaded a website with malicious code, it would be contained within the webpage so it couldn\u2019t infect your files, webcam and microphone.Google said there was one thing it could do better on: the inclusion of privacy settings to block tracking technology, similar to the tools that Firefox includes.\u201cI think that\u2019s something that we can improve on,\u201d Ms. Tabriz said. \u201cFirefox has some settings that we\u2019re also exploring.\u201dWhich browser is faster?Mozilla\u2019s promise that Firefox consumes less computer memory raises hopes that it should also use less battery life. Yet in my tests on a laptop running a script that automatically reloaded the top 10 news sites, Firefox lasted only a few minutes longer than Chrome before the battery was depleted. On another test, which involved streaming a Netflix video on a loop on each browser, the battery lasted about 20 minutes longer when the Chrome browser was used.Yet the path forward for Mozilla looks increasingly promising for consumers.In addition to the normal Firefox browser, Mozilla offers Firefox Focus, a privacy-centric mobile browser that blocks trackers by default and purges your web browsing history as soon as you close out of a page.These are privacy-conscious web products that Mozilla is in a position to expand on in the long term. The nonprofit has no direct relationship with advertisers; it gets a small sum from search providers like Google and Bing when a search is conducted through their sites using a Firefox product.For Mozilla, there\u2019s a plus side to being the underdog.\u201cThe advantage of when you get beaten down is you kind of drop some of your own ego around your decisions,\u201d Mr. Mayo said. \u201cWe had a lot less to lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Festival Where Refugees Cook for New York", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week, refugee chefs take the helm at local restaurants to celebrate their foods and cultures, in an effort that started in Paris and has spread to 13 more cities.On Wednesday afternoon, in a basement kitchen in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan, a cheerful woman in blue sneakers and pink-striped leggings chopped piles of parsley and mint leaves, making quick work of it with her 12-inch chef\u2019s knife. Rings on, hair up, she was testing a new Iranian-style falafel sandwich for the menu of Taim restaurant.\u201cIn Iran, we eat falafel with torshi,\u201d she said, opening a jar of tart, pur\u00e9ed pickles she had made by cooking eggplant with vinegar and dried mint.The cook, who would share only her first name, Nasrin, for fear of endangering her family still in Iran, is a refugee in the United States. She left Tehran in 2014, heading for Turkey, worried for the safety of her three children. The four of them have been living in Queens since the fall of 2016.The festival, which started in Paris in 2016 to help change the perceptions of refugees in France and to bring people together around the dinner table, is now celebrated around World Refugee Day (June 20) as a series of meals cooked by 100 refugees in 14 cities around the world, including Amsterdam, Cape Town and San Francisco. The 100 participating restaurants cover the costs of ingredients for these meals, pay the chefs for their work and donate a part of the profits to the local refugee organization of their choice. Taim is donating $1 for every one of Nasrin\u2019s sandwiches.According to data from the United Nations refugee agency, 65.6 million people were displaced in 2016, and more than half of the world\u2019s 22.5 million refugees are children.Before she was displaced, Nasrin worked for several years as the chef of an upscale gym back in Tehran, cooking traditional Iranian fare like rich eggplant dips and saucy meatballs filled with hard-boiled egg and apricot, and serving it all poolside. \u201cPeople were going to the gym to get skinny, but the food I made didn\u2019t make them very skinny,\u201d she said with a laugh.Nasrin had learned to cook when she was still in middle school, in her mother\u2019s kitchen \u2014 a huge space with two ovens, a gas range and a large refrigerator, overlooking grapevines in the yard. She was taught to make falafel by her cousin\u2019s husband, who ran a restaurant in the south of Iran, and she now adds black and white pepper to the basic mix, along with a mix of dried spices including coriander, fenugreek, turmeric and ginger. Nasrin plans to cook it with chicken at Le Coq Rico, a high-end French restaurant that specializes in poultry. She isn\u2019t intimidated, only excited: On the menu, she pulled together several well-known dishes, along with a few that she considered surprises.Bastani sonnati, a frozen dessert she made with cream and slivered pistachios, and perfumed with rose water and saffron, is one of two sweets she is planning; she said she rarely sees it in the United States. The other is a tender, syrup-soaked cake, served as a little petit four in a delicate paper wrapper.\u201cI want other refugees to see that there\u2019s an opportunity to bring their culture here,\u201d said Nasrin, moving on to the task of slicing red peppers. \u201cI want people at the dinners to have a good time, I want them to enjoy themselves. But I also want them to learn about new flavors from Iran.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Former Walmart That Is Now a Shelter for Almost 1,500 Migrant Children", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBROWNSVILLE, Tex. \u2014 In the loading docks, children sat in a darkened auditorium watching the animated movie \u201cMoana.\u201dWhere there were once racks of clothes and aisles of appliances, there were now spotless dorm-style bedrooms with neatly made beds and Pokemon posters on the walls. The back parking lots were now makeshift soccer fields and volleyball courts. The McDonald\u2019s was now the cafeteria. All this made it difficult to visualize what the sprawling facility used to be \u2014 a former Walmart Supercenter.The converted retail store at the southern tip of Texas has become the largest licensed migrant children\u2019s shelter in the country \u2014 a warehouse for nearly 1,500 boys aged 10 to 17 who were caught illegally crossing the border.The teeming, 250,000-square-foot facility is a model of border life in Trump-era America, part of a growing industry of detention centers and shelters as federal authorities scramble to comply with the president\u2019s order to end \u201ccatch and release\u201d of migrants illegally entering the country. Now that children are often being separated from their parents, this facility has had to obtain a waiver from the state to expand its capacity.Cots are being added to sleeping areas. The staff is expanding. But even that is not enough. Federal authorities are considering establishing tent cities on Army and Air Force bases, and have already transferred hundreds of immigrant detainees to temporary housing at federal prisons.On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that temporary tent housing would be set up near the border station in Tornillo, Tex., to house up to 360 youths. That prompted an angry response from a Democratic state senator, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, who noted that temperatures could be expected to exceed 100 degrees at the site. \u201cThis is what totalitarians in the Middle East and elsewhere do,\u201d he said in a statement.The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement is now overseeing an estimated 100 shelters in 17 states, serving a population that has grown to more than 11,000 youths. One of the biggest concentrations is here near the border in South Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the poorest regions in the nation. There are about 10 shelters in three Valley counties, the majority in the Cameron County cities of Brownsville, Harlingen and San Benito.The shelters in and near Brownsville have become big business, employing hundreds of residents and bringing abandoned stores, schools and other buildings back to life in a county where the median household income is $34,578 and the percentage of those living below the federal poverty line is 29.1, far higher than the national poverty rate of 12.7 percent.But they have also raised questions about federal oversight and management, and the invisibility under which many of them operate.Numerous shelters that care for unaccompanied migrant youth in Texas have been cited by state child care facility regulators for dozens of violations in recent years, according to data from two of the state\u2019s oversight agencies, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Department of Family and Protective Services. The majority of the violations were for minor infractions, including incomplete child records. But some were for more serious problems.The shelters are part of the federal government\u2019s attempt to accommodate a flood of young people who have been surging across the Southwest border over the past several years, often without an accompanying parent. Many of them are seeking asylum from gang violence or other troubles in Central America.The number of children under detention has grown in recent weeks as the Trump administration has begun prosecuting migrants who cross the border illegally. Previously, parents traveling with children were often quickly released with orders to appear later in court \u2014 a practice which members of the current administration say was providing a powerful incentive for migrants to take their children in tow and travel to the United States. The number of families apprehended at the border has gone up nearly 600 percent compared with the spring of last year, the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, told Congress in May.\u201cWord is getting out,\u201d she said.But what happens to children in these federally sponsored shelters has had little public scrutiny.Here in South Texas, the mystery of what the Oregon senator was not allowed to see \u2014 the living conditions for hundreds of migrant boys inside a space originally built to house not people but cheap jeans and housewares \u2014 was seemingly solved on Wednesday. Federal officials and the operator of the shelter, Southwest Key Programs, led several reporters on a roughly 90-minute media tour and question-and-answer session.The shelter, called Casa Padre, is a world all its own, much of it invisible to outsiders. The few windows are covered in black mesh; in the parking lot, yellow-painted wooden barricades read, \u201cKeep Out.\u201dInside, it is clean, massive and brightly lit. Not far from the entrance, there is a large mural of President Trump, an American flag and the White House, with a quote from Mr. Trump: \u201cSometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.\u201dA team of 48 medical staff and three on-call physicians provide medical services. X-rays and laboratory work are done in-house. The children receive classroom instruction for six hours a day Monday through Friday, and outdoor play time for two hours a day.The building no longer resembles a Walmart. The interior has been redesigned, with walls and hallways constructed to create bedrooms, classrooms and other spaces. The mural featuring the president is one of many; one painting depicts former President John F. Kennedy with his words, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you,\u201d in English and in Spanish.Most of the boys are from Central America. Many of them smiled, waved at or shook the hands of the reporters touring the site. They were asked by the reporters and Southwest Key executives, in Spanish, \u201cHow are you?\u201dThe constant reply was \u201cBien, bien,\u201d meaning \u201cOK, OK.\u201d The media was not allowed to interview the children.Some were leaning back, getting a shampoo at the sinks in the shelter\u2019s barbershop, where a striped lit-up barber\u2019s pole spun outside the door. They lined up in the cafeteria for dinner \u2014 chicken, mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables. Some played pool, or joined a tai chi session in the rec room. One teenager sat at a cafeteria table with his head bowed and hands clasped, praying silently. Another told the cafeteria worker who served him dinner, \u201cGracias, Miss.\u201dEverywhere, some of the shelter\u2019s more than 1,000 employees hovered nearby \u2014 they sat at the ends of the cafeteria tables while the boys ate dinner, watched \u201cMoana\u201d with the children in the old loading docks and escorted lines of boys in the hallways.Many of the boys appeared to be 16 or 17, and the few who were much younger, around the age of 10 or 11, seemed almost out of place. They wore gym shorts and sweatshirts, sneakers and rosary necklaces. One had his arm in a sling and another had his leg wrapped in a bandage. All of them are classified as unaccompanied minors by federal officials \u2014 they either crossed the border without a parent or guardian, or were separated from their parents as part of the administration\u2019s new policy of arresting illegal border crossers and separating them from their children.The vast majority, Southwest Key officials said, crossed the border unaccompanied.In Bedroom 53, there were four beds on frames and one bed on a cot. The cot highlighted the housing crunch \u2014 it was one of hundreds of new beds that were recently added to boost the shelter\u2019s capacity. In May, Casa Padre was licensed by the state at a capacity of 1,186. On Wednesday, after a variance approved by the state allowed Southwest Key to boost its population, the new capacity was roughly 1,500.Southwest Key executives said the additional children do not make it too big to properly manage. They defended the services and the care they provide the children, as they will likely do when elected officials take tours of their own in the coming days, including Mr. Merkley. A congressional delegation is scheduled to tour the shelter on Monday.\u201cWe pride ourselves in providing excellent child care,\u201d said Alexia Rodriguez, Southwest Key\u2019s vice president of immigrant children\u2019s services, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re not a political organization. We take care of kids. We take great care of kids.\u201dThe industry for sheltering young migrants had run into trouble here even before the latest boom. Hundreds of shelter workers in the Rio Grande Valley were laid off at the end of March, after several sites run on contract to the federal government by a private organization, International Educational Services, suddenly shut down. The organization, known as I.E.S., lost its federal financing and shuttered its shelters and other facilities, for reasons that federal officials have yet to publicly explain.Last year, a worker at a Brownsville shelter yelled at a child, causing the child to punch a wall. In 2016, children in a shelter in the Cameron County town of Los Fresnos were being told to sit down for four hours as a form of discipline. Shelters were cited in various cases after their employees pushed children, slapped their hands with a ruler or grabbed a wrist. Other violations involved a lack of supervision. One child ate a meal she was allergic to, even though she was wearing a red bracelet that listed her allergies.A shelter in the Rio Grande Valley city of McAllen was cited in January after a child missed several doses of medication, and after children who complained of being in pain had to wait several days before care was provided. In September 2015 in Brownsville, medical staff left rubbing alcohol accessible, and a youth took it and consumed it. In October 2017 in San Benito, a random drug test found a shelter employee had showed up to work over the legal limit for alcohol.On the tour on Wednesday, Southwest Key and federal officials did not discuss such violations. They saw nothing wrong with the children spending most of their day indoors. They highlighted numerous phone booths around the shelter, including some the children use to call relatives and others that have direct lines to child protection agencies so they can lodge complaints. And they said there were some cases of children who tried to run away. The average length of stay in a migrant children\u2019s shelter is about 56 days, after which children generally are released to a sponsor. Some have been placed with foster families.Only 3.5 percent of unaccompanied youths who have arrived from Central America have been returned to their home countries, Ms. Nielsen said in her report to Congress.Asked if there were plans to house even more children at the former Walmart, Ms. Rodriguez said the new state-authorized capacity of roughly 1,500 was the maximum. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \u201cWe cannot put any more kids here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Puerto Rican Storm Evacuees, Another Moving Day Looms", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKISSIMMEE, Fla. \u2014 It was moving day at a Super 8 motel in this city of strip malls, not far from the hubbub of Disney World. Minivans and S.U.V.s lined the parking lot on Saturday, as families in flip-flops packed the few things they had accumulated since fleeing Hurricane Maria nine months ago: a purple folding chair, a hot plate, a hamper full of laundry.But late Saturday, the evacuees received a reprieve. A federal judge stayed their departures until at least Tuesday. A civil rights advocacy organization, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, filed a class-action lawsuit Saturday afternoon seeking to stop FEMA from ending its temporary shelter assistance for displaced hurricane victims from Puerto Rico, saying it would put evacuees \u201cat risk of homelessness and other irreparable injury.\u201dA hearing will be Monday, and evacuees can effectively remain in their accommodations until checkout time Wednesday.Most of the displaced Puerto Ricans have already moved on to apartments of their own, according to FEMA. But not all of them. Those moving out now say they will miss not only the federal aid, but the community they formed among their fellow survivors. Few plan to go back to the storm-damaged island.\u201cWhen I came here, I didn\u2019t know anybody,\u201d said David Olmeda, 26, as he and his wife folded clothing into suitcases to take to their newly rented apartment down the road. \u201cNow, we\u2019re a family.\u201dAbout 56 percent of Puerto Ricans who arrived in Florida before and after the hurricane plan to stay \u201cindefinitely,\u201d according to a survey released Saturday by Florida International University. The survey, which interviewed 1,000 Puerto Ricans in the state, also found that about 90 percent of respondents had received some public assistance.Most cited Puerto Rico\u2019s tough economic conditions as the reason for leaving, with 61 percent saying they had been able to find work. Just 11 percent specifically cited the hurricane.The Super 8, nestled between a coin laundry and an IHOP, has become the community\u2019s focal point. Its open layout lends itself to socializing, and a common room in the lobby, outfitted with a few tables and a coffee machine, brings guests together in the mornings for breakfast and in the evenings to chat.Television news crews regularly come by for interviews. Politicians frequently drop in. Representative Darren Soto, an Orlando Democrat who was the first Puerto Rican elected to Congress from Florida, visited Friday evening. One of his aides held office hours at the motel on Saturday, as a World Cup match between Uruguay and Portugal played in the background.By then, it had become clear that FEMA, which has extended the temporary shelter assistance three times, would not offer any such relief, despite pleas from Mr. Soto and other Democrats, including Senator Bill Nelson of Florida. Mr. Nelson urged FEMA to activate a separate disaster housing assistance program to provide rent subsidies to families, as the agency did after Hurricane Katrina until 2009.Lenisha Smith, a FEMA spokeswoman, said there was \u201cno need\u201d for that aid because another program, called direct lease assistance, provides similar services \u201cwithout the additional complexities and red tape.\u201d However, critics like Christiaan Perez, a spokesman for LatinoJustice PRLDEF, say direct lease is too narrow to benefit most of the needy Puerto Rican families.The group sued Saturday in federal court in Massachusetts, which has the highest population of families receiving temporary sheltering assistance after Florida and Puerto Rico. Federal District Judge Leo T. Sorokin issued a limited temporary restraining order in the case late Saturday.FEMA has spent more than $84 million on temporary sheltering assistance for Puerto Rican evacuees of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, Ms. Smith said.With little hope to stay in their motel rooms \u2014 and no interest in taking FEMA up on free airfare back to Puerto Rico by Sunday \u2014 the Super 8 families prepared on Saturday to say goodbye. At least two families were headed to board a bus to Ohio; a recent local job fair featuring Ohio companies, including an auto parts manufacturer, resulted in several job offers.Others, like Mr. Olmeda, found apartments locally after extensive searching. His wife, Christine Gonz\u00e1lez, 26, said her husband would come home at 6 a.m. from his overnight shift at the Home Depot, sleep until 8 a.m., and spend the rest of the day hunting for a place to rent. The hurricane blew away their home in Cayey, the couple said; they found their infant son\u2019s crib strewn on the street outside.\u201cWe\u2019re not going back,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez, who is working for a local advocacy group, said as she scooped up her son, Kahil, who is now 1. \u201cThings in Puerto Rico are still bad.\u201dManny Ayala, director of community engagement for the local Episcopal Office of Latino Assistance, said his agency, which continues to staff a disaster relief center and steer families to a monthly food pantry, sees new Puerto Rican families every week.\u201cThey don\u2019t know the public transportation system. They don\u2019t know the language.

{"Headline": "The Vast World of Islam, in 300 Recipes", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt hadn\u2019t crossed Anissa Helou\u2019s mind to write a cookbook until she found herself at a dinner party in London with a table of people who, like her, were born in Lebanon and now lived far from home, discussing the paucity of Lebanese cookbooks.This was in the summer of 1992. Back then, Ms. Helou was working as an art consultant.But the conversation struck her. She realized that an entire generation of Lebanese people who had been uprooted by the country\u2019s civil war, which lasted from 1975 to 1990, had also lost access to the food of their homeland.\u201cI was a nonentity then,\u201d Ms. Helou said. \u201cNobody knew me.\u201dDifferent treatments for deceptively similar dishes reveal the expansiveness of the foodways throughout North Africa, the Middle East and far beyond. In Morocco, she writes, rice pudding is typically milk-based and flavored with orange blossom water. The rice pudding of Turkey, though, usually involves no milk at all, and it\u2019s laced with saffron.\u201cFeast\u201d was born out of a sense of disturbance she had felt since 2013, she said, when she saw Muslims vilified in the news coverage surrounding the Arab Spring and the rise of ISIS. \u201cThrough this book, I wanted to open up a world that people might not know, but in a positive and approachable way,\u201d she said.Ms. Helou is not Muslim, but she spent the first two decades of her life in the predominantly Muslim part of Beirut. Though her Syrian father and Lebanese mother raised Ms. Helou and her four siblings as Christians, she wasn\u2019t particularly religious.When she was a child, her mother would do all the cooking, ritualistically pounding pink lamb in a white marble mortar before chopping it to make kibbe, the pudgy ovals of bulgur, onion and lamb.Seeing only women in the kitchen gave Ms. Helou the impression that cooking was a gendered trap, a notion that clashed with her burgeoning politics. She was just 16 when she was drawn to the works of Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.Ms. Helou decamped for London in 1973, pursuing her career in the art world. \u201cWhen I moved to London, I told my boyfriend that he shouldn\u2019t expect to me to cook for him because I was very liberated, having read all the French existentialists,\u201d she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to be domesticated.\u201dShe reneged on her anti-cooking stance in 1975, after her boyfriend introduced her to an American friend of his, \u201ca glamorous blond lady,\u201d Ms. Helou recalled. \u201cShe produced a very nice dinner. My boyfriend was impressed. I looked at him and said, \u2018Oops! Maybe I should cook.\u2019\u201dShe began by hosting elaborate dinner parties where she made her mother\u2019s tabbouleh and hummus. It was a period when Britain was just becoming acquainted with Lebanese cuisine. Decades later, foods from the Middle East would be ubiquitous there.\u201cIn the last 10 years there has been an explosion of Middle Eastern food in the U.K.,\u201d said Claudia Roden, a British authority on the cuisine of the region. It has resulted, she explained, in a glut of Middle Eastern cookbooks. What sets Ms. Helou apart from her contemporaries is a curiosity she roots in historical precision.\u201cWhereas other writers are likely to modernize or do their own takes and innovations, I believe Anissa is a traditionalist and a purist,\u201d Ms. Roden said.Kabab karaz is a dish of ground lamb meatballs cooked in a pool of pitted sour cherries, raw cane sugar and pomegranate molasses. The meatballs take on the appearance of tiny marbles glossed with ruby-red sauce; the dish\u2019s tartness is energetic, but not disorienting. Once the meatballs are tender, you pile them on a bed of pita bread triangles drizzled with butter, dusting them with chopped parsley and toasted pine nuts.Ms. Helou considers Aleppo the \u201cgastronomic capital of the Middle East,\u201d she said.And kabab karaz epitomizes the soul of the city. \u201cThe food culture of Aleppo is probably the most interesting of the food cultures of the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s steeped in culinary lore.\u201dShe got the recipe from Maria Gaspard-Samra, a chef who taught cooking classes in Aleppo before the city\u2019s destruction.If Aleppo has now become synonymous with decay, Ms. Helou would do her part to keep its signature recipe alive. She started by writing it down.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Florida City Wants More Retirees, and Is Going After Them", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringIn Florida, one city is not waiting for retirees to show up but is recruiting them to resettle there.While older people flock to the state each year, relatively few head to Tallahassee, a tree-lined city in the Panhandle where lawmakers hold forth in the Capitol and streets spill over with students who attend the area\u2019s major universities.Tallahassee, which is not growing as fast as the rest of the state, is looking to attract new residents, including small-business owners who can generate jobs. A key part of the city\u2019s efforts is expanding its population of retirees, and it has adopted some unusual tactics \u2014 including subsidizing a few people to move there.Tallahassee\u2019s economy is fueled by state government as well as Florida State University, Florida A & M and a large community college. Some 66,000 students attend those institutions, but most are passing through.To better compete for baby boomers \u2014 and improve its chances against other college communities like Athens, Ga., or Tuscaloosa, Ala. \u2014 Choose Tallahassee ramped up last fall and expanded from an all-volunteer organization to one with a paid staff. It hired a part-time executive director. The group now has a budget of $150,000, three times its old budget, which comes from the city and county governments as well as banks, real estate firms and other companies.It rolled out a social media campaign in early May to promote some of the city\u2019s offerings, including the Tallahassee Senior Center, where $5 and $7 classes include American folk music, Florida geology and excursions to a wildlife refuge center.Using paid targeting, dedicated landing pages and the tagline \u201cThings Aren\u2019t the Same Since You Left,\u201d the ads are aimed at boomers who grew up in Tallahassee, went to college there or once worked there, said Gregg Patterson, Choose Tallahassee\u2019s executive director.Some ads will target \u201canchors,\u201d who are Tallahassee residents with parents living elsewhere, to \u201cshowcase the advantages of having your parents live there, such as free babysitting,\u201d said Amanda Handley of the public relations agency BowStern, which oversees the campaign.Parents who live elsewhere see only a message about the potential benefits typically provided by adult children, like free tech support and manual labor, she said. Each audience, anchor or boomer, will see only messages designed to appeal to it.\u201cNo one really wants to relocate to babysit,\u201d Ms. Handley said. \u201cSo the grandparents don\u2019t see that part of the message.\u201dChoose Tallahassee came up with the idea to pinpoint exactly who was interested in moving there. The campaign started trying to make Tallahassee better known nationally with a contest on Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets several years ago that offered a year\u2019s free housing and other perks to the winners. Glenn and Loujean Nelson of Chicago won in 2016. The couple, both retired teachers, had been set to move back to their hometown in Alabama when they heard about the contest.\u201cWe made a list of what we wanted in a retirement area, and Tallahassee had everything plus more, including college sports, which I love, along with plays and musicals and lifelong learning for people over 50,\u201d Mrs. Nelson said. In the semifinals, the couple submitted a brief video about why they wanted to move to Tallahassee, and later had a Skype interview with volunteer judges, who selected the winners.The four couples who were finalists received a free weeklong visit to Tallahassee, which included tickets to a Florida State football game. The Nelsons \u2014 she is 70, and he is 71 \u2014 received the housing money and other perks, like tickets to musical and other events. They applied $24,000 of their prize money to the down payment on a single-family home with a yard where they can entertain their eight grandchildren during visits, and moved in last year.And the city has begun to fix what some see as a serious drawback \u2014 a relatively sparse stock of retirement complexes that are common in established retirement locales. About 10 communities catering to those 50 and over who want amenities like swimming pools and golf courses are underway or planned in the area. One is operated by Brookdale Senior Living, which runs hundreds of communities around the country.After two contests that attracted retirees, Choose Tallahassee is skipping a third, at least for now, and instead focusing on helping residents persuade out-of-state relatives, friends and acquaintances to move to the city.One reason is that campaign organizers want to learn what attracts people to Tallahassee and improve outreach.\u201cOne of our earlier efforts was looking at the number of new driver\u2019s license applications from out-of-state residents who were 60 and over,\u201d Ms. Bono said. \u201cWe expected small numbers \u2014 it was up about one-third over the five years ending in 2016 \u2014 but we wanted a more precise way to track who the campaign is reaching.\u201dCathy and Bill Campbell moved to the area from New Hampshire in 2015, a year after they won the first Choose Tallahassee contest. Their advice to the city: Attract more multigenerational families.\u201cOur daughter and grandson moved here, too, and our daughter set up a business,\u201d said Cathy Campbell, 69, a retired graphic designer, whose husband was a meteorologist.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s a capital city, people don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s a quiet place that is family friendly,\u201d she said. \u201cMore and more people our age who are thinking about relocating end up moving closer to their kids.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Broadway Mogul Redefines Clout in His Own Fashion", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJordan Roth has put away his Prada suits. He had them in black, blue and gray, and they felt reassuring when he took over a small Broadway theater empire \u2014 a billionaire\u2019s son facing more than a little skepticism about his readiness for an old-school job.Nine years later, at 42, he has become Broadway\u2019s singular showman, pushing the boundaries of what it means \u2014 and, yes, what it looks like \u2014 to be a theater tycoon.As his confidence has grown, so has his appetite for provocative self-expression. He has become a red carpet magnet, thanks to his luxuriant locks and penchant for avant-garde couture. And he is producing and hosting a biting series of web videos that take aim at the coarsening of American culture and its association with President Trump.If his appearance and his antics strike some as outlandish \u2014 well, he seems to be enjoying that, too.\u201cPart of growing into yourself is worrying less and less \u2014 which is not to say not at all \u2014 about what everybody else thinks you should be, wants you to be, doesn\u2019t want you to be,\u201d he said, \u201cand hopefully more and more about what you want to be.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s taking a lot of risks,\u201d said Anna Wintour, the influential editor in chief of Vogue, whose men\u2019s editor has been helping him pick outfits. \u201cBecause of his work in theater, he\u2019s appreciative of talent and craft and how things are made.\u201dExplaining his choices (which he regularly documents on social media), Mr. Roth recalled the years when he sported a buzz cut and would leave the white shirts under his Prada suits untucked as his one nod to not being a banker. \u201cMy uniform served me really well,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cuntil it didn\u2019t.\u201dBroadway theater owners, who control which shows get homes, are mostly older white men, deal makers and schmoozers in conservative suits. But if Mr. Roth is atypical for his industry\u2019s leaders, he\u2019s O.K. with that. In fact, he acknowledges that he is challenging societal gender norms with his styling.\u201cI feel my most powerful and authentic when I am holding both my masculine and my feminine in both my hands at the same time, and I don\u2019t take that as unique to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all can and could embrace ourselves wholly, and derive strength and power from that.\u201dBut it appears to be punching above its weight, responsible for 20 percent of Broadway\u2019s overall grosses while owning just 12 percent of the 41 theaters. Still, conversations about Mr. Roth within the industry invariably include some degree of puzzlement over his evolving appearance and his fondness for the spotlight.Yet even those who are mystified by Mr. Roth\u2019s performative extracurriculars give him credit as a businessman who has aggressively wooed the shows he wants, is generous to artists working in his theaters and has overhauled customer service practices in a change-averse industry.He locked down \u201cFrozen,\u201d the first Disney show for Jujamcyn, after executing a complex (and costly) real estate transaction that allowed him to expand the stage at the St. James Theater by building into an alley owned by a neighboring nonprofit.He pursued the National Theater\u2019s \u201cAngels\u201d revival even before it hit the stage in London, then, when he didn\u2019t have space to house it in New York, persuaded one of his competitors, the Nederlander Organization, to provide a theater.And he courted Mr. Springsteen \u2014 the biggest get of the season \u2014 with persistence and hunger, and a bit of a leg up because he already knew the singer socially.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t follow the rules that others would,\u201d said the veteran producer Roy Furman, who described seeing Mr. Roth last month at a luncheon for Tony nominees. Many men were in suits, but Mr. Roth was in an embroidered Haider Ackermann jacket over a green graphic sweatshirt, and shiny brown pants with a purple stripe. (Mr. Furman: \u201cHe came like he was going to a grunge fest downtown.\u201d Mr. Roth had a different description: \u201cIt was chic as hell.\u201d)But Mr. Furman said he has appreciated Mr. Roth in action \u2014 aggressively pursuing shows, nurturing his theaters and tending to artists and investors (\u201cthe notes he leaves you!\u201d).\u201cIt\u2019s not an accident that he keeps booking the right shows,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cHe knows the market, he knows what he wants, he knows what\u2019s good, and he makes things happen.\u201dMr. Roth\u2019s producing projects are reflective of his personal passions as a gay man, a father, an activated liberal and an unabashed sentimentalist.There was the recent revival of \u201cFalsettos,\u201d the musical about a gay man\u2019s relationships with his lover, his ex-wife and their son; the current revival of \u201cAngels,\u201d subtitled \u201ca gay fantasia on national themes\u201d; and, this summer, he is among the co-producers of the bubbly, bawdy \u201cHead Over Heels,\u201d which manages to locate a lesbian love story, a transgender oracle and gender-bending high jinks within a mash-up of Go-Go\u2019s songs and a 16th-century prose poem.\u201cWe just have very different points of view,\u201d Jordan Roth said of the father-son Trump divide. \u201cBut he\u2019s my father, and he will be my father long after this president is president, God willing.\u201d (His father did not respond to an email seeking comment.)The videos have been \u201ca coming together of where I am creatively and where we are politically,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cThe second we let insane things happen without calling them out is the point at which we lose the republic.\u201dOskar Eustis, the artistic director of the nonprofit Public Theater, called Mr. Roth\u2019s video series \u201cwild\u201d and \u201cout there\u201d but also \u201ccompletely surprising and completely delightful.\u201d\u201cIt feels almost unprecedented that somebody in commercial theater is willing to lead the charge for social justice change,\u201d he said.\u201cJordan is a complete eccentric and also an incredibly wise man,\u201d he added. \u201cI asked him to sit down and talk with me about how we do our commercial work, and I walked out with my head spinning. He feels like a comrade in a pretty deep way.\u201dMr. Roth\u2019s journey to moguldom was, obviously, eased by his family\u2019s money and connections. Not only is his father one of the most successful businessmen in New York, but his mother, Daryl Roth, is also one of the most prominent Broadway producers, with 10 Tonys and a long history of support for work about gender and sexuality.\u201cHis mom is a great producer, and his dad is a real estate tycoon, and, like it or not, being a theater owner is real estate \u2014 that\u2019s the name of the game,\u201d said the director Michael Mayer (\u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d \u201cHead Over Heels\u201d). He has known Jordan Roth since he was in college, when Daryl Roth, wanting her son to have a gay role model, introduced them, Mr. Mayer recalled.\u201cHe can synthesize his father\u2019s business acumen and his mother\u2019s taste and passion,\u201d Mr. Mayer added, \u201cand he\u2019s the best part of both of them in one.\u201dMr. Roth saw a lot of theater as a child, and through that he learned to accept himself. \u201cThrough my life, at different stages, the things I felt wrong about me offstage were right onstage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is why we tell stories. We tell stories to show who we are. And who we can be.\u201dEven as he redefines the role of a Broadway bigwig, Mr. Roth is surrounded by its history. He works from an office above the St. James once occupied by David Merrick, the legendary Broadway producer, and when I asked about the Merrick legacy, he dropped his voice to a stage whisper.A few days later, he walked me up to the building\u2019s roof, where a 40-foot-high latticework of scaffolding holds up a luminous marquee now advertising the first Disney show to reside in one of his theaters, \u201cFrozen.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t it thrilling? It\u2019s so New York. It\u2019s so Broadway.\u201dHis office is spare \u2014 the one nod to razzle-dazzle is a set of 22-inch-high electrified letters, T-H-E-A-T-R-E, that Mr. Roth salvaged from the Virginia Theater, which was being rechristened the August Wilson, and mounted on his wall. He has a clutter-free black standing desk (no chair, just a black exercise ball), with a side table on which rest his three nickel-plated Tony medallions, plus the bronze Olivier Award.The heart of his day-to-day work, of course, is not his style or even his producing, but the less glamorous reality of maintaining five theaters, which, at the moment have high attendance and little turnover.He has prioritized customer service, with an overarching goal \u2014 that theaters need to find a way to stop saying \u201cno\u201d to patrons so often \u2014 guiding his work. When he took over, he brought in a company started by Danny Meyer, a prominent restaurateur with an emphasis on people pleasing, to counsel staff.Tired of telling people they couldn\u2019t bring food or beverages to their seats, he repealed that rule, but then set about finding fast-melting ice (the secret: small chunks) to reduce rattling noise.Knowing that women are frustrated by long lines for the restrooms, he has attempted a bit of reassuring humor at \u201cMean Girls,\u201d stationing ushers with pink placards reading \u201c#FollowMe (I\u2019m the line for the ladies\u2019 room).\u201dAnd trying to balance fans\u2019 wishes to document their experiences with rules that ban photography, he is attempting a compromise, starting at \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway.\u201d A Playbill insert warns against phone usage during the show, adding, \u201cwe love that you want a special memory of this night, so when the house lights come up at the end of the show, feel free to capture Bruce\u2019s bow on your cellphone from your seat.\u201dWhat\u2019s next for the restless Mr. Roth? He recently spent a semester in Anna Deavere Smith\u2019s N.Y.U. theater class as an artist-in-residence, performing a personal narrative for the other students. He is about to launch an email magazine about culture, called \u201cWarmly, Jordan,\u201d which is the way he signs his letters. And, he said, \u201cVery much in development are more creative projects \u2014 things I\u2019m writing and creating or performing, as well as producing.\u201dIn the meantime, he said, he\u2019s perfectly pleased to be a work in progress.\u201cI always knew that I would grow into myself, and it seems to be bearing out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He didn\u2019t say how many.There is another potential loophole in Facebook\u2019s rules. It appears that one person can go through the verification process and then give the account to someone else. Mr. Smith, for instance, said that while Facebook had authenticated him as a political advertiser, he later handed over control of Sierra Nevada Revolution\u2019s account to others. That meant others could have used his Facebook verification to post political ads without the social network\u2019s knowing it was not him.\u201cThey don\u2019t know we are five people running it, or however many,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s also not consistent. Occasionally, we slip a political ad by Facebook because it\u2019s not flagged.\u201dRob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product management, said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d that The New York Times had brought the actions of Sierra Nevada Revolution to the company\u2019s attention. \u201cWe are looking into it because it\u2019s against our policies to share passwords or give someone else access to a person\u2019s Facebook account,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe use signals such as two-factor authentication to detect and prevent this type of abuse, but steps like these won\u2019t stop every attempt to game the system.\u201dThe largest effort has focused on authenticating and cataloging campaign ads on Facebook. The system is a work in progress, executives said in a recent call with reporters. But they said they hoped the transparency requirements would deter bad actors \u2014 especially those from foreign nations \u2014 from meddling in American elections.\u201cWe believe the process we put in place is a solid step, but we also know that initially there will be instances where we don\u2019t catch ads that should have been labeled and the authorization process wasn\u2019t completed by the person placing the ad,\u201d Mr. Leathern said in the call.To run, Ms. Bateson, who grew up in Roseville, Calif., took a leave of absence last year from her job as a political-science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She moved from Boston back to her hometown, which is just outside Sacramento, with her husband, Vivek Krishnamurthy, who is a lawyer, and their three children. Ms. Bateson is running on a platform that includes protection of the Affordable Care Act.The group often posted its criticism of Ms. Bateson on Facebook. Mr. Smith said he was in control of the account when it posted its first ad blasting her, adding that he spent more than $3,000 of his own money on that ad and others.That first ad, which Facebook did not designate as a political ad, was titled, \u201cLose by any means necessary.\u201d It accused Ms. Bateson of running a \u201cscorched earth campaign\u201d and helping the Republican candidate by turning on her fellow Democrats.Another Sierra Nevada Revolution ad, which ran on Facebook on May 26 and mentioned Ms. Bateson and other topics, did not say who had paid for it, as required. Facebook said that it had made a mistake and that the ad was removed before being republished later with the correct label.In total, Sierra Nevada Revolution ran 29 Facebook ads in May aimed at swaying people\u2019s votes in California\u2019s primary, according to Facebook\u2019s ad archive.Ms. Bateson said that her own campaign was not verified as a political advertiser by Facebook and had filled out the paperwork only in recent weeks. Her campaign was working with an outside digital advertising firm to run ads on Facebook.But she worried that it would be too little, too late \u2014 especially since others have already made a mark through political Facebook ads that were not properly labeled.\u201cHere we are with people already voting by mail in the primaries, and we see serious problems with their system,\u201d Ms. Bateson said of the social network. \u201cWe see that someone from here with local knowledge of our election can use Facebook to really influence people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grilling Turns Back to an Ancient Fuel: Wood", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world\u2019s oldest cooking method has become one of its newest culinary quests.While there\u2019s nothing novel about wood-burning grills in restaurants (Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters have used them for decades), what is new is the zeal of the chefs using them, the variety of equipment now available, and the growing number of American home cooks who are forsaking gas and charcoal to master the ancient art of grilling over a wood fire in their backyards.One such convert is Marco Birch, a Manhattan financier by day and ardent wood griller on weekends. \u201cWe discovered parrilla grilling during a bike trip to Argentina,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe sparks and flames grabbed our attention; the unique earthy smoke flavor of the meat sealed the deal.\u201dSo Mr. Birch bought a 48-inch NorthFork Ironworks parrilla (an Argentinian-style wood-burning grill) from Brendan McCarthy, a grill builder and fly-fishing guide in Greenport, N.Y.Mr. McCarthy had experienced his own wood-fire epiphany during an outing with the grill maestro Francis Mallmann, who has restaurants in South America, France and Miami. \u201cPropane has no flavor, and charcoal isn\u2019t much better,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cThe aroma and flavor of wood are in a league of their own.\u201dThat flavor comes from the high, dry heat of a wood fire (1,000 degrees or more), which caramelizes the proteins in meats and the plant sugars in fruits and vegetables. But wood-grilled foods get even more of their distinctive flavor and edge from the fragrant smoke.\u201cWood smoke contains more than a thousand flavor-producing compounds,\u201d said Nathan Myhrvold, the former Microsoft executive who has become an evangelist for modernist cooking. That list of chemicals includes creosol (associated with the smoky peat flavor of Scotch whisky), syringol (responsible for clovelike flavors), and vanillin (source of a vanilla-ish sweetness in smoke).By the time wood becomes charcoal, Dr. Myhrvold said, 99 percent of those compounds are lost. That\u2019s why a wood fire delivers so much more flavor than charcoal. \u201cAlmost any hardwood is good for grilling, but avoid evergreens, like spruce and pine, which put out a black sooty smoke that tastes like turpentine,\u201d he said.Wood grilling is very different from traditional barbecue, although both start with burning logs. In a barbecue pit, the food smokes at a low heat away from the fire for intervals measured in half-days. Grilling is a rapid process in which the food sizzles directly over the fire.Traditionally, people grilled with the wood that grew in their area. In much of North and South America and Europe, that means oak \u2014 a clean, hot-burning wood with a smoke that\u2019s robust enough to stand up to red meat, yet mild enough not to overpower poultry or seafood.Southerners burn hickory; Californians use almond wood; Pacific Northwesterners burn cherry and alder. Mesquite \u2014 the go-to wood in Hawaii, the American Southwest and northern Mexico \u2014 emits a strong-tasting smoke and pyrotechnic sparks that, depending on your level of pyromania, you\u2019ll find thrilling or disconcerting.Grill with a single wood, Mr. Franklin suggested: \u201cWhen you mix woods, you can\u2019t really pinpoint the flavor.\u201dThe cooking properties and smoke flavor vary subtly from wood to wood, but less than you might think. For Ben Eisendrath, the chief executive of Grillworks, the species matters less than using split, seasoned, appropriate-size logs \u2014 seasoned because dry wood burns more efficiently than green, split because the wood ignites more easily, and sized to fit in your grill, which means smaller than what you generally burn in your fireplace.Mr. Eisendrath recommends logs that are 10 to 12 inches long and two to three inches wide. He also recommends mixing lump charcoal with wood in a ratio of about 30 percent to 70 percent to produce a hotter, more even-burning fire.When it comes to lighting the fire, channel your inner Scout. Stack the wood log-cabin style with plenty of air space between logs. Light twisted newspaper and kindling in the center. Another popular method is to light natural lump charcoal in a chimney starter, then arrange the wood (smaller pieces first, then larger) atop the embers.Speaking of chimney starters, there is a stunningly simple way to grill over wood that requires little more than a common kettle grill. Fill your chimney not with charcoal, but hardwood chunks (oak, hickory, apple, cherry and such, the sort sold at hardware stores for smoking). Light the chimney as you would for charcoal: in 20 minutes, you\u2019ll be grilling over wood embers.Wood chunks burn faster than charcoal, so you\u2019ll need to replenish them often. Lighting a second chimney will give you more hot coals at the ready. (When wood-grilling in a kettle grill, never close the lid, or your food will become unbearably smoky.)The chief challenge in grilling over wood is heat control. To increase or decrease the heat on an Argentinian-style parrilla grill, like the Grillworks or NorthFork, simply raise or lower the grill grate with the flywheel.When wood grilling in a fixed-grate grill, like a kettle grill, build a tiered fire with embers piled thicker to one side or at the back of the firebox and spread more sparsely in the center, with an ember-free safety zone away from the coals. Control the heat by moving the food closer to or farther away from the fire. On a fixed-grate grill with a braseiro (an open metal basket for burning logs to embers), simply rake more or fewer coals under the food.Another way to boost the heat is to oxygenate the fire. Mr. Stone uses an ingenious tool called a Blow Poke, a long metal tube you blow through to direct air to a specific part of the fire. (It also comes with a claw at the end for raking the coals.) You\u2019ll look like you\u2019re playing trumpet to some deity of fire. Alternatively, ventilate the fire with a fan or a hair dryer.Remember this simple formula: more air, hotter fire; less air, cooler fire.Wood-burning grills are incredibly versatile. You can grill over flaming logs, the way you might roast marshmallows over a campfire. Or grill over glowing embers, much as you would over charcoal.Use a flame-forward fire for chicken breasts, fish fillets, thin steaks \u2014 foods that benefit from high heat and a pronounced smoke flavor. The ember method gives you a steadier, more predictable heat source, well suited to grilling bread, pizza, thick steaks and chops, and high-moisture vegetables.Most chefs use both techniques. Mr. Franklin slow-smokes bavette on a rack high above the fire, then sears it over embers. Mr. Schwartz does most of his grilling over embers, periodically adding fresh logs to the fire to maintain a steady stream of flavorful smoke. Ms. Robbins roasts potatoes in front of the fire for a soulful twist on baked potatoes, and often grills caveman-style \u2014 directly on the embers.\u201cA wood burning grill is such a simple piece of equipment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even after two years, we\u2019re still finding new ways to use it.\u201dWhichever fuel you use or method for controlling the heat, be prepared to take your time.\u201cThis is not like cooking on a conventional grill,\u201d Mr. Birch said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mesmerizing process and a communal ritual that takes the better part of the day.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are You Sure You Want a Right to Trump\u2019s Twitter Account?", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Feldman is a law professor who specializes in constitutional law.On the surface, this apparent expansion of free speech may seem sensible, even exciting. After all, if social media is where we do our political talking, it would seem logical to bring the Constitution to bear there.The problem, however, is that applying the First Amendment to social media will make it harder or even impossible for the platforms to limit fake news, online harassment and hate speech \u2014 precisely the serious social ills that the world is calling on them to address.At present, free speech law ensures the platforms\u2019 own freedom of expression and association. That gives them the constitutional right to set their own terms of service and community standards, which they can use to address everything from spreading deliberate falsehoods to harassing people based on their sex, race or religion.But if courts determine that the Constitution trumps the private decisions of the platforms with respect to regulating speech, the platforms will no longer set their own standards. Instead courts will set them, using the only guidance they have: the body of free-speech law developed by the Supreme Court over the last half-century. That body of jurisprudence, guided by the ideology of the free marketplace of ideas, dictates near absolute protection for all forms of expression, including knowing lies and the vilest statements of prejudice and bigotry. (Disclosure: I have advised Facebook on issues connected to governance and free expression.)There is thus a fundamental trade-off at stake. If, on the one hand, courts treat social media platforms as private actors with the constitutional right to regulate what is said on their platforms and who can say it, then we must accept that only a combination of moral, public and market pressure can help ensure that the platforms take appropriate measures to protect truth and civility. This is a system of private, voluntary regulation.If, on the other hand, courts take over regulating social media, that essentially guarantees the same free-for-all on social media that exists on the internet as a whole \u2014 not to mention in real life. In that scenario, we should be prepared to accept the inevitability of fake news, online harassment, expressions of bigotry and all the rest. This would be a system of total free speech.This choice is now upon us. Consider the implications of the federal court\u2019s Twitter decision. According to the court, President Trump \u2014 and by extension any public official \u2014 creates a designated public forum on a social media platform when he creates an account. In such a public forum, the government can\u2019t discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.But of course it\u2019s not only people specifically blocked by President Trump\u2019s account who can\u2019t reply to him on Twitter. It\u2019s also anyone excluded from Twitter by the platform itself, including those barred from Twitter for engaging in harassment or hate speech. Such parties may now sue Twitter, demanding access to the platform so they can post comments on Mr. Trump\u2019s account.In February, the white supremacist Jared Taylor and his New Century Foundation filed a related lawsuit in California against Twitter, which has blocked accounts belonging to Mr. Taylor and the supremacist group American Renaissance. The suit argues that the California courts should declare all of Twitter a public forum. If the court were to agree, then Twitter would be bound by California\u2019s free-speech guarantee to allow all speakers access.Social media should not become a pure free-speech zone. The speech-based online abuses of our age need to be addressed not by the government but by the platforms on which they occur. The platforms\u2019 free-speech rights impose moral obligations on them. The free market will ensure that the platforms do their best to comply.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Funeral Crowdfunding Grows, So Do the Risks", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the early morning of May 27, Vinson Pierce had a heart attack and died in his sleep, leaving behind a wife, three children and more than 300 students in Comanche, Tex., where he was the principal at the local high school. The news traveled quickly in this Texas Hill Country town, which holds a yearly barbecue cook-off and antique car and tractor festival.Some funeral home directors, though, have begun asking relatives and friends to sign documents that relieve businesses of fault if a campaign goes awry, or funds are misrepresented or misused. Others, still, want to ensure they get paid.\u201cOur position is to suggest to people who are making choices to keep within their means,\u201d said R. Bryant Hightower Jr., a funeral director in Carrollton, Ga., and a board member of the National Funeral Directors Association. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people putting a number out there to profit.\u201dAnd that has some critics wondering: Is crowdfunding the best way to pay for a funeral?\u201cThis is an indication of where we are as a society,\u201d Mr. Slocum said. \u201cWe are seeing the modern equivalent of the carwash and bake sales.\u201dLoved ones have always pitched in during a time of crisis; Mr. Speegle said residents of Comanche would have helped the Pierce family whether there was GoFundMe or not. The average cost of a traditional funeral and cremation is $6,260, according to the funeral association. A funeral and a burial can cost about $10,000.What is different today, though, is that the number of people available to participate has expanded globally with social media. And that means successful campaigns \u2014 those that are shared widely on Facebook and Twitter \u2014 must have a compelling story to attract donors.Mr. Solomon said his staff coaches funeral organizers on what angles to pursue to make a campaign go viral. \u201cIf a picture is worth 1,000 words, a video is worth 10,000 words,\u201d he said.The bereaved, too, are advised to contact reporters and refresh pages with comments to maintain interest. \u201cLocal media matters to our campaigns,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. That\u2019s because if it doesn\u2019t resonate close to home, word is unlikely to spread. Indeed, many campaigns do not reach their target. Mr. Hightower said that about a third of the campaigns he had seen failed to reach their goals.One family \u201cphysically showed me the money from a campaign that would be enough to cover the service,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. \u201cThen they disappeared.\u201d Another time, he said, a couple solicited donations for the funeral of an infant, even though he performed the service at no cost, as he often does when a baby dies.That happened to Mr. Hightower, too. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know about it until someone called and they asked where to send the money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe called the family and said, \u2018We don\u2019t want to be a party to that.\u2019\u201dMr. Solomon maintained that there is rarely fraud on GoFundMe and said that if there is, the company will contact law enforcement.But a funeral director starting his own crowdfunding website is not the answer, either, said Mr. Slocum of the Funeral Consumer Alliance. For one, FundTheFuneral collects a 5 percent fee based on donations raised, along with a standard 2.9 percent credit transaction. FundTheFuneral, too, does not disclose Mr. Fisher\u2019s ownership stake on its website. \u201cThere is clearly potential for a conflict of interest,\u201d Mr. Slocum said.Jeremy Spiering, Mr. Fisher\u2019s business partner, said they charged the fee solely to cover costs. \u201cHe\u2019s not pushing it for profit on the side,\u201d he said of his business partner.FuneralFundMe.com is the newest entrant in the funeral crowdfunding industry. It was founded in April by Kate MacDonald, 26, a former personal trainer who lives in Tulsa, Okla. She said her father was in the funeral home business. \u201cIf you go into a funeral home, people are dressed nice,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like there wasn\u2019t a fund-raising platform that could parallel that.\u201dThere is one problem: The campaigns are fake.Ms. MacDonald acknowledged that she created mock-ups to attract funeral home directors, but does not disclose that on her website. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any real ones yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to teach directors what is an effective campaign.\u201dWhen asked about it, Mr. Slocum sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to the point where the funeral home is the client,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the family.\u201d\u201cThere were a few unknowns and anonymous folks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did have one person who said, \u2018You don\u2019t know us, but someone helped us in our time of loss.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

I do think that one of the things that happened in California demographically, was that the G.O.P. hitched its wagon so much to anti-immigrant sentiment in the 1990s that where they had a big inroad with the Latino population they very much lost that.\u201dThere were other parallels, he said. A loss of manufacturing jobs led to a sense of dislocation among the white working class. Rush Limbaugh began his career in Sacramento in the 1980s, just before conservative talk radio played a big role in immigrant bashing in the 1990s, similar to the role Fox News has played today in fanning anti-immigrant sentiment.But California\u2019s rise in the years since, Mr. Pastor says, offers at least some hope that American will overcome its own toxic political environment.\u201cThe serious discussion we have to have about California\u2019s future is not climate change versus no climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cNot about whether we will be a sanctuary state or not, but the nuances of this. Having a big symbolic battle about Trump, as interesting as it will be for the rest of the country, is quite a bit of a distraction from what the state itself needs to do, particularly in a gubernatorial campaign.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)If there is nothing in life better than carving open a perfectly ripe avocado \u2014 and truly, what could be better? \u2014 there is nothing more disappointing than discovering that one has gone bad.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "The Age of the MSNBC Mom", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Stoeffel\u2019s mother loves MSNBC.My parents are empty-nesters, but a visit home feels crowded. There are Joe and Mika, flirtily bickering over breakfast. After dinner, Rachel holds forth like a beloved fictional boarding school teacher. Looking for a phone charger during the day, I walk past panels of ethics experts, muted and forgotten.This is life with an MSNBC mom: a liberal woman whose retirement years have coincided with the rise of Donald Trump and who seeks solace, companionship and righteous indignation in cable news. (Not pictured: my father, a Republican-turned-independent, absorbed in his iPad, pretending to be out of earshot.) MSNBC is not my mom\u2019s only news source \u2014 nor her only act of political engagement. But if the hours spent watching MSNBC are an index of a certain strain of liberal occupation, that index is at an all-time high, and not just in our house..It\u2019s logical that an unpredictable president is a boon to news outlets. But as a password-borrowing millennial, I was surprised that the Trump effect touched television. Didn\u2019t many people decide cable news was bad when Fox News gave birth to President Trump? What do all those talking heads actually talk about all day?What I learned from my MSNBC mom, my MSNBC mom\u2019s friends and my friends\u2019 MSNBC moms is that cable news can play a symbiotic role with social media and straight news. MSNBC makes an authoritative narrative out of reports, takes and jokes that feel fragmented on Twitter. It is a safe space to contemplate issues viewers feel they can\u2019t bring up in mixed company (especially when mixed company liked a post about \u201cSpygate\u201d on Facebook). An evening with Ari, Chris, the other Chris and Rachel isn\u2019t just about licking the wounds of 2016. It shores up progressive bona fides called into question by both-sides-ism and liberal hand-wringing.MSNBC\u2019s popularity mirrors the rise of conservative media, said Sarah Sobieraj, a Tufts University sociologist and author of \u201cThe Outrage Industry.\u201d For the past 20 years, right-wing talk radio and Fox News have assured conservatives who felt their way of life was threatened that their politics didn\u2019t make them bad people (and did little to address their suspicion that women, people of color and immigrants \u2014 as opposed to, say, outsourcing and wage stagnation \u2014 were to blame).Today, it\u2019s liberals who feel that their way of life is under siege, Professor Sobieraj told me, because a president was elected for views his conservative peers had been shamed into suppressing. For liberals, watching beliefs they find abhorrent \u201cbe applauded, voted and institutionalized is unnerving, upsetting and probably confusing,\u201d she said. Consuming liberal media \u2014 whether it\u2019s MSNBC, \u201cPod Save America\u201d or John Oliver \u2014 is like \u201cgoing to a political church.\u201d \u201cYou listen to someone say the things you feel in a more powerful, dramatic way,\u201d Professor Sobieraj said.My MSNBC mom, Maggie Stoeffel, isn\u2019t new to cable news. As a stay-at-home parent, she followed Katie Couric from her reporting on the Gulf War to the tamer waters of anchoring \u201cToday\u201d and, after Sept. 11, ditched Martha and Oprah for CNN. After going back to work, she woke up to \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and kept up with Twitter throughout the day. Now retired, she can tune into an entire lineup covering \u201cthe Trump White House downfall mini-series,\u201d as she wishfully put it.Before I could formally interview her about MSNBC, my mom put her thoughts in a 700-word email, organized by anchor. The longest section was about Nicolle Wallace.\u201cI think she\u2019s a superstar,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe\u2019s a Republican, so watching her show I feel no one (Dad) can accuse me of hanging out in my liberal media echo chamber.\u201d As she went on to describe how Ms. Wallace makes her viewers feel that they\u2019re in her inner circle, chatting with really smart friends, I felt a pang of jealousy. Wasn\u2019t I an adequately delightful moderator of family political debates? But then, most of the time, I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m safely ensconced in my digitally tethered Brooklyn progressive bubble, whereas my mom, living in the swing state of Pennsylvania \u2014 with neighbors she actually knows \u2014 has to tread lightly.She likes Mr. Melber for his legal expertise, his rap references and his reluctance to shout. She follows his show with Chris Hayes, and then she might watch Rachel Maddow, unless her husband is home. Ms. Duffy hasn\u2019t converted him to MSNBC, she said, but she has drawn him into the drama of seeing which Louise Mensch tweets turn out to be true.The network star and \u201cAll In\u201d host Chris Hayes is feeling the MSNBC mom love at book events, where parent-child pairs \u2014 and mother-daughter pairs in particular \u2014 line up for a photo or book signing. \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s the mom who got really into the show and talked it up to her daughter,\u201d he said. Mr. Hayes said his viewers\u2019 connection to him has become \u201cintense and visceral\u201d since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, partly because they can feel that he\u2019s just trying to figure it out too. \u201cIt\u2019s all pretty bewildering to me,\u201d he said.Growing audiences offer some relief from ratings pressure, Mr. Hayes said, but they are counterbalanced by the pressure to get things right. \u201cIt feels easier to screw up in this era,\u201d he said, and those mistakes feel more costly for everyone. \u201cThe most powerful person in the country \u2014 and arguably the world \u2014 is a person who manifestly does not care about getting it right, and because of that has an insidious power to drag other people down to his level.\u201dWhat does it mean, these days, to get things right? I talked about this with another MSNBC mom, Wendel Meldrum, an actor, writer and, until recently, print media devotee in Laurel Canyon, Calif. \u201cThe \u2018truth\u2019 from media is so varied,\u201d she told me. \u201cMy relationship to truth is more fluid now.\u201dOn the issues she cares about most, she focuses on the policy impact of the news. When it comes to the Russia investigation, Ms. Meldrum said, she checks in with her people on Twitter, then watches Rachel Maddow, to see where she is with the information she\u2019s gotten from Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty amazing feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s bringing long-known Twitter news into the mainstream.\u201dMs. Meldrum\u2019s comfort with subjectivity is familiar to me, with my post-structural liberal arts education. But it\u2019s not very #resistance. So I asked MSNBC moms: What is the difference between MSNBC and Fox News?In response, I heard that Fox News is chaotic, reflecting a moral vacuum among Republicans. MSNBC anchors, however biased, approach debate from a more coherent ideological stance.My mom told me that MSNBC \u2014 far from whipping up partisan fervor \u2014 actually calms her down after a day reading Twitter. (My dad: \u201cI don\u2019t think that is true.\u201d)As to whether the MSNBC moms might still be living in an echo chamber? To their credit, they\u2019re not sure. But they\u2019re also not sure where else to go.On this front, I relate to them. I know where I stand politically and I want information tailored to my political objectives. I\u2019m no stranger to media as companionship. And until my mom gets into \u201cVanderpump Rules,\u201d the Russia investigation is the show we have in common. We talk about politics now every time we talk, deepening our relationship. I know her as a thinker, and I have a new level of respect for her politically mixed marriage. As a bonus, we have less time to talk about what so-and-so\u2019s daughter did for her wedding.Still, I was relieved to talk to an MSNBC mom and middle-school teacher in Nashville, Maresa Brassil. She is a cord cutter, but she streams Rachel Maddow at night. Ms. Maddow\u2019s detailed policy discussions arm Ms. Brassil with the information she needs for life in a red state. But on an emotional level, Ms. Maddow gives her more than group affirmation. \u201cI\u2019m glad that Maddow\u2019s not trying to appear to take a middle road,\u201d she told me. \u201cPlaying nice and trying to find common ground hasn\u2019t gotten us very far.\u201dMs. Brassil wasn\u2019t talking about the 2018 midterms specifically, but it made me think about Democratic candidates and their tendency to appear to take a middle road. It made me wonder whether a small part of liberals\u2019 current struggles might stem from some people, maybe women in particular, not feeling entitled to demand the full scope of progressivism from their elected officials. And it excited me to consider what Democratic slates might look like if a generation of MSNBC moms were more engaged, more confident and less compromising.Kat Stoeffel is a freelance writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shunned by Italy, Migrants at Sea Arrive in Spain", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 About 600 migrants disembarked from three ships on Sunday in the port of Valencia, Spain, more than a week after they had been rescued at sea only to be turned away by Italy and Malta.Arriving separately, the Aquarius, a rescue ship, and two Italian Navy vessels reached Valencia carrying a total of 630 migrants \u2014 including pregnant women and children \u2014 that the Aquarius had originally picked up from six rubber dinghies in the Mediterranean Sea off Libya.After their exhausting journey, migrants shouted with joy as their ships entered Valencia\u2019s port. Some disembarked singing.The fate of the Aquarius has underlined the deep divisions in Europe over how to handle an influx of migrants mostly from the Middle East and Africa.The Aquarius is operated by two European humanitarian groups, SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e and Doctors Without Borders. David Noguera, the president of the Spanish branch of Doctors Without Borders, said on Sunday that the migrants had completed a journey that was \u201ctoo long and generates contradictory feelings.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe blockade of European ports sets a very negative precedent.\u201dItaly\u2019s interior minister and the leader of the anti-immigrant League, Matteo Salvini, had argued that \u201can army of fake refugees\u201d had long exploited what he called the country\u2019s lax rules.That left the ship, which at the time was overburdened with the rescued migrants, stranded at sea in dangerous conditions.The migrants will be granted a special humanitarian permit to stay in Spain for 45 days while the authorities review their cases and give them medical attention. The Spanish government said it would review all of the 630 migrants\u2019 cases to decide whether to grant them asylum. Those who do not fulfill the criteria would face deportation.Italy\u2019s decision to bar the migrants drew a furious reaction from humanitarian groups and other European countries. Spain brought an end to the standoff when its new Socialist government offered to let the migrants land there instead.During the standoff, Italy allowed emergency services to board the Aquarius to check on the migrants, who were crammed on board. The Italian government also sent two navy ships to escort the Aquarius to Spain and to help transport the migrants to reduce overcrowding.Mr. Salvini has cast his government\u2019s turning away of the Aquarius as a political victory. His party campaigned on promises to expel hundreds of thousands of migrants and to prevent new arrivals from landing on Italian shores.Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of Spain said his government\u2019s decision to let the refugees land was an \u201cobligation to avoid a human catastrophe.\u201d Mr. Salvini responded acerbically to the Spanish decision. He welcomed the \u201cgood heart\u201d of Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s government and urged him to \u201calso use his generosity in coming weeks\u201d to welcome more migrants, given that Spain has received far fewer than Italy.Even as the Aquarius migrants reached safety after their week at sea, others faced a similar ordeal.Mr. Salvini warned on his Facebook page on Saturday that \u201ctwo other ships with the flag of Netherlands \u2014 Lifeline and Seefuchs \u2014 have arrived off the coast of Libya, waiting for their load of human beings abandoned by the smugglers.\u201dHe said Italy would block those other rescue ships, too, writing: \u201cThese gentlemen know that Italy no longer wants to be complicit in the business of illegal immigration, and therefore will have to look for other ports (not Italian) where to go.\u201dOn Sunday morning, Spanish medical staff boarded the Dattilo to carry out preliminary health checks when the Italian Navy ship reached its assigned dock at Valencia\u2019s port, shortly before 7 a.m. local time. Spanish police officers began registering the first migrants once they were allowed to disembark. The Orione, another Italian Navy vessel, was the last to reach Valencia, more than six hours after the Dattilo.The first migrant who completed the registration process was a 29-year-old man from Sudan, according to Spanish news reports. Over 2,000 people helped receive the migrants in Valencia, including Red Cross workers and interpreters.Some of the migrants are expected to be transferred to France, after the government of President Emmanuel Macron announced that passengers from the Aquarius who wished to resettle in his country would be welcomed.The arrival of the Aquarius coincided with the rescue of almost 1,000 migrants off the southern coast of Spain over the weekend. The migrants, traveling in dozens of dinghies, were picked up by the country\u2019s maritime rescue services as they were trying to cross the waters separating Morocco from Spain.\u201cSpain faces an avalanche of migrants because of the call effect,\u201d the headline on the front page of ABC, a Spanish right-wing newspaper, read on Sunday. The newspaper said that \u201calmost 1,000 illegals\u201d had reached southern Andalusia, calling it the largest influx of migrants since 2014.According to ABC, the message sent by the government\u2019s humanitarian gesture could be \u201cused by the mafias that traffic human beings to increase their activity, because it allows them to make their clients believe that the entrance to Spanish territory \u2014 and hence that of Europe \u2014 will be easier from now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Of course, the city ought to do that, too.) This argument underscores that the current testing regime is not \u201crace-blind,\u201d since it can\u2019t be separated from the reality of unequal schools and the disadvantages of generations of poverty and racism.In an interview, the city\u2019s new schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, argued that relying on a single test harmed all New Yorkers, including Asian families who spend scarce resources on test prep. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that the system has forced you to spend your time, your treasure on preparing your kids for that test,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp is on the way.\u201d\u201cDuring a nightly-news segment about a cooking contest, a reporter talked to some people who did the best in the contest.\u201dThe question asks for the most precise revision for the words talked to some people who did the best in the contest. Option A (\u201cconversed with some of the people who won the contest\u201d) and Option C (\u201cdiscussed the contest with some of the winners\u201d) do not precisely state how many people the reporter interviewed. Option B (\u201cspoke to the three contestants who did well\u201d) specifies the number of people interviewed but uses the imprecise phrase \u201cwho did well.\u201d Option D is the only option that precisely states the reporter\u2019s action (\u201cinterviewed\u201d) as well as who exactly the reporter interviewed (\u201cthe top three contestants\u201d).List the factors of 48: 1 and 48, 2 and 24, 3 and 16, 4 and 12, 6 and 8. There are no factors greater than 24 and less than 48.\u201cThe animal shelter, which is located on Midway Street, is looking for volunteers to help with a variety of tasks, such as walking dogs cleaning kennels, hand-feeding newborn kittens, and supporting the pet adoption process.\u201dThe sentence in the box needs a comma to separate items in a series. Option A (\u201cdelete the comma after shelter\u201d) would remove the necessary comma before the nonrestrictive clause \u201cwhich is located on Midway Street.\u201d Option B (\u201cinsert a comma after volunteers\u201d) is incorrect because while the phrase that ends with the word \u201cvolunteer\u201d can stand on its own as an independent clause, a comma is not needed before the explanation of what the volunteers would help do. Option D (\u201cdelete a comma after kennels\u201d) would delete a necessary comma between two items in a series. Option C is the only option that would place a necessary comma to separate items \u201cwalking dogs\u201d and \u201ccleaning kennels\u201d in the series.xRQ72PSxRQ72PSThe total number of candies in the box is 5 + 3 + 2 = 10. The number of candies that are not banana is 5 + 2 = 7. The probability of the first candy not being banana is 7/10. Now, out of 9 candies, there are 6 candies left that are not banana. The probability of the second candy not being banana is 6/9. Multiply these two probabilities to get the solution: 7/10 x 6/9 = 42/90 = 7/15.For the plan to succeed, the city will surely need to increase remedial and enrichment programs at the specialized high schools, to serve students who were at the top of their classes but whose middle schools may not have prepared them for the rigor of a Stuyvesant.In the meantime, there\u2019s nothing to stop the mayor from implementing those parts of his plan that don\u2019t require state action. He could begin with the five specialized high schools not covered by the 1971 state law.Mr. de Blasio could also consider applying the plan, or something similar, to the city\u2019s other competitive high schools, many of which are also failing to admit significant numbers of black and Latino students.It is a bitter irony, or just a deeply damning fact, that the spirit of Jim Crow would prove so stubborn in a city whose leaders pride themselves on their enlightened politics. Without aggressive action, New York will continue to fail its black and Latino students, a waste of their potential and its own.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Life of a Restaurant Inspector: Rising Grades, Fainting Owners", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA short man in a beige button-down shirt emblazoned with the New York City health department logo walked through the doors of a restaurant kitchen, detected signs of vermin and called over the owner to tell him the bad news.The restaurateur started shaking and sweating. He fell out of his chair, hit the floor and lost consciousness. An ambulance was called.The most feared and loathed character in the city\u2019s restaurant business is not the critic, or the landlord. It\u2019s the health inspector.Eight years on, that furor has cooled. The number of restaurants with an A grade rose to 93 percent in April, from 81 percent in that first year. Yet many restaurateurs still feel aggrieved about the rating system; they talk of the health inspectors as arbitrary, unjust \u2014 and frightening enough to send an owner to the hospital with a panic attack.As it turns out, the man in beige who precipitated that crisis is a pleasant, even-keeled individual named Fayick Suleman, who lives in the Bronx with his wife and two children, and \u2014 like the letter-grading system \u2014 is celebrating his eighth anniversary at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.His experience shows how the inspector\u2019s job works, and how much it has changed, or hasn\u2019t. He says his rounds have become fairly routine \u2014 at least for him.The sight of his distinctive black Casio G\u2019zOne flip phone, the kind issued to inspectors, often sends restaurant staffs into a panic, even when Mr. Suleman goes as a civilian.He has since switched to an iPhone. Still, chaos inevitably erupts whenever he arrives at a restaurant and announces he is there to inspect it.\u201cPeople start running back and forth, throwing out food, picking up mops,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone panics. If you wait too long to do the walk-through, everything is out of your way.\u201dMr. Suleman grew up in Kumasi, a city in Ghana. He left in 2002, came to New York and studied biochemistry at Hunter College, hoping to become a brain surgeon. But after the financial downturn in 2008, he realized that, with a family to support, he needed a more immediate source of income. One day, he met a health inspector at the lab where he worked.\u201cI had always been curious about health inspectors,\u201d Mr. Suleman said. \u201cI always find it puzzling how, when you go to a restaurant and order food, someone disappears and then next thing you know they appear with your food. I always wondered what happened behind the scenes. What do they do with my food? Who is monitoring them?\u201dThe application requirements, he said, were simple: 30 college credits in a biological or physical science. The hard part was the training. Inspectors must attend months of classes, covering everything from how to write violations to the science of food safety.At a recent food-protection class at the city\u2019s Health Academy on West 100th Street, students were taught all the diseases a customer could contract if different foods were left out for too long. Served at the improper temperature, smoked fish, for example, can carry dangerous bacteria called clostridium botulinum.\u201cAnd clostridium botulinum leads to \u2026 ?\u201d asked Meena Wheeler-Rivera, the instructor and a former health inspector for city swimming pools and saunas.\u201cParalysis!\u201d the class of about 20 responded in unison.\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t go to the hospital \u2026 ?\u201d\u201cYou die!\u201dMs. Wheeler-Rivera knows so much that she rarely eats out anymore. Mr. Suleman still patronizes restaurants, but the potential life-or-death consequences of not writing up a violation are ingrained in him.On a recent morning, he had just shut down a restaurant after finding mouse droppings in the walk-in refrigerator. \u201cYou usually won\u2019t find mouse droppings in a fridge, because it\u2019s a cool environment,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to have droppings in a walk-in is totally uncalled-for. What a way to start the day.\u201d He shook his head disapprovingly.Mr. Suleman conducts three or four inspections a day, on average, normally working from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m., or from 3 to 11 p.m. \u2014 though a nightclub inspection, say, could keep him out as late as 3 a.m.His daily schedule is set by a computer that generates a list of randomly selected restaurants in any of the five boroughs. (How often a restaurant is inspected depends on how it has fared in past visits.)When he shows up and introduces himself, he said, restaurants try various \u201ctricks\u201d: Servers press buzzers underneath the host stand to alert the staff that the inspector is there. Sometimes the manager will say he has to go find the manager, and use that time to get ready.Inspections can take as little as an hour (a perfect score \u2014 zero, for no violations \u2014 is possible), or several hours if food-safety conditions are poor. Mr. Suleman has to finish one visit before he can start the next; this means that, contrary to the widespread belief that inspectors deliberately show up during peak hours, he has little control over what time he arrives.\u201cOnce we walk in, we can\u2019t just say, \u2018No, you are busy, let\u2019s call it a day,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter the length of the line or how busy a restaurant is, I have to find a way to get the inspection done. It\u2019s unavoidable.\u201dLife on the job is lonely. Mr. Suleman travels around the city by himself, carrying a backpack with about 40 pounds of equipment: a Panasonic tablet for typing up reports, a portable Brother printer that allows him to deliver his findings on the spot, two kinds of probes for testing air and food temperatures, alcohol pads for sanitizing the probes, a small flashlight, various types of tags for marking and embargoing food and equipment, and the most important tools of all: the letter grades, printed on thick card stock.Mr. Suleman carefully pulled out the signs: Grade Pending, A, B, \u201cthe almighty C,\u201d he said. The last one read, \u201cClosed By Order of the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene.\u201d\u201cThis is the sign that nobody wants to see,\u201d he added with a small chuckle.Without that incentive, many restaurants risked being shut down. \u201cI remember closing 10 restaurants in one day,\u201d Ms. Testa said. \u201cWe were not doing anything but closing people down and taking their money.\u201dToday, before any inspection, every restaurant receives a health department work sheet detailing all potential violations, so owners can pre-emptively fix problems. Mr. Suleman and others conduct low-cost penalty-free consultations and free workshops for restaurants \u2014 measures meant to level the playing field for independent restaurants that lack the resources of larger groups.But restaurateurs are no less wary about the inspection process; many find it overly subjective, and too ready to write up violations for minor infractions.Virginia\u2019s recently received a B grade after an inspector found evidence of mice and foods kept at improper temperatures. The grade was raised to an A after the restaurant addressed some of the violations, and successfully disputed others in a hearing with the city\u2019s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. (Any restaurant can challenge violations before the office.)But even with the A, Mr. Adelson said he ended up paying about $600 in fines, which are imposed by the office. These penalties \u2014 which can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars \u2014 and other expenses end up being more financially burdensome than helpful in improving operations, he said.\u201cIf the inspector had a great day, cool, they are typically nicer and more lenient,\u201d he said. But others \u201chad a chip on their shoulder and rushed into the kitchen like there was something going on.\u201dMr. Tang also owns a restaurant in Philadelphia, where \u201cit\u2019s almost laughable how much more lax it is,\u201d he said.\u201cThere is more of a trust in restaurants\u201d in that city, which does not assign letter grades, he added. \u201cThey know we are not out to poison people. We are just trying to make a living and provide a service.\u201d\u201cWe had to display a B on our door for quite a while, just because of that gray area,\u201c she said. \u201cWe consider that location to be our cleanest store, but that\u2019s going to make customers pause.\u201d (The grade was later raised to an A.)Corinne Schiff, the city\u2019s deputy commissioner of environmental health, said there were a number of measures to ensure that restaurants were judged objectively and on the same scale, including an exacting reporting protocol for inspectors to follow, and the random assignments.But the health department still clearly feels the tension that hovers over the process. It would not let a reporter trail Mr. Suleman during his inspections, and limited his interview time. Mr. Suleman would not allow his face to be shown in photographs, and was reticent about some details, including his age and his exact salary; the job pays between $42,500 and about $76,000 a year, the department said.Mr. Suleman often feels frustrated by the perception that inspectors are out to punish restaurants. \u201cI\u2019m not all-powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe power is in the hands of the restaurants\u201d to improve their food safety.So when he shuts a restaurant down, he said, \u201chow do you expect me to feel bad? You have a set of rules, and if you are not following those rules, you deserve what you get.\u201dThis, he insisted, is not what his job is like: He tries to be as friendly as possible (but not too friendly, \u201cor they think you will pass them\u201d) and communicate openly throughout the inspection.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any inspector who takes pride in closing down a restaurant,\u201d he added. \u201cBut imagine food not being cooked to the right temperature, and someone getting very sick. That would make me feel even more guilty.\u201dNo matter how many customers are protected by shutting down a restaurant, though, the nit-picking, fine-levying bureaucrat will never be the protagonist of the story.\u201cYou want to know why there are only 100 inspectors for 25,000 restaurants?\u201d Ms. Testa asked. \u201cIt is a tough job. You have to go into restaurants knowing they are going to hate you. You have to have a tough skin. It\u2019s not warm and fuzzy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I left the health department, to be honest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

People who value their privacy come from all demographic groups, but the impact of consumer tracking varies greatly by race, class and power. When you\u2019re the \u201cright\u201d race, gender and sexual orientation, when you\u2019ve got the right schools and jobs on your profile, marketers use tracking to flatter and include you.

{"Headline": "A Brooklyn Favorite for Jamaican Food Beats the Odds", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review8 PhotosTo the right of the door, behind a counter, was the restaurant\u2019s single stove. It had three burners that were almost always going. No matter when I went there it seemed that about a quarter of the things on the menu had not finished cooking, but complaining would have been cloddish, both because the limitations on capacity were obvious and because whatever was finished was bound to be both nuanced and powerful.The whole operation was one of those precarious marvels of adaptive survival, like a pine growing from a crack in the side of a cliff. So the outlook was grim when news came two summers ago that the structures housing the Islands and another business were being torn down so a new apartment building could be constructed. This neighborhood and the ones to the south between Flatbush and Ralph Avenues owe much of their character to black- and immigrant-owned businesses, including a large swath of Caribbean restaurants such as the Islands. With developers sniffing at this part of Brooklyn, many of them are at risk.Marilyn Reid, who owns the Islands with Shuon Letchford, had other ideas. She had had other ideas since 2001, when she opened the restaurant. \u201cWe were always looking because we had outgrown it by the second day,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cWe knew.\u201dBefore closing the original space in March 2017, she and Ms. Letchford had found a much bigger one downhill on Washington Avenue. Preparing it took a few months more than she had hoped, but the second incarnation of the Islands has been up and running since January.The new kitchen has two stoves and 10 burners. Nevertheless, what\u2019s available when I\u2019ve gone has always been several dishes shy of the complete menu. The stewed okra with cod is especially hard to pin down. At the same time, the comfort of the bigger dining room and the table service, an impossibility in the first space, have encouraged me to branch out beyond my usual favorites.The Islands is best known for long-simmered stews but the kitchen also knows a thing or two about frying. The flattened fritters of salt cod seasoned with fresh hot chiles, known as stamp and go, were crunchy and golden. Some Caribbean cooks deep-fry fish escovitch to oblivion, on the theory that spicy vinegar heals all wounds. The escovitch I had at the Islands was a whole red snapper, obviously fresh and fried just until firm. The vinegar dressing, meanwhile, was seasoned with not just hot chiles but pickled bell peppers, carrots and cucumbers, making this escovitch more interesting than usual.From the old days, I knew the curried goat would be very tender and richly seasoned, although like most of the cooking at the Islands, it was never scalp-piercingly spicy. Now I\u2019ve found a new standby in the curried vegetables \u2014 a very different thing, of course, but the golden raisins, turmeric and allspice may do even more for cabbage and carrots than they do for goat meat.Barbecue chicken was ordered in a rush verging on panic because whatever I\u2019d first wanted wasn\u2019t ready yet. The sauce is nothing like the ketchup-based sludge I\u2019d imagined. Made with raisins and allspice, it tastes more like a glaze for a holiday ham, and it\u2019s lovely.I prefer it to the jerk chicken, which will sound like heresy to some customers. Like barbecue, jerk can describe either a sauce or a process, and the process needs to involve wood smoke. The Islands bakes its jerk chicken in the oven, and while I like its sauce, when I want jerk chicken I will cross Eastern Parkway and keep the windows down until I smell burning allspice logs.But I have no quarrel with the jerk shrimp or leg of lamb at the Islands \u2014 there\u2019s no place to get an allspice-smoked version of either, as far as I know. The lamb is especially alluring, stuffed with jerk spices and slowly roasted until its outer crust falls, upon slicing, into a dark rubble that in New Orleans would be called debris.Rice and peas, fried plantains and stewed cabbage, slippery with coconut oil, are all mandatory in my book. Others insist on baked macaroni and cheese, served in a brick the size of a pound of butter. When I taste the bread crumbs on top, and wonder if they\u2019ve been seasoned with dried onions, I think those people may have a point.All of this food is brought to the table on oval platters that could hold a small Thanksgiving turkey.Since opening in January, the new dining room has been embellished bit by bit. The walls are painted in watermelon and aquamarine. Small hurricane lamps decorate the tables. A couple of weeks ago, plaid cloth napkins made their debut in the middle of dinner service. Menus, which used to be kept inside a clear plastic sheath, are now presented inside folders made of textured handmade paper, held in place with stickers of bumblebees and butterflies.The bar, across the dining room from the kitchen, is still unoccupied while Ms. Reid waits for a liquor license to come through. A rumored roof deck has not materialized, either. In the meantime there is an excellent limeade sweetened with demerara sugar and a dark purple, fruity sorrel punch, which can give the impression it has been lightly spiked with rum.Credit for the food at the Islands is shared. There are two chefs, Delroy Henry and Ronald Porter. Most of the recipes, though, are Ms. Letchford\u2019s, and she does a lot of the cooking. Like Ms. Reid, all of them were raised in Jamaica before moving to New York, but only Ms. Letchford did any professional cooking there. Ms. Reid is often in the kitchen too. \u201cI do the light stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI tend to stay with salads, seafood.\u201dIs the food as good as before? I used to be impressed that anything at all could be cooked at the old Islands. That so much of it was actively delicious seemed like a miracle. It\u2019s less astonishing now that the kitchen has 10 burners and room to turn around.But I suspect the only thing that\u2019s changed is me. And when I\u2019m in the mood for something miraculous, I\u2019ll just remind myself that the Islands is still in business. You can\u2019t stop gentrification, but sometimes you can fool it while it\u2019s looking the other way.EMAIL petewells@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dairy Farms Find a Lifeline: Beer", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe\u2019re at a historic low nationwide in terms of farmers getting money for their milk,\u201d said Sean DuBois, who works in the family business. (His wife, Molly Stevens, is the daughter of the third-generation patriarch, Phil Stevens.)Prices have cratered, driven by high supply and falling demand. For Carter & Stevens, staying solvent required creative thinking. \u201cTo succeed today as a dairy farm, you need to diversify,\u201d Mr. DuBois said. \u201cWe found our passion for craft beer.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s totally changed our farm forever,\u201d said Mr. DuBois, 37, who manages the brewery.To save their livelihoods, many dairy farms have started breweries, bolstering bottom lines with a different kind of liquid capital.It\u2019s another chapter in the dairy and brewing industries\u2019 interlinked history. Brewers often supply farmers with spent grains for feed, and many American craft breweries have started by using secondhand dairy infrastructure.Ken Grossman founded Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, Calif., in 1980 with equipment scavenged from closed Midwestern dairies. The tanks were attractive because of their abundance, affordability and high sanitary standards. \u201cFor a small brewer who wasn\u2019t going to pasteurize his beer, having hygienically designed equipment was a real boon,\u201d Mr. Grossman said.Dairies also adapt empty tanks for alternate uses \u2014 as Josh Cody\u2019s family eventually did after its dairy farm in Alamosa, Colo., fell on hard times in the mid-1990s. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t fiscally viable for a family operation our size to milk cows,\u201d said Mr. Cody, who was 12 when dairy operations wound down.The farm started producing barley on a large scale for Coors Brewing. But family members sold off land, until, by 2006, the remaining fields weren\u2019t economically viable. \u201cWe were following the normal farm story in America where we almost went bankrupt,\u201d Mr. Cody said.To brighten a bleak financial outlook, Carter & Stevens, in Barre, Mass., started a farmstand in 2005 to sell produce, maple syrup and ice cream, soon adding a weekend barbecue featuring its grass-fed-beef burgers. \u201cIf we could sell them a pint or two of beer to go with their meal, that would be a bonus,\u201d Mr. DuBois said.Plans for a brewery were imperiled when a barn intended as its home burned down. Neighbors rode to the rescue by donating their 1820 dairy barn, rebuilt on the charred structure\u2019s site. Carter & Stevens installed brewing equipment bought at an auction, hired a brewer and opened Stone Cow, decorating the property with a 10,000-pound stone cow.\u201cWe have people that come in and get a growler of beer and a gallon of milk,\u201d Mr. DuBois said. \u201cWe take so much pride when people buy our milk. That\u2019s our heritage.\u201dAfter beers like its Brown Chicken Brown Ale sold well at farmers\u2019 markets, the family turned a dairy barn into a taproom. Where cows once chewed cud, customers now converse over crisp pints of Hayfield Blonde as cattle roam outside.\u201cFor a while I was watching the barn fall apart, and now I have hope that the brewery will bring life back to the farm,\u201d said Carol Sanford, an owner of the farm.Porters, pilsners and I.P.A.s are served from taps topped with the property\u2019s old shovels, and customers include former farm employees. The property\u2019s rebirth is a point of pride. \u201cIf you care about the rural heritage of a town, supporting adaptive reuse is necessary,\u201d Mr. Adams said.One structure is devoted to creating spontaneously fermented beer \u2014 made with wild yeast that has never been cultivated \u2014 while the milking parlor will be filled with large oak vessels to age beer.\u201cThis is a true revitalization of that property,\u201d Mr. Boera said, adding that he hopes someday to add dairy cows. \u201cIt\u2019d be cool to offer a dairy product to return the farm to what it once was.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That was not the case on Wednesday for the former chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm at the center of the controversy.Alexander Nix, who led Cambridge Analytica until it suspended him in March, defiantly shot back at accusations from British lawmakers that he or his company engaged in unethical business practices, abused information pulled from the social network or played a role in the British vote to leave the European Union.In a contentious hearing before Parliament\u2019s media committee, Mr. Nix said Cambridge Analytica did at one point have data on millions of Facebook users. The data was harvested from the social network without the users\u2019 consent. But, he said, Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t find the information useful and deleted it after a request from Facebook.His comments contradicted evidence presented by a former Cambridge Analytica employee, Christopher Wylie, who has said the data was central to Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political consulting work for Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Wylie has also suggested that Cambridge Analytica did advising work for the Brexit vote.Mr. Nix criticized Mr. Wylie as a \u201cbitter and jealous\u201d former employee bent on sabotaging the company in order to start a rival business.\u201cI\u2019m sitting here and being subjected to frankly ridiculous accusations based on the most tenuous connections that simply aren\u2019t supported by evidence,\u201d Mr. Nix said when denying that Cambridge Analytica had worked for campaigns in favor of leaving the European Union.\u201cYou\u2019re building a conspiracy,\u201d he said at another point.Cambridge Analytica, backed by Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House political adviser, and Robert Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire, used Facebook data to create psychographic modeling techniques to target voters. While former employees have said Facebook information was critical to building products that Cambridge Analytica deployed in the 2014 and 2016 American elections, Mr. Nix played down the importance. He said the company had gotten data from many sources, including Acxiom, Experian and Infogroup.Beyond that, Mr. Nix largely declined to speak about the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook controversy, citing a continuing investigation by Britain\u2019s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. The lawmakers did not press him about the company\u2019s work with the Trump campaign.The revelations about Cambridge Analytica have led to a global reckoning about the information Facebook has amassed on its roughly two billion users, and the ways that information can be manipulated to sway voters and tailor advertisements to specific types of people.Lawmakers on Wednesday grew increasingly frustrated with Mr. Nix\u2019s aggressive responses.\u201cYou\u2019ve attempted to paint yourself as the victim,\u201d one member of Parliament said. \u201cYou\u2019re not the victim.\u201dMr. Nix shot back: \u201cWhat if I was the victim?\u201dHe said Cambridge Analytica was a convenient target for those angry about Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and the Brexit result.\u201cWe were simply the guys who were perceived to have contributed,\u201d Mr. Nix said.He saved some of his sharpest remarks for Mr. Wylie. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how all your evidence circles all back to one individual,\u201d Mr. Nix said.Mr. Nix apologized to lawmakers on Wednesday, but also said he was the victim of an \u201centrapment sting\u201d by the television network. Channel 4 defended its reporting in a statement.Mr. Nix told lawmakers that the report wasn\u2019t accurate. When pressed about the payment again later, he declined to comment and said he had to review the matter with his lawyer.The months of news reports have made Mr. Nix the face of a broader debate over how social media platforms can be gamed to win votes, and whether they must be more tightly regulated.In addition to the Parliament inquiry, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is expected to publish a damning report on Cambridge Analytica this month.Advertisement"}

Nymphs (young ticks) become infected by feeding on birds and small mammals like mice, chipmunks, raccoons and opossums, Dr. Diuk-Wasser explained. But it\u2019s deer that are responsible for transporting dangerous adult ticks farther and wider.A tick\u2019s happy place is in a humid, forested area. Tree-filled, leaf-littered, shrubby areas are tick territory; sunny, dry patches of grass are usually not.

{"Headline": "How to Reverse the Rising Suicide Rate", "Date": "2018-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:As a 77-year-old woman who has had clinical depression for 35 years, I believe that dispelling the rampant ignorance about depression is the only hope we have of reducing the rising number of suicides.Before each of my three severe depressions, one or more shattering events had taken place that knocked me to the ground \u2014 a divorce, Hurricane Katrina, a huge home fire. I became unable to sleep, eat and, eventually, even get out bed. Suicide beckoned as the only solution to end the physical pain and insurmountable hopelessness.You can\u2019t \u201csnap out of it.\u201d Most important, you are ashamed of your condition and can\u2019t reach out for help because you are compelled to hide your shame from others. Others must recognize these signs and reach out to you and watch over you as you receive the necessary help. This is what must be understood if we are to help those suffering from this heinous, crippling, murderous disease.If you are fortunate, as I am, to respond well to antidepressants, you are saved. But, please, we must all look for these signs in others, reach out and watch over them as we lead them to a safe harbor.To the Editor:Your article informs us of the troubling statistic that the national suicide rate is up 25 percent since 1999. You report, \u201cTreatment for chronic depression and anxiety \u2014 often the precursors to suicide \u2014 has never been more available.\u201dAs a clinical psychologist who helps people manage depression, anxiety and suicidal feelings, I know that treatment is not as readily available to the general public as is suggested.Among my peers, I am in the minority in accepting insurance as payment for services. Why? Insurance companies typically reimburse psychotherapists at very low rates and administrative hurdles interfere with getting paid in a timely and fair manner. Most therapists choose instead to provide services to those who can pay out of pocket for therapy, which, even at a sliding scale rate, is unaffordable to the majority of people who require help.Medication alone is not nearly as effective in treating depression as the combination of talk therapy and medication. It is tragic that many depressed individuals are faced with the demoralizing reality that one can reach out for help and be turned away, because quality treatment is accessible only to those who can afford it.To the Editor:As much as we may think we know someone inside out, we don\u2019t. Those who are very private would never consider divulging their darker thoughts. The recent suicides of both the designer Kate Spade and the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain are perfect examples illustrating that fame, fortune and respect from our peers are not always everything.Anyone who has ever suffered from depression knows how oppressive and painful it can be. It can devour you. But with help, sufferers can get past the point of no return and once again see daylight. It\u2019s just sad that Ms. Spade and Mr. Bourdain saw only one way out of their misery, leaving their families in mental anguish.To the Editor:As a psychotherapist, I believe that the reason for this sharp uptick in suicide is rooted in technology and our growing dependence on social media for our personal relationships. The focus should not be on Facebook stealing users\u2019 data. The focus should be on how Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram have distanced people rather than brought them closer together.It is far more difficult to reach out to others for help when people no longer socialize in person or on the phone. Typing feelings and thoughts onto a phone or a computer screen encourages distance between people instead of nurturing trust. There is no substitute for the sound of a voice or the feel of a hug.While opioids and other prescription medications and the decline in marriage rates are contributing factors to the increase in suicide, a stronger case can be made for the increasing distance that social media has forced in interpersonal relationships.To the Editor:It is unfathomable that The Times would devote so much coverage, in such detail, to these recent deaths while also reporting, in the very same week, the rising suicide rate.To the Editor:I was shaken to the core when I heard about Anthony Bourdain\u2019s death. I felt unhinged, a dangerous thing for me. I suffered from bouts of terrible depression since I was a teenager, but thanks to excellent meds and counseling, I have been full of life for the past 25 years. However, mental illness, of which depression is one form, is a disease. It is treatable, but rarely curable. One always has to be on guard for any danger symptoms and immediately take preventive action.With the news of Anthony\u2019s death, I felt the warning signs of spiraling out of control. Recognizing these, I pulled out my therapist\u2019s card in case I needed to call, and immediately employed one of the physical activities that have proven to allay these moments: shopping for ingredients and cooking. It is life-affirming, made even more so when you taste the exquisiteness of your creation.To the Editor:I know about suicide and suicidal thoughts. Five members of my immediate family killed themselves. I have had thoughts of being better off dead. It\u2019s hard to predict suicide, but not hard to know when someone is hurting or depressed or withdrawn. The hard part is knowing what to do or say, how to help.The writer is the author of \u201cSilent Grief: Living in the Wake of Suicide.\u201dTo the Editor:The name we currently call this terrible disorder of the mind, \u201cdepression,\u201d is one of the primary obstacles in assisting friends and relatives. It makes people think it\u2019s like having a bad day, but just a bit worse. It\u2019s not. People need to understand that, like cancer or diabetes or hepatitis, it is a disease. It is not within the person\u2019s control. It is not a personal failing or weakness. It inflicts utter torment on those whom it afflicts and can drive them to suicide. Like any other true disease, it affects rich and poor, famous and obscure, extrovert and introvert. We all need to understand that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Burrowing Clam Is Not Boring. It Uses Acid to Make Its Home.", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResearchers have solved the mystery of how this small species of giant clam forms its own cave inside the rock of a coral reef.When a burrowing giant clam is very young, only about half a millimeter long, it picks out the home it will have for the rest of its life. It attaches itself to the rock of a reef, and as time passes, it grows larger (although as the smallest of giant clams, it reaches only 10 to 15 centimeters in length). Simultaneously, it sinks into the rock at an imperceptibly slow rate. When a scuba diver swims by an adult clam on one of the Pacific reefs where they live, all she will see is what looks like a protruding pair of beautiful turquoise lips. These are the clam\u2019s feeding tissues, basking in the sun and filtering food from the water \u2014 the rest of its body is safely encased in a cave of its own making. That\u2019s illuminating because reefs are built by tiny coral organisms that create their own skeletons out of calcium carbonate. When they die, they leave behind their hard shells, and their descendants, as well as many other creatures like the clams, make their homes in and on the resulting hummocks. Mix calcium carbonate and acid, however, and the molecules of the rock dissolve, in the same reaction you would see if you dropped an Alka-Seltzer into Coca-Cola, which is weakly acidic.Decades ago, researchers had suspected that the clams used acid, as well as perhaps sanding down the stone using their rough shells. But when they released pH-sensitive fluid into the seawater around clams, there was no change, even very close to the foot, the meaty tissue that emerges from the base of the shell and presses against the rock. Baffled, they turned their attention elsewhere. Richard Hill, a biologist at Michigan State University who is an author on the new paper, and his co-authors wondered whether looking for acid in the seawater wasn\u2019t the wrong way to go about it \u2014 the acid might only be found on the flat surface where the foot was pressing. \u201cSo we looked for a 2-D way to detect acidity,\u201d said Dr. Hill.Soon, the team had nine burrowing giant clams resting comfortably on flat, color-changing pH-sensitive foil in lab tanks. When they used a camera to photograph the foil from the bottom, the evidence was clear: The shape of the clams\u2019 feet was visible in light red, indicating that they had created an acidic environment at least two pH levels stronger than that of the seawater. Further testing showed that the feet contained a molecular pump that moves around hydrogen ions, or protons, to make acid.The reason earlier tests did not pick up on acid around the clams might come down to the rate at which they can make it, suggests Dr. Hill. When the clams are pressing their feet against a surface, even a fairly small number of protons will be concentrated together, leading to a substantial drop in pH at that spot. A large volume of water would pose a much bigger challenge. \u201cMy guess is the reason they don\u2019t acidify seawater is they simply aren\u2019t making protons fast enough to do that,\u201d said Dr. Hill. The research not only answers an old question about how these clams burrow, but also implies ways in which they contribute to the reef ecosystem. By dissolving old coral, the clams release the calcium carbonate back into the water for living coral to use. An earlier version of this article misstated the university where Richard Hill is a biologist. It is Michigan State University, not the University of Michigan.Advertisement"}

The routine is always the same: Check what\u2019s on display, find the most fetching option and consider guests\u2019 tastes (and the contents of my wallet). Take the plunge.It would be easiest to toss them, unshelled, into a pot of boiling water, seasoned with plenty of salt and aromatics, then serve them with melted butter or a mayonnaise-based sauce for dipping, some crusty French bread or a few boiled potatoes. Peeling the shrimp at the table would be part of the evening\u2019s entertainment.For something fancier, I could peel and devein the raw shrimp \u2014 it\u2019s not difficult, though some fishmongers will do it for you \u2014 and saut\u00e9 them in butter. Add salt, pepper, tarragon, perhaps, a splash of white wine, and they\u2019re done in minutes. Serve with steamed rice. I\u2019m also partial to spaghetti with shrimp. I cook the shrimp in extra-virgin olive oil, and, just before they\u2019re done, add a good dash of crushed red pepper and lots of chopped garlic and parsley. Then, I toss the whole lot with perfectly al dente pasta.But maybe because it was a warm, sunny day, I made a relatively simple shrimp curry. For best results, I let the shrimp steep in spices for a bit, starting with a combination of salt and pepper, turmeric, cumin and coriander, and adding chiles and sweet-sour tamarind paste. Mushrooms, a natural pairing, also played a part. You can use whatever cultivated varieties you can find, whether button-type brown or white ones, pale gray or golden oyster mushrooms.To put it all together, I used coconut oil and coconut milk. My Indian grocery had fresh curry leaves, so I added those to the pan, but the dish is fine without them. Mint and cilantro and lime wedges decorated the platter. I was feeling lazy, so I bought a jar of bright green chutney, the saucy kind made from pur\u00e9ed mint, chiles and coriander, with a touch of sugar and coconut. It\u2019s not hard to make, but this particular store-bought brand tasted surprisingly homemade.I put it in a bowl and sent it to the table as well, for a little kick. Everyone loved the curry, but the chutney? That was my secret.Advertisement"}

She unrolled it and there was her father, young, handsome and grinning amid a phalanx of soldiers.She was stunned: \u201cIt looked like a graduating class of Army men.\u201dHer father was a longtime mail carrier who loved his family, fishing and his beloved, gleaming Cadillacs. He never spoke about his service in World War II. On the day she found the photo, he finally told her why.Her father, John E. James Jr., graduated from the Army\u2019s Officer Candidate School in Fort Benning, Ga. in 1942, but was never allowed to serve as a commissioned officer. Instead, he was shipped overseas as a corporal with an all-black battalion at a time when racial discrimination in the military derailed the dreams and careers of a generation of African-American soldiers.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Mr. James, who descends from a long line of military men dating back to the Revolutionary War. \u201cI thought it would never happen.\u201dThe campaign took nearly three years. They sent more than a dozen emails and letters, made two appeals and encountered so many dead ends and disappointments that Ms. Lane half-jokingly wondered whether the Army was hoping her father would \u201ckick the bucket\u201d so that no one would have to acknowledge wrongdoing.\u201cI was ready to throw in the towel,\u201d Mr. James admitted.But after decades of silence, Mr. James was ready to tell his story. As a young man, he had never met any black officers and he had never seen any either.But after he was drafted in 1941, he heard that the Army wanted to recruit black officers. He applied and was accepted in 1942 to a class at Fort Benning that included 21 men of color.He slept in segregated barracks, but for the first time in his life he also ate, trained and studied alongside his white counterparts.He still remembers joining the jubilant black and white officers-to-be in their march, after they had completed their training in December of that year. They all expected to be promoted the next morning.But later that day, Mr. James said, a white officer pulled him aside. Instead of receiving his commission, he was going to be shipped to another post. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to be getting my bars,\u201d Mr. James said.Ms. Lane suspects that her father was denied his commission because he would outrank some white officers in the battalion he would be assigned to, and black officers were not supposed to supervise whites. Meanwhile, military records show that options for newly graduated black officers were becoming increasingly scarce.Some commanders said they could not house African-Americans who were barred from sharing barracks or mess halls with white officers. Others were more explicit. The Mississippi congressional delegation requested that \u201cno Negro officers be stationed in Mississippi at all,\u201d the study shows.Mr. James didn\u2019t know why he was denied his promotion, but he said he knew better than to complain.LOS ANGELES \u2014 The actor George Takei, who was 5 years old when he was sent with his family to a camp in Arkansas, was rehearsing for a role when his husband interrupted him with some news this week from the Supreme Court.There are too many striking parallels, they said, between their treatment and the logic to justify keeping people out of the country.Mr. Takei read the opinion of Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote that \u201cthe forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of presidential authority.\u201dChief Justice Roberts pushed back against what Justice Sonia Sotomayor called \u201cstark parallels\u201d between the 1944 decision and the majority opinion this week. He added, \u201cKorematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and \u2014 to be clear \u2014 \u2018has no place in law under the Constitution.\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Takei did not revel in the words. Instead, he called the ruling \u201cdeeply ironic.\u201d\u201cWe were classified as enemy aliens,\u201d Mr. Takei said.\u201cThere was no evidence in our case. And there is no evidence of terrorism here now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the court ruled was just as crazy and irrational as incarcerating us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an insult to people who spent their lives fighting,\u201d he added. \u201cMy parents are gone, but I find it hard to imagine they would be celebrating either.\u201dThere are increasingly few people who can talk about their memories of the camps, which began in 1942 and officially existed for more than four years. Mr. Takei and his contemporaries were young children at the time that President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued the executive order after the attack on Pearl Harbor.Most of the people who were in the internment camps during the Second World War have died, including Fred Korematsu, the Oakland native who defied incarceration orders and was convicted of disobeying a military order. Mr. Korematsu appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the internment with a 6-3 ruling, saying the policy was justified to protect national security during a wartime emergency.Here are some of the stories that we\u2019re talking about, beyond The Times.We publish many articles that touch on race.

And they are up 45 percent from the depths of the housing crisis in 2012.The big rebound in home prices and the lure of making a quick buck drew more than 200 people on Tuesday to a MidtownManhattan hotel for a two-hour free class on flipping houses. The lunchtime program I dropped in on was part of a sophisticated come-on for a paid three-day workshop that Nathaniel \u201cThan\u201d Merrill and his FortuneBuilders company plan to hold in the New York metropolitan area. An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience. The instructor at the afternoon session sought to inspire the crowd, saying that if they only had the courage, they could someday quit their day jobs and live the way they always wanted to. Judging by the enthusiastic reaction, many were buying the message.- Matthew GoldsteinThe Chinese market is valuable and distinctive from the rest of the world.

Taking care of yourself has to be your top priority.So, when someone starts a conversation you\u2019re not up to having \u2014 and you are the sole judge of that \u2014 shut them down nicely. Say, \u201cThank you! Let\u2019s talk about it when I\u2019m feeling better.\u201d Then move along without the slightest twinge of discomfort. Anyone with a heart will understand.For the rest of us: When we see people in pain, let\u2019s check our instinct to comfort them on our timetable. Warm notes can be amazing in times of trouble; they give the heartsick more control over when they read them (and often reread them). Phone calls should start with: \u201cIs now a good time to talk?\u201d And we should tread even more lightly when we cross paths in public. It may be kindness that\u2019s driving us to speak. But pausing to find the right moment is even kinder. My dog (and great love) was diagnosed with cancer. I\u2019ve been on the phone \u2014 a lot! \u2014 with my vet, talking through treatment options and end-of-life issues. I share an office with a young guy who must have heard these conversations, but he hasn\u2019t said a single word about my dog. I find this incredibly cold and find myself growing angry with him. Can I tell him how I feel?ANONYMOUSYou see what I\u2019m doing by pairing these first questions, right? Grief and compassion are highly individual \u2014 and highly charged too. Misreadings and missteps are inevitable. I\u2019m sorry for you and your dog, Anonymous. But isn\u2019t it possible that, rather than being an ice prince, your colleague is simply respecting your privacy? You don\u2019t mention confiding in him about your poor dog. Many people, in his shoes, would find it presumptuous to speak \u2014 having overheard just one side of your personal conversations. Tell him about your dog. Give him a chance to live up to your expectations. But even if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m more concerned with you finding folks who will support you than encouraging you to tee off on proximate co-workers. We moved into a new house in the fall. Like many of our neighbors, we have a swimming pool and small patio for outdoor dining. Now that the weather is nicer, we\u2019ve been eating outdoors and swimming a lot. We often turn on our outdoor speakers when we do. A couple of neighbors have complained angrily that they don\u2019t want to hear our music. We\u2019re not blaring it! I think they\u2019re being unreasonable. You?B.B.My son is not a big kid. He just turned 14. Over the years, people who meet him often exclaim rudely that he is small for his age. We are taken aback each time this happens. Afterward, I always wish I had a good way to respond. Any suggestions?MOMLet\u2019s make a deal, Mom. I am much more concerned with how your son feels about these interactions than how you do. Have you spoken with him about the comments? If not, please do \u2014 but later, not in the moment. One of the most shaming episodes of my adolescence was when my mom responded directly to a kid who made a bullying crack to me. It may have been the right thing to do, but it felt terrible to me. Your son may prefer to let these comments slide, or he may want to wield the zinger himself. But his feelings about his size and these stupid comments are the important ones. Start with him. We can build an action plan easily enough after we know how he wants to handle this.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How McKinsey Lost Its Way in South Africa", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "When the godfather of management consulting landed its biggest contract ever in Africa, it made the worst mistake in its storied nine-decade history.Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The blackouts kept coming. The state-owned power company, Eskom, was on the verge of insolvency. Maintenance was being deferred. And a major boiler exploded, threatening the national grid.McKinsey & Company, the godfather of management consulting, thought it could help, but was not sure that it should, according to people involved in the debate. The risk was huge. Could McKinsey fix the problems? Would it get paid? Would it be tainted by South Africa\u2019s rampant political corruption?In late 2015, over objections from at least three influential McKinsey partners, the firm decided the risk was worth taking and signed on to what would become its biggest contract ever in Africa, with a potential value of $700 million.It was also the biggest mistake in McKinsey\u2019s nine-decade history.The contract turned out to be illegal, a violation of South African contracting law, with some of the payments channeled to an associate of an Indian-born family, the Guptas, at the center of a swirling corruption scandal. Then there was the lavish size of that payout. It did not take a Harvard Business School graduate to explain why South Africans might get angry seeing a wealthy American firm cart away so much public money in a country with the worst income inequality in the world and a youth unemployment rate over 50 percent.And a bitter irony: While McKinsey\u2019s pay was supposed to be based entirely on its results, it is far from clear that the flailing power company is much better off than it was before.The Eskom affair is now part of an expansive investigation by South African authorities into how the Guptas used their friendships with Jacob Zuma, then the country\u2019s president, and his son to manipulate and control state-owned enterprises for personal gain. International corruption watchdogs call it a case of \u201cstate capture.\u201d Lawmakers here call it a silent coup. It has already led to Mr. Zuma\u2019s ouster and a moment of reckoning for post-apartheid South Africa.Yet despite extensive coverage of the scandal by the local news media, one question has remained largely unanswered: How did McKinsey, with its vast influence, impeccable research credentials and record of advising companies and governments on best practices, become entangled in such an untoward affair?McKinsey admits errors in judgment while denying any illegality. Two senior partners, the firm says, bear most of the blame for what went wrong. But an investigation by The New York Times, including interviews with 16 current and former partners, found that the roots of the problem go deeper \u2014 to a changing corporate culture that opened the way for an aggressive push into more government consulting, as well as new methods of compensation. While the changes helped McKinsey nearly double in size over the last decade, they introduced more reputational risk.The firm also missed warning signs about the possible involvement of the Guptas, and only belatedly realized the insufficiency of its risk management for state-owned companies. Supervisors who might have vetoed or modified the contract were not South African and lacked the local knowledge to sense trouble ahead. And having poorly vetted its subcontractor, McKinsey was less than forthcoming when asked to explain its role in the emerging scandal.Since the Eskom disclosures, much of McKinsey\u2019s business in South Africa has evaporated. Mr. Barton has made six trips there to assess the damage and make amends, and McKinsey has asked its 2,000 global partners to repay South Africa, where it is under investigation.More broadly, the scandal in South Africa \u2014 which has ensnared several other overseas companies \u2014 underscores the risks that arise as governments increasingly turn over responsibilities to consultants who operate mostly in secret, with little or no public accountability.McKinsey built its brand as the ubiquitous adviser to businesses great and small. But in recent years, it has created an increasingly powerful unseen presence as counselor to governments across the globe.The extent of that global influence is difficult to evaluate because, as a matter of policy, the firm will not reveal clients or the advice it gives.Even so, by examining government records, along with McKinsey publications and other company documents, The Times found that the firm shapes everything from education, transportation, energy and medical care to the restructuring of economies and the fighting of wars.McKinsey\u2019s clients include sovereign wealth funds worth more than a trillion dollars, as well as what one marketing brochure describes as \u201cdefense ministries, military forces, police forces and justice ministries in 15 countries,\u201d where the company consults on such matters as the maintenance and support of \u201carmored personnel carriers; minesweepers, destroyers and submarines; and fast jets and transport aircraft.\u201dMcKinsey \u201cis a hidden, unaccountable power that has a prestigious face,\u201d said Janine R. Wedel, a professor at George Mason University who has written extensively on what she calls \u201cthe shadow elite.\u201d She added, \u201cThink of them as a repository of the most intimate information that governments and others have, from what they are investing in to who wields influence.\u201dMcKinsey refused to work in South Africa until it embraced democracy in the mid-1990s, but records show that it consults for many authoritarian governments, including the world\u2019s mightiest, China, to a degree unheard of for a foreign company. Late last year, two McKinsey partners spoke at a meeting of the state-controlled conglomerate China Merchants Group that focused on carrying out Communist Party directives. McKinsey is also advising the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as he seeks to make its economy less reliant on oil.While confidentiality is necessary in private business, it can become problematic when public money is involved, as in South Africa, or for that matter in the United States, where McKinsey has advised more than 40 federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Department and the Food and Drug Administration.Since President Trump took office, McKinsey has greatly expanded consulting for Immigration and Customs Enforcement through that agency\u2019s office of \u201cdetention, compliance and removals.\u201d Their contracts with the agency exceed $20 million. Asked about those contracts, a McKinsey spokesman said the company\u2019s work focused primarily on administration and organization and was unconnected to immigration policy, including the separation of children and parents at the border.Certainly, consulting firms other than McKinsey keep client lists confidential and work for authoritarian governments. And McKinsey has undeniably been a force for good, through its pro bono work and by helping many organizations become more efficient engines of economic growth. As for the quality of people McKinsey hires, many have gone on to run some of the world\u2019s biggest and most successful companies.That is why McKinsey\u2019s behavior in South Africa is so startling.In 2012, a new class of recruits \u2014 the worker bees in McKinsey\u2019s hive \u2014 settled in at its office in Sandton, Johannesburg\u2019s financial center, often called the richest square mile in Africa. They were part of a notably diverse group. Given South Africa\u2019s historic battle against apartheid, it was a point of pride at McKinsey that more than 60 percent of the office\u2019s 250 employees were black South Africans. Many described their work as a calling, an opportunity to make a difference in a young and still-struggling democracy.Years earlier, McKinsey\u2019s South African partners had decided that to be relevant, they had to embrace the public sector, because of its outsize role in South Africa\u2019s economy. But a South African government weakened by corruption also represented a risk to McKinsey\u2019s sterling reputation \u2014 a reputation forged by its founder, a math whiz from the Ozarks named James O. McKinsey, and nurtured by his disciple and successor, Marvin Bower.Over the decades, the firm \u2014 that\u2019s what it calls itself \u2014 became confidant to chief executives and presidents, simultaneously the secret-keeper of corporate America and its most effective evangelist, preaching the McKinsey way to companies across the globe.There came to be a not entirely hyperbolic narrative of McKinsey\u2019s preordained white-shoe path through the world \u2014 the Harvard Business School recruit turned McKinsey consultant turned rising corporate titan. And few companies have a better track record of producing them: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who oversaw I.B.M.\u2019s turnaround in 1990s, is a McKinsey veteran. So is Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, and Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai.\u201cSo pervasive is the firm\u2019s influence today that it is hard to imagine the place of business in the world without McKinsey,\u201d wrote Duff McDonald, author of \u201cThe Firm,\u201d a 2013 book about the company.McKinsey has had its share of bad publicity, but much of it has focused on people who have already left.It looked bad. And while McKinsey was cleared of wrongdoing, the experience helped steer the company away from government work, avoiding the publicity, the ethical quandaries and the generally lower fees that came with public contracts.But if McKinsey had learned a lesson, it soon began to unlearn it.By the early 2000s, McKinsey re-entered the public sphere in a major way \u2014 and now government contracts and work with state-owned companies make up 16 percent of the firm\u2019s revenues.There was another lesson being unlearned as well: Work for a fixed fee.In the late 1980s, an up-and-coming partner in McKinsey\u2019s energy practice, Jeffrey K. Skilling, had been part of a committee considering whether payment should be based on delivered results, such as reduced costs.As Mr. Skilling told the journalist Anita Raghavan, the panel concluded it would not work, because getting paid based on impact, for example, could give McKinsey an incentive to tell clients to reduce costs even if it was not in their interest. Doing that, Mr. Skilling said, \u201ccould destroy\u201d the firm.Mr. Skilling \u2014 who would become Enron\u2019s chief executive and end up in federal prison after its vast accounting fraud was revealed \u2014 saw the ethical trap. A future generation of McKinsey partners came to a different conclusion.Starting around 2001 or 2002, McKinsey again began to rethink its fee-for-service rule. Its competitors were already changing over. After years of deliberation and study, the firm agreed in 2011 to allow \u201cat risk\u201d contracts alongside its traditional fee structure.\u201cThere\u2019s been client demand for that, clients saying we like that approach,\u201d Mr. Barton said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the results you want, then don\u2019t pay us.\u201dWith this new pay policy and avid embrace of government work, the firm\u2019s South African partners had been handed a seductive vision of the future. Some of McKinsey\u2019s young associates in Johannesburg would end up on the ill-fated Eskom deal. But first, there was an ambitious project at the state-owned rail and port agency, Transnet.McKinsey had worked with Transnet since 2005, embedding itself so deeply that one board member wondered how the agency could ever oust the consultants should the need arise. Still, Transnet remained an underachiever, its ports inadequate, its freight rail system moribund.Then, in February 2011, Transnet got a new chief executive, Brian Molefe, who had been running the country\u2019s public pension fund.McKinsey and Mr. Molefe set out to revitalize the agency by buying as many as 1,064 new locomotives in what would be the biggest government procurement in South African history. But McKinsey would have to take on a subcontractor, under a South African law requiring companies that worked with state-owned enterprises to have black-owned partners.According to prosecutors, the Guptas saw these black-empowerment companies as a way to empower themselves, and state-owned companies like Transnet became willing accomplices. Transnet steered McKinsey toward working with a company, Regiments, owned in part by a businessman linked to the Guptas.But weeks before the winning bidders were announced, McKinsey bowed out, saying the process was moving too quickly.As it turned out, Transet agreed to pay about $1 billion more than the agreed-upon price for the locomotives. And, as leaked documents published last year in the local media revealed, one of the winning bidders, a state-owned Chinese company, paid more than $100 million to shell companies tied to another Gupta associate, Salim Essa.Although it is unclear what, if anything, Mr. Molefe knew about those payments, he left Transnet to search for a new challenge. He found it in 2015 as the chief executive at Eskom.The power company had long been the public\u2019s favorite punching bag, notorious for its high rates, sputtering from one crisis to the next. Officials worried about getting enough coal, about delaying maintenance to keep electricity flowing. During the World Cup in 2010, Eskom feared that the lights might go out at any moment with the whole world watching.To address Eskom\u2019s financial troubles, McKinsey and Eskom drew up an audacious new reorganization plan.McKinsey\u2019s team leader on the project was a popular partner, Vikas Sagar, a stylish, Porsche-driving fitness buff in his 40s, known for hugging colleagues when the spirit moved him and fiercely charting his own course. He was assisted by Alexander Weiss, a serious reverse image of Mr. Sagar, who thought little of commuting between his home in Germany and Johannesburg.McKinsey\u2019s proposal appeared perfect for a company in desperate financial straits. Eskom would pay only if the plan produced savings. Then the consultancy would get a percentage. All the risk, ostensibly, would be McKinsey\u2019s, since it might spend heavily but get nothing in the end.Yet for all the upside, the proposal had a Trojan-horse quality: Eskom would hire McKinsey not knowing what the final bill would be.The plan left several McKinsey partners uneasy. Could Eskom absorb and apply McKinsey\u2019s recommendations? And how would a contract with an anticipated payout in the hundreds of millions of dollars be received by South Africans? Also troubling was the fact that McKinsey had won the contract without competitive bidding.\u201cYou are betting the office,\u201d one former partner recalled warning colleagues. If the final payout became public, that official added, \u201cYou are going to be slaughtered just for the size.\u201dThe contract\u2019s structure \u2014 with the risks it posed for McKinsey \u2014 was not universally embraced, either. \u201cTrying to do a 100 percent at-risk contract at Eskom is trying to play God,\u201d a former partner said. \u201cYou are really guaranteeing that I can turn around everything, no problem.\u201d To accomplish that, McKinsey might need more political clout and expertise than it could deliver.Most of McKinsey\u2019s current or former partners who spoke to The Times requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. McKinsey did provide several partners for interviews on the condition that their names not be used. Mr. Sagar did not respond to repeated messages seeking an interview, and Mr. Weiss declined to speak to The Times.Concerns notwithstanding, the prospect of a big payday made the contract popular not only in Johannesburg but throughout McKinsey\u2019s global empire. Supporters included two senior partners with oversight in energy and power: Yermolai Solzhenitsyn, the novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s eldest son, in Moscow, and Thomas Vahlenkamp in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Both declined to be interviewed.In the end, Mr. Sagar and his allies carried the day.In situations like these, risk managers are supposed to serve as corporate lifeguards, ready to whistle back dealmakers if they expose the company to unnecessary legal and reputational peril. Yet the Eskom contract was approved with less scrutiny than regular public contracts. That was because state-owned enterprises were treated as private corporations, where reviews focused on commercial viability, not political risk.Had McKinsey vetted the Eskom contract properly, it might have spared itself some of the grief to come. The contract, it turned out, was illegal: The power company had failed to get a government waiver from the standard fee-for-service payment, despite assuring McKinsey that it had done so.\u201cFor the scale of the fee, they were prepared to throw caution to the wind, and maybe because they thought they couldn\u2019t be touched,\u201d said David Lewis, executive director of Corruption Watch, a local advocacy group.If McKinsey fell short in vetting the Eskom contract, the same could be said about the scrutiny of its minority partner, a company called Trillian Management Consulting.McKinsey\u2019s putative marriage to Trillian produced its first awkward moments when its chief executive, Bianca Goodson, showed up angry at the consultancy\u2019s Sandton headquarters on a January evening in 2016. Under McKinsey\u2019s agreement with Eskom, Ms. Goodson\u2019s company was supposed to provide consulting support, but with only two employees was unsure how to do that.Feeling ignored and marginalized, Ms. Goodson planned to raise her concerns at a meeting of McKinsey partners. Four hours in, she got her chance. But before she could finish, Ms. Goodson wrote in an account later submitted to Parliament, a McKinsey team leader abruptly left the room, another partner said not to worry too much about work because she would still get her financial cut, and another made \u201cwhipping sounds and gestures,\u201d an apparent inside joke, prompting laughter among the partners.Ms. Goodson left more disillusioned than before she arrived. Two months later, she resigned.During the internal debate over the Eskom deal, several partners had questioned whether McKinsey knew enough about who precisely was behind Trillian. Now rumors began reaching the McKinsey office that Trillian Management and its parent company, Trillian Capital, might have ties to the Gupta family.McKinsey knew little about Trillian \u2014 a new company, with no track record, that had broken off from McKinsey\u2019s previous minority partner, Regiments, after a business dispute. What\u2019s more, Trillian had refused McKinsey\u2019s requests to divulge its ownership.Even so, McKinsey chose to kick the can down the road and continue working. What McKinsey did not yet know was that Eskom\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Molefe, had placed dozens of phone calls to one of the Gupta brothers during and after contract negotiations.An influential senior partner in Johannesburg, David Fine, had grown increasingly uneasy about Trillian, according to his testimony to Parliament. One source of concern: Over the objections of two senior partners, McKinsey\u2019s team leader, Mr. Sagar, had been meeting with Eskom and Trillian without any other McKinsey officials present.Eventually McKinsey hired a private investigative firm to dig into Trillian\u2019s background. When that did not produce any definitive leads, Mr. Fine began running internet searches on companies named Trillian and found the name \u201cS. Essa\u201d listed as a director. Weeks later, the South African media revealed the majority owner of Trillian as none other than Salim Essa, the Gupta associate whose shell companies had received more than $100 million in the locomotive deal.On March 30, 2016, McKinsey told Eskom in writing that it was severing its ties to Trillian. But while McKinsey had finally taken a stand, it quietly undercut that decision by continuing to work alongside Trillian \u2014 independently, rather than as a subcontractor.To the consternation of some McKinsey partners, that arrangement continued until the end of June 2016. With the local media revealing ever more of the Gupta family\u2019s influence, Eskom \u2014 not McKinsey \u2014 prematurely terminated the contract. Mr. Molefe resigned that November. Mr. Molefe did not respond to requests for comment for this article; a lawyer for the Guptas declined to comment.The abbreviated tab for barely eight months of work: nearly $100 million, with close to 40 percent going to Trillian.In the United States, with an economy over 50 times as big as South Africa\u2019s, a contract that size might have gone unnoticed. But in South Africa, millions of dollars flowing out of a struggling public utility and into the pockets of consultants driving Porsches and Ferraris created an unsavory image that required a response.Yet McKinsey kept quiet, one of many decisions the firm would come to regret.Late the next year, South Africa\u2019s National Prosecuting Authority would deliver a stinging summation of the Eskom case. McKinsey, the prosecutors would allege, had been instrumental \u201cin creating a veil of legitimacy to what was otherwise a nonexistent, unlawful arrangement.\u201d That arrangement, in turn, allowed a company controlled by the Gupta associate, Mr. Essa, to profit.That conclusion was based in part on a letter obtained by a widely respected human-rights advocate, Geoff Budlender, who had been asked to investigate Trillian, including its ties to McKinsey. For the first time, McKinsey was being publicly held to account.Mr. Budlender asked to interview McKinsey but was told to put his questions in writing, which he did. In response to one question, McKinsey denied working \u201con any projects\u201d with Trillian, as either a subcontractor or a black-empowerment partner.With his trap laid, Mr. Budlender pounced. He attached a Feb. 9, 2016, letter from the McKinsey team leader, Mr. Sagar, to Eskom. \u201cAs you know,\u201d Mr. Sagar had written, \u201cMcKinsey has subcontracted a portion of the services to be performed\u201d to Trillian. The letter went further and authorized Eskom to pay Trillian directly, rather than through McKinsey, as was customary for a subcontractor.Asked to explain the conflicting answers, a McKinsey lawyer, Benedict Phiri, took weeks to respond, saying he needed to speak with his colleagues. Finally, he wrote that, given ongoing legal disputes, it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment.Mr. Budlender concluded that McKinsey\u2019s denial was false. \u201cI have to say that I find this inexplicable, particularly having regard to the fact that McKinsey presents itself as an international leader in management consulting and given the widespread public interest in this matter,\u201d he wrote.In the interview with The Times, the McKinsey managing partner, Mr. Barton, said the office leadership in Johannesburg had been unaware of Mr. Sagar\u2019s letter, and had only learned of it from Mr. Budlender. But three current or former McKinsey partners told The Times that Mr. Sagar\u2019s German colleague, Mr. Weiss, and the firm\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Phiri, also knew of the letter.McKinsey\u2019s lawyers said that the letter should never have been sent. Even so, they said, the authorization to pay Trillian referred to another, much smaller contract, and it was predicated on Trillian\u2019s meeting certain conditions.In late 2017, a parliamentary committee began calling witnesses as part of its own investigation of state capture. One witness was Ms. Goodson, the former Trillian executive, who said she had been told soon after being hired that Mr. Essa owned Trillian. She also testified about meeting Mr. Sagar and Mr. Essa in Melrose Arch, a wealthy enclave with high-end retail and sidewalk dining where deals are made.McKinsey sent Mr. Fine, who withstood nearly four hours of questioning. He addressed criticism head on, beginning with the size of the contract. \u201cWe should have absolutely had a fee structure that was capped,\u201d he said.Mr. Fine, who had no role in the Eskom contract, said he had been assured that Eskom did derive measurable benefits from McKinsey\u2019s consulting. Yet his comments betrayed an element of doubt. As a native South African, he said, he couldn\u2019t help asking himself, \u201cIf these benefits were there, why then has the price of electricity gone up and has the liquidity position of Eskom deteriorated?\u201dMr. Barton, in his interview with The Times, insisted that his firm helped Eskom solve important problems. He expressed frustration at the overarching narrative that McKinsey took money for little work. \u201cThere was real work being done,\u201d he said.Grieve Chelwa, an economics lecturer at the University of Cape Town, said in an interview that McKinsey\u2019s top ranks in South Africa were overwhelmingly filled by Europeans who \u201cmay not have had the political antennae\u201d to pick up potential problems.\u201cThe less charitable interpretation is that they knew,\u201d said Dr. Chelwa, until recently a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Center for African Studies. \u201cThey made a risk calculation that we know what is going on or we have an idea what is going on, but then there is 1.6 billion rand to make, and what is the probability that all this falls in our faces? They made that kind of calculation and they said, \u2018O.K., the risk is worth doing,\u2019 and they did it.\u201dIt is a risk McKinsey now regrets taking.The advocacy group Corruption Watch referred the firm\u2019s conduct to the United States Justice Department for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. McKinsey declined to say whether federal investigators had contacted the firm; the Justice Department declined to comment. The National Prosecuting Authority in South Africa has frozen the proceeds of the Eskom contract, pending the completion of the government\u2019s investigation. And several banks and corporations, including the South African arm of Coca-Cola, have said they will not do business with McKinsey until investigations are concluded.McKinsey vehemently denies breaking any laws, and says that this view has been validated by a monthslong internal inquiry involving more than 50 lawyers reviewing millions of documents and emails.The firm does admit mistakes. McKinsey will now give state-owned companies the same scrutiny it would government agencies or ministries. That policy may have a major impact in China, where McKinsey has advised at least 19 of the biggest state-owned companies as well as the country\u2019s powerful planning agency.In a statement, McKinsey said that it was \u201cnot careful enough about who we associated with,\u201d that it should not have worked alongside Trillian after cutting its ties and that it did not communicate properly with Mr. Budlender. \u201cWe are embarrassed by these failings, and we apologize to the people of South Africa, our clients, our colleagues and our alumni, who rightly expect more of our firm.\u201dAt the end of June, Mr. Barton, 55, will step down as previously planned. McKinsey\u2019s nearly 600 senior partners voted to replace Mr. Barton with Kevin Sneader, a British citizen. Last weekend, as The Times was preparing this article after weeks of questioning McKinsey about its secretive culture, The Financial Times published an interview with Mr. Sneader, who said the firm could no longer \u201chide from the outside world.\u201dMr. Sagar has left the firm with his full benefits in place. Mr. Weiss has been sanctioned, though McKinsey declined to say what that involved. The firm\u2019s Johannesburg lawyer, Mr. Phiri, resigned, and the head of McKinsey\u2019s Africa practice was transferred to Hong Kong.Mr. Fine, who now leads McKinsey\u2019s worldwide public-sector practice in London, cast the fallout from Eskom in personal terms. \u201cI have seen the anger and disappointment in my clients\u2019 eyes,\u201d he told the South African Parliament. He added, \u201cI\u2019ve experienced rejection from people that I really love and trust, and that\u2019s been hard.\u201dWalt Bogdanich reported from Johannesburg, and Michael Forsythe from New York.

Those partners have included 60 device makers that used application programming interfaces, also known as A.P.I.s, so Facebook could run on their gadgets.The European Union has passed such legislation, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., which forces companies such as Facebook to do a better job shielding individual data.

{"Headline": "Officer Who Shot Antwon Rose Is Charged With Criminal Homicide", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOfficer Michael Rosfeld, 30, turned himself in to the authorities around 7 a.m. and was booked into a jail in Allegheny County. He was arraigned about an hour later and released after posting $250,000 bail, despite an argument by prosecutors that he should be denied bail, given the severity of the charge.The Allegheny County district attorney, Stephen A. Zappala Jr., said that Officer Rosfeld had failed basic police procedures in the moments before Antwon was shot, gave statements to investigators that were contradicted by witnesses and had a troubling employment history with other police departments.\u201cI find that Rosfeld\u2019s actions were intentional and they certainly brought about the result he was hoping to accomplish,\u201d Mr. Zappala said at a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cUnless you see a genuine threat, it\u2019s inappropriate and in fact criminal to take someone\u2019s life.\u201dOfficer Rosfeld came upon Antwon and another teenager, Zaijuan Hester, when he stopped a car they were riding in that had been seen leaving a drive-by shooting in the nearby town of North Braddock, the police said. Zaijuan, 17, was charged on Wednesday in connection with that shooting, but Mr. Zappala said that Antwon did not fire a weapon and was not an active participant.\u201cAntwon Rose didn\u2019t do anything in North Braddock other than be in that vehicle,\u201d he said.In Pennsylvania, a criminal homicide charge enables prosecutors to argue for a range of more specific charges, from involuntary manslaughter to first-degree murder. Mr. Zappala said prosecutors would try to make a case for first-degree murder, which carries a life sentence.The district attorney\u2019s office also plans to refer the case to the office of the United States attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania because of problems that investigators uncovered with the East Pittsburgh Police Department.When law enforcement officers from other agencies responded to Antwon\u2019s shooting, Mr. Zappala said, East Pittsburgh officers told them that they did not know how to handle the situation because the department did not have clear guidelines.Mr. Zappala said that the department does not have policies \u201cfor anything, as far as we know.\u201d He added: \u201cSomeone\u2019s dead. Can there be anything more dangerous?\u201dLori Fruncek, the East Pittsburgh police chief, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Patrick J. Thomassey, a lawyer representing Officer Rosfeld, could not be reached.Prosecutors argued in court on Wednesday that Officer Rosfeld should be denied bail, but they were overruled. S. Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing Antwon\u2019s family, said it was \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d that the officer was released.\u201cIt shows a system that is bent in favor of law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Merritt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy to this family and an affront to justice. I don\u2019t know how it happens.\u201dOfficer Rosfeld previously worked for the Oakmont Borough and Harmar Township police departments in Allegheny County, and as a campus police officer at the University of Pittsburgh. He was sworn in to the East Pittsburgh Police Department on June 19, hours before Antwon was killed.Mr. Merritt said he was hoping to review Officer Rosfeld\u2019s employment records.\u201cThey\u2019ll reveal significant history of abuse of authority and a pattern that should have signaled to East Pittsburgh not to have hired him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should never have been sworn in the day he killed Antwon Rose.\u201dMr. Zappala said investigators had reviewed the records and had concerns, but he declined to elaborate. He also said his office was considering whether to contest the judge\u2019s decision to grant bail. A preliminary court hearing is scheduled for July 6.During the service, his friends read a poem he had written. \u201cI see mothers bury their sons,\u201d it said. \u201cI want my mom to never feel that pain.\u201dOfficer Rosfeld pulled over a Chevrolet Cruze the evening of June 19 that matched the description of a vehicle seen near an earlier drive-by shooting in North Braddock, in which a 22-year-old man was struck in the abdomen.Without waiting for backup, Officer Rosfeld approached the driver\u2019s side of the car and had the driver step out. As he was placing the driver in handcuffs, Antwon, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, and Zaijuan, who was in the back seat, jumped out.Officer Rosfeld, who spoke with investigators on Friday, initially told them that Antwon had turned his hand toward him and was holding \u201csomething dark,\u201d and that he thought it was a gun. But when he was asked again about what had transpired, Officer Rosfeld said he did not see a gun.\u201cWhen confronted with this inconsistency, Rosfeld stated he saw something in the passenger\u2019s hand but was not sure what it was,\u201d according to the criminal complaint. \u201cOfficer Rosfeld stated that he was not certain if the individual who had his arm pointed at him was still pointing at him when he fired.\u201dWitnesses told the police that they heard Officer Rosfeld fire three shots \u2014 all of which hit Antwon. One struck the right side of his face, another hit his right elbow and a third, which was the fatal wound, hit his back and then struck a lung and his heart, an autopsy found.Antwon was pronounced dead at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center at McKeesport at 9:19 p.m.An empty 9 millimeter magazine, which fit into a 9 millimeter pistol recovered under the car\u2019s front passenger seat, was found in Antwon\u2019s front right pocket. The pistol had been reported missing in Monroeville, Pa., that same day.Witnesses of the drive-by shooting said that the passenger in the back seat had opened fire, an account that was corroborated by security camera footage from the scene, Mr. Zappala said. That passenger, Zaijuan, was charged on Wednesday with aggravated assault and attempted criminal homicide, according to court records. The driver of the car was detained the day of the shooting but later released.Officers recovered a .40-caliber handgun near where Zaijuan had been sitting in the car, and it was later linked to bullet casings found at that shooting and at least three other crimes, according to court records and the district attorney\u2019s office.Advertisement"}

There is no celebrity culture. Sports stars are not insulated from the public and do not have to be rescued from scandals by crisis managers. But as Hallgrimsson told them, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we have one person in the room or 1,000 people in the room \u2014 we\u2019re all in this together.\u201dThe meeting had a galvanizing force. \u201cIt really molded and validated the supporters\u2019 culture,\u201d Jonsson said.

Discussions with my peers in the wake of the #MeToo movement have yielded shared feelings of disgust towards these abusers, and horror that we too may be part of the problem. This fear stems not from acknowledgment that we have facilitated harassment, but rather from the uncertainty of what constitutes reprehensible behavior.Our shared worry was not spurred by Harvey Weinstein or Matt Lauer, but instead from claims brought against Aziz Ansari. The allegations against Mr. Ansari appeared to be a landmark event, for instead of universally turning favor against him, they divided the community. Some notable feminists, including Bari Weiss, even began to back Ansari.Following the release of the allegations, Weiss published an article in The New York Times in which she calls for women to be more vocal about their wishes, and states that lumping Ansari in with other accused abusers \u201ctrivializes what the #MeToo movement first stood for.\u201d This sentiment was shared by my peers.Following the publication of the original expos\u00e9, my morning commute was dominated by debates over whether what Ansari did was wrong, and whether his accuser went too far.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s WWDC 2018 Live: Apple Still Wants to Be Different", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u25a0 Apple is adding tools to help get your information addiction under control.\u25a0 A new feature in Apple\u2019s web browser will make it harder for sites to track you.\u25a0 The company previewed iOS 12, the new version of the iPhone and iPad operating system, including improved speed, bug fixes and other improvements.\u25a0 Apple revealed Siri and photo updates that catches up to competitors.The most notable new feature in iOS 12 is called Screen Time, a tool to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices.The feature shows you a dashboard of apps you regularly use and the amount of time you tend to spend with them. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps: For example, you can give yourself an hour a day to spend inside Instagram, Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app. Parents will also be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones.Apple\u2019s software chief, Craig Federighi, said Apple felt it was time to address smartphones\u2019 oversize impact on everyday life. \u201cFor some of us, it\u2019s become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we\u2019ve become,\u201d he said.The announcement was a bizarre one: A company using one of its biggest events of the year to showcase new tools that help customers use its products less.But the move is most likely shrewd. Apple depends on customers buying its devices, not spending lots of time on them. Apple is pitching the tools as evidence that it is putting its customers\u2019 interests first \u2014 and that if people are worried they are addicted to their smartphone, the iPhone is the device that will help them.The new tools are also a shot across the bow to Silicon Valley\u2019s other big tech companies, like Google, Twitter and particularly Facebook, that depend on users spending more time with their services.Apple\u2019s move is also not happening in a vacuum. Silicon Valley has faced early signs of a reckoning over tech addiction, including an open letter to Apple from investment firm Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System. The letter urged Apple to research the health effects of its products, particularly on children.Will this be enough to help people curb their addiction? Presumably, if you set a limit for yourself you will be able to easily remove the restriction and continue using an app like Instagram when you run out of time.If anything, the feature will certainly make people more mindful (and perhaps ashamed) of how often they use certain apps and encourage them to put their phones down.\u2014 Brian X. Chen and Jack NicasApple took another swing at its rivals Google and Facebook with tools that sharply diminish their ability to track users as they surf across the web.Apple said that by default its Safari browser would disable tracking software that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users\u2019 activity across the internet. The software is often embedded in tools to share, comment or \u201clike\u201d content on third-party sites.To share an article directly to Facebook from a news site, for instance, users of Safari will need to manually allow the software to track them. Apple said it would also make it more difficult for companies that track users using a different technology, known as fingerprinting.As the world wakes up to the sheer amount of user data tech companies have collected over the years, Apple is doubling down on its bid to be the privacy-focused tech firm. Unlike Google and Facebook, which rely on user data to sell ads, Apple\u2019s main business is selling devices to consumers, so its focus on privacy has become a central selling point.Apple said it would also restrict third-party developers\u2019 access to more data on Mac computers, a nod to the scandal over how a Facebook developer enabled the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly harvest the data of millions of Facebook users.\u2014 Jack NicasThe Apple Watch\u2019s latest operating system has a nifty throwback to an old technology: walkie-talkie. \u201cYou press to talk, and your friend can hear your voice \u2014 just like a walkie-talkie,\u201d said Kevin Lynch, Apple\u2019s head of Watch software.The feature works only with users who opt in \u2014 I need your approval to send you a walkie-talkie message \u2014 but it\u2019s striking for the way it improves the Watch\u2019s best feature, letting users stay in touch without having to use a phone.There were also a few new features for activity monitoring. The new software will automatically start tracking a workout even if you didn\u2019t let tell it you were working out. And it has a new way to let you compete with friends. For instance, you can set up a weeklong exercise-off between you and a friend.But all this requires waiting. The new OS will be available for the Watch later this year, through a software update.\u2014 Farhad ManjooApple\u2019s head of software, Craig Federighi, opened the event with the introduction of a new mobile operating system, iOS 12, an update that he said was focused on speed.\u201cFor iOS 12, we are doubling down on performance,\u201d he said. The update increases the speed for many important features of iOS, like the camera app and keyboard. In Apple\u2019s testing, apps launched two times faster in iOS 12 compared with the last system.The new operating system will work with devices as far back as the iPhone 5S from 2013.Here\u2019s something Apple should fix at the event: its Wi-Fi. None of us are able to get on the internet. I\u2019m barely hanging on to a connection on my iPhone hot spot. Wireless has always been spotty at these events with so many devices in the audience fighting for a connection, but this is exceptionally bad.\u2014 Brian X. ChenIt\u2019s crystal clear that iOS 12 is focused on improving on existing features rather than bombarding users with brand-new features.In addition to updating the Photos app and expanding Siri, Apple made minor updates to its Apple News, Stocks, Messages and FaceTime apps. The Apple News app now lets you discover articles through topics, and the Stocks app now loads Apple News stories that are related to stocks that you follow.The Messages app was updated to let you create some custom emojis with the camera. And the FaceTime app lets you do a video call between multiple people, similar to Google Hangouts.Again, Apple is responding to some negative feedback. Over the last few years, app developers and users have complained that iOS was getting increasingly bloated and confusing to use.This is a good time for Apple to slow down on adding new features, especially after the introduction of the iPhone X, which fundamentally changes how the iPhone works by removing the home button.This software conference illuminates Apple\u2019s revised software strategy. In the past, Apple updated each new version of iOS on an annual basis with a long list of new features.But recently, the company announced to employees that it would revise its strategy to a two-year cycle. In other words, next year, you can expect iOS 13 to have a barrage of new features. In the following year, iOS 14 will focus on improving those features. Rinse and repeat.However, Apple doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down the pace of upgrades for the Apple Watch, a much younger product. Each version of Watch OS has introduced significant changes to the way the watch works. Apple\u2019s allocation of resources to the watch shows that the company is treating the wearable computer as the post-smartphone device.In a decade, will we all be wearing our phones?\u2014 Brian X. ChenAdvertisement"}

The companies argued that Title II gave the F.C.C. too much control over their business, and that the regulations made it hard to expand their networks.Democratic lawmakers who are opposed to the repeal took to social media, promising to reinstate the regulations.

{"Headline": "Facebook Gave Device Makers Deep Access to Data on Users and Friends", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "The company formed data-sharing partnerships with Apple, Samsung and dozens of other device makers, raising new concerns about its privacy protections.As Facebook sought to become the world\u2019s dominant social media service, it struck agreements allowing phone and other device makers access to vast amounts of its users\u2019 personal information.Facebook has reached data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers \u2014 including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung \u2014 over the last decade, starting before Facebook apps were widely available on smartphones, company officials said. The deals allowed Facebook to expand its reach and let device makers offer customers popular features of the social network, such as messaging, \u201clike\u201d buttons and address books.But the partnerships, whose scope has not previously been reported, raise concerns about the company\u2019s privacy protections and compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing, The New York Times found.[Here\u2019s what we know about Facebook\u2019s partnerships with device makers.]In the furor that followed, Facebook\u2019s leaders said that the kind of access exploited by Cambridge in 2014 was cut off by the next year, when Facebook prohibited developers from collecting information from users\u2019 friends. But the company officials did not disclose that Facebook had exempted the makers of cellphones, tablets and other hardware from such restrictions.In interviews, Facebook officials defended the data sharing as consistent with its privacy policies, the F.T.C. agreement and pledges to users. They said its partnerships were governed by contracts that strictly limited use of the data, including any stored on partners\u2019 servers. The officials added that they knew of no cases where the information had been misused.The company views its device partners as extensions of Facebook, serving its more than two billion users, the officials said.\u201cThese partnerships work very differently from the way in which app developers use our platform,\u201d said Ime Archibong, a Facebook vice president. Unlike developers that provide games and services to Facebook users, the device partners can use Facebook data only to provide versions of \u201cthe Facebook experience,\u201d the officials said.Some device partners can retrieve Facebook users\u2019 relationship status, religion, political leaning and upcoming events, among other data. Tests by The Times showed that the partners requested and received data in the same way other third parties did.Facebook\u2019s view that the device makers are not outsiders lets the partners go even further, The Times found: They can obtain data about a user\u2019s Facebook friends, even those who have denied Facebook permission to share information with any third parties.In interviews, several former Facebook software engineers and security experts said they were surprised at the ability to override sharing restrictions.\u201cIt\u2019s like having door locks installed, only to find out that the locksmith also gave keys to all of his friends so they can come in and rifle through your stuff without having to ask you for permission,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a research and privacy consultant who formerly served as the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist.By Rich Harris and Gabriel J.X. DanceDetails of Facebook\u2019s partnerships have emerged amid a reckoning in Silicon Valley over the volume of personal information collected on the internet and monetized by the tech industry. The pervasive collection of data, while largely unregulated in the United States, has come under growing criticism from elected officials at home and overseas and provoked concern among consumers about how freely their information is shared.In a tense appearance before Congress in March, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, emphasized what he said was a company priority for Facebook users.\u201cEvery piece of content that you share on Facebook you own,\u201d he testified. \u201dYou have complete control over who sees it and how you share it.\u201dBut the device partnerships provoked discussion even within Facebook as early as 2012, according to Sandy Parakilas, who at the time led third-party advertising and privacy compliance for Facebook\u2019s platform.\u201cThis was flagged internally as a privacy issue,\u201d said Mr. Parakilas, who left Facebook that year and has recently emerged as a harsh critic of the company. \u201cIt is shocking that this practice may still continue six years later, and it appears to contradict Facebook\u2019s testimony to Congress that all friend permissions were disabled.\u201dThe submission followed testimony by Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, during a closed-door German parliamentary hearing in April. Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, one of the lawmakers who questioned Mr. Kaplan, said in an interview that she believed the data partnerships disclosed by Facebook violated users\u2019 privacy rights.\u201cWhat we have been trying to determine is whether Facebook has knowingly handed over user data elsewhere without explicit consent,\u201d Ms. Winkelmeier-Becker said. \u201cI would never have imagined that this might even be happening secretly via deals with device makers. BlackBerry users seem to have been turned into data dealers, unknowingly and unwillingly.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.Samsung declined to respond to questions about whether it had any data-sharing partnerships with Facebook. Amazon also declined to respond to questions.Usher Lieberman, a BlackBerry spokesman, said in a statement that the company used Facebook data only to give its own customers access to their Facebook networks and messages. Mr. Lieberman said that the company \u201cdid not collect or mine the Facebook data of our customers,\u201d adding that \u201cBlackBerry has always been in the business of protecting, not monetizing, customer data.\u201dMicrosoft entered a partnership with Facebook in 2008 that allowed Microsoft-powered devices to do things like add contacts and friends and receive notifications, according to a spokesman. He added that the data was stored locally on the phone and was not synced to Microsoft\u2019s servers.Facebook acknowledged that some partners did store users\u2019 data \u2014 including friends\u2019 data \u2014 on their own servers. A Facebook official said that regardless of where the data was kept, it was governed by strict agreements between the companies.\u201cI am dumbfounded by the attitude that anybody in Facebook\u2019s corporate office would think allowing third parties access to data would be a good idea,\u201d said Henning Schulzrinne, a computer science professor at Columbia University who specializes in network security and mobile systems.The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how loosely Facebook had policed the bustling ecosystem of developers building apps on its platform. They ranged from well-known players like Zynga, the maker of the FarmVille game, to smaller ones, like a Cambridge contractor who used a quiz taken by about 300,000 Facebook users to gain access to the profiles of as many as 87 million of their friends.Those developers relied on Facebook\u2019s public data channels, known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. But starting in 2007, the company also established private data channels for device manufacturers.At the time, mobile phones were less powerful, and relatively few of them could run stand-alone Facebook apps like those now common on smartphones. The company continued to build new private APIs for device makers through 2014, spreading user data through tens of millions of mobile devices, game consoles, televisions and other systems outside Facebook\u2019s direct control.Facebook began moving to wind down the partnerships in April, after assessing its privacy and data practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mr. Archibong said the company had concluded that the partnerships were no longer needed to serve Facebook users. About 22 of them have been shut down.The broad access Facebook provided to device makers raises questions about its compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the F.T.C.After the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the F.T.C. began an investigation into whether Facebook\u2019s continued sharing of data after 2011 violated the decree, potentially exposing the company to fines.Facebook officials said the private data channels did not violate the decree because the company viewed its hardware partners as \u201cservice providers,\u201d akin to a cloud computing service paid to store Facebook data or a company contracted to process credit card transactions. According to the consent decree, Facebook does not need to seek additional permission to share friend data with service providers.\u201cThese contracts and partnerships are entirely consistent with Facebook\u2019s F.T.C. consent decree,\u201d Mr. Archibong, the Facebook official, said.But Jessica Rich, a former F.T.C. official who helped lead the commission\u2019s earlier Facebook investigation, disagreed with that assessment.\u201cUnder Facebook\u2019s interpretation, the exception swallows the rule,\u201d said Ms. Rich, now with the Consumers Union. \u201cThey could argue that any sharing of data with third parties is part of the Facebook experience. And this is not at all how the public interpreted their 2014 announcement that they would limit third-party app access to friend data.\u201dTo test one partner\u2019s access to Facebook\u2019s private data channels, The Times used a reporter\u2019s Facebook account \u2014 with about 550 friends \u2014 and a 2013 BlackBerry device, monitoring what data the device requested and received. (More recent BlackBerry devices, which run Google\u2019s Android operating system, do not use the same private channels, BlackBerry officials said.)Immediately after the reporter connected the device to his Facebook account, it requested some of his profile data, including user ID, name, picture, \u201cabout\u201d information, location, email and cellphone number. The device then retrieved the reporter\u2019s private messages and the responses to them, along with the name and user ID of each person with whom he was communicating.The data flowed to a BlackBerry app known as the Hub, which was designed to let BlackBerry users view all of their messages and social media accounts in one place.The Hub also requested \u2014 and received \u2014 data that Facebook\u2019s policy appears to prohibit. Since 2015, Facebook has said that apps can request only the names of friends using the same app. But the BlackBerry app had access to all of the reporter\u2019s Facebook friends and, for most of them, returned information such as user ID, birthday, work and education history and whether they were currently online.The BlackBerry device was also able to retrieve identifying information for nearly 295,000 Facebook users. Most of them were second-degree Facebook friends of the reporter, or friends of friends.In all, Facebook empowers BlackBerry devices to access more than 50 types of information about users and their friends, The Times found.Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.June 4, 2018April 4, 2018March 20, 2018March 17, 2018Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018Abolish ICE\u2019 Went From Social Media to Progressive Candidates\u2019 Rallying Cry", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbolish ICE!\u201cImmigrants are some of the most courageous and industrious people humanity has to offer,\u201d he wrote in an introduction to the immigration platform of Brand New Congress, a grass-roots progressive organization. \u201cWe can only benefit from their presence.\u201d\u201cWe should abolish ICE,\u201d Mr. Richardson said in an interview this week, with the conviction of a politician who believes he has a winning idea. \u201cICE is terrorizing our communities.\u201dPolitical strategists point out the inherent risk in the movement: that Republicans will use it to portray Democrats as extremists who are weak on border control. \u201cThe other side is using the slogan to communicate to the country that this is a debate about open borders,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, former director of the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council under President Obama.Still, the idea has been gaining momentum as a rallying cry of the far left, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s upset victory over an establishment Democrat gave it a newfound political currency. Then, on Thursday night, just hours after hundreds of immigration protesters had chanted \u201cabolish ICE\u201d on Capitol Hill, Kirsten Gillibrand became the first sitting senator to directly support the agency\u2019s elimination.It was a powerful gesture, coming from a prominent Democrat who is also considered a possible 2020 presidential contender, and one that could inspire more high-profile politicians to back the idea. (Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City added his support Friday morning.) Notably, Senator Gillibrand had backed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s opponent, the Democratic stalwart Joseph Crowley, in the primary.The call to abolish ICE remains a largely rhetorical, activist position with questionable feasibility. Top Democratic leaders have not adopted the position, and only a handful of other sitting politicians have embraced it to this point.But fueled by continued anger over the crisis at the border, the movement to abolish ICE is taking hold as an important policy issue for the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing. Driven more by their ideology than any concrete political calculus, a small but rising number of progressive candidates are unabashedly pushing the proposal.Some Democrats point to other progressive proposals that were once similarly dismissed by party leaders but have since gained traction among mainstream Democrats, like Medicare for all and tuition-free public college. The hope among grass-roots activists is that progressive energy will give these same people the political cover to embrace an abolish-ICE policy that has mostly thrived on the fringe.\u201cICE operates through the tactics of fear, violence and intimidation, with questionable legality, and tears families apart,\u201d Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the liberal organization Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement. \u201cWe applaud the growing number of progressives who are calling for an end to this terror.\u201dTheir ICE proposal, these progressives hope, could also help galvanize voters in the summer\u2019s remaining primaries and November\u2019s general elections. Some of those who support the position said in interviews that they were especially encouraged by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory.But while the movement is gaining strength, it has also drawn attention from the right, which has seized on it to bludgeon the Democrats.In an interview on Wednesday with Politico, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, referred to the Democratic Party as \u201cself-avowed socialists\u201d who wanted \u201copen borders.\u201dKellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, has also sought to use the progressive rallying against Democrats.\u201cEvery Democratic candidate could be asked now, maybe, \u2018Do you agree or disagree with the new face of the Democratic Party that we should abolish Immigration and Customs and Enforcement?\u2019\u201d Ms. Conway said Wednesday on Fox News.Still, there are indications the proposal is reverberating in the halls of Washington. This week, Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin said he planned to introduce legislation to abolish the immigration agency. In an interview, he said that he had received support for the bill from fellow Democratic House members including Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Jim McGovern of Massachusetts.\u201cI think that you will see more support for it just because this really gets at addressing the core abuses by the administration,\u201d Mr. Pocan said.One potential problem is that the abolish-ICE movement could further divide the Democratic Party as it looks to project a unified message heading into the midterms and, beyond that, the 2020 presidential campaign. Eliminating a federal agency is a position that leaves little room for compromise, and moderate Democrats who do not support the proposal risk drawing the ire of the very vocal far left, which already views the party establishment as slow to embrace their ideals.Strategists and legal experts say the position could also be difficult to pass, especially if it continues to be a partisan issue.\u201cIt would require us to think about immigration policy from a very different perspective, but I think it is possible,\u201d said Sameera Hafiz, a senior political strategist at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.Supporters of abolishing ICE are vocal, their call magnified by social media, but they have offered few concrete plans. Mr. Pocan of Wisconsin said his bill would create a commission that would examine ICE to determine which of its roles should be performed by other agencies.At this point, however, the issue is still largely the province of the far reaches of the far left. Even progressives do not agree on the elimination proposal.\u201cI don\u2019t know that abolishing ICE solves anything,\u201d said Veronica Escobar, a progressive who is running for Congress in Texas\u2019s 16th district, which lies along the Mexican border. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that ICE does do some things that are necessary to keep the country safe.\u201dMs. Escobar cited in particular ICE\u2019s work investigating child predators and human trafficking, a point she echoed in a lengthy Facebook post.The obstacles to eliminating ICE do not deter groups like Brand New Congress, the grass-roots organization that included abolishing the agency in its November 2017 immigration platform, and has encouraged young social activists like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Richardson of Florida to run for federal office.The group\u2019s education materials cite the enormous fiscal burden of immigration enforcement, and also assert that other government agencies can do the watchdog work of immigration enforcement with clearer oversight.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory has only energized the effort.\u201cAs long as progressives keep winning elections and keep pushing the issue and refuse to let the issue of abolishing ICE go, it will become a bigger issue for Democrats,\u201d said Sarah Smith, who is running for Congress in Washington. \u201cThis is just another one of those issues where we have to strong-arm them into listening to us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Her body was discovered Wednesday morning on a soccer field there, just hours after she left a bar where she had performed to walk home alone.Within 24 hours of her death, Jaymes Todd, 19, turned himself in to the police and was quickly charged with her rape and murder.Ms. Dixon\u2019s death became a feminist cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre after some women accused the authorities of suggesting that women were responsible for preventing attacks against them.After the attack, the police in the state of Victoria had urged residents to be aware of their surroundings and take precautions while out late at night.\u201cThe message we would provide to all members of the community is to take responsibility for your safety,\u201d Superintendent David Clayton of the Victoria Police said at a news conference. \u201cMake sure people know where you are, and if you\u2019ve got a mobile phone carry it, and if you\u2019ve got any concerns at all call police.\u201dSuperintendent Clayton\u2019s comments were seen by some as unfairly blaming Ms. Dixon \u2014 who was carrying a cellphone at the time \u2014 for her own death.\u201cWe get told all the time that we have to be the ones that have to be situationally aware \u2014 that we are the ones that have to protect ourselves,\u201d said Tiara Shafiq, one of the vigil\u2019s organizers.\u201cMost of us are already doing those things. Eurydice was texting a friend right before she was attacked,\u201d Ms. Shafiq said. \u201cThere\u2019s not as much attention being placed on the perpetrators, being placed on people to not rape and not attack people.\u201dShe added, \u201cEvery time this happens, there\u2019s the statement about how women should be more careful, and we\u2019re just tired of it.\u201d\u201cOur message to Victorian women is this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cStay home. Or don\u2019t. Go out with friends at night. Or don\u2019t. Go about your day exactly as you intend, on your terms. Because women don\u2019t need to change their behavior. Men do.\u201dPatty Kinnersly, the chief executive of Our Watch, a Melbourne-based nonprofit that advocates for women and children, said that the conversation had moved on to the causes of such violence.\u201cWe know, from a huge body of highly respected research, including the work of Victoria\u2019s Royal Commission into family violence, that if we are to prevent these crimes, we must address the attitudes and behaviors that drive violence against women in the first place,\u201d she said.Vigils were organized in parks across Australia\u2019s major cities, and in several rural centers. In Canberra, the capital, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the opposition leader Bill Shorten attended a service at Parliament House.As the vigil at Princes Park began, the Melbourne Town Hall was aglow in orange, the official color of the United Nations\u2019 Unite to End Violence Against Women campaign.The Princes Park vigil for Ms. Dixon appeared to draw a crowd of several thousand. Most stood silently, clutching candles at their chests.Becky Schrederis and Laura Summers, who attended, said they had walked their dog through the park for six years.\u201cA woman should be allowed to walk alone, and not be attacked,\u201d Ms. Summers said.\u201cPeople are sick and tired of it,\u201d Ms. Schrederis said. \u201cPeople should have freedom to walk around as they wish.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Many don sashes that read \u201cbride squad,\u201d and there is the occasional tiara-wearing bride-to-be on her last fling in a V.I.P. area. Bartenders sling drinks to hooting patrons as musicians bound around the stage. The woman of honor may even join them if the Fireball shot kicks in. Outside, lights illuminate the main strip so it almost feels like daytime, or at least, twilight. Revelers wander the busy sidewalks in search of late night eats or their Uber drivers to take them to their hotels. The neon signs still flicker.No, this isn\u2019t Vegas. It\u2019s Nashville \u2014 and it\u2019s possibly the hottest destination for bachelorette parties in the country.\u201cThe increase in bachelorette parties became evident about four years ago,\u201d said Jeff Eslick, the media manager for Tootsie\u2019s Entertainment, which owns popular spots in Nashville like Honky Tonk Central and Tootsie\u2019s Orchid Lounge. \u201cThe spring and summer weekends have Broadway filled with what seems like hundreds of packs of women wearing shorts, boots and shirts reading \u2018someone\u2019s last rodeo.\u2019\u201dNashville hosted 14.5 million visitors last year, and that number continues to rise exponentially, according to Butch Spyridon, the president and chief executive of the Tennessee capital\u2019s Convention & Visitors Corporation. The airport is now one of the fastest growing airports in North America, bringing in bachelorettes from nearby states and even revelers from international locations. The number of new restaurant openings doubled since 2015, and nearly 15,000 hotel rooms are in the development pipeline. But with all the changes, business owners and residents say, the city continues to feel local, laid-back, and accessible for tourists to dine on Southern fare, peruse shops and art galleries, and experience the epicenter of country music. For evidence of this growth, look no further than the throngs of young people who pack Broadway, downtown Nashville\u2019s main drag of live music venues, bars, and restaurants. This is the home to the popular honky tonk, a term used to describe both the bar and the style of country music played within. Musicians have long descended upon this strip to show crowds \u2014 and hopefully industry scouts \u2014 what they\u2019ve got. Nashville, after all, is known as Music City for its role in history of country music, and houses landmarks like the Grand Ole Opry, Country Music Hall of Fame and Ryman Auditorium.Live music is the top draw, especially for bachelorettes. Talented performers, songwriters and aspiring stars provide endless entertainment at every turn. Most bars don\u2019t charge a cover, and the proximity of attractions means groups can effortlessly wander from place to place. Even if you aren\u2019t a fan of country music, the vibrant energy of the honky tonks exudes merriment. \u201cOur performers are aware of the impact bachelorettes have on the tip jug, so they cater to them,\u201d Mr. Eslick said. \u201cNo bachelorette party is complete without getting on stage with the band.\u201dHe also noted that many honky tonks and restaurants have V.I.P. areas that can accommodate large groups, and he fields questions weekly from inquiring bridesmaids organizing trips. Lisa Curry, the event sales manager of the 21c Museum Hotel Nashville, which opened last year, said that restaurants also crafts menus to delight female patrons. The hotel\u2019s Gray and Dudley, for instance, offers cocktails served in vintage beverage decanters or pitchers. Thompson Hotels also opened a property in town, with a trendy rooftop that features views of Nashville\u2019s chic Gulch neighborhood. The hip Pinewood Social functions as a craft cocktail bar, co-working space, and bowling alley that can accommodate groups for anything from casual afternoon coffee to all-night festivities.Bach Weekend, a planning company which has spawned from the rise in pre-wedding celebrations, organizes entire itineraries, including brewery tours, open bars, and pole dancing classes with matching swag. The company estimates a partygoer spends about $850 for the weekend (without travel costs) to a destination bachelorette party.The part that makes Nashville stand out is the fact that locals partake in many of the same activities as the tourists, said Benjamin Goldberg, a managing partner of Strategic Hospitality, which owns Pinewood Social. Brunch at a neighborhood eatery may include booths of squealing bachelorettes but also young professionals grabbing a bite with friends.Boutiques like White\u2019s Merchantile, Judith Bright and Peter Nappi honor the city\u2019s artisans, and vibrantly colored murals have sprung up all over the city. The 21c Museum Hotel allows the public and guests to jointly admire their three floors of exhibition space showcasing 21st-century works. \u201cThe art scene is absolutely booming,\u201d Ms. Curry said. \u201cWith Instagram, photo ops have become a huge draw for bachelorettes.\u201dThere is, of course, the typical debauchery.

{"Headline": "A 150-Year-Old Wine and Its Descendants Reveal Their Secrets", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE POURNo wine is meant to last for a century. If it does, it\u2019s by accident. But at a dinner commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Rothschild acquisition of Lafite, 16 vintages were sampled going back to 1868. More recently, it was an invitation in a stack of mail that, because of renovations to our newsroom, did not catch up to me until weeks after it had arrived. Did I want to taste 16 vintages of Lafite at one of a series of small dinners at the chateau in Bordeaux commemorating the 150th anniversary of the estate\u2019s purchase by the Rothschild family?We know that the gradual exposure to air over time softens the tannins in a firm red like Lafite, made primarily of cabernet sauvignon with varying degrees of merlot, cabernet franc and petit verdot. Powerfully fruity aromas mellow, harmonize and evolve, as the wine gains nuances, depth and dimension.Experts boldly predict how wines will evolve over time. They make broad judgments about the quality of a particular year. But these are often matters of opinion and taste, and the predictions don\u2019t always hold true. How is this character derived? Is it a matter of nature, the place in which the grapes were grown? Or nurture, how the wine was made? Or a combination of the two?Bordeaux is among the longest lived of wines, and so lends itself to vertical tastings, especially since Bordeaux is one of the few wine regions in which producers traditionally keep libraries of old vintages. Nonetheless, luxury wines like Lafite, which cost many hundreds of dollars a bottle, are not necessary for tastings like this. It would be equally fascinating with fine, though far more modest, bottles.Even then, Lafite was widely known and admired. Its vineyard traces back at least to the 17th century. Thomas Jefferson visited Bordeaux in 1787, and was a great admirer of Lafite, but that did not save Lafite\u2019s owner, Nicolas Pierre de Pichard, from the guillotine during the French Revolution. Though Lafite passed through several hands before 1868, it was still ranked at the top of the top in the 1855 classification, a five-class ranking of 60 M\u00e9doc chateaus (and one from Graves, the famous Haut-Brion) that is still influential today. We sat in the cellar at tables arranged in a square and illuminated by candles. We were joined by Jean-Guillaume Prats, the chief executive of Domaines Barons de Rothschild, and Eric Kohler, the technical director, who discussed the vintage conditions and the production of each wine. The wines came in flights, arranged by vintages that would benefit by comparison, or, in some cases, solo or blind. The first was a pair, 2010 and \u201909, back-to-back years that many critics considered great but which were completely different.The \u201909, on the other hand, was voluptuous and powerful, quite tannic yet more advanced than the \u201910, with an aroma of tobacco rather than flowers. As one taster put it, \u201cThe \u201910 represents the heart of Lafite, the \u201909 the flesh.\u201dThis arrived as a solo flight. The 2001 was one of my favorite recent Bordeaux vintages to drink. Coming after the much-hyped 2000 vintage, the \u201901 was considered something of a letdown by many critics. But I\u2019ve been very much attuned to its charms. After 18 years, the 2001s have given me a lot of pleasure while, for me at least, the 2000s have always seemed amorphous. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the youngest, drinkable, open Lafite,\u201d Mr. Kohler said of the \u201901. It was fresh, complex and subtle, with aromas of violets and that perfume of Pauillac, somewhere between pencil lead and cigar boxes, for those who can remember such things.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the length of the best vintages,\u201d one taster said, but I was hard-pressed to find any fault with it at all. The 1996 was served with an unidentified vintage. The \u201996 was deep and complex, with harmonious mineral flavors, intense but weightless, a great wine at first, though the complexity seemed to dissipate in the glass with prolonged exposure to air. The other looked older, with a brownish rim to the color. It was delicious, tasting lightly of fruit and pencil lead, but lacking intensity. By itself, it would have been a lovely wine, but in this company it seemed a bit dilute. I identified it as a \u201993, \u201994 or \u201995, but was not able to pinpoint it as the \u201994, as some of the tasters did.Three wines from \u201988, \u201989 and \u201990 vintages were offered blind. We did not know which was which. These were three good but differing years, and Mr. Kohler said Lafite enjoyed seeing guests work out the identities.One, which turned out to be the \u201990, was full-bodied, rich and exotic, seemingly uncharacteristic of Lafite. The next was a bit more evolved, linear and complex, the \u201989, and the last was the firmest, with the most energy and minerality. It was the \u201988, my favorite of the three. But first we started out with a glass served blind, a rich young wine, heavy but deficient in acidity and finesse. It was not hard to identify it as a 2003, one of the hottest, driest years on record. After that came only wines worth dreaming about. First 1982, a great vintage marking the end of some difficult years and inaugurating the current era of Bordeaux as a luxury good. At almost 36 years of age, it was still youthful, ripe and a bit exotic, yet balanced and harmonious. Next was the 1961, another great year, smelling entirely of pencil lead, pure and lovely. Then the 1945, a legendary vintage from the end of World War II, which was surprisingly youthful and fresh. The rich wine was elegant rather than powerful, very much of a piece with the \u201961 and \u201982. Two more were to come. First, an extraordinary 1905, delicate yet energetic, pretty and fragile yet with a tensile strength that kept the wine vibrant. Then, finally, the 1868, 150 years old. Its aroma had a fruity sweetness, and the wine seemed to have an inextinguishable life force and intensity while staying completely in character.\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle, this wine,\u201d Baron \u00c9ric said.Perhaps he was right. No wine is meant to last so long; if it does, it\u2019s almost accidental. Baron James, who bought Lafite, died not long after the 1868 harvest. In the United States, President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House of Representatives but survived a trial and finished out his term.Through the Franco-Prussian War, World War I and II, depressions, multiple governments, the invention of cars, planes, rockets to the moon and the internet, this wine survived to tell its story. A miracle, maybe, but entirely Lafite.Advertisement"}

After studying photography at the Ealing Technical College, he worked as a freelance photographer for black British newspapers, including West Indian World and Caribbean Times. In 1970, he began promoting beauty pageants, founding a series of popular contests, including Miss Black and Beautiful, Miss West Indies in Great Britain and Miss Grenada. Mr. Albert\u2019s work as a photographer extended beyond pageants. Throughout his career, he documented life in the West Indian communities of London, making portraits and photographing local families and social events. But his best-known images are of beauty competitions and studio portraits of aspiring black models (the latter also included in the exhibition). These photographs meticulously document the rituals of pageantry as well as the style and sensibilities of women virtually erased from the British mainstream media: radiant beauty queens, replete with crowns and scepters, posing with their vanquished competitors; a glamorous woman modeling jewelry, a ring on every finger; a model, legs crossed and staring directly into the camera, sporting a bold plaid pantsuit; and a contestant lounging in a swimsuit and wearing huge platform shoes.Nevertheless, these pageants featured token black contestants while largely continuing to perpetuate an idealized image of white beauty. \u201cThis fair image weighs most heavily on the brown shoulders of minority women who bear a special beauty burden,\u201d wrote the psychologist Rita Freedman. \u201cThey too set out in search of it, only to discover that failure is built in for those whose lips smile too thickly, whose eyelids fold improperly, whose hair will not relax enough to toss in the wind, whose skin never glows in rosy shades.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Albert, who died in 2009 at the age of 74, documented a consequential moment when women of color, flexing their power, explored their individuality and beauty in the face of racist stereotypes and limitations. \u201cImbued with an exquisite, revolutionary sensuality and a certain joie de vivre,\u201d observed Ms. Mussai about Mr. Albert\u2019s photographs, they embodied \u201can aura of hedonistic confidence in a new generation of black women coming of age in Britain during the 1970s, fueled by complex cultural politics of identity, difference, and desire.\u201d Race Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

{"Headline": "Grief and Self-Doubt Follow Shooting at Trenton Arts Festival", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRENTON \u2014 Trenton is a capital city of more than 84,000 people that can often feel like two urban areas rolled into one. On State Street, beyond the State House with its golden dome, sit clean brick buildings that house deep-pocketed lobbying firms and a cafe where state employees in business suits were having lunch at outdoor tables on Monday afternoon.Yet a short drive in nearly any direction reveals boarded-up houses, sagging roofs, vacant lots and cracked roads. Signs pledging to buy homes in any condition for cash hang from the utility poles.\u201cIt was our worst nightmare,\u201d said Lauren Otis, the executive director of Artworks Trenton, the nonprofit that produces the event, now in its 12th year. \u201cIt was horrible. It\u2019s something that would be inexplicably horrible wherever it happened, but to have it happen in what was the most diverse event in Trenton, perhaps in New Jersey, at an event that was so popular \u2014 it was tragic. It eviscerated us.\u201dHe went on: \u201cWhat occurred there is what a lot of people\u2019s impression of our city is, violence, urban decay, lack of economic opportunity. That\u2019s why Art All Night was so important. It provided this beacon of hope.\u201dAs law enforcement officials investigated and event organizers waited to retrieve art from the crime scene, the shooting raised questions not just about the future of Art All Night, but the well-being of the city itself: a place where some 20,000 government workers flood in every day only to disappear by dusk, leaving behind an expanse of dilapidated warehouses and a famous sign, \u201cTrenton Makes, the World Takes\u201d \u2014 reminders of its heyday as a hub of manufacturing.Over the past several years signs of revitalization have appeared. The city may not have a major port or proximity to a major metropolis, assets that other once-industrial New Jersey cities have used to reinvent themselves. But it does have what is a rarity in New Jersey, said George D. Sowa, the chief executive officer of an organization called Greater Trenton: affordability.Mr. Sowa\u2019s group has spearheaded economic development in Trenton, recruiting companies and even pitching Trenton as a location for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. As he ran his hand over a map, Mr. Sowa spoke of how the city could attract a company like Amazon, pointing to Trenton\u2019s many train lines and proximity to Newark Liberty Airport, but also to its old warehouses, vast brick relics of the city\u2019s past. \u201cYou can almost get a building here in Trenton for free,\u201d he said.Mr. Sowa cited the Chambersburg neighborhood, where an industrial property was recently transformed into the Roebling Lofts, as proof that the adage of developers \u2014 bring the artists and the money will follow \u2014 could prove true in Trenton, too.The Art All Night event has played a central role in that transformation.This year, more than 25,000 people were expected to attend Art All Night, which was held at the 50,000-square-foot Roebling Wire Works, once a factory that supplied wire cables for the Brooklyn and Golden Gate Bridges.Still, Trenton faces a host of issues \u2014 a poverty rate of nearly 28 percent and a median household income of around $34,400, well below the state average.The mayor\u2019s office noted that Trenton is also hurt by the state\u2019s exemption from paying property taxes on the large tracts of land it owns downtown.\u201cThey\u2019re short-handed. They\u2019re spread thin,\u201d said Regina Thompson-Jenkins, 51, an educator and a volunteer for Everytown for Gun Safety whose 19-year-old son was killed by gunfire in Trenton six years ago.The police director, Ernest Parrey Jr., pointed to a recent decline in the number of homicides and shootings.Still, gun violence has continued to plague the city. In a 2017 report, the mayor\u2019s office said that since 2014 the authorities collected more than 1,700 firearms in a state-funded buyback program and seized more than 230 in arrests and investigations.Gangs were once a larger menace in the city, but still remain a presence.On Sunday morning, the forces shaping Trenton collided.The arts festival grew rowdy after midnight, the Mercer County prosecutor\u2019s office said, and had to be shut down by the police after fistfights broke out. Then shots rang out shortly before 3 a.m.The one fatality, Tahaij Wells, 32, one of the gunmen, was shot by the police. He had a long arrest record and had been released from prison in February on parole, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Officials said another suspect, Amir Armstrong, 23, had been charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and was being treated for injuries from the shooting. A third suspect, whom officials did not name, was also injured in the shooting, but there were not yet charges filed against him.About two dozen people were injured, two of whom were in critical condition, according to hospital officials.The day after the event, questions remained unanswered over the nature of the confrontation and how the police and officials responded to a warning that had gone out on Facebook the night of the event. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t go to Art All Night!,\u201d it said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be shooting it up!\u201dAna Lozada, a kindergarten teacher whose friends attended the event, recalled their accounts of the mayhem. \u201cEveryone was screaming,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cOne lady instead of going out, she found a little hiding place inside and locked the door. She was with her child.\u201d\u201cWe try to be positive but you see, suddenly, your life could be over,\u2019\u2019 she added. \u201cYour life could be over just because some crazy people came to the event where we go every year.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Murphy vowed to focus on the needs of the city where he works, telling reporters, \u201cI\u2019m not going to turn my back on Trenton.\u201dJon Hurdle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

New evidence indicates that the Y chromosome participates in an array of essential, general-interest tasks in men, like stanching cancerous growth, keeping arteries clear and blocking the buildup of amyloid plaque in the brain.As a sizable percentage of men age, their blood and other body cells begin to spontaneously jettison copies of the Y chromosome, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. That unfortunate act of chromosomal decluttering appears to put the men at a heightened risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, leukemia and other disorders. \u201cI\u2019m quite certain,\u201d said Lars Forsberg, an associate professor of medical genetics at Uppsala University in Sweden, \u201cthat the loss of the Y chromosome with age explains a very large proportion of the increased mortality in men, compared to women.\u201dLooking at nine distinct sets of genes that have been identified on the human Y chromosome, Dr. Makova said, \u201ceight of them are shared with the gorilla, while only six gene families are shared with the chimpanzee.

Among gorillas, fertile females generally mate with one male at a time \u2014 the local silverback. Women, too, are mostly, though by no means unerringly, monogamous. By contrast, female chimpanzees mate wildly and promiscuously during each ovulatory cycle. As a rule, female promiscuity promotes sperm competition among males, and because the Y chromosome oversees sperm production, Dr. Makova said, the chimpanzee Y is likely evolving at hyperspeed to keep up.David Page of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., a world authority on the male sex chromosome who could well be called the Y Guy, believes the Y and the X \u201ceach deserve a full novel of their own.\u201d That tendency toward molecular aloofness led to the initial designation of the female chromosome as \u201cX,\u201d for strange or unknown; the Y was simply named for the next letter in the alphabet.The Y chromosome is a true chromosomal outlier, holding a fraction of the number of genes found on all the other chromosomes, including the X. Its genetic impoverishment is a legacy of its role in sex determination. Among our pre-mammalian forebears, an offspring\u2019s sex was dictated as it is today in crocodiles and turtles: not by genetics, but by temperature.Among turtles, if an egg develops in warm conditions, the embryo turns female. If it\u2019s cooler outside, the embryo becomes male.As a result, the Y chromosome on which sry was located could no longer freely recombine and swap its pieces with its corresponding X chromosome, as the other chromosomal pairs do to freshen things up whenever a new egg or sperm cell is created. Lacking the standard repair system of chromosomal recombination, genes on the Y chromosome began to decay and were eventually tossed out or reassigned to other chromosomes.It\u2019s not total isolationism: The tips of the X and Y chromosome can still swap pieces, but most of Y is off limits to trans-chromosomal barter and amendments. \u201cThere\u2019s a striking loneliness to the Y chromosome,\u201d said George Vassiliou of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Cambridge University.\u201cIt\u2019s dynamic but stable,\u201d said Melissa Wilson Sayres, who studies sex chromosomes at Arizona State University. \u201cIt may lose a gene or two, but it may also gain sequences. It\u2019s not a dead end.\u201d Moreover, new research indicates that the Y chromosome can patch up some internal problems without benefit of free trade and recombination with the X \u2014 by shuffling around duplicate copies of genes on its own lonely span. The Y also holds a host of genes that have yet to be fully appreciated or understood. Dr. Forsberg of Uppsala University and his colleague Jan Dumanski have published a series of papers about the phenomenon called L.O.Y., or loss-of-Y, in which men\u2019s blood and other cells mysteriously start shedding their Y chromosomes with age. The researchers propose that a weakening of the immune system may explain the many perils of L.O.Y. When white blood cells that serve as immune sentries lose their Y chromosome, Dr. Dumanski said, their surveillance skills falter. They fail to clean up messes on arterial walls or to spot cancer cells in need of destruction. They allow plaques and tangles to accrete in the brain. Dr. Dumanski admitted that the association between the loss of Y and disease has yet to be definitively proved, and that much remains to be understood about what\u2019s driving the chromosomal loss in blood cells and how it might be stopped.\u201cIt\u2019s still early, and there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a couple more years before the idea is widely accepted, but we are quite convinced ourselves that we are right.\u201d At which he laughed \u2014 and admitted his extreme self-confidence could well be the result of the Y chromosome that made him a man.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Top Tech Companies Met With Intelligence Officials to Discuss Midterms", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Eight of the tech industry\u2019s most influential companies, in anticipation of a repeat of the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, met with United States intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for this year\u2019s midterm elections.The meeting, which took place May 23 at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., was also attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oath, Snap and Twitter, according to three attendees of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because of its sensitive nature.The company officials met with Christopher Krebs, an under secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s newly formed \u201cforeign influence\u201d task force.Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the F.B.I. responded to a request for comment.Companies like Facebook and Twitter have been changing the way they operate to counter the kind of misinformation that plagued the two social services in 2016. But the May meeting was the first significant discussion between a group of tech companies and intelligence officials ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.The meeting, which was initiated by Facebook, was seen as a hopeful first step to ensure that the midterms were not a repeat of the Russian interference in 2016, said the three people who attended the meeting.But the people who attended described a tense atmosphere in which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information, only to be told \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that no specific intelligence would be shared.The tech companies shared details about disinformation campaigns they were witnessing on their platforms, but neither the F.B.I. nor the Department of Homeland Security was willing or able to share specific information about threats the tech companies should anticipate, the people said.One attendee of the meeting said the encounter led the tech companies to believe they would be on their own to counter election interference.Facebook, in particular, has been facing pressure to stem disinformation ahead of the elections. The company has been hit hard by reports that it allowed Russian-backed agents to buy advertisements and manage Facebook pages with one notable goal: influence voters in the United States and stoke conflict on hot-button issues like gun control.In public and behind closed doors, intelligence officials have offered scant details about what Russia is doing, prompting frustration from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill.Officials in Washington have described problems that range from intelligence agencies losing track of Russian targets to the same kind of poor communication between various intelligence-gathering agencies that hampered the response of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency has proved an especially vexing target in recent months, stepping up efforts to mask its activity, said an American official with access to intelligence reporting.Unlike in 2016, when Russian hackers left unmistakable footprints \u2014 posting tweets that identified locations, for instance, or working in Cyrillic language documents \u2014 they are now making much better use of virtual private networks and other tools that can hide their true identities and locations.At times, the official said, intelligence agencies have lost track of specific individuals they were tracking, and could not see what, if anything, the Russians were posting or trying to hack.\u201cWe\u2019re getting so many mixed signals, depending on what the agency is,\u201d Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters last week.He said his committee was planning to bring together intelligence officials next month to figure out what was going on and how the government should handle it. \u201cIt compels us to bring everybody together in the same room and try to figure out whether or not there\u2019s some stovepipe issues,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Part of the problem, officials say, is that the White House has expressed little interest in the problem of Russian interference, and that the apathy has had a trickle-down effect. Without pressure from the top, it can be difficult to bring together all the different strands of intelligence collected across America\u2019s spy agencies, and evaluate how to act on it.\u201cWhat we would normally see in a normal administration is the principals meeting to discuss what are they doing individually, what are they doing jointly, or what they are communicating among themselves, what\u2019s the whole of government plan to protect the midterms,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and the top minority member on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with Politico. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any evidence that\u2019s happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Your First Apartment", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf the many new arrivals who pour into New York City each spring with new degrees, new jobs, or simply new life plans, Patrick Laflamme thought that he would be in a fairly good position to find an apartment.A graduate student in cognitive psychology moving from Vancouver, British Columbia, to take a job with an investment bank, Mr. Laflamme had experience with competitive housing markets \u2014 \u201cthe Vancouver rental market is pretty aggressive: you go to see a listing and there are 40 people lined up outside\u201d \u2014 and he was accustomed to spending a large percentage of his income on rent.\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t too picky. I just didn\u2019t want to be more than a half-hour from the financial district,\u201d said Mr. Laflamme, 24, who set what seemed a reasonable budget of about $2,000 a month for a one-bedroom or large studio in Manhattan. \u201cRental agents don\u2019t really exist in Vancouver; you just kind of make it work. I figured that\u2019s what I would do in New York, too.\u201dBut several weeks of looking on Craigslist turned up only bait-and-switch scenarios, studios sneakily shot from angles that made them look like one-bedrooms and suspiciously beautiful apartments in Midtown managed by out-of-state companies without a New York address.\u201cI\u2019d read on some blogs that you should get an agent if you\u2019re not from New York, but I had been a skeptic,\u201d Mr. Laflamme said. \u201cFinally, I got one. Unless you have connections in the city, the barrier to entry is high.\u201dEven for renters accustomed to complex housing markets, finding an apartment in New York can be daunting. Many first-time renters arrive in the city braced for small, expensive apartments, but few are prepared for just how small and expensive.How much flexibility is required to get more space or seemingly basic perks like an elevator or dishwasher? Is it a matter of changing neighborhoods, raising your budget or just looking harder?For those unfamiliar with the city, a good agent can be invaluable for maximizing the number of apartments a potential renter sees \u2014 and then guiding that renter through the application process, and helping determine whether the renter\u2019s budget and expectations are reasonable.Bailey Gladysz said that when she moved to the city five years ago, she and her husband had a budget of $2,400, and they wanted a spacious one-bedroom with natural light in an elevator building in Chelsea. \u201cBrokers would literally take us to the worst apartment and say that we needed to increase our budget,\u201d she recalled.Now a real estate agent with Triplemint, Ms. Gladysz said she would never show renters grim listings to convince them to give in to higher prices. Instead, she tempers expectations at the outset.\u201cIf it\u2019s their first time moving to the city and they\u2019re a new college grad with not much money, I have to politely tell them to drop things off their must-have list,\u201d she said.Many newcomers aren\u2019t being intentionally demanding, she added, they just don\u2019t understand how New York works. When she explains that it is not that unusual for people to send their laundry out or have packages delivered to their workplaces, many are happy to forgo the in-unit washer-dryer or the doorman.And factors that, to the uninitiated, may not seem worth mentioning can sometimes derail or at least drastically change a New York apartment hunt.Kim Bloomfield, an agent at Citi Habitats, recalled showing a man moving from Washington one-bedrooms on the Upper East Side in the $2,300 range, which limited him primarily to walk-ups. \u201cOn the sixth or seventh apartment, he tells me he has a king-size bed that he\u2019s not willing to give up,\u201d said Ms. Bloomfield, who had to explain to the man that not only were the layouts of the older walk-ups in his price range not ideal for a king-size bed, she was not even sure he would be able to get it up the stairs.The man held firm and ended up finding an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. \u201cAt the end of the day, he was willing to move pretty far away from where he was looking to keep his bed,\u201d she said.Deciding what to sacrifice can be difficult, however, especially as financial necessity compels most recent college grads to live with roommates who may not all be on the same page. It is not uncommon, brokers say, for one roommate to get stuck on a specific neighborhood or amenity that the other roommates are more than willing to do without. Several brokers recalled watching would-be roommates break up in the middle of showings.Though the last few years have seen rents in the city level out, the breather came only after a relentless, yearslong climb, and rents remain prohibitively high for many New Yorkers in their 20s and 30s. Student loan debt is another big factor, Mr. Malin said: \u201cIncomes haven\u2019t gone up that dramatically, but rents have gone up and student loan debt has gone up.\u201dAfter college and law school, Kristen Pride recently moved back to Bedford-Stuyvesant, where she grew up. She wanted to find a one-bedroom, but couldn\u2019t afford the $2,300 and $2,400 rents she was seeing, \u201cnot even on an attorney\u2019s salary,\u201d she said. \u201cNot with student loans.\u201dFinally, she found something on StreetEasy in her price range \u2014 an older, unrenovated one-bedroom for $1,750 a month \u2014 and the broker was eager to put her application through. But she was reluctant. Rationally, she knew that the apartment was a good deal, but it felt like a lot to pay, especially for an older building.In the end, she signed the lease, but she hasn\u2019t been able to bring herself to tell anyone in her family how much she pays. \u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is super passionate about gentrification. He gets so mad and is like, \u2018This is crazy, people shouldn\u2019t be paying this much in Bed-Stuy!\u2019\u201dFor the many people who move to New York without a full-time job \u2014 or a well-paid one \u2014 finding a sublet or pre-existing share are among the few available options. In most cases, going one of these routes means the renter can avoid having to submit pay stubs and bank records, or signing a yearlong lease. But the process can be grueling in other ways.Matt Gelman, a 23-year-old copywriter and coder freelancing at a tech company in Dumbo, Brooklyn, recently moved into his second Williamsburg sublet, a $1,300-a-month room he found on Gypsy Housing. On the night he went to see the room, he was told that seven other people were interested, and because of a scheduling glitch, one of them would be touring it at the same time.\u201cThe other guy was clearly interested, so I had to prove I wanted it more,\u201d Mr. Gelman said. \u201cI emailed right away and said I wanted to meet the other roommates.\u201dActually, Mr. Gelman clarified, he Facebook messaged using Google translator, because the roommates, who were French, do not speak much English, and he does not speak French. Fortunately, they have since discovered that they all speak Spanish.But while terrible first-apartment tales tend to get passed around like scary stories at a campfire, it is important to remember that not every first-time renting experience is harrowing.As a senior at Emory University in 2016, Rifat Mursalin attended a presentation by a New York brokerage, but blanched at the prices of their listings. \u201cIt was like $3,800 for a two-bedroom in Hell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d he said. Neither he nor his roommate felt the need to live in Manhattan, \u201cand we could care less about having a doorman or a gym.\u201d A friend suggested he try StreetEasy, where he found a no-fee two-bedroom in East Williamsburg for $2,200 a month.\u201cIt was quite daunting before I came here, but not when I arrived,\u201d said Mr. Mursalin, who also used the site to find his current apartment, a $2,200 two-bedroom in Long Island City. The neighborhood is known for its lushly amenitized new construction, but his building is a bare-bones walk-up. The only upgrade he insisted on, he said, was better transit.And for all those put off by the price of New York apartments, there are some recent arrivals who find them comparatively reasonable. When Madeleine Goldsmith moved to the city from San Francisco last summer to start a new career as a theater producer, she was delighted to see her rent plummet from $1,500 a month to $1,075.\u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s a steal!\u2019\u201d said Ms. Goldsmith, who currently shares a Harlem three-bedroom with two roommates. \u201cIt\u2019s so much cheaper here. In San Francisco, there are no pockets of cheapness. And that apartment was rent-regulated \u2014 my roommate had lived there since 2012!\u201dBut she plans to move again this summer, in part because she realized she could be paying a lot less in some areas of Brooklyn or Queens. \u201cI\u2019m aiming lower for the next one,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t want to pay more than $800.\u201dAs for Mr. Laflamme, his story has a happy ending, too.He decided to up his budget. \u201cI realized I had to increase to find anything that wasn\u2019t a 200-square-foot studio,\u201d he said.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s more than I was expecting,\u201d he said.Of course, like everything in New York, there is a catch: It is a fifth-floor walk-up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stephen Bannon Buys Into Bitcoin", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon, 10 months removed from the job of chief strategist to President Trump and five months after his ouster from the arch-conservative news site Breitbart News, is betting that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can disrupt banking the way Mr. Trump disrupted American politics.Mr. Bannon won\u2019t reveal very much about his cryptocurrency plans \u2014 he worries that the controversy that comes with his name could have a bad impact on projects just getting off the ground.But he has had private meetings with cryptocurrency investors and hedge funds where he has discussed working on so-called initial coin offerings through his investment business, Bannon & Company. And in his first interview on the topic, he said he had a \u201cgood stake\u201d in Bitcoin.The work that Mr. Bannon is doing in the virtual currency realm is still in its early stages. But he has expressed an interest in helping entrepreneurs and even countries looking to create their own cryptocurrencies \u2014 generally outside the United States.The offbeat world of cryptocurrencies has drawn interest from all sorts over the last few years, from drug dealers and scam artists to the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and the most staid institutions of Wall Street.It is not a shocking place for Mr. Bannon, 64, to plot his re-emergence. Cryptocurrencies have many of the characteristics that drew him into Tea Party politics: They break old rules, they exist on the periphery and they pose a challenge to the powerful figures and institutions that have long called the shots.\u201cIt\u2019s disruptive populism,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in the interview at his Capitol Hill townhouse in Washington. \u201cIt takes control back from central authorities. It\u2019s revolutionary.\u201dEven though he has no formal ties to the business anymore, Mr. Bannon still refers to his townhouse as the Breitbart Embassy, the nickname given to it because so much of the site\u2019s business was done there.While Breitbart editors and writers no longer linger at all hours inside the embassy, remnants of the website remain in Breitbart mementos hanging from the wall and coffee mugs with the signature block B logo strewn about the kitchen. Mr. Bannon still accepts a steady stream of visitors who provide him intelligence and gossip from the conservative circles he once commanded. But these days he is just as likely to be convening meetings there on his new financial venture.He won\u2019t talk about a possible return to politics someday. His messy rupture with the White House over critical comments he made in Michael Wolff\u2019s book \u201cFire and Fury\u201d about colleagues and Donald Trump Jr. is still too fresh. But he does see a political component to virtual currency.\u201cIt was pretty obvious to me that unless you got somehow control over your currency, all these political movements were going to be beholden to who controlled the currency,\u201d Mr. Bannon said.His vision for virtual currency has elements of his unorthodox ideology. He sounds like both an avowed libertarian who wants government out of his life and a progressive who wants Wall Street held to account when he insists that virtual currencies can help citizens take back power from the central banks that \u201cdebase your currency\u201d and make citizens \u201cslaves to debt.\u201dHis focus on creating new digital tokens, which are usually offered through initial coin offerings, puts him squarely in the edgiest, most scam-filled slice of the cryptocurrency business.New companies have raised billions through these I.C.O.s, which allow them to bypass regulators and other middlemen and go straight to investors. That has also led to plenty of scams, and authorities throughout the world are starting to crack down.Mr. Bannon\u2019s involvement in cryptocurrencies has raised eyebrows among people trying to move the business toward the mainstream. They fear he will further cement the technology\u2019s reputation as a plaything of fringe elements.\u201cIt almost seems like a natural progression for a man who gained prominence by shoveling out unfounded conspiracies to now shilling complex technology and financial instruments to an unsophisticated investing public,\u201d said Colin Platt, a cryptocurrency researcher and adviser.Bitcoin are stored and moved around a global network of computers that allows for the system to work without relying on a central authority. That lack of oversight has made Bitcoin a favorite method of payment for online drug markets and ransom schemes.Bitcoin has been popular with the alt-right and nationalist communities because it has provided them with a way to receive online donations and evade restrictions put on them by banks and payment companies. PayPal and Apple Pay, for example, shut down the accounts of some right-wing groups last year.These big companies are generally trying to take the technology away from its radical political roots. But Mr. Bannon is hoping to embrace those roots. \u201cControl of the currency,\u201d he said, \u201cis control of everything.\u201dTimothy Lewis, a hedge fund manager who met with Mr. Bannon to talk about cryptocurrencies last month, said he was impressed with the degree to which Mr. Bannon had delved into the details of the technology and the challenges it faces.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect going in, but he had clearly done his homework,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, who is a co-founder of the Ikigai hedge fund, which invests in cryptocurrency projects. He said they had talked about the laws governing new cryptocurrencies and a few initial coin offerings that had recently raised money from investors.Mr. Bannon is particularly interested in the possibility that countries could create coins tied to national wealth \u2014 an Italian coin tied to marble deposits in the country, for instance.He found his way into the virtual currency universe through Brock Pierce, a former child actor who appeared in films like \u201cThe Mighty Ducks\u201d before starting a company in Hong Kong that sold the virtual gold that players use in the video game World of Warcraft.Mr. Bannon credits the company with introducing him to the ranks of disaffected young men who gathered online around video games, and who became pillars of the alt-right movement.Mr. Bannon said he would have gotten involved with Mr. Pierce and cryptocurrencies back in 2016 if the Trump campaign hadn\u2019t intervened.Mr. Bannon is not bothered by the mockery. Other causes he has taken on have worked out well despite low expectations.\u201cThese guys are visionaries,\u201d he said.Jeremy W. Peters reported from Washington, and Nathaniel Popper from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

In those days, I was winging it. I knew I had an incredible gig and didn\u2019t want to mess it up by revealing the hassles that went along with it.I also had the disadvantage of working in the days before digital photography was widespread and affordable. I shot on film, with a camera, heavy lenses and a tripod, and lugged this gear around wherever I went. My back was a mess for years. The most valuable thing you can take on your trip isn\u2019t a suitcase or app; it\u2019s the email or number of a local contact. Whenever I travel, I try to make some connections on the ground before I go. Sometimes I travel to a destination I would not have otherwise thought of, because of a friend I\u2019ve made there. Here\u2019s a question for you guys: Is there anything (besides laundry) that you always try to do when you visit somewhere? I often get under the skin of a place by booking a personal service like a shampoo-and-blow-dry or a pedicure. I\u2019d love to chat a little bit more about the difficulties and hardships that have come up on the road and what, if anything, we learned from those experiences.Aside from physical danger, traveling alone for months a year comes with a dose of loneliness and two doses of exhaustion. The cure for loneliness, I always found, was talking to strangers \u2014 easier in some countries than others. Now that I\u2019m in my early 60s I find that age has much more impact on how I experience travel than gender. Being older on the road is equal parts disconcerting, humbling and enlightening. It\u2019s a whole new world. Fortunately I\u2019m in good health and I can do all the same things I did when I was writing the column. But I can tell that the people I encounter along the way see and deal with me differently than when I was doing the column in my 40s. Sometimes that means I get treated extra nicely, especially in generation-conscious Asia. In other situations, though, it means I\u2019m invisible and ignored or just don\u2019t fit the profile. The same applies for food and entertainment. I love eating and drinking on the street and in small local places not because they\u2019re cheap per se, but because they frequently give a better sense what life is actually like in that city or country (It helps if the food is good, of course). So that means eating a big steaming bag of dumplings on the street in Chengdu for 8 yuan (about $1.20), yes. But I think it\u2019s also valuable to show that eating upscale can be done, too.

But Ms. Ant\u00f3n said that few locals would tell her that they don\u2019t respect those beliefs. She was intrigued.

{"Headline": "Over 16 Years, Simon Rattle Transformed the Berlin Philharmonic. Here\u2019s How.", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The conductor Simon Rattle stepped onto his podium here last month and gave the downbeat. But the orchestra in front of him wasn\u2019t his mighty Berlin Philharmonic \u2014 not exactly. One of the horn players was a police officer. The concertmaster was a cardiologist. The violin section included a Turkish engineer and a Dutch airline pilot.\u201cCould we be noble, rather than aggressive?\u201d Mr. Rattle asked at one point as he shaped a passage in rehearsal. Then he smiled. \u201cThat would actually be quite a good thing for all over the world, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s on the box you get via the high-art Amazon, a warning sign on the cover: \u2018This is Not Going to Be Easy,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Rattle, who has moved on to become music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, said in an interview last week.But the era ended with warmth and admiration on Sunday at an emotional, open-air farewell concert \u2014 with some players donning wigs that mimicked Mr. Rattle\u2019s instantly recognizable poof of white curls.\u201cI\u2019m sure there were many moments of \u2018lost in translation,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Rattle, now 63, a spirited choice to fill a Berlin post that had previously been held by a pantheon of more Olympian maestros, including Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Herbert von Karajan and Claudio Abbado. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is, at this point, the \u2018lost in translation\u2019 on both sides seems mostly to translate into affection. O.K., we were a strange fit, but we also could become a team.\u201dMr. Rattle made a big statement in his first season, inviting 250 Berlin schoolchildren from different backgrounds to dance Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d with the Philharmonic at Berlin\u2019s Treptow Arena.\u201cI had had this weird dream of putting lots of young people who had not danced with an orchestra,\u201d Mr. Rattle said.It was tied to his vision for reaching out to communities that had previously had little to do with the orchestra, which some players feared was seen as a \u201cchilly diva\u201d by too many in the vibrant city it served. Such educational initiatives were not common at the time in Germany. Sarah Willis, a horn player at the Philharmonic, recalled how surprised some players were when Mr. Rattle, at his first meeting with the ensemble, outlined his expansive education plans.\u201cYou try telling classical musicians that they have to go and stand in front of a class of 10-year-olds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking them to take their clothes off.\u201dBut it worked, and was the first of several large-scale dance projects.Mr. Rattle significantly broadened the Philharmonic\u2019s repertoire \u2014 not only by programming more new music, but also by reclaiming Baroque works that many symphony orchestras had ceded to early-music ensembles. Most notable was Peter Sellars\u2019s simple but shattering staging of Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion.\u201dIt broke with any number of traditions. Singers popped up and sang from seats in the audience. The chorus, the Berlin Radio Choir, learned its parts by heart so its members could move throughout the auditorium and act. Members of the Philharmonic were asked to get up from their seats as quasi-actors in the spiritual drama.\u201cThis was the point where everybody left how wonderfully they play out in the dressing room,\u201d Mr. Rattle said. \u201cWorking with Peter on a piece like that simply involves everybody deciding on not what it sounds like, but what it means. It was a way of almost healing the orchestra from their own virtuosity and excellence. Because this music has nothing to do with that, however beautifully you can play.\u201dThe Berlin Philharmonic was once a recording-industry titan. When that industry melted, the orchestra responded by starting one of the first, and most sophisticated, orchestra streaming services, the Digital Concert Hall. The ensemble is still building a subscription base \u2014 the service costs about $17 a month \u2014 but the project has extended the orchestra\u2019s reach; its Facebook page has 1.2 million followers. And Mr. Rattle remains one of classical music\u2019s great communicators.Simon Halsey, the choral conductor who has long worked closely with Mr. Rattle, said: \u201cHow do we make sure, in days when a 17-year-old has a million choices about what he or she will do after the high school day ends, why would they practice the cello or play in the orchestra or come to a concert? Therefore you have to have these Pied Pipers, and I think he\u2019s been extraordinarily successful at that.\u201dMr. Rattle presented 40 world premieres during his tenure, and embraced contemporary music. Last season, when the American composer John Adams turned 70, Mr. Rattle made him the Philharmonic\u2019s first composer in residence, and the orchestra released a box set of his works. While the list of most-performed works of the Rattle era is still heavy with Brahms and Beethoven, 20th-century pieces by Stravinsky, Berg and Webern have also been among the most frequently heard works.The Berlin Philharmonic is considered one of the most virtuosic orchestras in the world \u2014 and one of the most independent. It was founded in 1882 by a group of musicians rebelling against their conductor. A little more than a century later, the autocratic Karajan resigned in a dispute with the players.Fergus McWilliam, a Philharmonic horn player, recalled how the orchestra had come to select Mr. Rattle. \u201cDo we turn the clock back, be a more traditional orchestra with a living museum role?\u201d he recalled the players asking themselves. \u201cOr do we embrace the future?\u201dIf any orchestra could have afforded the status quo, it was this one. It plays in a city that embraces and supports classical music like few others, and boasts a global following. It regularly sells over 90 percent of its tickets. But the players decided to go for change.Looking back, Mr. Rattle acknowledged that there were some projects he had not been able to realize, but said he was pleased over all.\u201cI think we moved this big, big ship forward,\u201d he said.On the podium last month, Mr. Rattle was putting the Be Phil amateurs through their paces as they rehearsed Brahms\u2019s First Symphony, which they were playing at the orchestra\u2019s open day, when it unlocks the doors of the Philharmonie for a day of free concerts large and small. Mr. Rattle stepped backstage, where he was given a dab of makeup \u2014 \u201cIt won\u2019t help!\u201d he joked \u2014 and found Ms. Willis, the horn player, who was waiting in the wings with a camera crew to interview him for the Digital Concert Hall.\u201cMusic is for everybody, and we\u2019ve all believed this, and this was really one of my most important goals while I was here,\u201d Mr. Rattle said, his enthusiasm tinged with a note of wistfulness. \u201cTo spread it everywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Major Study of Drinking Will Be Shut Down", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn investigation at the National Institutes of Health concluded that the $100 million trial had been tainted by funding appeals to the alcohol industry.The extensive government trial was intended to settle an age-old question about alcohol and diet: Does a daily cocktail or beer really protect against heart attacks and stroke? To find out, the National Institutes of Health gave scientists $100 million to fund a global study comparing people who drink with those who don\u2019t. Its conclusions could have enshrined alcohol as part of a healthy diet.While the advisory group was not asked to determine whether N.I.H. officials violated federal policy, investigators did find that there \u201cwas frequent email correspondence\u201d among the staff of the alcohol institute, outside scientists and alcohol industry representatives.Alcohol industry officials offered input into the design of the trial, the investigators found. The lead investigator, Dr. Kenneth J. Mukamal, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, discussed the methods with alcohol groups by email in August 2014, responding to questions raised by Diageo, Anheuser Busch InBev, and trade groups like the Distilled Spirits Council. In December 2014, he participated in a conference call discussing the research with a dozen representatives of alcohol companies, the investigators said.\u201cThe early and frequent engagement with industry representatives calls into question the impartiality of the process and thus casts doubt that the scientific knowledge gained from the study would be actionable or believable,\u201d said the advisory committee\u2019s report.The contacts by staff with industry officials and others took place before the Foundation for the N.I.H., which has the authority to seek donations for government studies, was given permission to raise private funding for the trial. Investigators also found that officials at the alcohol institute \u201chid facts\u201d from other staff and from the foundation. Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of community health sciences at Boston University and an early critic of the alcohol study, applauded the N.I.H. for discontinuing the research. \u201cThis ensures that N.I.H.\u2019s research agenda will be determined by scientific merit, not corporate marketing priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe N.I.H. research portfolio should not be up to the highest corporate bidder.\u201dIn a statement, Dr. Mukamal denied any wrongdoing and said he and his colleagues \u201cstand fully and forcefully behind the scientific integrity\u201d of the trial. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that issues raised have led to a recommendation to end the trial and negate the extraordinary efforts of its participants, investigators, scientific and ethics review boards, and many dedicated staff members,\u201d he wrote. N.I.H. policy prohibits employees from soliciting, suggesting or requesting donations, funds or other resources to support the institutes\u2019 activities. After The Times revealed the industry\u2019s financial interests in the study, Dr. Collins ordered an internal investigation into whether that policy had been violated. Anheuser Busch InBev, one of the five industry sponsors, pulled its $15 million in funding from the study last week, saying the controversy had undermined the trial\u2019s credibility.The international study, a 10-year-long randomized clinical trial that aimed to recruit 7,800 participants at 16 sites around the world, is the kind of ambitious, broad-reaching scientific project that few agencies other than the N.I.H. could attempt. The goal was to follow the two groups for six years on average to see if moderate drinkers have fewer heart attacks and strokes, and lower odds of death and diabetes.But N.I.H. investigators on Friday were extremely critical of the trial\u2019s design, suggesting that the investigators\u2019 interactions with the alcohol industry \u201cappear to intentionally bias the framing of the scientific premise in the direction of demonstrating a beneficial health effect of moderate alcohol consumption.\u201dA review by two N.I.H. officials concluded the number of participants and the follow-up time were insufficient to assess important adverse outcomes of daily alcohol consumption, particularly its relationship to cancer. \u201cThus the trial could show benefits while missing the harms,\u201d said the investigators\u2019 report.The trial also did not include heart failure as a primary endpoint, and alcohol consumption is associated with a higher risk of heart failure, the investigators said.Outside experts also have criticized the design of the study. Though the goal was to recruit an equal number of male and female participants, for example, Dr. Mukamal has acknowledged the study would not be large enough to detect gender differences unless they were pronounced. Women metabolize alcohol more slowly than men, and studies have shown that women are more susceptible than men to the toxic effects of alcohol on the liver at any dose. Heart disease also manifests differently in women, experts say.The investigators also planned to exclude any participants whose health might be compromised by light drinking, including people with a history of substance abuse, mental health problems, liver or kidney problems, certain cancers or family histories of cancer, as well as people who have never consumed alcohol.The exclusions were meant to protect volunteers, but they would have altered the results of the trial and minimized the potential harms, particularly to older adults, noted Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the community health sciences department at Boston University School of Public Health.\u201cIndustry influence on the N.I.H. research agenda should be avoided. It's very important that N.I.H. make research decisions independently,\u201d said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of pharmacology at Georgetown University.  Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of the federal institute that funds research into alcoholism. It is the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, not the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse.Advertisement"}

This was no celebratory call.Lidia Karina Souza had been released from immigration detention nearly two weeks earlier. But she could not tell Diogo, who was separated from her shortly after they reached the United States, when they would see each other again.\u201cDon\u2019t cry. You are going to get a Nintendo, a birthday party. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d Ms. Souza, who is from Brazil, told her son. The telephone conversation was recorded and later provided to The New York Times.They had parted ways at the southwest border on May 30. Ms. Souza was locked up. Diogo was flown to Chicago, where he was placed in a shelter. Ms. Souza was released on June 9 and allowed to join relatives in Hyannis, Mass., but it is still not clear when her son will rejoin her.\u201cI am going to do everything to get you out of there,\u201d she told him on the call. \u201cIt\u2019s so many papers they need.\u201dPresident Trump has officially ended the policy of separating families when parents are being prosecuted under the \u201czero tolerance\u201d border enforcement program that took effect in May. But frustrating stories like that of the Souza family are playing out across the country, as parents of more than 2,300 children who were separated after their arrival in the United States now face lengthy bureaucratic delays in recovering them.\u201cThere was clearly no plan for reuniting the families,\u201d said Karen Hoffmann, an immigration attorney at Aldea-The People\u2019s Justice Center in Reading, Penn., who is suing the government to reunite three migrants with their children.Part of the problem is that in many cases, parents and children are being detained thousands of miles apart, and the parents do not know exactly where their children are. Though federal agencies have registered each child with an identification number and set up hotlines for parents, immigrant advocates say that many parents have trouble getting through or are not given answers when they call.Late Saturday, the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services announced that they had a \u201cwell-coordinated\u201d process for reuniting families. As of June 20, their statement said, there were 2,053 separated minors in government custody. It said that another 522 children who had not yet been sent by the Border Patrol to a shelter or a foster family were returned to their parents at the border.\u201cA parent who is ordered removed from the U.S. may request that his or her minor child accompany them,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt should be noted that in the past, many parents have elected to be removed without their children.\u201dIf a parent is released from detention, the authorities say, he or she will be reunited with a separated child once the parent fulfills requirements set by the government. But as Ms. Souza\u2019s case illustrates, the red tape can cause lengthy delays.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called on the Trump administration on Sunday to appoint a \u201cczar\u201d to be in charge of coordinating federal agencies to quickly reunite families.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a foreign relations expert to know that the situation created by zero tolerance has left many people with zero confidence that the administration will be able to quickly reunite the kids,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference.Noting that three different cabinet departments had a role in the situation, Mr. Schumer said, \u201cNo one is really in charge if there are three people in charge.\u201dShortly before the government officially announced the zero tolerance policy, it issued a memorandum setting stringent new rules for vetting parents, relatives and other potential sponsors who wish to get children from government custody.For one thing, the memo said that Health and Human Services must obtain the \u201ccitizenship, immigration status, criminal history and immigration history\u201d of the potential sponsor. It also said that the department must collect the names, dates of birth, addresses, fingerprints and identification documents of the potential sponsor and \u201call adult members in the potential sponsor\u2019s household,\u201d and provide that information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that oversees deportation.Previously, Health and Human Services did not share such information with ICE; other members of the household were not typically screened as part of the process; and parents did not have to be fingerprinted to get their children back.\u201cWe have cases of Brazilian minors who remain in a shelter because of the new demands, which ended up intimidating relatives who wanted to bring them home,\u201d said Luisa Lopes, the director of consular affairs for Brazilians abroad. Ms. Lopes said she is aware of 49 Brazilian children who were separated from their parents.Ms. Souza, 27, and her son turned themselves in to the Border Patrol on May 29, declaring that they had a fear of returning to their home country and wished to obtain asylum in the United States. The following day, an agent used Google Translate, she said, to explain to her \u2014 as Diogo erupted in tears \u2014 that because she had not presented herself at an official port of entry, she had entered the United States illegally; therefore she would go to jail, and he would go to a shelter. The son saw his mother being handcuffed.\u201cI told him, I\u2019m not going to jail,\u201d she recalled in an interview conducted in Portuguese. \u201cI am going to a place with other mothers. You are going to a place for children.\u201dMs. Souza appeared soon after in federal court in El Paso, where she pleaded guilty to illegal entry, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to time served. Three detention centers and 10 days later, she was allowed to join a relative in Massachusetts, having passed an interview meant to ascertain whether she had a credible reason to fear returning to Brazil.Before the authorities dropped her off in Dallas for her flight to Boston, they handed her a toll-free number she could call to locate Diogo.She tried the number when she reached Massachusetts, but she could not get through to anyone.\u201cI was devastated, desperate, crazed,\u201d she said.Ms. Souza, an evangelical Christian, said she sought strength in prayer.She also searched on Facebook for a Brazilian woman she had met in detention whose child had also been removed from her. The woman, who is now in Pennsylvania, told Ms. Souza that her daughter had been at a shelter in Chicago called Casa Guadalupe and had befriended a Brazilian boy there named Diogo. She gave Ms. Souza the number.Mother and son spoke for the first time in more than two weeks. She learned that Diogo had contracted chickenpox and, as a result, was isolated from other children. He sobbed, pleading for his mother to come get him.Since then, they have been allowed to speak to each other by phone twice a week, for 10 minutes at a time.\u201cIt has been 16 days, but don\u2019t worry,\u201d Ms. Souza told her son over one call that was recorded. \u201cIt\u2019s coming to an end. Be well. Stay with Jesus. With God on our side, it will all work out.\u201dTo get her son back, Ms. Souza learned, she would have to provide the shelter, which is run by Heartland Alliance, with a mountain of documents.Assisted by a lawyer, Ms. Souza filled out a 36-page packet and submitted documents attesting to her relationship to Diogo. But \u201cevery day, they wanted something else,\u201d Ms. Souza in an interview on Saturday.For example, the adults in the family with whom she lives in Hyannis also had to submit five pages of personal information for a background check.On another call, Diogo urged his mother to hurry his release. With his voice breaking, the boy begged, \u201cAi, Mom, get the papers done fast.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t up to me,\u201d she tried to explain. \u201cI am doing everything, but it\u2019s a lot of paperwork to handle.\u201dBut more days passed, and more requirements had to be met.The last straw, she said, was the fingerprint request last week. A case worker notified Ms. Souza that she and two other adults in the household would have to visit a designated location in their area to be fingerprinted \u2014 on July 6. Her request to get back her son would then take 22 days to be approved, she was told.\u201cThey said she can only get the child in August,\u201d said Jesse Bless, her lawyer. \u201cThat is completely unacceptable. What kind of process for reunification is this?\u201d\u201cIt was zero tolerance, zero planning, zero thought,\u201d said Mr. Bless, a senior counsel at Jeff Goldman Immigration, based in Boston, who has taken Ms. Souza\u2019s case pro bono.He expressed outrage to shelter managers, telling them that Ms. Souza had already been fingerprinted at the border. In response, a Health and Human Services official emailed Mr. Bless, saying: \u201cPolicy and Procedures recently changed and requires all household members and sponsor\u2019s to fingerprint. I can assure you that while at Heartland, Diogo is not isolated.\u201cCase Managers at Heartland truly care about our children and are working diligently to ensure all of our minors are safely released.\u201dMr. Bless said that after he threatened to sue the shelter, \u201cthey agreed to a more expedited, but undefined schedule.\u201d Unsatisfied, he said on Sunday that he intended to travel to Chicago to press the matter further.Meanwhile, Ms. Souza is next scheduled to speak with her son on Wednesday.Her last words to him on his tear-filled birthday were: \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I want you to be okay. Please be strong. O.K., son? Stay with Jesus, my son. Tchau. I love you.\u201d\u201cI love you too,\u201d the boy responded.Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an earlier version of this article misspelled Lidia Souza\u2019s middle name.

{"Headline": "Aztec Turquoise Tiles May Solve a Mesoamerican Mystery", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA recent geochemical analysis calls into question the idea of extensive contact between Mesoamerican and Southwest American cultures before the Spanish invaded. With its brilliant hues of blue and green, turquoise was a highly prized gemstone to the ancient Aztecs and Mixtec in the region that stretches from central Mexico to Central America known as Mesoamerica. They used the mineral to create armbands and nose plugs, for handles on sacrificial knives and also to design elaborate mosaics of warriors that adorned their ceremonial shields and fearsome statues of double-headed serpents.After shaving off the tiles\u2019 edges to remove adhesives, Dr. Thibodeau ground them up individually and dissolved them in acid. She then analyzed the samples for their isotopic fingerprints, which provided insight into their origins.Late in the lab one night, she got back her first results. \u201cI saw the number pop up and I\u2019m pretty sure I did a dance around the lab,\u201d Dr. Thibodeau said. \u201cNot only do they have isotopic signatures that are absolutely consistent with the geology of Mesoamerica,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they are completely different from the isotopic signatures of the Southwestern turquoise deposits and artifacts that we have seen so far.\u201dDr. Thibodeau said that even though archaeologists have not found remnants of turquoise mines in Mesoamerica, that does not mean they were never there. Turquoise forms near the surface as a product of copper weathering, typically caused by rainwater or groundwater. Mesoamerica has plenty of copper mines, she said, which suggests that turquoise deposits may have once been present there, too. The isotopic signatures she found on the turquoise artifacts also matched the signatures of copper deposits found in Mesoamerica.\u201cThe evidence increasingly suggests there was no organized contact between Mesoamericans and the American Southwest,\u201d Dr. Killick said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 I wanted to hate the scooters. I really did.Tech hubris on wheels \u2014 what\u2019s not to loathe?But I wanted to experience the scooter craze for myself. So for a week, I used shared e-scooters as my primary mode of transportation. I rode them to meetings, ran errands across town and went for long joy rides on the Venice Beach boardwalk. In all, I took more than a dozen scooter rides, from just a few blocks to several miles.My journey to e-scooter acceptance began when I saw an empty scooter outside my hotel. I downloaded the Bird app, entered my driver\u2019s license and credit card information, agreed to some basic terms (no riding on sidewalks, no riding two to a scooter, no speeding downhill) and scanned a code on the scooter\u2019s handlebar.The scooter beeped, telling me that it was unlocked, and I was off.Battery-powered scooters have been available for years, but only recently have they been outfitted with GPS trackers and wireless connectivity and arranged into on-demand fleets. These scooters are limited to 15 miles per hour, but that is still zippy enough to put a satisfying whoosh in your hair. And when you\u2019re done riding, just park it anywhere, choose \u201cend ride\u201d on your app, take a photo to help the next rider find it and walk away. Rides are cheap (Bird charges $1 plus 15 cents per minute), and an abundant supply of scooters in Santa Monica meant that I was never more than a block or two from one.The rise of shared e-scooters is just one of several recent tech-powered experiments in urban mobility. Dockless bike-sharing programs, which have been popular in China for years, are starting to take off in America. The programs added 44,000 bikes in the United States during the last half of 2017, according to a report by the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Other wheeled innovations \u2014 like electric unicycles and skateboards \u2014 are also making gains.But people should think twice before condemning e-scooters as an ill-conceived tech-world fantasy. Because if you can get over their dopey aesthetics and dubious corporate strategy, e-scooters actually solve some problems. They\u2019re lightweight and emission-free. They don\u2019t require bulky docks or parking lots, and they\u2019re perfect for trips that are too long to walk but too short to justify driving or hailing a car. If they take off, they could alleviate congestion and become a low-cost way of getting around cities without robust public transportation systems.Opponents of e-scooters typically make three major claims. But as I learned during my experiment in California, none of those arguments hold up particularly well under scrutiny.Anti-scooter activists tend to paint scooter riders as kamikaze daredevils, slaloming through cars and pedestrians. I did see a few instances of dangerous behavior \u2014 couples riding two to a scooter, people riding one-handed while taking selfies and some running red lights. There is also the issue of helmets, which many states require but which, as far as I can tell, no scooter riders are wearing.There have been five traffic incidents involving Bird scooters in Santa Monica since November, and 424 citations of motorized scooter riders, according to a Santa Monica Police Department spokesman. Bird, which declined to provide information about accidents, offers helmets to active riders for a $1.99 shipping fee, and about 30,000 people have taken it up on the deal. (The deal is available only to riders who live in a current Bird market, which excludes out-of-town visitors like me.)There is no doubt that scooters could be safer if helmet laws were better enforced and basic safety training was provided before riding. But it\u2019s probably not time to panic just yet. We don\u2019t have enough data to know if scooters are more dangerous than bikes, motorcycles or other types of two-wheeled transit, and scooter safety will most likely improve as riders get more experience and drivers learn to share the road.In fact, the only scary scooter rides I had were the times that cars veered a little too close to the bike lane I was riding in. If cities want to encourage safe scooter riding \u2014 and they should, given the benefits they have for congestion and environmental health \u2014 they should create protected scooter lanes and encourage drivers to give them more room.It\u2019s true that scooters have gone from nonexistent to ubiquitous in a matter of weeks \u2014 one morning, I counted more than 100 within a few blocks of my hotel. But their visibility is a function of their novelty. We don\u2019t view parked cars and bus stops as eyesores, even though they\u2019re everywhere.Some people object to e-scooters on political and symbolic grounds, claiming that they represent everything that is wrong with the tech industry. Critics have taken aim at their perceived elitism (you need a smartphone and a credit card to use scooter-sharing apps) and the sudden, permissionless way they were rolled out in cities, which fit a pattern of bad behavior set by tech companies like Uber and Airbnb.It\u2019s true that scooter companies have not exactly covered themselves in glory. They have invited a backlash by flooding the streets with scooters with no explanation and little or no contact with local officials. As these companies grow, they will need to prove that they can cooperate with regulators, rather than trying to circumvent them.David Estrada, Bird\u2019s chief legal officer, told me that the company had cooperated with officials in Miami and other cities to plan orderly rollouts. He said the company obeys local laws and doesn\u2019t introduce scooters in cities, such as New York, that expressly prohibit them. But he said that cities tended to drag their feet on new transportation policy, and that seeking pre-emptive approval for e-scooters could take years.\u201cWe\u2019d have happy cities, but we wouldn\u2019t have a business and we wouldn\u2019t be solving a problem,\u201d Mr. Estrada said.It\u2019s possible that the skeptics are right, and that electric scooters will end up like Segways \u2014 novelty gadgets for big-city tourists. It\u2019s also possible that they\u2019ll end up like Uber and Lyft \u2014 a multibillion-dollar industry that spends years battling local officials but ultimately changes urban transportation as we know it. The answer will most likely depend on the regulations that emerge, and whether scooter companies can operate profitably in cities that, unlike Santa Monica, don\u2019t have flat terrain and year-round sunshine.Whatever happens, you can count me as a slightly embarrassed member of Team Scooter. If liking fun, inexpensive, short-distance transportation is wrong, I don\u2019t want to be right.Advertisement"}

Over the next decades, Spuyten Duyvil Creek (to its north) was filled in, and the land joined with the Bronx but remained, technically, part of Manhattan. So began a cross-borough tug of war.The Marble Hill Houses, a Nycha development, anchor the bottom of the neighborhood near commercial Broadway; the turn-of-the-century private, residential homes grace the winding roads above.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Today will grow increasingly cloudy, with a high of 75.Saturday will see rain with a high of 77.And sunny Sunday will be our saving grace, with clear skies and a high of 86.SaturdaySundayIn 1982, a New Yorker harvested a two-acre field of golden wheat on a landfill off Wall Street \u2014 the World Trade Center poking out from behind the blades \u2014 over what is now Battery Park City.An unusual sight in a city of skyscrapers.The project by Agnes Denes, called \u201cWheatfield \u2014 A Confrontation,\u201d became one of the most significant artworks in New York history.Decades later, she reappeared in our city with \u201cThe Living Pyramid,\u201d a grassy ziggurat at Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens.But it\u2019s not until now, at 87, that Ms. Denes is about to have her first solo show at a major New York institution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moscow Theater Rebels, Husband and Wife, Are Dead", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 In the early 2000s, Mikhail Ugarov and Elena Gremina, playwrights who were husband and wife, were lamenting that Russian theater had grown ossified and distant from society\u2019s problems a decade after the fall of the Soviet empire.Then, sparked by an encounter with the Royal Court Theater of London, they set about trying to change that.As part of a cultural exchange with the Londoners, they learned about documentary theater \u2014 the use of interviews, oral history and journalistic sources to create works for the stage. Ms. Gremina and Mr. Ugarov embraced the technique, brought it to Moscow and in 2002 established Teatr.doc, a theater company that presented shockingly raw accounts of life in post-Soviet Russia.\u201cIf you go to a regular theater, you won\u2019t even guess that there are rich and poor in the country, that people are in some kind of crisis, that the birthrate is falling, that we are at war,\u201d Ms. Gremina told Radio Liberty in 2005.The theater became an outsize force on the Russian dramatic scene, and Mr. Ugarov and Ms. Gremina, who were known for their warmth, became the center of a new wave of playwrights and actors committed to protest theater.The works they wrote, nurtured, directed and presented increasingly became powerful critiques of Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government, attracting official harassment, suppression and repeated closings.Young playwrights cultivated by the couple created \u201ctales of homeless people, criminals, unwed mothers in prison, factory workers and the like,\u201d he wrote, conveyed in authentic, often verbatim language that jarred conservative theatergoers.Mr. Ugarov and Ms. Gremina, who had lived and worked together since the tail end of the Soviet era, died within weeks of each other in Moscow this spring.Mr. Ugarov died of heart disease on April 1 at 62, and Ms. Gremina died of kidney failure on May 16 at 61. Mr. Ugarov\u2019s son Ivan confirmed the deaths.Mr. Ugarov served as the artistic director of Teatr.doc and Ms. Gremina as managing director. The theater, which had no more than 100 seats, was housed in a basement on a lane in central Moscow, where audiences crammed in to experience raw performances and often engaged in discussion sessions afterward.Some of the plays traveled abroad, building an international audience. Productions were mounted at festivals in Poland, France and Germany.The city evicted the theater shortly after, despite a campaign supported by international figures, including the playwright Tom Stoppard. Ms. Gremina and Mr. Ugarov soldiered on; they reopened in a small run-down wing of an old mansion in another neighborhood several months later, only to be evicted again in 2015.As part of the harassment campaign, prosecutors called Ms. Gremina in for questioning, and undercover investigators from the F.S.B., the successor agency to the K.G.B., were audience regulars.\u201cOur authorities are creating a situation in which we are compelled to engage in protest art, thereby giving new life to the theater, endowing it with new meaning,\u201d Mr. Ugarov told Business Online, a news site in Kazan, in southwest Russia.Ms. Gremina scoffed at the harassment. \u201cI really don\u2019t give a damn,\u201d she said in a Facebook post in 2015.Mr. Ugarov and Ms. Gremina died as Teatr.doc was about to be evicted once again.Teatr.doc made speaking out its mission. It \u201cstarted filling in the information gaps in society, talking about those things that no one else was talking about,\u201d said Mikhail Durnenkov, a playwright who is closely associated with the theater.Mr. Browder, who was once the largest foreign investor in the Russian stock market, ran afoul of Mr. Putin in 2005 and was kicked out of Russia. He was convicted of tax fraud by a Russian court in absentia and sentenced to nine years in prison.Teatr.doc has continually lacked for adequate funding.\u201cGremina said poverty is also censorship,\u201d Zarema Zaudinova, a former student of Mr. Ugarov\u2019s who is now running the theater, said. \u201cWe want to have workshops, to bring authors from the regions, to send ours out on residencies in order to develop. But this is impossible because all of us have to have other jobs in order to earn money to live on.\u201dMs. Gremina\u2019s sideline was writing scripts for mass-market television series, including \u201cAdjutants of Love,\u201d a historical drama about czarist Russia. Her income helped finance the theater.The City of Moscow did offer financial help, but the theater refused to accept state money.Mikhail Yurievich Ugarov was born on Jan. 23, 1956, in Arkhangelsk, in northern Russia, where his father, Yuri, was a well-known teacher of theater studies. In the 1970s, Mr. Ugarov worked as an actor and playwright in the western city of Kirov. He moved to Moscow after meeting Ms. Gremina.She asserted her independence and created her own last name, Gremina, by combining her father\u2019s last name with that of her mother, Galina Mindadze, a literary translator. Ms. Gremina\u2019s brother, Alexander Mindadze, became a successful screenwriter and survives her.Besides Ivan, Mr. Ugarov\u2019s son from a previous marriage, the couple are also survived by a son, Alexander Rodionov, from a previous marriage of Ms. Gremina\u2019s, and three grandchildren. Mr. Ugarov is also survived by a brother, Aleksei.As time went on, the couple despaired of events in Russia. In a Facebook post in September 2017, Mr. Ugarov expressed frustration at the production of \u201cnice and pretty plays\u201d despite the grim reality that theater directors \u201care in prison for nothing, that the country is at war, that torture has become the norm, and Orthodox extremism is at hand.\u201dWith the couple\u2019s death, Teatr.doc\u2019s supporters are grappling with the future, said Mr. Durnenkov, the playwright. The theater, he said, \u201cis a space of freedom that we can\u2019t lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So is the possibility that we might win the World Cup.Ms. Gold is a British journalist.PENZANCE, Cornwall \u2014 England plays Belgium in the World Cup on Thursday while Prime Minister Theresa May is in Brussels, for Brexit negotiations. I know which I\u2019ll be watching: football, because nationalism is more fun with balls.I know that nationalism can begin with sports \u2014 I watch children in their white England football shirts adorned with the three lions, those symbols of English kings, awaken to it \u2014 but it does not end there. In 2012, when the Olympic Games were held in London, some people said the Games would usher in a new age of prosperity and unity. It didn\u2019t happen. The opposite happened and fear of the other, of immigrants, blew us out of the union that had kept us safe for 45 years. Now our nationalism is resurgent, and our football team is in Russia, the country that perhaps benefits most from the collapse of the European Union.When our delusion is exposed, we drink in that peculiarly savage way that led to English clubs being banned from playing in Europe from 1985 to 1990 after a riot at Heysel Stadium in Brussels, in which 39 people died and more than 350 were injured. Nationalism and violence are natural bedfellows, and they won\u2019t be kept apart for long.On Sunday I watched England play Panama from a pub here in Cornwall, on the far southwest tip of England. This is deepest Brexit land: poor, angered by European Union fishing quotas, remote and in decline. Cornish people like to pretend they aren\u2019t English and that their taxes go to Westminster because of a bureaucratic error that has yet to be fixed.But they were English that day. England winning by a preposterous 6-1 did it easily. As the score mounted they sang a song about the planned Nazi invasion of Britain in 1940. Neither they nor their parents were alive in 1940, but still they sang, of the Royal Air Force:We were lucky in 1940, when the R.A.F. held the skies, and Hitler canceled the invasion, as though it were a dinner reservation he no longer wished to keep.Is our deliverance miraculous, or assured? It depends on whether you voted for Brexit. I think luck, but I am a pessimist. Some Brexiteers like to say that the historically Euroskeptic nations in Europe \u2014 England and Denmark \u2014 are the ones that, post two world wars, have the least to be ashamed of. Assured, then. Certainly you cannot construct a coherent argument against destiny.I am afraid that if we do well in the World Cup we will believe we can \u201cwin\u201d Brexit, which is hurtling toward us as fast as a football, and we still don\u2019t really have a team. The comedown will be swift and pitiless. But who will care about that when we are in the last 16 and England is covered in bunting? Hope is a drug, and so is football, but neither will help Mrs. May in Brussels. Perhaps she will sing: \u201cTwo world wars and one World Cup, doo-dah, doo-dah\u201d at the European Union delegation. Because Belgium, you may recall, collapsed in May 1940, in 18 days.If you are hoping for a more sophisticated or modern strategy, we have nothing.Advertisement"}

Everything.SydneyBy Daniela D\u2019Angelo One day during my summer holidays in Sydney, my friend Becky came over to play. I wasn\u2019t normally allowed to have friends over, I had plenty of cousins who lived on my street and they were it. As a first-generation Italian-Australian girl, I had very strict parents, so when my mother let me have a play date, I was elated!That morning I woke up super early and made my bed, I placed my Barbies in a row and put on my favorite pink T-shirt. I had Coco Pops, I loved Coco Pops \u2014 it was \u201cnaughty\u201d food. You see, my parents made everything from scratch. Almost everything came out of our garden and we ate from head to tail, so Coco Pops were a rare treat.It was midmorning and it was about to get hot. My parents set up the blowup kiddie pool and my mother thought it would be nice for Becky and me to fill it. It was time! I ran down to the bus stop. Becky was early; she was waiting with her luminous pink bicycle. I couldn\u2019t believe she was allowed to catch the bus with her bike. As we walked back to my house she commented on how big it was and I felt proud, but it didn\u2019t occur to me that I was leading Becky into an alternate Australian universe, one not usually reserved for a blond kid from the eastern suburbs with a satin bow in her hair.My super-affectionate aunty appeared at the front door with the slightly bloody, stuffed and oiled rabbits on a platter ready to go in the pizza oven for a long, slow roast. I really should have known then, when my aunt pinched both our cheeks and Becky went white, that she was not O.K. with knowing where her food came from.We walked into the backyard. My parents were in the garage; they had rigged a makeshift wooden beam and were in the process of removing the heads from the carcasses of two small, wild pigs my father had caught, the smell of burned pig hair still lingering.Becky let out a strange, muffled sound that stopped everyone in their tracks, her bike dropped to the ground and she threw up all over it. As my father hosed Becky\u2019s breakfast from her bike, she broke down crying, saying that she wanted to go home, and I knew there would be no more play dates. I was so sad she didn\u2019t get to try the rabbit.I think of Becky often and wonder if she maybe became an animal rights activist. I, on the other hand, became a foodie.Advertisement"}

Only his skeletal legs and lower torso protruded from beneath the 600-pound block.The team had already determined that the man, thought to be around 35 years old, had a physical defect that caused him to limp. It\u2019s possible the disability slowed him down, making him more vulnerable to the incoming noxious gas and ash. He was one of about 2,000 known victims from the eruption. Most of the people were either flash-heated to death from the pyroclastic flow or died from asphyxiation.They also found that the man had a small sack with an iron key, about 20 silver coins and two bronze coins. The team is not sure when the block fell over the body. One hypothesis is that the man was in or near a building during the eruption when he suffocated and died. The walls \u2014 and the large stone block \u2014 may have collapsed at the same time or later and fallen over the deceased body. Though the skull has some fractures on it, Dr. Osanna said that he and his team plan on analyzing it for DNA in hopes of learning more about the man\u2019s ancient past before his fretful final moments.Advertisement"}

I was mesmerized by the atmosphere cultivated in gay bars. I loved the celebration of gender fluidity and how some of the people saw gender norms as rough guidelines instead of inherent rules. That\u2019s when I met David and Tanner, who both performed in drag. I was interested in exploring stories within the transgender community and wanted to work with Tanner, but it wasn\u2019t yet the right time. Three years later, in August 2016, Tanner announced on Facebook that he and David were expecting a child, and that he, Tanner, would be giving birth to that child. \u201cNo this is not a joke,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am still a man and I will be the best FATHER I can be for my child.\u201d The bravery of Tanner\u2019s announcement really moved me, and I knew then that I wanted to tell this chapter of his story. I reached out with my congratulations \u2014 a few texts and calls. No reply. Finally, I left a three-minute voice mail as a last-ditch effort. He texted me back right away and told me he was on board.From the beginning Tanner, David and I had a lot of conversations about what publishing their story would mean for them. If they let me into their lives, they would be exposing themselves to the world. They chose to let me document their lives anyway, in the belief that sharing their story would help to educate others.Naturally, there were some hurdles along the way. I wanted to show how Tanner\u2019s body was changing with the pregnancy, but it was tough for him to let me do this, especially to expose his chest in front of me when he still had breasts. And he didn\u2019t want me to photograph him having morning sickness. Sometimes the story became too overwhelming for the couple, and we took a step back and worked through it together. It was important for me to respect their privacy.A few months later, the reporter Denise Grady and I headed to their home, where we spent hours talking with David and Tanner and playing with Paetyn. Like me, Denise immediately became protective, wanting to make sure the family wasn\u2019t exploited in any way. That was an important moment for me. I had become so close to their story that I was no longer sure others would relate to it and see their bravery. Denise did. The morning the piece was published, I was a little tense. I was thrilled the story was out in the world, but I was also filled with questions. Would people understand it? Did we do enough to protect them? Most importantly, what would David and Tanner think? It wasn\u2019t until I heard from them that day that I allowed myself to really take it all in. We spoke on the phone, cried happy tears and reflected on the time we spent together. I hope one day Paetyn sees the story and realizes how brave her dads are and how incredible their odyssey has been. Follow Jackie Molloy on Instagram @jackiemolloy13.Advertisement"}

He is also charged with one count of attempted sexual exploitation of a minor, one count of possession of child pornography and one count of receipt and distribution of child pornography, prosecutors said this week.An email to Mr. Davis and a phone call to his lawyer were not returned Thursday. Mr. Davis, who lives in New York, is currently being held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan without bond.

{"Headline": "At Cafe Dushanbe, a Chef Stays True to His Tajik Roots", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City8 PhotosThe landlocked nations of Central Asia share many dishes, but there is one that belongs to Tajikistan alone. And Cafe Dushanbe in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, may be the only restaurant in New York that serves it.It begins with fatir, a bread of simple dough pressed and stretched, glossed with butter, rolled in on itself and squashed flat. In the oven, the layers swell, multiplying, ready to flake. Eaten on its own, the bread is a chapbook of crackly glassine sheets and thicker, chewy panels, hoarding its stores of butter without leaking a drop.But to make kurutob, the country\u2019s culinary claim to greatness, fatir is torn by hand \u2014 never touched with a knife; in Tajikistan, bread, a necessity for survival, is revered and must not be cut, set facedown on a table or dropped \u2014 it is arranged in a loose nest at the bottom of a wooden bowl.The next ingredient is kurut (from which kurutob takes its name), a profoundly salty yogurt palmed into little orbs and left in the sun to grow hard and dry. It smells ripe and ancient at once. For centuries, it was a staple of nomads herding sheep on the steppe, to be rehydrated over a campfire or softened in the mouth and chewed like gum.Here, balls of kurut are submerged in hot water until it turns milky. This is the dressing for kurutob, to be poured over the shredded fatir, followed by onions fried in poppy-seed oil, with its faint smack of almonds. Over this go juicy tomatoes and cucumber limned with vinegar and olive oil, and finally a scattering of cilantro, dill and raw jalape\u00f1os \u2014 just a few, but vital.In Dushanbe, Tajikistan\u2019s capital, kurutob is often eaten with the fingers while sitting on thin mattresses around a tablecloth spread on the floor. In Brooklyn, with the scent of saltwater coming across the boardwalk half a block away, there are tables and cutlery. But the spirit of the restaurant is still elsewhere, with pale sheets draped over the ceiling and peaked niches in the walls, painted with the ghostly backdrop of a minaret against a blue sky, as if they were windows.The rest of the menu recalls other Silk Road and Russian restaurants around town, but is no less thrilling for it. Samsa \u2014 meat pies in bulging triangles of puff pastry and smaller rounds with a softer wrap of dough \u2014 arrive with the meat (lamb and beef, minced fine) still succulent, their fats half-liquid and running.Great spears of shashlik come wafting smoke: lamb ribs that barely require action from the teeth; dense, minerally veal liver with a hint of bounce; and beef roulade, the meat hammered and curled around a slice of fat, so you taste first salt, then pillow and ooze.Noodles are hand-pulled and beautifully pliant in lagman, a soup so heavy, it almost qualifies as stew. Okroshka, a cooler summer soup, is made with the same yogurt as in kurut, although here the salt has subsided; crisp radish and dill lend brightness, and a quail egg, chopped, a hint of cream.Best of all is morkovcha: a seemingly ordinary heap of julienne carrots, wholly in thrall to garlic and vinegar, with a dusky, snaking trail of cumin. It\u2019s a distant heir to Korean kimchi, evolved from the traditions of Korean settlers in the Russian Far East who were deported to Central Asia under Stalin. The version here is more earthy than sweet, heat subordinate to musk, and has a voluptuousness of flavor I haven\u2019t found elsewhere.Alidzhon Imamov, the chef and a native of Tajikistan, opened the restaurant in 2013 under the name Cafe Rokhat. (He changed it to Cafe Dushanbe after buying out his business partner in 2015.) He now also runs two takeout counters in the neighborhood, specializing in Russian and Central Asian staples, along with the recently opened Heaven on the Bay around the corner on Emmons Avenue, where the menu lists beef Stroganoff alongside oysters Rockefeller and Japanese yakitori.At Cafe Dushanbe, Mr. Imamov stays true to his roots except in the desserts \u2014 the likes of apple strudel, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and coconut cheesecake \u2014 which come striped in chocolate sauce. Order the doughnuts, and they prove to be Russian ponchiki, fistfuls of fried dough piped with caramel inside, whose kin (bomboloni, sufganiyot, Berliners) appear in various forms around the world. They\u2019re a surprise and a delight, and a reminder that pleasure rarely observes borders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Aligot\u00e9 Defense Rests", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolWe believe in the virtues of an open mind here at Wine School. Yet we would be less than honest if we did not concede our own struggles with practicing what we preach.Certain styles have proved difficult for me to appreciate with meals. Big, fruity reds, for example, that are high in alcohol and give the impression of sweetness, tend to overpower most foods. They are better for people who enjoy wine as a cocktail than for those seeking an agreeable partner at the table.I don\u2019t apologize for that. I will acknowledge that I ought to revisit certain wines that have not spoken to me in the past. Rather than write off, say, amarone and zinfandel entirely, I may find that some examples are not quite so domineering. Depending on the producer\u2019s intent, some of these wines may be made in a style more appealing to me.Still, many people \u2014 once they have decided to forsake a certain type of wine \u2014 refuse to go back. I never argue the specifics of taste. What you enjoy and what you abhor are entirely up to you.But at Wine School, we believe relentless curiosity is awarded. You will find more styles to embrace, and more flavors that convey wine\u2019s vast wonders and complexity.If your experience is limited to a bad example, that may skew your entire outlook. Good examples may open your mind.Several readers chose to respond to the subject of aligot\u00e9 apparently without drinking any of these wines.Those statements have an element of truth to them. Visit any supermarket in France and you will find cheap aligot\u00e9, just as you will find relatively inexpensive grand cru Burgundy. These are wines that are badly made from grapes grown with more regard for quantity than quality. These are the conventional wines that gave us the conventional wisdom.Are many other white grapes better than aligot\u00e9? That\u2019s a loaded question. It\u2019s a lingering 19th-century habit to think of grapes and wines in hierarchical terms, to separate the so-called \u201cnoble\u201d grapes from those that, by contrast, must be commoners.It\u2019s far more productive to think both in terms of potential and of occasion. The potential of grapes like chardonnay, chenin blanc and riesling has been deeply explored, and we can conclude that these are superb grapes that can make some of the most sublime wines in the world, as well as great everyday bottles. And still so much more remains to be learned about them.What about grapes like aligot\u00e9? Do we know how good it can be if they were planted in the best sites rather than in what remained after the best sites are used for chardonnay? If they were farmed and vinified with the same care given to chardonnay, might they cost a little more than those cheap bottles in the supermarket racks?But what if most aligot\u00e9 simply made pleasing everyday whites. Is that a bad thing? Sometimes, that is exactly the wine you want, and on those occasions none are better.Not surprisingly, the best growers and producers in Burgundy seem to make the best aligot\u00e9s. They respect its history in Burgundy, and even if they may have varying opinions of its potential, they make exceptional wines that reflect the esteem they have for it.The three wines I selected were all different vintages, which added an extra variable. The \u201916 Pernot was penetrating and incisive, with a deep, rich aroma and flavors of herbs and tart citrus. The \u201915 Lafarge was rounder and saline, though without the energy of the Pernot, while the \u201914 De Villaine Bouzeron was rich, full and lip-smacking, with both energy and salinity.All three of the wines had a depth of texture that seemed to unfold in the mouth, always a characteristic of good aligot\u00e9.Two of the bottles carried the appellation Bourgogne Aligot\u00e9, a reminder that the Burgundians themselves have deemed aligot\u00e9 unworthy of carrying a more specific designation of place. The two exceptions to that are the expensive Ponsot, which is called a Morey-St.-Denis premier cru, and aligot\u00e9s from Bouzeron, a village in the C\u00f4te Chalonnaise.\u201cIt\u2019s the only place where the vignerons didn\u2019t hear the siren call of chardonnay,\u201d Pierre de Benoist, who runs the De Villaine estate, told me when I visited him last year.\u201cI found a richer, rounder wine that, yes, had the bright acidity but even more whose minerality and energy was the loudest,\u201d she wrote. I will have to seek that out.Amid the social media chatter regarding aligot\u00e9, I discovered a new criticism of it: This unfashionable grape is now being disparaged as trendy. As a result, the criticism goes, it is no longer inexpensive, which apparently was its sole virtue.So has aligot\u00e9 now joined Sicily, the Jura, gr\u00fcner veltliner and other regions and wines that can be dismissed for becoming more popular?One more reason to keep an open mind and decide for yourself.Advertisement"}

His intent was to cause harm.\u201dA bail hearing for Mr. Ramos was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Friday in Annapolis, according to Maryland court records, which did not list a lawyer for him but said Mr. Ramos was eligible to be represented by a public defender.The chilling attack was covered in real time by some of the journalists who found themselves under siege. A message saying \u201cplease help us\u201d with the address of the office building was tweeted from the account of Anthony Messenger, a summer intern. A crime reporter, Phil Davis, described how the gunman \u201cshot through the glass door to the office\u201d before opening fire on employees.For a country that has grown numb to mass shootings, this was a new front. Schools have become a frequent target, with college students on down to kindergartners falling victim. A movie theater was shot up. Churches, too. But this was a rare attack on a news organization, one of the oldest in America, which dates its roots back to the 1700s and boasts on its website that it once fought the stamp tax that helped give rise to the American Revolution.The gunman was silent as he stalked the newsroom, stopping once to reload as journalists huddled in fear under their desks, Mr. Davis said in a telephone interview. Once the police arrived, staff members put their hands in the air and shouted, \u201cWe\u2019re not him,\u201d Mr. Davis recalled. The gunman was hiding under a desk as the police moved in. He did not exchange gunfire with officers when he was taken in.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have enough bullets for us,\u201d Mr. Davis said, struggling to grapple with the images of his fallen colleagues. \u201cIt was terrifying to know he didn\u2019t have enough bullets to kill everyone in that office, and had to get more.\u201dAfter his arrest, Mr. Ramos refused to cooperate with the authorities or provide his name. He was identified using facial recognition technology, said a law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak on the record.In July 2012, Mr. Ramos filed a defamation lawsuit in Maryland\u2019s Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court against Capital Gazette Communications, its then editor and publisher and a former reporter, claiming that his reputation had been damaged after the newspaper published a story the prior year about Mr. Ramos\u2019s guilty plea in a harassment case. Three months later, he filed a fuller complaint alleging invasion of privacy.The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice by Judge Maureen M. Lamasney after a March 2013 hearing, in which she asked Mr. Ramos to identify anything that was falsely reported in the July 2011 article and to cite examples about how he had been harmed. He was unable to do so, according to a partial transcript of the hearing published in an appellate court decision two years later.Mr. Ramos represented himself and, according to the appellate decision that later affirmed the dismissal, showed no understanding of defamation law.The article was published in July 2011 with the headline \u201cJarrod Wants to Be Your Friend,\u201d and detailed a harassment charge against Mr. Ramos. According to the article, Mr. Ramos sent a friend request on Facebook to a former high school classmate and over the course of several months, he \u201calternately asked for help, called her vulgar names and told her to kill herself.\u201dThe harassment continued for nearly a year. He pleaded guilty in July 2011 to harassment and was sentenced to 18 months of supervised probation and ordered to attend counseling.According to the article, Mr. Ramos had no prior criminal history. He had a degree in computer engineering and at the time had worked for six years for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.Thursday\u2019s shooting prompted law enforcement officials throughout the country to protect media organizations. As the day proceeded, however, investigators were looking into whether the attack was an isolated grudge.\u201cJarrod Ramos has a long history of being angry and taking action against The Capital newspaper,\u201d said Tom Marquardt, a former executive editor and publisher at The Capital. \u201cI said at one time to my attorneys that this was a guy that was going to come and shoot us. I was concerned on my behalf and on behalf of my staff that he was going to take more than legal action.\u201dLate Thursday night, the dead were identified as Gerald Fischman, 61, the newsroom\u2019s editorial page editor; Rob Hiaasen, 59, an editor and features columnist; John McNamara, 56, a sports reporter and editor for the local weekly papers; Wendi Winters, 65, a local news reporter and community columnist; and Rebecca Smith, a sales assistant.In a telephone interview on Thursday, the writer Carl Hiaasen confirmed that his brother, Rob, had been one of those killed in the newsroom.Carl Hiaasen \u2014 a longtime columnist for The Miami Herald \u2014 said that he had no information about what had transpired, but that his family was \u201cdevastated beyond words.\u201d\u201cHe was dedicated to journalism. He spent his whole life as a journalist,\u201d he said.Past and present employees of the newspaper chain were struggling to understand what could have prompted such an attack.The New York Police Department said its decision to deploy officers to news organizations was not based on any specific threat, \u201cbut rather out of an abundance of caution until we learn more about the suspect and motives behind the Maryland shooting.\u201d The department described such deployments as \u201ca standard practice to shift resources strategically during active shooter or terrorist events.\u201dThe Capital Gazette has a long history. The Capital, founded as an afternoon paper in 1884, is \u201cthe ultimate local newspaper,\u201d said Steve Gunn, a former editor. It merged with The Gazette, which has an even older pedigree.Owned by a local family until 1968, the paper underwent a period of expansion after being purchased by Philip Merrill, a former American diplomat and NATO official, who served as its publisher until his death by suicide in 2006.Mr. Merrill pushed national news off the front page, instead building the paper into a local force. City council meetings and features on local heroes were staples. But it also strove to hold local institutions accountable, winning national attention in 1991 for a series of stories on hazing and sexual harassment at the Naval Academy.The paper was a training ground for reporters who had little experience \u2014 or zero experience, but a lot of attitude, Mr. Marquardt said. Many went on to work at larger news organizations, including The New York Times.At its height, the company employed some 250 people and operated its own printing press, Mr. Marquardt said. In more recent years, the news staff has shrunk. A staff member said on Twitter on Thursday afternoon that it now stands at about 20, with a few more on the advertising staff.\u201cEveryone left there stuck to their profession because they loved what they did,\u201d Mr. Marquardt said. \u201cTo die like this is a tragedy that you can\u2019t fathom.\u201dAfter it was purchased by the Baltimore Sun Media Group in 2014, the company moved to an office building, across from a local mall, which was the site of Thursday\u2019s shooting.Shortly before 6 p.m., at least three helicopters were still circling, and lines of silent police cars, with lights flashing, blocked off the main roads leading up to the newsroom at 888 Bestgate Road. Yellow police tape flapped in the wind, keeping people and journalists away from the area.Even as the authorities continued to pore over the newsroom for clues, the Capital Gazette announced Thursday that it would be publishing an edition on Friday.Shortly after 9 p.m., several tired reporters and a photographer from the Capital Gazette were filing stories and photographs from their laptops, set up in the back of a silver pickup truck in the parking lot of the Westfield Annapolis Mall, across the street from their newsroom.E. B. Furgurson III, a reporter, stood in a blue shirt and khaki pants with his colleagues. He had decided to go get lunch around the time the shooting happened, so he was not in the building at the time.When asked if they were putting out a paper on Friday, he said fiercely: \u201cHell, yes.\u201dHis colleague Joshua McKerrow, a photographer, said he was going to pick his daughter up for her birthday when he was called about the shooting. He rushed back. He had a hard time finishing sentences.\u201cOur newspaper is one of the oldest newspapers in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real newspaper and like every newspaper, it is a family.\u201d He began to cry. Then he added:\u201cWe will be here tomorrow. We are not going anywhere.\u201dSabrina Tavernise reported from Annapolis, Md., and Amy Harmon and Maya Salam from New York.

{"Headline": "Whole-Grain Pancakes to Make Any Morning Special", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA good appetiteHearty and nutritious, but still buttery and rich, these unfussy pancakes come together quickly and without any special equipment.When my mother made pancakes, you knew it was a special occasion. My pancakes aren\u2019t anything like hers. For one thing, mine are easy, stirred by hand, with no stand mixer required. I don\u2019t even need a whisk. A fork can get the job done, so I can make them anytime \u2014 not just on birthdays, but on lazy Sundays in that rustic summer rental, or whenever I get the craving for their crisp edges and a hearty side of bacon.If you want to embellish these, the best way to incorporate fruit \u2014 or chocolate chips, if you\u2019re feeding small children (or sweet-toothed adults) \u2014 is to add it to the cakes while they\u2019re cooking rather than mixing them into the batter. You\u2019ll want to drop the batter onto a hot pan, and let it cook for a few minutes to let the undersides firm up. When tiny bubbles appear on the pancakes\u2019 surface, and just before you flip them, sprinkle on the fruit or chocolate chips. This keeps things tidy and lets you distribute the add-ons evenly. It also offers an opportunity to make chocolate chips into a happy face, should you want to amuse those sweet-toothed adults.The batter itself is also adaptable. Feel free to adjust the ratio of the flours, or substitute some rye or buckwheat flour for all or part of the whole-wheat. I\u2019ve also made these with coconut milk and coconut oil in place of the buttermilk and butter for the dairy averse in my life, and they\u2019ve come out great. This is a pancake recipe that\u2019s reliably tasty, easy and forgiving \u2014 exactly what you need on any given Sunday morning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Move Over, China: U.S. Is Again Home to World\u2019s Speediest Supercomputer", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States just won bragging rights in the race to build the world\u2019s speediest supercomputer.For five years, China had the world\u2019s fastest computer, a symbolic achievement for a country trying to show that it is a tech powerhouse. But the United States retook the lead thanks to a machine, called Summit, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.Summit\u2019s speeds, announced on Friday, boggle the mind. It can do mathematical calculations at the rate of 200 quadrillion per second, or 200 petaflops. To put in human terms: A person doing one calculation a second would have to live for more than 6.3 billion years to match what the machine can do in a second.Still stupefying? Here is another analogy. If a stadium built for 100,000 people was full, and everyone in it had a modern laptop, it would take 20 stadiums to match the computing firepower of Summit.China still has the world\u2019s most supercomputers over all. And China, Japan and Europe are developing machines that are even faster, which could mean the American lead is short-lived.Supercomputers like Summit, which cost $200 million in government money to build, can accelerate the development of technologies at the frontier of computing, like artificial intelligence and the ability to handle vast amounts of data.Those skills can be used to help tackle daunting challenges in science, industry and national security \u2014 and are at the heart of an escalating rivalry between the United States and China over technology.Supercomputers now perform tasks that include simulating nuclear tests, predicting climate trends, finding oil deposits and cracking encryption codes. Scientists say that further gains and fresh discoveries in fields like medicine, new materials and energy technology will rely on the approach that Summit embodies.\u201cThese are big data and artificial intelligence machines,\u201d said John E. Kelly, who oversees IBM Research, which helped build Summit. \u201cThat\u2019s where the future lies.\u201dAt 200 petaflops, the new machine achieves more than twice the speed of the leading supercomputer in November, when the last Top 500 list was published. That machine is at China\u2019s National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi.Summit is made up of rows of black, refrigerator-size units that weigh a total of 340 tons and are housed in a 9,250 square-foot room. It is powered by 9,216 central processing chips from IBM and 27,648 graphics processors from Nvidia, another American tech company, that are lashed together with 185 miles of fiber-optic cable.Cooling Summit requires 4,000 gallons of water a minute, and the supercomputer consumes enough electricity to light up 8,100 American homes.The global supercomputer sprint comes as internet giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google in the United States and Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in China take the lead in developing technologies like cloud computing and facial recognition.Supercomputers are a measure of a nation\u2019s technological prowess. It is a narrow measure, of course, because raw speed is only one ingredient in computing performance. Software, which bring the machines to life, is another.Scientists at the government labs like Oak Ridge are doing exploratory research in areas like new materials to make roads more robust, designs for energy storage that might apply to electric cars or energy grids, and potential power sources like harnessing fusion. All of those areas can benefit from supercomputing.Modeling the climate, for example, can require running code on a supercomputer for days, processing huge amounts of scientific data like moisture and wind patterns, and modeling all the real-world physics of the environment. It is not the sort of task that can run efficiently on the cloud computing services supplied by internet companies, said Ian Buck, a computer scientist and general manager of Nvidia\u2019s data center business.\u201cIndustry is great, and we work with them all the time,\u201d said Rick Stevens, an associate director of the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. \u201cBut Google is never going to design new materials or design a safe nuclear reactor.\u201dAt Oak Ridge, Thomas Zacharia, the lab director, cites a large health research project as an example of the future of supercomputing. Summit has begun ingesting and processing data generated by the Million Veteran Program, which enlists volunteers to give researchers access to all of their health records, contribute blood tests for genetic analysis, and answer survey questions about their lifestyles and habits. To date, 675,000 veterans have joined; the goal is to reach one million by 2021.The eventual insights, Mr. Zacharia said, could \u201chelp us find new ways to treat our veterans and contribute to the whole area of precision medicine.\u201dDr. J. Michael Gaziano, a principal investigator on the Million Veteran Program and a professor at the Harvard Medical School, said that the potential benefit might well be a modern, supercharged version of the Framingham Heart Study. That project, begun in 1948, tracked about 5,000 people in a Massachusetts town.Over a couple of decades, the Framingham study found that heart disease \u2014 far from previous single-cause explanations of disease \u2014 had multiple, contributing causes including blood cholesterol, diet, exercise and smoking.Today, given the flood of digital health data and supercomputers, Dr. Gaziano said that population science might be entering a new golden age.\u201cWe have all this big, messy data to create a new field \u2014 rethinking how we think about diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time.\u201dAlthough impressive, Summit can be seen as a placeholder. Supercomputers that are five times faster \u2014 1,000 petaflops, or an exaflop \u2014 are in the works, both abroad and in the United States. The Energy Department\u2019s budget for its advanced computing program is being increased by 39 percent in the two fiscal years ending September 2019, said Paul M. Dabbar, the Energy Department\u2019s under secretary for science.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this to help drive innovation in supercomputing and beyond,\u201d Mr. Dabbar said.An earlier version of this article, using calculations by Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who tracks supercomputer speeds, misstated how long it would take a person to do the calculations that the Summit supercomputer could do in one second. It would take 6.3 billion years, not 63 billion years. The error was repeated in the headline and in a mobile news alert. The article also misspelled the surname of the Energy Department\u2019s under secretary for science. He is Paul Dabbar, not Dabarr.Advertisement"}
