{"Headline": "Your Wi-Fi Security Is Probably Weak. Here\u2019s How to Fix That.", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixAfter all, when we think about wireless connectivity in our homes, most of us generally care more about speed of data transmissions and how much range the router can cover.But it\u2019s time to change our views. Network security needs to be high on our list of considerations because a Wi-Fi station is the gateway for devices to get on the internet. If your router is infected with malicious software, all your internet-connected devices become vulnerable, including your smartphone, computer, smart watch, television and Amazon Echo.That means base stations from every well-known router brand were a target for this malware, known as VPNFilter, which is capable of manipulating your web traffic. Attackers could use it to load a fake banking site on your computer browser that looks like the one you normally use and steal your credentials and clean out your bank accounts. They could also load spoof versions of an email site you use to steal your password and gain access to your communications.\u201cMost consumers don\u2019t know to patch these things,\u201d said Matt Watchinski, a senior director of Cisco Talos, who helped research the VPNFilter malware. \u201cThey don\u2019t treat it like they do their air-conditioner or refrigerator, where we all know we should change the filters.\u201dHere\u2019s a guide to some of the best practices you can embrace to ensure that your router \u2014 and, by extension, all your internet gadgets \u2014 is safe.Even though a router lacks moving parts, it needs to be maintained with the latest security updates. Easier said than done, right? Here is a basic step-by-step for how to do that:\u25a0 Consult the instruction manual for your router to get its IP address, a string of numbers that you will punch into a web browser for access to the router\u2019s web dashboard. Jot down the number and store it somewhere safe like your filing cabinet.\u25a0 After entering the router\u2019s IP address into a web browser, log in to the base station with your username and password. In the router\u2019s web dashboard, click on the firmware settings. Look for a button that lets you check for the latest firmware version.\u25a0 If an update is available, choose to install it and let the router restart. Repeat this process every three to six months.\u25a0 If you use a router provided by a broadband provider like Comcast or Verizon, call the customer service department and ask whether your equipment has been updated with the latest firmware.When you log in to your router, if your username and password are something like \u201cadmin\u201d and \u201cpassword,\u201d you have a problem. Many Wi-Fi stations come with weak, generic passwords by default that manufacturers intend for you to change.The problem with having a weak username and password is that anybody within range of your router could log in to it and change its settings, potentially opening it up to the outside world, said Dave Fraser, chief executive of Devicescape, a company that helps make public Wi-Fi networks more reliable for mobile phone service.So while you are checking for firmware updates in your router\u2019s web dashboard, make sure to also check your security settings and change the username and password to something strong and unique. Security experts recommend creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases and added numbers and special characters. (Examples: My fav0rite numb3r is Gr33n4782# or The cat ate the C0TT0n candy 224%.) Write down these credentials on the same piece of paper where you recorded your IP address.Even if your router still appears to work properly, the device has reached the end of its life when manufacturers stop supporting it with firmware updates, leaving it vulnerable to future cyberthreats. You can expect this to happen every three to five years. At that point, it is crucial to upgrade to a new piece of hardware.The best way to check is to look up your router on the manufacturer\u2019s website and read notes about its firmware releases. If there hasn\u2019t been a firmware update in the last year, the router has probably been discontinued.Among the routers affected by the VPNFilter malware, a significant portion of them were more than five years old, said Cisco\u2019s Mr. Watchinski.How did we get here in the first place? Historically, manufacturers have designed routers by cobbling together open-source software platforms with commodity components to produce base stations as cheaply as possible \u2014 with little care for long-term security, Mr. Fraser said.\u201cIt is a miserable situation, and it has been from day one,\u201d he said. But Mr. Fraser added that there were now \u201cnew world\u201d routers with operating systems, tougher security and thoughtful features to make network management easy.The caveat is that smarter Wi-Fi systems tend to cost more than cheap routers that people are accustomed to. Eero\u2019s base stations start at $199, and a Google Wifi station costs $119, compared with $50 for a cheap router. For both of these systems, you can also add base stations throughout the home to extend their wireless connections, creating a so-called mesh network.Another bonus? Mr. Fraser noted that more modern Wi-Fi systems should have longer life spans because the companies sometimes relied on different revenue streams, like selling subscriptions to network security services.Advertisement"}

We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.\u201dAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington. And some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., publicly promoted its work with ICE in January in a blog post, citing it as an example of the success of its technology.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d Mr. Nadella said at Microsoft\u2019s developer conference last month.Yet criticism of Microsoft\u2019s work with ICE began to grow. One Microsoft engineer, Larry Osterman, tweeted on Monday to ask how working with ICE matched with the company\u2019s \u201cethical stances.\u201dBut for many Microsoft employees, that was not satisfactory. A group of about a dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter, in which they said the company\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not go far enough.\u201dThe employees continued, \u201cWe are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy.\u201dThe letter added that Microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ICE but be open to a review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally, and that it should create a policy stating it would not work with those \u201cwho violate international human rights law.\u201dMicrosoft declined to comment on the employee letter, which was posted internally on Tuesday afternoon. Within hours, it had received more than 100 signatures.It was only later that the messages from Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith decrying the immigration policy were released. \u201cWe will always stand for immigration policies that preserve every person\u2019s dignity and human rights,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Baseball Binge With Small-Town Charm", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "Every spring for the last 60 years, Grand Junction, Colo., has embraced the junior college Division I World Series. Supported byGRAND JUNCTION, Colo. \u2014 The baseball teams began arriving about 10 days ago, mostly in charter buses after the beauty-pageant-of-a-drive along Interstate 70, over Vail Pass with a breathtaking view of the snow-capped Rockies, through Glenwood Canyon with cliffs up to 2,000 feet high by the roadside, past the Grand Mesa and finally into Grand Junction, a city 247 miles west of Denver along the Colorado River at its confluence with the Gunnison River.It\u2019s a hike, but a glorious one, for the junior college players who arrive at Sam Suplizio Field, home of the National Junior College Athletic Association\u2019s Division I Baseball World Series, known here simply as JUCO.\u201cI\u2019m just amazed at the beauty of this place; never seen anything like it,\u201d said Francisco Justo, a freshman pitcher from the Claremont section of the Bronx who plays for Monroe College in New Rochelle, N.Y. \u201cI had no idea about any of this. Wow.\u201dHe\u2019s not alone. Outside of Grand Junction, population 61,881, and the 171 teams in Division I junior college baseball, much of the world is unaware of this gem of a tournament, which parlays small-town charm into a big-time baseball binge.\u201cFor most of these kids, it\u2019s the experience of a lifetime,\u201d said Jeff Johnson, the longtime coach of Chipola College in Marianna, Fla., the defending champion, which had 10 players selected in the 2017 Major League Baseball draft. \u201cWe try to tell them to savor the experience, but at the same time, you don\u2019t want to get them so enamored with the surroundings they forget to play.\u201dMost teams were awed by the size of Suplizio Field: It has a seating capacity of 7,048, but can accommodate about 10,000 fans, and sometimes does. The dimensions rival those at some major league parks, with left-center field, at 410 feet, the deepest part and the left-field line, at 302 feet, the shortest.Junior college players are accustomed to playing conference games in front of family, friends and cozy groups of 100 to 200 people.\u201cThis is where they are celebrities,\u201d said Jim Davis, who has been a play-by-play radio voice for the tournament for more than 20 years. \u201cThis is a place where everybody pays attention to them, and the young fans idolize the players and are always asking for autographs.\u201dThe 10-team, 19-game, eight day tournament began May 26 with a quadruple-header that started at 9 a.m. local time. The first game, between Temple College of Texas and the College of Southern Idaho, drew a crowd of 7,218. Fourteen hours later, top-ranked Walters State closed the marathon with an 8-6 win over Chipola.This was the 61st JUCO World Series, the first of which was played in Miami, Okla., in 1958. It rained so much that hardly anyone showed up, and Grand Junction was awarded the tournament in 1959. The city\u2019s junior college at the time, Mesa College (now Division II Colorado Mesa University), was given an automatic berth that created an instant fan base.Sixty years later, the tournament is still here \u2014 and will be for a while thanks to a 25-year contract extension in 2010. It has been a showcase for dozens of players who went on to become major league stars, including Kirby Puckett, Eric Gagne, Cliff Lee, John Lackey, Bryce Harper and Brandon Belt.Kenzi Davis, who works at Canyon View Imaging and Lab at Community Hospital, is among many fans who grew up with JUCO in their blood.\u201cMy first JUCO was in utero,\u201d she said. Davis\u2019s grandparents have attended the games for more than 40 years. A few years ago, during an $8.3 million stadium renovation, the family\u2019s usual seats were ripped out \u2014 but not forgotten: \u201cThey have a piece of that bench seat sitting in their backyard,\u201d Davis said, adding that she is using vacation time from work to attend the games with family and friends.Kiwanis, Lions and Rotary clubs act as host groups for the visiting teams, throwing barbecues and cookouts and making arrangements for fishing and hiking trips to the Grand Mesa and the Colorado National Monument. Players from competing teams show up at baseball clinics and work with physically challenged children.\u201cThis is what you want junior college baseball to be like all the time, but it\u2019s nowhere close,\u201d said Johnson, the Chipola coach. \u201cIn a normal, everyday thing, no one cares about junior college. But here it\u2019s different. They care. And it shows.\u201dSam Suplizio played a vital role in creating this love affair between the city and the visiting players and coaches. He was the chairman of the tournament from 1970 to 2002. The field was renamed in his honor in 1990.An outfield prospect for the Yankees in the mid-1950s, Suplizio fractured his throwing arm while sliding into second base during a minor league game late in the 1956 season. At the time, he was under consideration by Manager Casey Stengel to be called up to the big club. The previous year, Suplizio hit .294 with 24 home runs at Binghamton in the Eastern League. Also in \u201955, a soon-to-be Yankees slugger named Roger Maris hit .292 with 19 homers at Reading in the same league.Suplizio recovered well enough to play and coach the semipro Grand Junction Eagles for 17 years. He chose to settle in Junction and became a minor league coach and scout for several M.L.B. teams.Suplizio, who died in 2006 at 74, was quite the salesman. He persuaded dozens of retired major league players and managers to come to this somewhat remote city to speak at the pretournament banquet. Among those who answered the call were the Hall of Famers Stan Musial, Duke Snider, Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, Lefty Gomez and Bob Gibson. His Yankees connections landed George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, Reggie Jackson and Whitey Ford over the years.\u201cSam knew everyone; his contacts were amazing,\u201d said Jamie Hamilton, the current tournament chairman. \u201cHe consistently reached out to the scouts, front-office people and former players, inviting them to our tournament to watch major league prospects. It worked.\u201dThe Yankees connections didn\u2019t stop with Suplizio. More recent Yankees stars like Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte are tied to this world through their time at San Jacinto, a junior college baseball dynasty that annually churns out major league prospects.The Gators are so well known around these parts, they have built a solid fan base, along with a bunch of Gators haters.\u201cWe go into stores and different restaurants, and they\u2019ll know who we are,\u201d center fielder Tyriece Silas said. \u201cI feel like they love us more than they hate us.\u201dOther teams are less familiar with these parts. Temple College is in the World Series for the third time, and would not even be here if not for a double forfeit in the regional title game.That game, between Cisco College and McLennan Community College, was suspended after a benches-clearing scuffle following a close play at the plate.Words were exchanged, a bunch of grabbing ensued, but no punches appeared to be thrown, and coaches quickly restored order. Still, the N.J.C.A.A. declared a double forfeit, citing a rule that calls for ejections and suspensions to any player or coach \u2014 other than the head coach \u2014 who leaves the bench when on-field issues occur.Temple, the third-place team, was awarded the region\u2019s spot in the World Series.\u201cAn unfortunate situation,\u201d said Temple Coach Craig McMurtry, adding that both coaches called him to wish him well in Grand Junction. \u201cIt\u2019s awkward, but we\u2019ll try to represent our district well.\u201dMonroe College earned its first trip to JUCO this year, behind a pair of unbeaten pitchers, Antonio Frias (8-0, 1.07 E.R.A.) and Justo (9-0, 2.12 E.R.A.).A team from New York had not reached Grand Junction in 19 years. The only team from New York to win the JUCO World Series was Nassau Community College of Garden City in 1966. Coach Luis Melendez has players from Cura\u00e7ao, Panama and Puerto Rico, and many are from low-income backgrounds.\u201cMany have never left New York City,\u201d said Melendez, whose team was eliminated after three games. \u201cSo just for their personal growth alone, and having the chance to share experiences with different cultures and different types of living, it helps them grow. Win or lose, what an experience.\u201dJoseph Encarnacion, who is from Corona, Queens, has been to Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. He said playing at Suplizio was better.\u201cI actually found out a few weeks ago when we started regionals and talking about Colorado,\u201d he said. \u201cI said: \u2018What\u2019s Colorado about? And how do you get there?\u2019 I looked online and said we definitely have to get there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Thai Chef Heads Home for a Challenge", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHaving made her name in San Francisco, Pim Techamuanvivit is taking charge of Nahm, a Bangkok restaurant famed for its fine dining.BANGKOK \u2014 It was close to 2 a.m., and Pim Techamuanvivit couldn\u2019t sleep. So, like a tenacious detective, she taped huge sheets of white paper to her hotel room wall and covered them in color-coded sticky notes, charting out her clues.She shuffled dish names into clusters, aiming for a variety of flavors and techniques, imagining the pace at which family-style plates would be set on the table, then cleared. She moved the notes around, again and again, writing new ones in a mixture of Thai and English.For Ms. Techamuanvivit, the high-profile job is both a chance and a challenge to express her precise vision of Thai fine dining on a world stage \u2014 the kind of opportunity that is rarely presented to Thai chefs.As Ms. Punyaratabandhu explained it, \u201clike anyone selling refined Thai food in Bangkok at a high price point, to bring in a Thai audience, she will have to prove that Nahm is performing at a certain level.\u201d But she also noted that Ms. Techamuanvivit had a distinct advantage, as a Thai chef who lives and breathes Thai cuisine, who would be making reference to dishes from her family\u2019s recipe vault. Any doubts Ms. Techamuanvivit had about the new job passed quickly. She reminded herself that her grandmother\u2019s cooking was not only the foundation of her approach, but that it charged her work with a sense of purpose.\u201cI don\u2019t own this, but I inherited this,\u201d she said of Thai cuisine. \u201cNow I\u2019m here to keep it going.\u201dOn visits to farms and markets, Ms. Techamuanvivit has connected with small growers and tracked down new ingredients to refit Nahm\u2019s pantry: heirloom rice, rare citrus, bitter leaves, handmade palm sugars, small-batch fish sauce.In her hotel suite, Ms. Techamuanvivit showed the jumble of handwritten sticky notes to Suraja Ruangnukulkit, the chef de cuisine at Nahm, and Meghan Clark, the chef de cuisine of Kin Khao, who had come to Bangkok to help with the transition.Shoes off, still in their whites from lunch service, the three women rehydrated with cold water from steel cups, and ate handfuls of sweet, airy meat floss and tiny pork-stuffed pastries from crinkly plastic bags. Together, they analyzed the menu out loud.\u201cDo we want people to have a choice right here? Or do we want to choose for them?\u201d\u201cHow quickly can we train everyone to change this around?\u201d\u201cO.K., when is the curry-paste machine getting here?\u201dNahm used to buy its curry pastes from Aylmer Aaharn, the food company founded by Mr. Thompson, the previous chef. But as part of her overhaul, Ms. Techamuanvivit wanted to make all the pastes from scratch.The machine arrived at the end of the week, ready to grind piles of aromatics between two powerful, spinning stones. Though it would make the process more efficient, it still required an investment of time and attention to detail. Ms. Techamuanvivit vividly remembers the most intricate Thai dishes from her childhood, when her extended family would gather for Sunday lunch and eat kanom jeen nam prik, lightly fermented rice noodles in a rich, gently sweet coconut sauce heightened with makrut lime and shrimp, surrounded by a bank of blanched and delicately fried vegetables, and a boiled egg with a soft, satiny yolk. It wasn\u2019t everyday fare.\u201cElaborate dishes, like kanom jeen nam prik, that\u2019s not something you make for just two or four people,\u201d she said. Back then, like many Thai families, her extended family lived together on the same compound. Their Sunday meals were special occasions marked by extraordinary, labor-intensive home cooking. Now, spread out in different homes all over the city, the family is more likely to meet at a restaurant for dim sum \u2014 though her family\u2019s version of kanom jeen nam prik is already on the new menu at Nahm.Ms. Techamuanvivit left Bangkok to attend graduate school at the University of California, San Diego, where she studied cognitive science. But unlike her three siblings, who were also educated abroad, she didn\u2019t return home after graduation.Instead she worked in Mountain View, Calif., building collaborative work tools for Netscape, and later for Cisco Systems in San Jose. As she traveled more to Europe for work \u2014 often following engineers around their network operation centers with a notebook in hand \u2014 she looked for meaningful distractions after hours. That\u2019s how Ms. Techamuanvivit found herself dining alone, in excellent French restaurants, documenting the experience course by course with a pocket-size Sony camera. In 2001, she was an early user of the Blogger platform, writing posts for her friends back in Bangkok about the tiny, crucial details of her life, like what she was watching and reading, or the things she overheard strangers say. But within two years, she shifted her blog\u2019s focus to restaurants.\u201cBut eventually I realized, I have more to say about Thai food than I do jam,\u201d she said.When she opened Kin Khao, she was still commuting between Santa Cruz and San Francisco, but after receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2015, she broke up with Mr. Kinch and moved closer to the restaurant.Later that year, she went to a big party in San Francisco celebrating her team\u2019s first Michelin star. She was only a week out of surgery, and still recovering, but she didn\u2019t want to miss out. She went in a wheelchair.Ms Techamuanvivit often talks about her brain trust of women in food: the cooks and managers who stepped up when she needed to recover and take care of herself. The family, friends and strangers who shared their food knowledge with her. One source, Nantana Chitman, came to visit Nahm on a recent Friday, bringing along the cast-iron tools required to make traditional rice crackers.\u201cWhen Westerners make coconut milk or peel peanuts, it sounds so exciting to everyone, but that\u2019s what we normally do and that\u2019s what our grandmothers did,\u201d Ms. Chitman said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to explain, but I\u2019d really like to see a Thai chef making a good name for Thai food,\u201d she added.Though the opening date isn\u2019t set, there is no debate over the name. Ms. Techamuanvivit has known for years that when she opened a Thai fine dining restaurant in San Francisco, she would call it Nari \u2014 a Thai word meaning women.Advertisement"}
