Ms. Kraninger, a graduate of Marquette University and Georgetown Law School, specialized in homeland security matters before joining Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s staff at the Office and Management and Budget in March 2017.She surmounted a key hurdle last week when a member of the National Economic Council staff, Andrew Olmem, signed off on her nomination, people close to the situation said.President Trump tapped Mr. Mulvaney to oversee the consumer bureau late last year, giving the brash former South Carolina lawmaker a mandate to dismantle the agency, which was created in the wake of the financial crisis to help protect consumers against financial company abuse.Ms. Kraninger, 43, has spent much of her career on Capitol Hill, including serving as the clerk for the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security and working with the House Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.Since his appointment, Mr. Mulvaney has tried to weaken the bureau\u2019s enforcement and investigative activities, including its policing of payday lending, student lending and consumer finance.Critics said the selection of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was a way for Mr. Mulvaney to keep his grip on the consumer agency.\u201cThis looks like nothing more than a desperate attempt by Mick Mulvaney to maintain his grip on the C.F.P.B. so he can continue undermining its important consumer protection mission on behalf of the powerful Wall Street special interests and predatory lenders that have bankrolled his career,\u201d said Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, a consumer group that has been critical of Mr. Mulvaney.One administration official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the matter, said Mr. Mulvaney had picked Ms. Kraninger because she was seen as more palatable, particularly to Democrats, than another candidate, Todd J. Zywicki, a conservative professor at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School.Ms. Kraninger\u2019s possible appointment was reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News.A call to Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s spokesman was not immediately returned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Curbs Borrowing, Growth Shows Signs of Faltering", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s government has been trying to break the country\u2019s addiction to ever-rising debt, but its effort to crack down on easy money is starting to hit growth in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.Beijing has been concerned in recent years about the increased reliance on credit to keep the economy expanding briskly, worrying that it could lead to a financial crisis, or to a long period of stagnation like the one in Japan after the real estate market burst in the early 1990s.But curbing debt may have significant consequences in China and elsewhere. Countries around the world are much more closely tied to China than ever before, because of its role not just as the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer by far but also, increasingly, as a consumer. An economic slowdown in China \u2014 coupled with the knock-on effects of widening trade disputes and slowing growth in Europe \u2014 may augur poorly for a global economy that even recently seemed in rude health.Domestically, China\u2019s credit crackdown has affected smaller businesses hardest. Though the country often appears to be dominated by its vast conglomerates and hulking state-owned enterprises, its economy is, in reality, somewhat more reliant on small businesses than its Western counterparts. And the way Beijing has gone about curbing lending in recent months is unintentionally hitting the most entrepreneurial segments of the economy, the governor of China\u2019s central bank acknowledged in a speech on Thursday in Shanghai.Over all, there is growing evidence that a credit crunch is taking a toll on the Chinese economy.The National Bureau of Statistics released data in Beijing on Thursday showing that investment, retail sales and industrial production all slowed in May. The slowdowns in investment and retail sales were particularly sharp and unexpected.With that backdrop of eroding economic growth, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, conspicuously did not match on Thursday the Federal Reserve\u2019s increase to interest rates on Wednesday. It had at least partly matched previous Federal Reserve interest rate rises since the autumn.An index of 300 large-company stocks traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped 0.4 percent on Thursday, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.9 percent on the poor economic news from the mainland.With the Chinese economy showing signs of slowing and the authorities making it harder to borrow, small businesses are particularly vulnerable. They represent about three-fifths of economic output in China, compared with around half in Germany, Japan and the United States, according to Yi Gang, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China.The downgrades were among many reasons the government has tightened some curbs on borrowing since the end of the autumn. Beijing has particularly clamped down on lending by online finance companies and other private sector businesses that bypass the state-controlled banking system.While commercial banks have continued to lend the money they hold from deposits, these conventional loans go mainly to state-owned enterprises. Private lenders, meanwhile, charge interest rates that are double or triple the 6 percent charged by banks, but they are often the only source of financing for small businesses.Despite the higher interest rates, \u201cwe should also fully affirm the significance of private loans, which are an important supplement\u201d to bank lending in the Chinese economy, said Mr. Yi, speaking at the Lujiazui Forum, a gathering in Shanghai of China\u2019s top financial regulators. The forum, held at the start of each summer, is one of the Chinese government\u2019s main channels for signaling the direction of Chinese monetary and financial policy.Even before deciding on Thursday morning not to match the Fed\u2019s rate increase, though, the Chinese government had already made a pair of moves that appear to have been elaborately crafted to channel more money to smaller, more entrepreneurial businesses.Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a Shanghai-based research group, said on the sidelines of the Lujiazui Forum that China\u2019s private-sector companies of all sizes, even large ones, had long faced challenges in obtaining loans. But the credit squeeze on them this spring has been particularly painful.\u201cIt\u2019s very bad, and we see not just small and medium-sized enterprises defaulting but even big companies defaulting,\u201d he said.Some financial regulators nevertheless appear determined to maintain the crackdown on informal lending.Speaking at the forum, Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, called for further rigor. He warned the audience against putting money into the dwindling number of online finance companies that still offered high returns on investment. While some informal lending operations provide valuable credit to small businesses, others have proved to be fraudulent.\u201cYou need to report them so we can find all these Ponzi-type schemes,\u201d Mr. Guo said.China\u2019s financial policymakers have made clear that they do not mind seeing a few defaults and some strains in the system. Retail auto sales slackened last month, and unsold cars have started accumulating at dealerships. A decision by the authorities to allow at least a dozen bond defaults in recent weeks, after years of preventing them, has rattled some investors.The Chinese economy is not crashing. By international standards, the pace of bond defaults is still negligible. While car sales have leveled off, they have done so at a very high level after two decades of strong growth, causing chronic traffic jams. Real estate demand is still buoyant, and so is the construction industry.But faced with a high level of debt across the economy, \u201cwhat regulators need to be careful is not to respond in such a heavy-handed way that it could essentially compound the risks,\u201d said Fred Hu, an influential Chinese economist who is now a hedge fund chairman in Hong Kong.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In New Jersey and 7 Other States, Democrats Fill Ranks of Challengers", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVERONA, N.J. \u2014 A former Navy pilot, a veteran White House national security adviser and a conservative pro-gun state senator won Democratic nominations on Tuesday to represent battleground congressional districts in New Jersey, officially earning their spot on the front lines in a state that could determine control of the House.Senator Dianne Feinstein easily won a spot on the November ballot in her re-election bid in what by every indication looks like an easy race this fall \u2014 no matter who ends up running against her.New Jersey could prove as crucial as California in the contest for the House in November. Democratic leaders are hoping to flip as many as four of the five Republican-held districts in the state.In perhaps the most closely watched contest in New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, won the Democratic nomination in the 11th District, The A.P. reported, where Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican, is retiring from a seat that a Democrat has not held since the 1980s. Ms. Sherrill became the latest woman to prevail in a nationwide wave of female candidacies and will now continue a nearly 18-month effort to replace Mr. Frelinghuysen with a Democrat in a district where Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has spawned intense activism.\u201cWe made New Jersey\u2019s 11th District the center of a national movement for new leadership,\u2019\u2019 she told supporters at a victory rally. \u201cChange is led by the people of New Jersey.\u2019\u2019Ms. Sherrill, who raised nearly $2.4 million even before the primary, will face Jay Webber, a state assemblyman, in the general election.In the contest for the Senate in New Jersey, the Democratic incumbent, Robert Menendez, won his primary and will face Bob Hugin, a pharmaceutical executive who easily won the Republican nomination.But elsewhere, female candidates had another big night \u2014 including a Democratic nomination for governor in New Mexico, a Republican nomination for governor in South Dakota and a win in a competitive Democratic primary for a battleground House seat in Iowa.In New Jersey, the House races are so important that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made endorsements in four of the primaries to help clear the field for candidates it believed had broad enough appeal to win over the state\u2019s many unaffiliated voters in the fall.In the southern region of the state, where Representative Frank LoBiondo is leaving his seat in the Second Congressional District, Jeff Van Drew, a state senator, won the Democratic primary. Mr. Van Drew, a conservative Democrat with a pro-gun record who voted against same-sex marriage in 2012, nonetheless won the backing of powerful South Jersey Democrats early on and was able to fend off a challenge from some progressive candidates.Andy Kim, a former White House national security official who ran uncontested in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, faces perhaps the steepest climb in the state\u2019s key races this November: a general election contest in the Third Congressional District against Representative Tom MacArthur, a wealthy incumbent in a firmly red district that Mr. Trump won handily in 2016.As many other New Jersey Republicans have distanced themselves from the administration, voting against the tax law and efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. MacArthur has been a loyal supporter, potentially alienating more centrist voters who have grown wary of the president.Atop the Democratic ticket in New Jersey was Mr. Menendez, who, despite having weathered a lengthy corruption trial and receiving a blistering admonishment from the Senate Ethics committee, faced only a little known challenger, Lisa McCormick, in the primary. But Ms. McCormick, who had no federal finance filings, no ads and no major campaign apparatus, still managed to garner nearly 40 percent of the vote \u2014 a sign, perhaps, that many Democrats voted in protest for a candidate they did not know rather than support the scandal-singed Mr. Menendez.In Montana, a state Mr. Trump carried by 20 points in 2016, the primary contest for Jon Tester\u2019s Senate seat is a pivotal race for Republicans hoping to retain or build upon their slim majority in the Senate. Mr. Tester will face Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, who won the Republican nomination Tuesday in a narrow victory over Russ Fagg.Mr. Trump has taken particular interest in the race \u2014 and in savaging Mr. Tester on Twitter and elsewhere \u2014 ever since the senator helped to derail the nomination of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal physician, Ronny L. Jackson, to be his secretary of veterans affairs. But Mr. Tester remains a modest favorite, according to officials in both parties, in part because Mr. Rosendale is not viewed as a robust challenger.In Alabama on Tuesday, it was a Republican who seemed to pay a price for running afoul of Mr. Trump. Ms. Roby fell short of the 50 percent threshold required to win outright, after withdrawing support for Mr. Trump in 2016 following the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which he boasted of sexually assaulting women.Regardless of which Republican is on the ballot for Ms. Roby\u2019s deep-red district in November, the seat is highly unlikely to fall into Democratic hands.The same cannot be said for competitive races in Iowa \u2014 which also had its primary on Tuesday \u2014 where two Republicans in the House, Rod Blum and David Young, are expected to face tough tests in their re-election bids this fall. Mr. Young\u2019s opponent will be Cindy Axne, a business owner and activist. She routed Pete D\u2019Alessandro, who led Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 caucus campaign in Iowa \u2014 and earned his former boss\u2019s endorsement in this race, to little avail.Mr. Blum will be running against Abby Finkenauer, a state legislator.Iowa Democrats are also working to knock off Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican. She will square off against Fred Hubbell, a business executive and longtime Democratic donor.In New Mexico, Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, prevailed in the Democratic primary for governor. If elected, she would be the first Latina Democratic governor in the United States, replacing Gov. Susana Martinez, a term-limited Republican who is also Latina. Steve Pearce, a conservative congressman, won the Republican nomination.Among the other states voting on Tuesday were South Dakota, where Kristi Noem won the Republican primary for governor and the opportunity to face Billie Sutton, and Mississippi, which held its primaries for a Senate seat occupied by Roger Wicker. Mr. Wicker, a Republican, won his primary Tuesday night and is expected to be re-elected without major incident.But Democratic leaders have trained their attention most intensely on to Republican-held House seats in blue states like New Jersey.In the Seventh District along the western part of New Jersey, Representative Leonard Lance easily defeated two challengers Tuesday to win the Republican primary, and is expected to face his first tough general election in a decade for a seat that has been held by Republicans since 1981. His opponent will be Tom Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state, who had raised more than $1.2 million in his effort to capture the Democratic nomination.Part of the intense focus on seats in New Jersey involves the unpopularity of Mr. Trump and his policies. The administration\u2019s early signature accomplishments, most notably the overhaul of the tax system, took aim at high-tax states like New Jersey. And the plan to open offshore drilling off the Atlantic Coast drew widespread condemnation up and down the Jersey Shore, a cherished resource and tourism destination.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexander Askoldov, Whose Banned Film Was Found, Dies at 85", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlexander Askoldov, a Soviet-era director whose one film, \u201cThe Commissar,\u201d was banned by censors in the late 1960s for its sympathetic portrayal of a Jewish family, only to resurface two decades later to great acclaim, died on May 21 in Gothenburg, Sweden, where he had a home. He was 85.His death was confirmed by Marat Grinberg, the author of a book about the film.The commissar slowly warms to the family\u2019s generosity and decency. Late in the film, as everyone hides in a basement while artillery shells are exploding outside, the sweet-tempered, Tevye-like tinsmith (played by Rolan Bykov) dances to a Klezmer melody, inspiring his frightened wife and children to join in.Sitting in the darkness watching them, the commissar (Nonna Mordyukova) has a vision: a flash-forward of Jews, wearing Nazi-era stars on their clothes, marching to a death camp. The tinsmith is among them \u2014 he is dancing \u2014 and the commissar, with her baby, follows at the rear.In the Soviet era, there was probably never a right time for Mr. Askoldov to make a film that portrayed Jews in a favorable light, or worse, to evoke the Holocaust.Like other Soviet filmmakers, Mr. Askoldov had to endure a heavy-handed process just to receive approval to make a film.\u201cDifferent committees were responsible for different stages of production, from script to shooting,\u201d Mr. Grinberg, a professor of Russian and humanities at Reed College in Oregon and the author of \u201cAleksandr Askoldov: \u2018The Commissar\u2019 \u201d (2016), said in a telephone interview. \u201cFilmmakers themselves were included in these committees, so the censoring was done not just via party bureaucrats but by the filmmakers.\u201dMr. Askoldov understood the risks of making a film under such rigid monitoring.\u201cEvery day during shooting something was objected to,\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in 1988. \u201cI had only one assignment for myself: to live through this day of shooting, because tomorrow it may be shut down.\u201dThe film ultimately antagonized Gorky Film Studio in Moscow, where Mr. Askoldov worked, and the party\u2019s censors. They demanded that he diminish the Jewishness of the story and eliminate scenes, like the death camp march and one in which the tinsmith\u2019s children enact a pogrom.He refused, and the film was banned and buried in the archive, with no expectation that it would ever be disinterred.\u201cWhen people ask me why my film was banned,\u201d Mr. Askoldov said in the book \u201cMoscow Believes in Tears: Russians and Their Movies\u201d (2010), by Louis Menashe, \u201cI answer, \u2018Because the system of moral and political principles that this film depicts went against the system of moral and political principles that prevailed for 70 years in the U.S.S.R.\u2019 \u201dHe was fired from Gorky \u2014 the stated reason was ineptitude \u2014 and stripped of his Communist Party membership. He and \u201cThe Commissar\u201d fell into obscurity for 20 years, until the film\u2019s unexpected revival.Alexander Yakovlevich Askoldov was born on June 17, 1932, and grew up in Kiev, where he was exposed to the darkness of the Stalin era. His father was a Red Army commissar and factory director \u2014 he was also, Mr. Grinberg said, probably Jewish \u2014 who was arrested by Stalin\u2019s secret police and killed in 1937. His mother, a doctor, was arrested and imprisoned soon after.Mr. Askoldov later recalled that at only 5 years old, fearful that he would be taken away, he left the house and found his way to Jewish family friends, who hid him before one of his grandmothers took him in.But rather than pursue his ambition to be a literary scholar, Mr. Askoldov went to work for the Soviet Ministry of Culture as an editor and censor. He went on to complete a two-year course in screenwriting and directing at a film school in Moscow.After \u201cThe Commissar\u201d was suppressed, Mr. Askoldov, exiled from Soviet cinema circles, took various jobs, including staging musical shows at a Moscow theater.But the openness, known as glasnost, ushered in by the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev presented Mr. Askoldov with an unexpected opportunity. As other banned films were being resurrected, he asked that \u201cThe Commissar\u201d be released as well. By 1987, the Soviet authorities had agreed to let him restore and show it.Mr. Askoldov edited what was found in the Gorky archive, combining it with a separate reel already in his possession containing the Holocaust scene.\u201cThis reel was supposed to have been destroyed, but Askoldov\u2019s assistant carried it out, under her skirt, and it sat under Askoldov\u2019s bed for 20 years,\u201d Olga Gershenson, a professor of Judaic and Near Eastern studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and the author of \u201cThe Phantom Holocaust: Soviet Cinema and Jewish Catastrophe\u201d (2013), said in a telephone interview.\u201cA woman said that she had been ordered to burn the film, but she said she decided it might be useful some day,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1988. \u201cI knelt and kissed her feet.\u201dThe film was first screened at the Moscow International Film Festival in 1987, and acclaim followed. Among its awards was the Special Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1988.He added that it was \u201chard to imagine anyone but a Russian being able to bring such sheer lyricism, passion and epic scope to so intimate a tale.\u201d\u201cThe Commissar\u201d found another path to approval: In 1988, the Soviet Union submitted it as its official Academy Awards entry for best foreign-language film. (It was not nominated.)In the years afterward, Mr. Askoldov taught film at various schools in Berlin, where he lived part time. Besides Gothenburg, he also had a home in Moscow.He is survived by his wife, Svetlana; his daughter, Marina; and three grandchildren.But he never made that film, or any other. Mr. Grinberg suggested that a lack of financing was one reason; another, he said, was Mr. Askoldov\u2019s continuing resentment over the banning of \u201cThe Commissar.\u201d\u201cHe couldn\u2019t work for 20 years,\u201d Ms. Gershenson of the University of Massachusetts said. \u201cThat would break your spirit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Academically, I have no woes. It is the thought of living on my own, in the grown-up world, that troubles me. Society has become so focused on academics, test scores and GPA, that no school wants to spend time teaching kids about buying a house, or paying off loans. Because of this, I am going off to college with little to no knowledge about everyday skills.Professor David Perkins has looked at the issue of what is and is not taught in schools, and tells educators to ask themselves, \u201cWhat\u2019s worth learning in school?\u201d At a seminar that Perkins spoke at, he asked audience members to raise their hand if they had learned in school what mitosis, the process of cell division, was. Nearly every person raised their hand. When Perkins asked how many of them had used their knowledge of mitosis in the last ten years, only one hand went up.I am not arguing that public schools should up and abandon math or science or any subject, but if biology is a required course, why shouldn\u2019t accounting be too? Or home economics? Public schools are built around a curriculum that spends so much time teaching information that will likely never be used again. Instead, teaching important life skills needs to be integrated into the curriculum of public schools. Some courses, like accounting and home ec, are offered as elective classes, but very few kids take them because it won\u2019t make their college application look better or boost their GPA as much as taking the AP Statistics elective. Public schools are doing the bare minimum to make these useful classes available to students and in turn are sending kids off unprepared for their future lives outside of the academic world. There needs to be a bigger push toward making classes about life skills a requirement in public schools, so that people are not going into the workforce, wondering how to do their tax returns.Works CitedHough, Lory. \u201cWhat\u2019s Worth Learning in School?\u201d Harvard Graduate School of Education, 8 Jan. 2015.Ojalvo, Holly Epstein. \u201cWhat Are You Really Learning at School?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Sept. 2011._________In the timeless words of Abraham Lincoln, \u201cAnd in the end, it is not the years in your life that count. It\u2019s the life in your years.\u201d The debate over whether the quality or quantity of life is more important has shaken up the grounds of ethics. Recently, physician-assisted suicide has become legalized in Oregon, Washington, Washington, D.C., Vermont, Montana, Colorado and California. Yet New York, just this past year, banned this end-of-life route.The Death with Dignity Act, passed in selected states, allows strictly qualified terminally ill patients to receive lethal medication from their doctors to end their lives. It is one end-of-life option among others including: palliative sedation, voluntary stopping of eating and drinking, and stopping treatment. All of these alleviate pain and hasten death, however, they are not always effective depending on the diagnoses. Brittany Maynard, who had terminal brain cancer, wrote an article explaining her choice of physician-assisted suicide: \u201cI considered passing away in hospice care \u2026 but even with palliative sedation, I could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal, cognitive and motor loss.\u201d Fundamentally, both physician-assisted suicide and other end-of-life options result in the same outcome. However, physician-assisted suicide is more immediate and less painful while the others, though legal, can result in intolerable, prolonged anguish. Some patients want to have the responsibility of choosing their own way of ending the suffering in the comfort of their own homes, surrounded by their loved ones. For this reason, physician-assisted suicide ought to be legal.By disallowing terminally ill patients from choosing the right to die with dignity, there is an infringement on the right to live a quality life, right to freedom, and right to autonomy. Physicians against assisted suicide claim that since the Hippocratic oath implies a doctor\u2019s responsibility is to heal, assisting patients to hasten their deaths is a violation of medical ethics. John Grohol, a psychologist, wrote a New York Times article stating, \u201cWhen doctors equate healing with quantity of life, they ignore the quality of life. If suffering is intolerable, it is inhumane not to end it.\u201d Therefore, if it is against the patient\u2019s will to continue suffering, disallowing the patient to die peacefully and painlessly is disregarding the patient\u2019s well being and, in fact, rejecting the oath.The Death with Dignity Act entitles a patient to make a decision about his own life and, for once, not allow the disease to dictate the body\u2019s fate. With strict regulations, such as psychiatric evaluations ensuring the patient\u2019s choice is individual and competent, New York should be the next state to adopt such end-of-life care and give people the option to live fully and freely.Works CitedGrohol, John M. \u201cDenying Someone a Peaceful Death Can Be Unethical\u201d The New York Times. 7 Oct. 2014.Maynard, Brittany. \u201cMy Right to Death With Dignity at 29.\u201d CNN, Cable News Network, 3 Nov. 2014._________In China, the competition is great and the opportunities are few. Children are faced with the burden of success the minute they are born. Before they are born, mothers are faced with the pressure of bearing the most well-advantaged offspring. In recent years, there has been an exponential rise in the number of couples who are opting to screen embryos during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Because of the financial burden, lack of facilities for, and social stigma of raising a handicapped child, Chinese parents are more willing to prioritize you sheng (which translates to \u201chealthy birth\u201d) over the protection of an embryo.One of the screening processes, known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is currently used to detect embryos with single gene mutations that could cause diseases and disabilities like Tay Sachs disease or cystic fibrosis. Chinese law prohibits selection of embryos based on anything else (for instance, selecting for male embryos is illegal). However, a whole new array of problems will develop as we achieve a greater understanding of what genes influence intelligence.The trailblazer in this field is the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), which launched a project in 2012 to analyze the DNA of 2,000 of the world\u2019s smartest people. There are thousands of variants that influence mental abilities, but BGI aims to decipher the substantial genetic component of intelligence in the near future. While the study is purely academic, insight into the labyrinthine genetics of genius will define the future of genetic screenings; Pandora\u2019s box will be opened with no possibility for return.Fertility clinics may go from advertising for \u201ccancer-free babies\u201d to promising \u201cprodigy babies\u201d. The starting line for the rat race to the middle class will shift from family standing to predestined genetic design. PGD won\u2019t necessarily result in China mass-engineering super-citizens, but it will easily be misinterpreted by and desensitize result-driven consumers. \u201cSelecting for the smartest embryos\u201d overemphasizes the hereditary facet of intelligence and glosses over the influence of nurture. Clinics cannot guarantee smarter babies, but eager couples will still flock to them nonetheless. In addition, even with PGD for simpler single gene mutations there is the risk of false positives. Now, couples might unknowingly dispose of perfectly healthy embryos in pursuit of a prodigy.It is imperative that the Chinese government take proactive measures to oversee future PGD implementation. In addition to a moratorium so officials, scientists and consumers can deliberate, genetic counselors who are well-versed in bioethics need to lead a nationwide discussion on how far we are willing to let competition define us, literally. The human genome is indisputably the new frontier of exploration. However, unrestrained scientific ambition will move China forward before it is ready.Works CitedCyranoski, David. \u201cChina\u2019s Embrace of Embryo Selection Raises Thorny Questions.\u201d Scientific American, Nature America, Inc, 16 Aug. 2017.Eror, Aleks. \u201cChina Is Engineering Genius Babies.\u201d Vice, Vice Media, 15 March 2013.Kolata, Gina. \u201cBuilding a Better Human With Science?

Though Mr. Clinton was referring to her qualifications and unusually significant political role \u2014 she remains the only first lady ever to maintain an office in the West Wing \u2014 presidential couples always present voters \u201ctwo for the price of one.\u201d Presidents\u2019 spouses fulfill a variety of official responsibilities: They manage paid staffers, promote nonpartisan causes and entertain White House visitors. Crucially, the first lady is unpaid, and, as former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson once quipped, \u201celected by one person \u2014 her husband.\u201dAs every new election raises the prospect of a man in the office of first lady, this amorphous role has become awkward and archaic: The presidential spouse should be absolved of public obligations altogether. The position of first lady evolved within the context of a society that could not imagine a woman in power or a president\u2019s wife with a high-powered career, relegating her to the domestic sphere. It devalued traditionally feminine tasks such as event planning, deeming them unworthy of monetary compensation.Feminist advances have allowed successive presidential spouses to expand their public profiles, becoming vocal advocates for women\u2019s and children\u2019s issues. Thus, some have argued, as Professor Jean H. Baker proposed in The New York Times, that the office should \u201cbe defined as a paid public position, with salary and expectations.\u201dHowever, this change would only affirm the expectation that women subsume their identities into those of their powerful husbands. If the role of the presidential spouse is a \u201cfull-time job,\u201d as Baker claims, he or she would likely be compelled to relinquish their existing occupation, just as Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton gave up prestigious positions. Yet, a life of visiting elementary schools or choosing flower arrangements for the next White House dinner may not appeal to every spouse. Furthermore, since the first lady is eligible for office by virtue of being married to the president, greater politicization inevitably bumps up against charges of nepotism.A far simpler solution would be to abolish the office and treat the presidential spouse as a normal private citizen. After all, the position is dispensable. German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s husband, a theoretical physicist, has eschewed the public eye so unwaveringly that a German newspaper once labeled him \u201cas invisible as a molecule,\u201d a practice that has not impeded the smooth functioning of the German state.The United States can and should follow suit. We can only free ourselves of the sexist assumptions and stereotypes that currently underlie the role of first lady if we free presidential spouses from public servitude.Works CitedBaker, Jean H. \u201cGive First Ladies a Salary and Expectations.\u201d The New York Times. 9 March 2016.Cornwell, Rupert. \u201cBill and Hillary\u2019s Double Trouble: Clinton\u2019s Two for the Price of One\u2019 Pledge Is Returning to Haunt Him, Says Rupert Cornwell.\u201d Independent. 9 March 1994.Finkelstein, Sarina. \u201cWant to Fix Wage Inequality?

In this day and age, the extensive use of fuel-burning vehicles is becoming a larger issue as global warming develops into a growing threat \u2014 especially in the United States. While replacing all gasoline cars with electric vehicles (EVs) would be impractical, widespread change is necessary. A good place for us to begin is with some of our nation\u2019s most admired and respected individuals: police officers.According to the most recent law enforcement census, 17,985 police departments across the United States deploy thousands of police vehicles, becoming one of the country\u2019s largest contributors to greenhouse gases. Living in a city where EVs and hybrids are becoming increasingly common, the dozens of diesel police cars around me begin to feel archaic. Within the next decade, several departments can reasonably aim to replace a majority of their police fleets, or at least nonemergency fleets, with fuel efficient vehicles.In fact, plans for this system have already garnered support and are underway in New York City, one of the nation\u2019s greatest greenhouse gas emitters. For instance, recent city plans call for replacing just under a fifth of its 11,000 car fleet; this is estimated to reduce city government emissions by 50 percent, according to the New York Times article \u201cNew York City Aims for Vast Electric Car Fleet by 2025.\u201dAlbeit costly, replacing only 2,000 cars will pay for itself through fuel savings, while dramatically improving the environment of one of the world\u2019s busiest cities. Furthermore, police officers serve as an example to the public, which is why their use of green vehicles could cause a larger change to ripple across America.The variety and practicality of electric vehicles have grown tremendously in the past half decade, showing no signs of stopping. Some argue against this plan\u2019s practicality due to the failure of the most significant previous attempt in the LAPD, in which a 100 car fleet of EVs had seldom been used since its introduction in 2016. However, cars in this fleet were among first-generation mass market EVs and faced significant limitations.Most modern models have evolved past those limitations with greater durability, safety, speed, affordability and other factors that strengthen the practicality of the car. Some gasoline vehicles may remain for specialized missions, but their necessity is limited.The more Americans neglect the benefits of today\u2019s fuel efficient vehicles, the more dire our climate situation becomes. A solution is widely available, and a step forward taken by our nation\u2019s officials can push us toward a future of clean energy. With this advance, police officers can save more than just lives.Works CitedCity of New York Inventory of New York City\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Emissions, April 2017, by Cventure LLC, Cathy Pasion, Christianah Oyenuga, and Kate Gouin, Mayor\u2019s Office of Sustainability, New York, 2017.Grynbaum, Michael M. \u201cNew York City Aims for Vast Electric Car Fleet by 2025.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 Dec. 2015.King, Alanis. \u201cThat Fleet Of Electric Cars The LAPD Paid At Least $2.9 Million For?

Reynolds Tobacco hid and denied the health risks of smoking in pursuit of greater profits.The courts have forced the companies to release \u201ccorrective statements\u201d in newspapers and on major news channels. Although these statements are a step in the right direction, their sparse design does not catch people\u2019s attention and, therefore, does not effectively spread their information to the public.Tobacco advertisements in the 1900s were flashy and colorful; they featured pictures of grinning doctors endorsing the health benefits of cigarettes and attractive people smoking happily. These advertisements grabbed the reader\u2019s attention, but the corrective statements do just the opposite.The print and televised statements consist of plain black text in bullet points on a white background, with a monotonous, slow voice-over that is reminiscent of a digital assistant added to the televised ones. They appear designed to be unattractive and slip under the radar of viewers and readers.This is not how to get a message across.An antismoking campaign by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention entitled \u201cTips\u201d ran in 2012 and featured former smokers telling their stories with graphic images of their injuries.According to NBC News, this campaign led 1.6 million people to attempt to quit smoking, and 78 percent of surveyed smokers and 74 percent of surveyed nonsmokers recalled seeing at least one Tips advertisement. The CDC\u2019s advertisements made an impact because they caught people\u2019s attention; these corrective statements do not do that, so how will people see them?These statements reveal important information about smoking\u2019s adverse effects and the companies\u2019 deceitful actions. It is imperative that smokers and those considering smoking are fully aware of the negative consequences of their actions. In Texas, women seeking abortions must receive information about the procedure\u2019s risks and alternative options 24 hours beforehand. Don\u2019t smokers, whose choice to smoke exposes them and every person around them to numerous fatal diseases, deserve the same educational material?And how will they receive that information when it is practically invisible?When Kessler ordered these companies to release corrective statements, her intent was that the American public see and hear those statements. In their current form, these advertisements do not satisfy that condition.The courts cannot allow these ineffective statements to continue; the companies must release new advertisements that actually attract the eye to fulfill their obligation. We do not allow our children to avoid apologizing for misconduct; let us apply this same rule in this case. Altria, Lorillard, Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, say it like you mean it.Works CitedFox, Maggie. \u201cGraphic Anti-Smoking Ads Helped 100,000 Kick the Habit for Good, CDC Says.\u201d NBCNews.com, NBCUniversal News Group, 9 Sept. 2013.Maheshwari, Sapna. \u201cWhy Tobacco Companies Are Paying to Tell You Smoking Kills.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 24 Nov. 2017._________\u201cThe King and I\u201d\u201cMiss Saigon\u201d\u201cAllegiance\u201dAt face value, these recent Broadway musicals are evidence of an increasingly diverse Broadway: one that allows Asian-American artists to thrive alongside those of every color and identity. In fact, the 2015-16 Broadway season was praised for bringing diversity \u201cfront and center\u201d with shows emphasizing heritage, like \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cAllegiance.\u201d However, as diverse audience members search for representation on the Broadway stage, we must reevaluate: Do these shows offer Asian-American artists the same opportunities as those of other ethnicities? The Asian American Performers Action Coalition\u2019s report \u201cEthnic Representation on New York Stages\u201d confirms the trend of growing diversity: Between the 2006-07 and 2015-16 New York theater seasons, minority actors\u2019 representation increased from 15 percent to 35 percent while Asian-American actors\u2019 representation rose to only 9 percent.High Asian-American representation accompanies musicals such as \u201cThe King & I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d \u2014 among the only shows to employ large Asian-American ensembles. According to the same report, the 2015 revival of \u201cThe King & I\u201d hired \u201calmost half of all Asian actors employed that season.\u201d Japanese-Canadian director Stafford Arima confirms their impact: \u201cYou would look at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and just see 12 productions of the \u2018King and I\u2019 and nine productions of \u2018Miss Saigon\u2019.\u201dThese classic musicals, however, carry the remnants of a less racially-aware time. \u201cThe King & I\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d include large Asian ensembles, but consistently cast Asian-American actors as background to white story lines. Unlike the vibrant cultural celebrations of \u201cHamilton\u201d or \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d which pridefully explore ethnocultural roots through hip-hop or religion, these Asian-centric shows only \u201ccelebrate\u201d a long history of Anglo-European interference in Asia and the Pacific Islands.Asian-American actors deserve to play characters that embrace their history without focusing on the white man\u2019s role in it. They deserve to involve themselves in shows that look toward a future in which Asian-American pride is loud and present. They deserve the same opportunity to love, honor and celebrate their culture as the trailblazing African-American, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ actors currently shining on the Broadway stage.The theater community should take pride in its beacons of diversity \u2014 \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d \u2014 but should also recognize the inequality among actors of color. Modern musicals such as \u201cAllegiance,\u201d about Japanese-American internment, or \u201cHere Lies Love,\u201d about the political controversy of the Philippines, drive the industry in a positive direction, yet they have not closed the gap between Caucasian and minority \u2014 particularly, Asian \u2014 representation on Broadway. Let Broadway applaud itself for its monumental gains in the past decade, but never let it stop pushing for the equal, truthful and proud representation its diverse audience deserves.Works CitedBandhu, Pun.

My friends, who also have their driving permits, frequently joke with me about the woes of lane-changing, parallel parking and three-point turns as we prepare for our looming driver\u2019s license tests.Yet we remain part of a dwindling majority. In 1976, nearly 87 percent of high school seniors held a driver\u2019s license. By 2016, this percentage dropped to under 72, a decrease that may correlate with a climbing dependence on parental or public transportation, a lack of car ownership, or simply not needing to drive anywhere.Then add these declining rates to a rising innovation: autonomous cars. The introduction of effective autonomous cars could drastically reduce vehicular deaths, since 94 percent of traffic fatalities involve human error. Self-driving cars would eliminating the dangers of intoxicated driving, distracted driving or simply incompetent driving \u2015 and render learning to drive unnecessary.But, following the fatal Arizona crash between an autonomous Uber car and a pedestrian, Americans question the true safety of such technology. Company documents reveal that Uber\u2019s self-driving cars drove an average of only 13 miles before a human supervisor had to interfere to prevent a crash. In comparison, a study by Virginia Tech found that the average American driver crashes approximately once every 49,505 miles. Juxtaposed with the data of human drivers, Uber\u2019s autonomous cars appear laughably incompetent. Nevertheless, autonomous cars collectively travel about 113,636 miles per crash, indicating that they can and will be more reliable than humans.Autonomous cars remain far from flawlessly navigating the roads, but we often fail to consider that developers designed our traffic regulations with humans \u2014 and human error \u2014 in mind. An entire network of self-driving cars would optimize traffic congestion and pollution by reducing the number of cars on the road. Consequently, regulations such as speed bumps and parking spaces may become restrictive rather than protective. To take full advantage of autonomous cars, we must prepare to rescind and replace longstanding laws.As self-driving cars continue to improve, so does public reception of them. The percentage of Americans that distrust driverless cars decreased drastically from 74 percent in 2017 to 47 percent in 2018. If this downward trend continues, autonomous cars will soon be an accepted and integral part of society. Akin to penmanship and opera singing, human driving will soon be a practice of the past. And, given the potential security benefits and efficacy of autonomous cars, this is a future that we must accept \u2014 and even embrace.Works CitedBahrampour, Tara. \u201cNot Drinking or Driving, Teens Increasingly Put off Traditional Markers of Adulthood.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 19 Sept. 2017.Blanco, Myra. \u201cAutomated Vehicle Crash Rate Comparison Using Naturalistic Data.\u201d Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, Virginia Polytech Institute and State University, 8 Jan. 2016.\u201cCritical Reasons for Crashes Investigated in the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey.\u201d National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Feb. 2015.Giffi, Craig A. \u201cA Reality Check on Advanced Vehicle Technologies.\u201d Deloitte Insights, Deloitte Insights, 5 Jan. 2018.Wakabayashi, Daisuke. \u201cUber\u2019s Self-Driving Cars Were Struggling Before Arizona Crash.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 March 2018._________Education has become an industry in which the upper-class\u2019s monopoly of resources is unchecked. A New York Times study of 38 top colleges in America, including five Ivy League schools, found that more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent. China faces a similar conundrum, where rich families in urban areas can send their kids to \u201ckeypoint\u201d high schools. These schools receive more funding per student than average schools, have better teachers, and reliably place their students into elite colleges. In a world where income inequality is growing \u2014 China\u2019s bottom 25 percent owns less than 1 percent of the aggregate wealth while the top 1 percent owns over one-third \u2014 one wonders if people not born into wealth are doomed to poverty.However, in 2016, the Chinese Ministry of Education sparked hope when it announced 140,000 spaces \u2014 about 6.5 percent of spots in top colleges \u2014 would be reserved for students from less developed provinces. Unfortunately, this policy immediately ignited strong protests by urban parents. Under protest banners of \u201cfairness in education,\u201d protesters rallied to preserve using \u201cGaokao\u201d college-entrance examination score, as the sole metric. They noted that Gaokao mimics China\u2019s old imperial civil service exam (\u201cKeju\u201d) in relying purely on exam results and praised this meritocratic system as superior. Essentially, their argument is that in the long race of college applications, no one should be forced to run 6.5 percent further than their competitors.What these protesters failed to mention is that times have changed, and the race\u2019s participants begin on vastly different starting lines. The Keju system that was effective in bringing people from rural areas to government posts in cities, and thus increased social mobility, is not applicable in a country experiencing the fastest urbanization trend in history. As recently as 1993, over 40 percent of students in China\u2019s colleges were children of farmers or factory workers. But now social mobility is becoming an obsolete concept. Today, less than 10 percent of young people in the countryside go to senior high schools compared with 70 percent of their urban counterparts.Fairness in education is the right slogan, but a truly meritocratic system should not ignore complex social realities that put some students at a disadvantage from a young age. The Chinese government\u2019s new higher-education admissions policy is a step toward balancing the unequal \u2018starting lines\u2019 that poor, rural students face. More such creative, comprehensive policies should be encouraged. Without these measures, growing inequality in society cannot be redressed. Every citizen \u2014 regardless of location, family background or wealth \u2014 should have hope that hard work and dedication can transform their lives.Works CitedAisch, Gregor, et al. \u201cSome Colleges Have More Students From the Top 1 Percent Than the Bottom 60.

Today, our political climate is marked by increasingly acerbic and polarizing rhetoric on all sides of the political spectrum. While we tend to blame those in Washington for splitting America into two, there is another major reason for this internal discord \u2014 ourselves. From social media to news outlets, we often shut ourselves in echo chambers that reinforce our existing views but exclude alternative views.Understandably, we naturally do so in the first place because we like hearing what we want to hear and because we feel confident when others accept our opinions, especially when we browse through and post on social media. But, why is this specifically bad?While some may contend that these platforms allow us to converse with like-minded individuals, echo chambers have silent, pernicious effects on the way we perceive truth. When we surround ourselves only with ideas that are similar to our own, we succumb to groupthink as we take everything we read as fact. This dangerous cycle perpetuates disinformation since we almost always don\u2019t take the time to independently verify what we read and view to be true in the echo chamber.Statistical data already proves this phenomenon. In a 2016 study published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, Swedish researchers analyzed 700,000 posts on a right-wing forum. The results were shocking: It took only six months for the average user to adopt the community\u2019s radical opinions and go from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cWe.\u201dOnce we fall under the influences of this \u201cmob mentality,\u201d we regard our beliefs as hard fact and refuse to engage in conflicting opinions, extinguishing civil discourse. For instance, when people of the same political affiliation were told to debate the merits behind denigrating rumors about the opposite party, the discussions notably veered toward reaffirming those erroneous statements.Despite the plethora of multifaceted and diverse opinions offered online, we still overwhelming choose to latch onto narrow viewpoints that we want to hear. Instead of willfully ignoring the other side, we must learn to engage in opposing perspectives to listen and understand rather than to respond or scorn at. Instead of taking everything we read in blind faith, we must learn to analyze and question it.So, at the end of the day, don\u2019t be afraid to question anything in life. Even if you feel like it\u2019s a \u201cdumb\u201d question, ask it. The more you learn, the less \u201cdumb\u201d questions you will have. But most importantly, learn to be prepared for the answer, too. It may not be what you want to hear, but that\u2019s the truth. The plain truth.Works CitedB\u00e4ck, Emma A., et al. \u201cFrom I to We: Group Formation and Linguistic Adaption in an Online Xenophobic Forum.\u201d 13 March 2018.

Although the wall hasn\u2019t been built yet, planning is underway and it\u2019s now possible to see eight prototype walls in Otay Mesa, San Diego. According to the Trump administration, this planned wall will reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants. However, building a wall is actually counterproductive and there are many more effective alternatives.It\u2019s true a wall may keep some undocumented immigrants out, which might decrease the number of these immigrants in the workforce. But, according to the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cmost undocumented immigrants now simply overstay legally obtained short-term visas \u2014 and do not sneak across the border.\u201d Simply flying to the U.S. as a tourist or visitor, many people arrive legally and then stay on as undocumented immigrants. Clearly, physically blocking people from crossing the border using a wall is not an effective way to solve the problem.Building the wall would also cut into the budget for other kinds of border control. The Trump administration plans to spend over 18 million dollars on building a border wall, or over 50 percent of the 33 billion border security budget. Spending so much to build the wall would mean budget cuts for routine spending on maintenance and border control upgrades during the wall\u2019s construction. Spending cuts would result in reductions in patrol routes, lights, cameras, sensors and personnel. This lack of maintenance and improvements would result in more undocumented immigrants crossing over during construction, not fewer.Instead of building a wall, there are more effective ways to solve the undocumented immigration issue. First, money budgeted for the wall could be spent on enhancing law enforcement efforts aimed at companies that hire undocumented immigrants. If hiring regulations are enforced and it becomes harder for undocumented immigrants to find jobs, the number of illegal border crossings would decrease. Another critical way to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants is to continue investing in other forms of enhanced border control technology like drones and heat sensors, which would increase law enforcement\u2019s ability to find undocumented immigrants sneaking across border.If completed, the wall wouldn\u2019t be an effective protection against undocumented immigrants. Even China\u2019s Great Wall was ineffective at keeping out groups like the Mongolians or at keeping Han Chinese from leaving China to settle outside the wall illegally. Eventually, immigrants will always find ways to cross the physical obstacles that governments put in their paths. Therefore, the U.S. border security budget should be spent on actual solutions instead of on creating a big, inefficient wall that may eventually become just another tourist attraction like the one in China.Works CitedBurgos, Fredy. \u201cTrump\u2019s Mexico Border Wall Isn\u2019t Going to Stem the Flow of Undocumented Immigrants.\u201d Newsweek, 20 Dec. 2017.Nixon, Ron. \u201cTo Pay for Wall, Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures.\u201d The New York Times, 8 Jan. 2018.Nixon, Ron. \u201cWhat Border Agents Say They Want (It\u2019s Not a Wall).\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 March 2018.Urrea, Luis Alberto. \u201cLooking at Trump\u2019s \u2018Beautiful Wall\u2019.\u201d The New York Times, 3 March 2018._________Many Americans characterize the Electoral College as a fair system that represents all Americans. Supporters point to the fact that small states like Wyoming and Delaware would be unimportant in a direct election for president and thus ignored. Under the Electoral College, they reason, candidates must pay attention to all states. Yet nearly every argument in support for the Electoral College is inconsistent.The truth is that small states are still ignored despite the extra representation. Rather than diversifying the states that candidates visit, the Electoral College forces candidates to focus on the swing states. This is because of its all-or-nothing approach to granting electors: If a candidate wins a majority in a state, he or she will win all the electors in the state. It matters not whether the candidate wins by 60 percent or 90 percent. The results of this are horrible. As The New York Times stated, \u201cIn 2016, two-thirds of all public campaign events were held in just six states\u2026.\u201dIn addition, there is not a clear reason why the small states should have their votes count more than the large states if the Electoral College does nothing to diversify the states candidates visit. Small states should have their votes count less precisely because they are smaller than the large states.Most in favor of abolishing the Electoral College want a direct national vote giving one vote to every person. However a direct national vote would still retain several problems of the Electoral College, most notably the spoiler effect. The spoiler effect occurs when a third candidate splits the vote of one of the two parties causing the candidate who would have won to lose and the candidate that a minority of Americans wanted to win. This has happened both to Republicans and Democrats and it discourages Americans from voting for a third party for fear of wasting their vote on a candidate who cannot win. Americans would still be stuck with two-party rule under this system.This problem could be alleviated with instant-runoff voting. Under this system, voters could rank their choices for candidates. If no candidate has a majority in the first round, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and the second choice of those who voted for that candidate is considered. This process is continued until one of the candidates has a majority. With instant-runoff voting, the fear of giving away an election would be eliminated because voters could choose third parties as higher choices and give lower priority to the major parties. This would diversify the political landscape of the United States and give Americans more choices for elections.Works CitedEdwards, George C., I.,II. \u201c5 Myths about the Electoral College.\u201d The Washington Post, Nov. 04, 2012, ProQuest.\u201cIt\u2019s Time to Give Instant Run-Off Balloting a Try.\u201d Montgomery Advertiser, Sept. 17, 2017, ProQuest.Lehnert, Tim. \u201cNo Vote \u2018Wasted\u2019 in This System.\u201d Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 30, 2016, ProQuest.\u201cLet the People Pick the President.\u201d Editorial.

Instead of squandering limited sources on policing an issue that history has proved impossible to eradicate, why not give sex work a legal framework that provides sex workers with medical help and legal protection against violence?Prostitution is a multimillion dollar business, yet no one is collecting taxes from it. According to Nevada brothel owner Dennis Hof, the city of Las Vegas alone could make $25 million a year, just from taxing prostitution. A study conducted by the University of California found that one American city spends on average of $2000 arresting one prostitute; this amounts to $125 million a year in enforcement costs nationwide. Legalizing sex work would turn it into a revenue maker, rather than a burden for the taxpayer.Making prostitution legal could minimize serious health concerns. Decriminalizing prostitution allows the government to regulate and monitor the trade. This, in turn, could ensure that HIV and other STD protection programs are carried out effectively, and research proves this to be true; according to expert Steffanie Strathdee\u2019s study, 46 percent of HIV infections could be averted in any of the Canadian, Kenyan and Indian cities she researched, simply by fully decriminalizing prostitution. An Australian study found that the prevalence of STDs was \u201c80 times greater in 63 illegal street prostitutes than in 753 of their legal brothel counterparts\u201d. Additionally, it was found that condom use was significantly higher in legalized sex work compared to illegal prostitution.It could be argued that authorizing sex work encourages ill treatment toward women. Research shows the opposite; legalizing prostitution actually reduces violence toward women. A study in the Netherlands found that opening designated legal street prostitution zones decreased rape and sexual abuse by 30-40 percent. It was also found that giving sex work a legal framework empowered women to demand safer sex and legal punishment of abuse. Furthermore, as Peter G. Hill brings up in his New York Times Letter to the Editor, legalizing prostitution allows the government to enforce age restrictions on sex trade, preventing underage teens from being lured into the trade.I am not proclaiming a moral judgment on prostitution; I am stating facts. Prostitution is a reality of the modern world. This modern world demands equality. It demands protection and change. Yet change, protection and equality are not being demanded for sex workers. It\u2019s time for the government to stop telling people how to live their lives, and it\u2019s time for the citizens to demand protection for those who need it.Works CitedAkers, Mick. \u201cThis Pimp Wants to End Sex Trafficking.\u201d LasVegasSun.com, 20 March 2017.Becklund, Laurie . \u201cProstitution Arrests Cost $2,000 Each, Study Finds.\u201d Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Times, 10 July 1987.Kastoryano, Stephen, et al. \u201cStreet Prostitution Zones and Crime.\u201d Cato Institute, 19 Apr. 2017.\u201cOpinion | Should Prostitution Be Legalized?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Sept. 2015.\u201cProstitution, Public Health, and Human-Rights Law.\u201d The Lancet.\u201cSimple Way to Curb HIV?

I only recently recognized the connection between these two facets of myself \u2014 or rather, the lack of one: in all of my stories since childhood, I had never written about a Chinese American character. The reason? I\u2019d never really read about one either.The lack of ethnic representation in children\u2019s literature is stark. According to the publisher Lee & Low, only about 10 percent of children\u2019s books published in the last two decades contain diverse themes. Meanwhile, roughly 80 percent of people involved in children\u2019s literature \u2014 authors, illustrators, editors, publishers, etc. \u2014 are white. When people of color constitute roughly 39 percent of the current U.S. population, these numbers convey a serious problem. It has been said that books act as mirrors, allowing readers to reflect on their own identities. Children of color are deprived of the opportunity to truly see themselves in the pages they read, thus made to understand that they can never be the protagonists of their own stories.Too often, multicultural books are pushed aside because they can\u2019t connect with the majority of white readers. But to make such an argument when nonhuman characters are so popular in children\u2019s literature is to suggest that white children have more in common with animals than other children. Moreover, research has continuously shown that reading facilitates empathy and understanding. A study conducted by Laurel Hartmann specifically found that multicultural picture books \u201chelped encourage the students to search for similarities between their own lives and the lives of members of diverse cultures around the world.\u201d Thus, representative books may be just as important for white children as for children of color.In recent years, more and more attention has been brought to this issue. In 2014, an online campaign under the hashtag #WeNeedDiverseBooks turned into a nonprofit organization that advocates for diversity in children\u2019s literature. Independent publishers such as Lee & Low Books, ArtePublico Press\u2019 Pi\u00f1ata Imprint, and Just Us Books have introduced more diverse characters into print. It is up to us to support these efforts to ensure that children of color have a chance to see themselves and be seen, to remember that their stories are just as real, valid and deserving. It is up to us to buy diverse books from local bookstores, contact school libraries to ask for more inclusive selections, and promote minority writers who are representing their communities.And as a young minority writer myself, I am learning to find my voice and to speak out for all those who have lost their own. In doing so, I hope that the writers of the next generation will never learn to silence their heritage as I did.Works CitedHartmann, Laurel K. \u201cUsing Multicultural Literature in the Classroom to Encourage Tolerance and Respect.\u201d MS Thesis.

Beijing\u2019s municipal government is waging a targeted, unethical and destructive campaign against migrant communities.On November 18, 2017, a fire killed 19 people in a blue-collar apartment, prompting China\u2019s capital to initiate a safety blitz against \u201cillegal structures\u201d on its outskirts, seeking to \u201cimprove safety,\u201d according to government officials. Consequently, thousands of migrants living in these low-rent areas were forced to move or leave Beijing entirely with as little as one day\u2019s notice, as their homes and business were destroyed. These mass evictions trample on the human rights of Chinese citizens and were met with unusual public backlash. Over 100 Chinese intellectuals authored an open letter condemning the governmental actions and demanding an immediate termination of the campaign, compensation to the evicted, and increased awareness of the migrants\u2019 rights.Furthermore, the illegitimate displacements pose a serious threat to the psychological health of victims and deprive migrant children of equal access to education. At Yingbo, a private kindergarten in suburban Beijing, dozens of security officers forcibly evacuated students, causing significant trauma. Geoffrey Crothall, the director of China Labour Bulletin, explains that this coldblooded operation \u201creinforced [evictees\u2019] feelings of resentment and social exclusion.\u201dIn fact, this campaign fits into China\u2019s ongoing efforts to shrink Beijing\u2019s population. Home to approximately 21.7 million residents (including 8 million migrants), the city suffers from a \u201cmetropolitan disease\u201d and desperately needs a reduction in size. Last year, the level of annual per capita water resources was one-eightieth of the world average. In 2014, Beijing had the country\u2019s highest rates of congestion and per capita commuting time. In an attempt to transform the overcrowded capital into an upscale metropolis, Beijing aims to cap its population at 23 million by 2020.However, diluting the population of Beijing by evicting migrant workers has an acutely negative impact on the city. A Forbes study shows that the total GDP of Chinese cities is proportional to its migrant population. As Beijing\u2019s population ages, migrants are a vital bulwark against failing social and economic institutions. Li Tie, the president of the China City Development Center, states, \u201cBeijing cannot survive without them.\u201dPolicymakers must consider patterns of urban ecology when reforming Beijing. The government should allow more time for migrant families to move between houses, jobs and schools, as necessary. To empower this vital community, new employment opportunities and relocation compensation should be offered. As Beijing strives to transform into a world-class capital, it must stop treating migrants like second-class citizens.Works Cited\u201cBeijing\u2019s Total Water Consumption Will Be Less Than 4 Billion This Year.\u201d The Beijing News, 18 May 2017.Buckley, Chris. \u201cWhy Part of Beijing Looks Like a Devastated War Zone.\u201d The New York Times. 30 Nov. 2017.Hernandez, Javier and Zhao, Iris. \u201cOne Target in Beijing\u2019s Migrant Crackdown: Schoolchildren.\u201d The New York Times. 24 Dec. 2017.\u201cLi Tie: Beijing Cannot Survive without the Migrants.\u201d Sina Finance. 29 Nov. 2017.Ma, Beibei \u201cBeijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform Analyzes Four Major Causes of the \u2018Metropolitan Disease\u2019 of Beijing.\u201d China Youth Online. 23 Jan. 2016.\u201cNotice on Special Operations for Security Hazard.\u201d Beijing Municipal Work Safety Committee, 20 Nov. 2017.________Abortion is one of the most polarizing topics in the United States. For many on both sides, you\u2019re either with them or against them, and unwilling to compromise. But what if there was a way to reduce abortion rates without blocking women from getting them? The answer is simple: better sex education.For the past few decades there has been a large push to end the abstinence-only sex education implemented by many schools across the U.S. Several studies have found that an abstinence-only education does not work, as it is becoming increasingly unlikely to expect young people to remain abstinent until they are married, considering the increasing age of marriage. There has also been significant evidence that cohesive sex ed classes decrease the chances of unplanned pregnancy and abortion. In theory, abstinence is an idealistic solution, but it has been shown time and time again to be unsuccessful in practice.One program that has actually shown positive results is the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which is evidence-based and funds a wide variety of organizations working to prevent teen pregnancy. In the past decade the CDC has reported the average teenage birthrate has dropped more than 40 percent, due to the help of the TPP and similar programs.After defunding the planned parenthood budget and closing 81 clinics in Texas, teen abortion rates were found to have risen a significant amount. Meanwhile, Colorado offered free birth control, and teen abortions decreased by 42 percent in just 4 years. This is just one example of how it has been shown that limiting access to family planning services such as planned parenthood actually drives up the need for abortions, while providing contraception and informing people of how to be safe drives the need for abortion down. Why is it then that Republican lawmakers continue to slash funding for these organizations?It would be logical to assume that an administration with a pro-life agenda would be eager to decrease abortions in any way they could, however, this seems to not be the case. Regardless of its proven benefits, the Trump administration canceled funding for 81 projects in the TPP program, while increasing funds for abstinence programs. The fact that the government is ignoring fact-based evidence under the guise of being \u201cpro-life\u201d is appalling. It has been shown that quality sex education is highly beneficial, and if the government truly wants to stop abortions from happening, this is the way to do it. Until then, we need to call them out for their blatant hypocrisy and urge legislators to pay attention to the facts, protect the rights of its citizens and remind others to stay informed.Works CitedBaker, Aspen. \u201cA Better Way to Talk about Abortion.\u201d TED: Ideas Worth Spreading, May 2015.Bassett, Laura. \u201cTeen Abortions Surged In Texas After Republicans Defunded Planned Parenthood.\u201d The Huffington Post, 12 July 2017.Bennet, James. \u201cOpinion | The Gathering Threat to Abortion Rights.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 31 Jan. 2018.Bump, Philip. \u201cAnalysis | How America Feels about Abortion.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 24 April 2017.Carroll, Aaron E. \u201cSex Education Based on Abstinence?

Discussions with my peers in the wake of the #MeToo movement have yielded shared feelings of disgust toward these abusers, and horror that we too may be part of the problem. This fear stems not from acknowledgment that we have facilitated harassment, but rather from the uncertainty of what constitutes reprehensible behavior. Our shared worry was not spurred by Harvey Weinstein or Matt Lauer ..., but instead from claims brought against Aziz Ansari. The allegations against Mr. Ansari appeared to be a landmark event, for instead of universally turning favor against him, they divided the community. Some notable feminists, including Bari Weiss, even began to back Ansari. Following the release of the allegations Weiss published an article in The New York Times in which she calls for women to be more vocal about their wishes, and states that lumping Ansari in with other accused abusers \u201ctrivializes what the #MeToo movement first stood for.\u201d This sentiment was shared by my peers. Following the publication of the original expos\u00e9, my morning commute was dominated by debates over whether what Ansari did was wrong, and whether his accuser went too far. The fact that such discussions occurred is evidence of a systematic problem across the younger generations; we are unsure what exactly constitutes inappropriate sexual behavior.The Economist recently published the results of a survey in which participants were asked whether they felt certain actions constituted sexual harassment. The findings were divided by nation, age and gender. The study concluded that in the U.S. there exists both a generational and gender gap. Older generations were shown to be less likely than younger generations to view actions such as commenting on attractiveness to be sexual harassment. Similarly, women were far more likely to view actions as harassment than their male counterparts. The divide demonstrated by the study coupled with the discourse surrounding Ansari paint a picture of a society confused, unsure and anxious. The only viable solution to such sentiments is further education.I propose redefining sexual harassment and restructuring the way young men are taught about relationships. I believe that boys should be taught from a young age what is and is not acceptable, similarly to how young children are taught the difference between a \u201cgood touch\u201d and a \u201cbad touch.\u201d While I understand my claims may be viewed as shortsighted or worse, defensive of predators, my intent is the opposite. We young men know we are the problem and that until we change these issues will still occur. We want to be a part of the solution and long for education.Works Cited\u201cOver-Friendly, or Sexual Harassment?

It\u2019s easy, often helpful, and most importantly: free.But soon, everything about that is going to change.On December 14, 2017, the Federal Commissions Committee (FCC) voted to repeal 2015\u2019s net neutrality rules, officially called Title II. These rules required internet service providers (ISPs) to give equal access to all content online without charging its consumers for higher quality, nor special treatment to certain websites. This repeal may not change the web drastically, but it will take the entire internet as we know it and chuck it down the drain.The ringleader behind the repeal, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, claimed last April that Title II \u201cabandon[s] successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom.\u201d But let\u2019s travel to net-neutrality-free countries like Portugal, where these hypothetical harms are already a reality. Portugal\u2019s wireless carrier, Meo, splits internet access into packages: a package where customers pay for traditional data, plus monthly paying packages for any other sites and apps they use \u2014 entertainment, shopping, communication. For instance, more data for both messaging apps and social networks cost \u20ac4.99 [$5.86] a month each. This means you could be paying up to $140.64 USD a year for both packages. Imagine losing almost $150 a year, just for your favorite messaging and social media sites.But wait, there\u2019s more! With no net neutrality, an ISP could block any access to an app unless the customer or the app company pays up. ISPs who view a site as a competitor, or even disagree with their political views, can be censored.And if Portugal can do that, what\u2019s stopping America from doing the same? Without the safety blanket of net neutrality, what\u2019s stopping them from silencing social movements like Black Lives Matter? Suppressing resources from communities that need them most like women, the LGBT+ and immigrants? It doesn\u2019t just hurt small businesses trying to expand, students living in poverty, or even long-distance relationships relying on the internet to communicate. It blocks any of our voices from being heard.Net neutrality is hanging by a thread, but there\u2019s still a small flicker of hope in the midst of the internet\u2019s impending doomsday. Recently, congressional Democrats introduced a resolution of disapproval to counter the FCC\u2019s repeal. Both the House and Senate must pass it in under 60 days.To my fellow Gen Z kids, and those older too \u2014 the clock is ticking. It\u2019s time to let these people know we want to save our messy, manic and magical internet.Works CitedCollins, Keith. \u201cWhy Net Neutrality Was Repealed and How It Affects You.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Dec. 2017.

In a world where freedom is a luxury, underaged brides watch their aspirations die as they are sold into patriarchal family structures that display the very roots of male dominance. The underage marriage of Indian women must be eradicated in order to protect the interests of women worldwide.According to UNICEF\u2019s Child Marriage Statistics, an estimated 47 percent of girls in India continue to be involuntarily married before the age of eighteen \u2014 leaving them little time to grow and develop their social footing. Misogyny is inevitable for several of these girls \u2014 many of their fathers marry them off in an attempt to increase food rations and investments in men, who are regarded as more valuable in rural Indian societies. Unfortunately, girls are simply seen as a \u201cliability and a burden,\u201d according to Dinesh Shur, a village pastor, in a CBN article detailing child marriage in India.As such, futures remain desolate for child brides in rural India. Their educational careers are left on an indefinite hold as they bear children, often by the time they reach puberty. Instead, they spend their time doing dreary chores for their husband\u2019s families. \u201cAfter marriage, what is my work now? Washing dishes, cleaning the floor, washing clothes and cooking,\u201d states Seema, in an article written by Nel Hedayat that details the life of a child bride. With no education, no work experience and no one to turn to, child brides are left dependent on any support offered by their in-laws.What families don\u2019t realize is that by allowing girls to obtain an education rather than being forced into domestic labor could lead to the socioeconomic advancement of India as this enables potential members of the workforce. Additionally, jobs will provide women with financial security and a voice in a male-dominated society. The New York Times article \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?\u201d states: \u201cWorking, and the control of assets it allows, lowers rates of domestic violence and increases women\u2019s decision-making in the household. And an economy where all the most able citizens can enter the labor force is more efficient and grows faster.\u201dAfter being upheld for thousands of years, child marriage may seem hard to stop; but it is all of our duties to help these girls through supporting and donating to educational, self-defense and women\u2019s rights groups in India. We must strive to make it possible that no young woman will ever have to see a day when a price tag is set upon her self worth and freedom again.Works CitedHedayat, Nel. \u201cWhat Is It like to Be a Child Bride?\u201d BBC News, BBC, 4 Oct. 2011.Pande, Rohini, and Charity Troyer Moore. \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 Aug. 2015.Thomas, George. \u201cIndia\u2019s Innocent: Secret Weddings of Child Brides.\u201d CBN.com \u2014 The Christian Broadcasting Network, 26 March 2017.\u201cUNICEF Child Marriage Statistics.\u201d UNICEF.________It\u2019s a Saturday evening. You\u2019re flipping through the television channels when you stumble upon the movie \u201cShe\u2019s All That.\u201d Or \u201cAnother Cinderella Story.\u201d Or \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d While each may have different characters, plot lines and messages, they are all classified as teen movies, which means they share one common feature: bullying.The bullying that occurs in these films is usually of a specific type: The football player and his buddies see the nerd with his calculator in the hallway and shove him into a locker. The cheerleaders fill the chubby girl\u2019s locker with soda so that when she opens it, she gets drenched. The huge bodybuilder of a senior beats up the scrawny freshman who accidentally bumped his backpack.I don\u2019t know if times have changed or movie writers have just forgotten what it felt like to be in high school, but in my four years of being a student, bullying has rarely been carried out in this manner. More often, it happens in whispers, through subtly closed off circles, through feigned compliments that turn into mocking giggles as soon as backs are turned. It happens over the internet: in group chats that exclude one specific person, in comments of \u201cGORGEOUS!\u201d under an Instagram post that the commenters definitely do not think is gorgeous. This cyberbullying is particularly prevalent in the lives of current teenagers, who have almost unlimited access to social media, and it \u201ccan have such a negative impact \u2026 [and] can do great harm to a whole peer group, or to school culture more generally.\u201d These more subtle types of harassment seem to be more prominent in a high school setting than physical attacks, and hurt much more.Most teen movies fail to capture this kind of bullying accurately, and in this way contribute to an unrealistic view of high school life. Bullying can have very strong effects on teenagers, \u201ccausing depression and anxiety \u2026 disrupting [teenagers\u2019] sleep, [and] causing gastrointestinal issues and headaches.\u201d If movies continue to portray bullying in the wrong way, not only may these symptoms be increased as teenagers begin to feel that their own experiences are invalid, but people will not be able to recognize true bullying behaviors. Kids are taught constantly in school not to be a bystander, but even the most noble of students cannot be expected to intervene when they don\u2019t realize that someone is being bullied. Teen movie writers need to take on the responsibility that comes with targeting the adolescent demographic, and complete research and focus groups to make sure that they are portraying one of the most common experiences in teenage life accurately. This, if nothing else, they owe to their viewers.Works CitedKlass, Perri. \u201cIn the Fight Against Bullying, a Glimmer of Hope.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 Dec. 2017.Strickland, Ashley. \u201cBullying Is a \u2018Serious Public Health Problem,\u2019 Experts Say.\u201d CNN, CNN, 21 June 2017._________\u201cI swear, I\u2019m so OCD,\u201d the girl says after neatly placing a bundle of colored pencils into a decorated pouch. I offer an awkward laugh, but all I can think about is my friend, who\u2019s OCD keeps him from going to school and hanging out with friends, or the article I read that says people with OCD are 10 times more likely than people without to commit suicide.

Even I\u2019ve done it. Most of the time there\u2019s no malice, but comments like these, which trivialize serious illnesses, feed a society that stigmatizes the mentally ill, isolating them and making it impossible for them to live fulfilling lives.Using mental illnesses like descriptive adjectives and not serious disorders is trivializing, and contributes to the stigmatization of those afflicted. NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) estimates that 1 in 5 Americans suffers from a mental illness, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. \u2014 claiming well over 41,000 lives a year. In simpler words, mental illness is a big deal; such a big deal the World Health Organization sites depression \u2014 just one of many mental illnesses \u2014 as the leading cause of disability. So why do we act like they\u2019re not by using them as descriptors or for cheap laughs?Mental illness stigma leads to misunderstandings about the conditions and can create barriers to accessing treatment. In the New York Times piece \u201cAlone With My Husband\u2019s Secret,\u201d Carolyn Ali writes of her husband\u2019s struggle with depression. Even after telling his wife, he asked to keep his condition a secret from his family members because of fear of their reaction. Ali says the experience also took a tremendous toll on her. She wonders why these surprisingly common experiences are kept secret and why the stigma exists. This is just one story, but it underscores what experts say about stigma being a major cause of under-treatment.Although there are many things that lead to the stigmatization of mental illness, and many reasons for treatment barriers, the trivializing of these conditions through jokes and minimization of the severity of the conditions is contributing to the exacerbation of the problem. It can be easily addressed through increased understanding of the words we use to describe experiences and ourselves. Recognizing how serious these disorders are and choosing not to use them as merely descriptors for an exaggerated situation is one small step to a society where stigma won\u2019t prevent those from getting the treatment that they need.Works CitedAli, Carolyn. \u201cAlone With My Husband\u2019s Secret.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 Feb. 2018.Hawkes, Nigel. \u201cStigma Is Leading to under-Treatment of Mental Health Conditions, Says Leading Psychiatrist.\u201d The BMJ, British Medical Journal Publishing Group, 21 April 2016.\u201cMental Health By The Numbers.\u201d NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness, 12 March 2018.\u201cPatients with OCD Are 10 Times More Likely to Commit Suicide.\u201d ScienceDaily, ScienceDaily, 19 July 2016.Wilkerson, Abby L. \u201cShould I Tell My Students I Have Depression?\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Dec. 2016._______As R. David Lankes once said, \u201cBad libraries build collections, good libraries build services, and great libraries build communities.\u201d In an age where access to the internet is becoming more and more prevalent in people\u2019s lives, some argue that libraries are more of a financial burden than a benefit to society. However, libraries are more than an obsolete source of information. They are places of community and opportunity still important to this day, and thus should not be discarded but adapted for modern purposes.According to the Editorial Board from The New York Times, in 2015 more people visited New York\u2019s libraries than all the baseball stadiums, sports arenas, city-owned museums, gardens and zoos combined. This could be due to the fact that \u201cvirtually all libraries provide free access to the internet [and] WiFi\u201d as reported by the American Library Association. For some, libraries are even a safe haven. One woman called Sandra recalled, \u201c[Libraries were] a space to feel safe. During my high school years of hormone induced mental imbalance, I knew that I could depend on my local library.\u201d The continued use of libraries and the invaluable services they offer, such as technology training and workshops, proves the necessity of libraries in the modern world.Even more than a library\u2019s usefulness for information and support, they also provide a place for the city\u2019s community to gather. The American Library Association found that libraries have been used for book clubs, classes, forums and more. From study groups to citywide events, libraries are the ideal location for people to come together. And in an age where people\u2019s lives are becoming increasingly digitized and secluded, community is all the more important. As a high school student who utilizes the library at least once a week, I can sincerely say that I have built friendships between those bookshelves.Some people may argue that libraries still cling to archaic methods, which extremely diminishes their useful potential. And some libraries are indeed losing their effectiveness by sticking with old routines as the world shifts to a digital face. But many libraries have already adapted wonderfully to the changes. From starting online ebook libraries to integrating new software into their systems, these libraries prove that the answer is not to shut down libraries, but to help them change.Libraries are invaluable for their services, support and the opportunities they offer for the community. By helping them to adapt to current technology and modern techniques, we can ensure that libraries will continue to benefit their cities. So support your local library and take advantage of its services. Maybe you\u2019ll learn something new, or make an unexpected friend. And who knows? You may even read a book while you\u2019re there.Works Cited\u201cALA Library Fact Sheet 6.\u201d American Library Association.The Editorial Board. \u201cNew York City\u2019s Libraries Need Money.\u201d The New York Times.

Unfortunately, this is exactly the life of women in Saudi Arabia, where the treatment of women restricts their fundamental human rights.During my two years living in Dubai and Qatar, I went to Saudi Arabia three times with my father where I witnessed their discriminatory policies. In a mall in Riyadh, I was shocked to see a woman awkwardly eating noodles without taking off the veil of her niqab. She used a fork to lift the noodles toward the eye-opening, and slightly pulled the lower part away from her face, then pointed the fork down so the noodles would slide onto the inside of the veil without revealing her face.As it turns out, the Saudi government strictly prohibits women in public from ever taking off their niqabs. Saudi Arabia claims these restrictions are to ensure \u201cwomen\u2019s modesty\u201d commanded by Allah. Yet, not only are these restrictions undignifying, the Quran calls for \u201cboth men and women \u2018to cover and be modest.\u2019\u201d The fact that the Saudi government only restrict women reveals a double standard.However demeaning the requirement of wearing a niqab in public might be, it is only one symptom of a system that restricts women\u2019s fundamental rights. According to Human Rights Watch, Saudi females\u2019 lives are controlled by male guardians from birth to death due to its unique guardianship system. As hundreds of Saudi females have attested, this is a most inhuman policy as the male guardian decides whether \u201chis\u201d woman can see a doctor or even leave prison. Presumably, Saudi leadership, composed entirely of men, believes that women are unable to make the types of decisions that men make. Over time, the system gradually changes Saudi women\u2019s mind-sets, reducing them to men\u2019s property, even in their hearts. Rania, a 34-year-old Saudi woman, said, \u201cWe are entrusted with raising the next generation but you can\u2019t trust us with ourselves. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dWhile the Saudi government argues that these policies are protecting women, they have nothing to do with protection and everything to do with dehumanization. However, President Trump has proposed multiple economic collaborations with Saudi Arabia, and during his recent meeting with Prince Salman, \u201cover 20 people were at the table, yet none were women.\u201d This symbolic irony along with other policies reveal the U.S. government\u2019s unwillingness to address this gender disparity.It is time for our free nation to push for urgently-needed reforms by placing conditions of ending human rights violations to U.S.-Saudi trade deals. Instead of ignoring these human rights abuses, the United States of America should show the world that abuses are not tolerated.Works Cited\u201cBoxed In: Women and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Male Guardianship System.\u201d Human Rights Watch, 6 June 2017.Cochrane, Emily. \u201cOver 20 People Were at the Table When Trump Met the Saudis.

That is, well, tobacco in the form of cigarettes. Now, because of vape pens \u2014 technology that delivers nicotine through heated oils \u2014 American youth are experiencing the rapid rebranding of our favorite vice. While vape companies such as Juul are capitalizing on the image of a sleeker, less carcinogenic way of getting buzzed, vaping is simply a method of concealing nicotine use, without eliminating any of its physiological consequences. The discreet nature of vaping and the game of cat and mouse that it inspires between teachers and students is prompting a psychological shift among youth that enables drug consumption, while masquerading as doing the opposite.Joe Camel, the icon of tobacco conglomerate R.J. Reynolds, was executed in 1997, after nearly a decade of representing the Camel brand of cigarettes. The reasoning behind the federal government\u2019s decision to outlaw the swaggering camel was that he made smoking seem carefree and enticing to youth. Currently we are experiencing a more subtle version of the Joe Camel, in which vape pens such as Juul are reclaiming fun, risqu\u00e9 smoking. Not only do vapers have a nearly endless array of flavors to choose from, they also have apparatus that can disappear in a closed fist, according to a review of the Juul pen by NPR, in which owning a Juul is like a badge of honor. \u201cY\u2019all this kid came into my 7th period to get a juul and we all started laughing when he left so the teacher was really confused,\u201d according to @hyphyybriannaa, quoted in the study.A recent Times report on vaping attributes vaping partially to a decline in teenage cigarette smoking. While vaping is indeed helping teens move away from more carcinogenic forms of consuming nicotine, it also has the detrimental effect of making drug use seem more commonplace, cosmetic and convenient. After all, some brands of vaporizer can be charged in a laptop USB port, and concealed all day for undetectable puffing. Vaping might in fact just be hiding the harmful effect of drugs through a sleek image. In the National Institute on Drug Abuse study cited in the Times report, 51.8 percent of teens surveyed claimed that the substance inside vaporizers was \u201cjust liquid.\u201dDoes better technology make drug use permissive? No, but it certainly makes it easier. Vape pens are likely going to be short-lived in schools, which will make them only more appealing to youth. In order to truly lessen drug use, government and schools have to go after image, not just drugs themselves.Works CitedChen, Angus. \u201cTeenagers Embrace JUUL, Saying It\u2019s Discreet Enough To Vape In Class.\u201d NPR. 4 December 2017.Elliot, Stuart. \u201cJoe Camel, a Giant in Tobacco Marketing, Is Dead at 23.\u201d The New York Times. 11 July 1997.Hoffman, Jan. \u201cMarijuana and Vaping Are More Popular Than Cigarettes Among Teenagers.\u201d The New York Times. 14 December 2017.________Since 1970, the global Catholic population has nearly doubled. At the same time, 5,000 fewer priests are active in the Church, creating a worldwide priest shortage in which more than 20 percent of parishes lack a resident priest. To address this crisis, the Catholic Church should end the ban on female ordination.Although most supporters of a male-only clergy cite Church tradition, ordaining women only chafes against modern constraints. In fact, the Church didn\u2019t change their rules on ordination in this respect until the 11th century. To be clear, this means women served as priests, deaconesses and even bishops for nearly 1000 years. In the early Middle Ages, the changing Church not only closed these roles to men, but attempted to change contemporary and ancient records to obscure that women ever served in these roles, a campaign that has been remarkably successful through modern times.If tradition is not enough proof, then perhaps Scripture itself provides a better basis. In Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans, he refers to \u201cour sister Phoebe, a deacon\u201d (Rom 16:1). Further, his letter to the Galatians states that \u201cIn Christ there is no Jew or Greek, slave or citizen, male or female. All are one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Gal 3:28). Even the Gospels show the importance of women to Jesus\u2019s ministry. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is widely accepted as the first disciple, and the first Apostles, or witnesses to the Resurrection, are all women, including Mary Magdalene, who reveals the news to the initially disbelieving male disciples. When it comes to celebrating the Resurrection, the purpose of a Catholic Mass, Scripture proves women are equally qualified to do so.If there ever was a time to expand the priesthood, it is now. The Francis Effect has expanded the laity in new ways, welcoming lapsed Catholics disillusioned by social positions of the Church and the sexual abuse scandal, as well as LGBT Catholics. The energy of young people on the side of the Francis Effect can and should be harnessed by a movement to allow women to fulfill their vocation to the priesthood.However, proponents of ordaining women should acknowledge the difficulty of any movement in an institution as reluctant to change as the Church. Some dioceses in the United States don\u2019t even allow girls to altar serve, and Pope Francis, the face of the inclusive Church movement, has made clear his opposition to ordaining women. Still, if Church leaders want to recruit more priests to end the shortage, they would be wise to open the position to the other half of the population.Works CitedEgan, Timothy. \u201cA Francis Effect for a Broken System.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 24 Sept. 2015.\u201cFrequently Requested Church Statistics.\u201d CARA, Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, 2017.Macy, Gary. \u201cThe Hidden History of Women\u2019s Ordination: Female Clergy in the Medieval West.\u201d Oxford University Press, 2008._________In 1997, Tarana Burke was working at a youth camp when a 13-year-old girl told Ms. Burke that her stepfather had been sexually abusing her. Tarana was left speechless \u2014 what could she tell the girl, and hundreds of others in her position, that would convey that she understood and felt their pain? Ten years after that conversation, Ms. Burke finally found what she needed to say: me too.As a survivor of child sexual assault, I have been waiting for these two words for a very long time \u2014 seeing the #MeToo movement explode empowered me to share my experiences with others after years of being silent. The #MeToo movement brought me to a place in which I felt that I could openly discuss my experience without judgment or victim blaming. Saying #MeToo is a statement of understanding like no other. But what must remain fundamental is that the movement is about more than awareness and empathy. It is also about changes to laws and policies that perpetuate the imbalance of power between men and women. It is about challenging social norms and a culture in which the victim is instinctively blamed for the crime.This issue requires us, as a society, to examine ourselves and our culture that allows and encourages this type of behavior. At some point, we must ask ourselves if the \u201cproblem\u201d of sexual assault is an unintended consequence or the purposeful product of a system designed to systematically isolate, silence and marginalize those with lesser power. A report from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that 75 percent of workplace harassment incidents go unreported \u2014 for those who did speak out, 75 percent faced retaliation from their employer. A matter of such magnitude cannot be mended on a case-by-case basis. Comprehensively fixing this issue starts with providing women effective reporting options beyond filing a complaint with HR or talking to their managers \u2014 options that often have only the company\u2019s best interest at heart \u2014 and giving women decision-making roles in which they have the same chance for success as men.Although the #MeToo movement is not exempt from criticism, those who call it as a \u201cmoral panic\u201d are misdiagnosing it. What #MeToo is a social movement that finally holds powerful men accountable for their actions; as author David Perry writes, #MeToo is not an act of persecution, but rather a rebellion against the powers that persecute. In order for our culture to change and in order for future generations to grow up in an equitable world, we must build on #MeToo as a vehicle for reform in our courts, workplaces and schools. It is a wake-up call and an opportunity to inspire genuine change \u2014 an opportunity that we cannot waste.Works CitedBeck, Richard. \u201c#MeToo Is Not a Witch Hunt.\u201d Vox. 11 Jan. 2018.Bennett, Jessica. \u201cThe #MeToo Moment: No Longer Complicit.\u201d The New York Times. 7 Dec. 2017.Campbell, Alexia Fernandez. \u201cHow the Legal System Fails Victims of Sexual Harassment.\u201d Vox. 30 March 2018.Garcia, Sandra. \u201cThe Woman Who Created #MeToo Long Before the Hashtag.\u201d The New York Times. 20 Oct. 2017.Golshan, Tara. \u201cStudy Finds 75 Percent of Workplace Harassment Victims Experienced Retaliation When They Spoke Up.\u201d Vox. 15 Oct. 2017.Gorman, Michele. \u201c1 in 4 Women Experienced Sexual Assault in College, Survey Finds.\u201d Newsweek. 21 Sept. 2015.Guerra, Cristela. \u201cWhere\u2019d the \u2018Me Too\u2019 Initiative Really Come From?

{"Headline": "Putin Sees an Opening in Europe\u2019s Fury With Trump", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in Austria on Tuesday sensing an opportunity almost unimaginable just months ago: to overhaul frosty relations with a European Union infuriated by President Trump on a host of issues, from climate and Iran to, most recently, tariffs and trade.Never mind that Mr. Putin was until recently virtually a pariah in Europe after his military interventions in Ukraine, Crimea and Syria; after meddling in European elections and working hard to foment right-wing populist uprisings throughout the Continent; after polluting the political environment with fake news; and after allegedly poisoning a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain, charges Russia denies.Mr. Putin was now gaining considerable traction by casting himself as a reliable friend and trading partner to Europe even as the Trump administration was treating its closest allies there as strategic and economic competitors.Though careful not to gloat, Mr. Putin had to take great satisfaction in the recent turn of events. Often dismissed as a tactician and opportunist, he was looking more like a grand strategist as Mr. Trump bluntly rejected European demands for an exemption from what Brussels considers illegal and unilateral tariffs on steel and aluminum.Populist, Russophile parties are in power in Greece, Hungary, Italy and Austria. The prospect of attaining Mr. Putin\u2019s immediate goal of throwing off economic sanctions imposed by the European Union over the last several years suddenly seemed within reach, even without compromise in Ukraine.Indeed, in recent days, with the G-7 meeting of the world\u2019s largest advanced economies looming, Mr. Trump has had unusually bad-tempered telephone calls on the tariff issue with both the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the British prime minister, Theresa May.The Germans and Canadians are furious about the tariffs, too. Washington justifies them even to its NATO allies on what they dismiss as the specious grounds of \u201cnational security.\u201dThese tensions will be on display this weekend at the G-7 meeting in Canada. That normally American-dominated meeting is likely to see Mr. Trump isolated on the issue of trade, six against one.Such internal divisions probably amuse Mr. Putin, who saw Russia \u201csuspended\u201d from what was the G-8 after the annexation of Crimea, but who now sees a far more welcoming landscape in Europe.Austria, officially neutral, has always had close ties to Moscow and takes over the revolving European Union presidency next month. Austria\u2019s young chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, refused to expel any Russian diplomats following the poisoning of the ex-spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter Yulia.In contrast, most other European allies and the United States readily lined up behind Britain and were quick to isolate Russia diplomatically. More than two dozen countries ejected more than 150 Russians, including people listed by their embassies and consulates as diplomats, and military and cultural attach\u00e9s.Mr. Kurz is in a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, which in 2016 signed a partnership agreement with Mr. Putin\u2019s own United Russia Party and has called for economic sanctions to be lifted.The new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told the Italian Senate on Tuesday that it was time for \u201can opening toward Russia,\u201d which he said had \u201cstrengthened its position\u201d in various international crises. He called for lifting sanctions against Russia that he said harm \u201cRussian civil society.\u201dThe admiration of Mr. Putin is real from France\u2019s far-right National Front, too, as well as from the leftist populist government in Greece and the far-right opposition party in Germany, Alternative for Germany. And there are strong suspicions that all these parties benefit from Russian funding, according to Western intelligence agencies.In the interview with the Austrian state channel ORF, Mr. Putin said that Russia\u2019s ties to such parties were merely fraternal, with no strategic motive. Russia, he said, wants to cooperate with those who want to cooperate with Moscow.\u201cThis alone is the reason why our political parties, groups and movements have contacts at the political and party level with certain European ones, and not the wish to \u2018rock\u2019 or impede something within the European Union,\u201d he said.But Austria is clearly a friendly gateway for Moscow. Mr. Putin said that the two countries had maintained \u201cvery good and close relations,\u201d adding that Austria had traditionally been Russia\u2019s \u201ctrusted partner in Europe.\u201dMr. Kurz harks back to Austria\u2019s self-styled Cold War role as a mediator.\u201cWe want to be a bridge between East and West, and keep the lines of communication with Russia open,\u201d he has said. That has traditionally translated into a belief that dialogue is the answer to every confrontation, from the Georgian war and the annexation of Crimea to the poisoning in Britain and Russia\u2019s support for the Syrian regime.Stefan Lehne, a former Austrian diplomat, said that the Austrian sympathy for Russia is decades-long, based on the history of neutrality, economic interests, pragmatism and an \u201celement of anti-Americanism,\u201d the view that \u201call big powers behave similarly.\u201d He noted that Mr. Putin had been invited to Austria within months of the annexation of Crimea. But so far, he said, Austria has gone along with the European consensus on sanctions.But with Italy and Greece pushing to end them, that may not continue.Mr. Putin would clearly like to end his isolation. In his current term as president, Mr. Putin has two clear goals, said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research institution.\u201cFirst, to keep Russia together, and that\u2019s a helluva job, and second, to make Russia a great power again and seen to be one,\u201d Mr. Trenin said last weekend at a conference in Estonia.To accomplish those goals, however, \u201cyou need economic success.\u201d And for that, Mr. Putin needs European financing, energy markets and technology, Mr. Trenin said. Mr. Putin also wants good relations with Europe, he said, to concentrate on his real priority, which is China, a rising neighboring power with resource needs and ambitions.\u201cI do think we have to reconnect with Russia,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.Both Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Mr. Macron visited Russia at the end of May to discuss salvaging the Iran deal. And Mr. Macron complained at a conference in St. Petersburg about the damage being done to world trade \u2014 clearly alluding to Mr. Trump.Mr. Macron, the guest of honor, was particularly effusive in evoking the cultural and historical links that tie Russia to the rest of Europe.Ms. Merkel, who has few illusions about Mr. Putin and has been vital to maintaining economic sanctions against Russia, also finds herself and her country a particular target of Mr. Trump. In addition to the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Germany can live with, he is now threatening unilateral tariffs on imported cars, which it cannot.He has also raised the prospect of tariffs on those companies involved with building Nordstream II, an energy pipeline from Russia to Germany that entirely bypasses Ukraine.Austria was the first country to import Russian energy 50 years ago, another reason for Mr. Putin\u2019s visit, and Europe now gets a third of its gas supply from Russia, a figure likely to increase.At the same time, both Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron noted the nagging sores that continue to infect relations with Moscow, including the continuing wars in Ukraine and Syria. Ms. Merkel underscored that both were impediments to better ties, and there seems little movement possible from Moscow on either front.Many European governments remain deeply concerned about Russian meddling in their internal politics, ranging from spreading false information on social media to fostering far-right opposition to trying to widen divisions among European states themselves over Russia.Still, Russia is cognizant of the fact that Mr. Trump has created a sudden opportunity for them.\u201cA battle for Russia has begun in international politics!\u201d Vladimir R. Solovyov, the host of a prime-time talk show on Russian state-run television that often reflects the government line, said on Sunday. \u201cEurope is compelled to change its policies on the fly since Trump has declared a trade war.\u201dVladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to the European Union, said on Tuesday, \u201cI am closely watching how the situation evolves and when the necessary volume of political will is there \u2014 and I see this tendency \u2014 then the E.U. perhaps will take the necessary decision to change its course.\u201dSteven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow. Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, and Milan Schreuer from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Two Suitors for Fox, the Murdochs Consider Next Steps", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt stake are cable channels including FX and National Geographic, the \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cX-Men\u201d film franchises, and a pair of international television networks. It may stoke visions of blistering negotiations between high-powered media executives with big egos barking into phones or ruminating in closed-door meetings, but there are rules of engagement around mergers that are designed to civilize the process.Fox and its chairman, Rupert Murdoch, will have a lot of say over how the process is managed.How will Mr. Murdoch and his board of directors proceed? Here\u2019s a breakdown of what to expect.It\u2019s not as simple as saying Comcast\u2019s $65 billion offer is larger than Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion deal.First, Fox has to decide if Comcast\u2019s financing is good, just as someone selling a home wants to make sure the buyer has secured a mortgage. Also, the currency of both offers is different. Comcast is offering cash, while Disney is paying with its stock, which could carry some tax benefits and rise in value in the long run.Fox also wants to be confident that any bid would be approved by the government.The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates broadcasters, isn\u2019t a factor. Disney\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t undergoing F.C.C. review, and Comcast said its offer shouldn\u2019t be subject to F.C.C. approval since there wouldn\u2019t be any transfer of broadcast licenses. The Fox broadcast network, Fox News and the sports network FS1 aren\u2019t being sold.That leaves the Justice Department, which was dealt a blistering defeat last week in its attempt to block another media merger: AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner.That outcome could help Comcast, which will be challenged on two fronts: as a content distributor, through its cable and broadband service, and as a content provider, via its NBCUniversal division.When announcing his company\u2019s bid for Fox last week, Brian L. Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, said he was \u201chighly confident that our proposed transaction will obtain all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and that our transaction is as or more likely to receive regulatory approval than the Disney transaction.\u201dHowever, Fox owns 22 regional sports networks, such as the Yankees\u2019 YES channel in the New York area. Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal group already operates nine regional sports networks, while Disney has control of ESPN, the dominant cable sports channel in the country. The Justice Department could see either of these combinations as potentially stifling competition.Mr. Murdoch and his board will want to see which side has crafted the better regulatory maneuver. Both Disney and Comcast are willing to divest the regional sports networks should the government require.Separately, Hulu would come under the control of either Comcast or Fox \u2014 both of which currently own portions of the streaming service. The Justice Department could see Comcast as a possible threat here since it is also the largest broadband provider in the country. Disney is just a programmer. But according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss company deliberations, Comcast would also consider selling Fox\u2019s 30 percent ownership of Hulu as a concession.In other words, it might be a regulatory wash.If so, then it comes back to which offer is better. Mr. Murdoch is said to have favored Disney\u2019s offer last year, partly because an all-stock transaction would not require an immediate tax payment. Comcast\u2019s bid is all cash and would be taxable right away.Insiders, however, say the Murdoch family \u2014 the elder son, Lachlan, is Fox\u2019s executive chairman, and his brother, James, is chief executive \u2014 will advocate for the best offer, regardless of the tax implications. The board, after all, has a duty to its shareholders to maximize their returns. Even a Disney stock deal would ultimately incur a tax hit once an investor cashed in those shares.Investors with a significant ownership in Fox are already smiling.\u201cAs a Fox shareholder, I\u2019m the happiest guy in the world,\u201d said Mario J. Gabelli, chief executive of the investment firm Gamco Investors. \u201cI have a bidding war for one of my largest holdings. I have over $500 million in this, and I think it\u2019s terrific.\u201dIf the Murdochs and the board determine Comcast has the superior offer, they will alert the Disney chief, Robert A. Iger, and his directors of their new preference, and the July 10 shareholder meeting will be void.Disney then has five business days to respond. If Disney returns with a counter bid Fox likes, the ball is back in Comcast\u2019s court.But unlike Disney, Comcast wouldn\u2019t have the luxury of time.That\u2019s because it has to negotiate within the confines of the merger agreement already laid out between Disney and Fox, which has built in some protections for Disney, specifically what is known as the right of last refusal. In other words, Disney will always have a chance to counter Comcast until it decides it has had enough.There is still a potential gray area in the process. Before Fox officially notifies either party, it could try to stoke a higher bid by hinting of its intentions. This is where some gamesmanship could come into play.But whether Disney or Comcast winds up with the assets, it is Mr. Murdoch who will be the real winner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Is the World Mitch McConnell Gave Us", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. MacGillis is the author of a biography of Mitch McConnell.There is an unusual space in the basement of the University of Louisville library, in the large anteroom to the official archives for Senator Mitch McConnell. The space is called the Civic Education Gallery, but it is, essentially, a kind of shrine to the political career of Mr. McConnell, not unlike the exhibits on Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron you\u2019d find at the Baseball Hall of Fame.The mere fact of the shrine is curious enough, given that it memorializes a politician who shows no sign of leaving the stage any time soon. What\u2019s most unusual, though, is what it chooses to highlight. There are a few artifacts from Mr. McConnell\u2019s youth \u2014 his baseball glove, his honorary fraternity paddle \u2014 but most of the exhibits are devoted to the elections Mr. McConnell won, starting with high school and on up through Jefferson County executive and the Senate.When I visited the room while researching my 2014 biography on Mr. McConnell, I was struck by what was missing: exhibits on actual governing accomplishments from the Senate majority leader\u2019s four decades in elected office. That absence confirmed my thesis that Mr. McConnell, far more even than other politicians, was motivated by the game of politics \u2014 winning elections and rising in the leadership ranks, achieving power for power\u2019s sake \u2014 more than by any lasting policy goals.Mr. McConnell has created the world in which we are now living. Donald Trump dominates our universe \u2014 and now has the power to fill the second Supreme Court seat in two years. Mitch McConnell, who has promised a vote on whomever the president nominates \u201cthis fall,\u201d is the figure who was quietly making it all possible, all along.First, there was Mr. McConnell\u2019s vigorous defense, going back to the early 1990s, of the role of big money in American politics, which would help Mr. Trump not so much in terms of funding his campaign, but in helping shape the conditions for his appeal.While Mr. McConnell has long cast his defense of campaign spending as a First Amendment issue \u2014 money is speech \u2014 he made no secret of his motivation for fighting so hard on the issue. Namely, that he was well aware that he, as someone lacking in natural campaign talents, and the rest of the Republican Party, as more business-oriented than the Democrats, would need to maintain the flow of large contributions to be able to win elections. \u201cI will always be well financed, and I\u2019ll be well financed early,\u201d he declared after winning his first race for county executive, in 1977.His crusade against campaign finance reform culminated in the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United ruling eliminating limits on corporate spending on elections, which Mr. McConnell followed up by blocking legislation to disclose the identity of large donors. Even before that ruling, the spread of big money in politics had done so much to sour the public on government, creating a ripe target for the Tea Party and, later, for a billionaire populist running against \u201cthe swamp.\u201dMr. McConnell laid the groundwork for the right-wing insurgency of 2009 and 2010 in another way, too, with his decision to withhold Republican support for any major Democratic initiatives in the Obama years. This meant that Republicans had less influence on the final shape of legislation such as the Affordable Care Act than they would have had as fully willing negotiators.But Mr. McConnell, prioritizing elections over policy, calculated that by blocking or delaying Democratic legislation, above all through aggressive use of the filibuster, Republicans would create a tedious gridlock that voters would blame the Democrats for. After all, weren\u2019t they the ones in power?Mr. McConnell was right. This strategy helped to foment opposition to the health care bill, and to drive huge Republican gains in the 2010 election. But it also fueled the rise of the Tea Party, which was motivated substantially by the notion that Mr. Obama was \u201cramming things down our throats\u201d \u2014 that is, passing legislation on a partisan basis after Mr. McConnell withheld any Republican negotiation. Of course, Mr. McConnell proceeded to have plenty of headaches managing the far-right contingent in his own caucus, but it was a contingent he helped produce.His role in the election of Mr. Trump was even more direct. Most notable was his refusal to hold a confirmation hearing, let alone a vote on Merrick Garland, Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, despite the fact that the nomination was made a full 10 months before the end of Mr. Obama\u2019s term. This refusal exploded norms and dismayed Beltway arbiters who had long accepted Mr. McConnell\u2019s claim to be a guardian of Washington institutions. It also provided crucial motivation to Republicans who had grave qualms about Mr. Trump but were able to justify voting for him as \u201csaving Scalia\u2019s seat.\u201dThe abortion and union rulings had an ironic resonance, as far as Mr. McConnell goes. In the 1970s, when he ran for county executive in Louisville, he secured the pivotal endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. by pledging to back collective bargaining for public employees (a promise that went unfulfilled), and while in office he worked effectively behind the scenes to protect abortion rights locally.Whether Mr. McConnell decides to add an exhibit in the Civic Education Gallery documenting his role in the rise of Donald Trump is another matter. The final historical judgment on that score will not rest with him, in any case.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York City\u2019s $89 Billion Budget Includes Discount Transit Fare Plan", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, shook hands Monday on a $89.2 billion city budget that included a major concession by the mayor to provide funding for discounted subway and bus fares for some of the poorest New Yorkers.The budget continues the sustained rise in spending that has come on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s watch. It is $4 billion more than the previous budget, including $254 million more for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, called for by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and initially resisted by the mayor.The budget was the first that Mr. de Blasio had to negotiate with Mr. Johnson, who was selected as the Council speaker in January on a pledge to make the city\u2019s legislative body more independent of the mayor. The Council is expected to approve the budget on Thursday.The mayor said that while he supported the idea, he believed that it should be paid for with a dedicated tax on high-income earners \u2014 something that would require state action. But Mr. Johnson and his colleagues persisted.At one point last month, during a late-night negotiating session with the mayor at Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence, people briefed on the interaction said Mr. Johnson walked out after Mr. de Blasio offered a much smaller number to finance the fare subsidy. (City Hall has disputed that account.)\u201cWhat have we achieved over five years now with these budgets?\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategic investment concept.\u201d He said that city spending on the police had made New York the safest big city in the country, and that spending on early childhood education had improved public schools, which made the city more appealing to residents and businesses and supported economic growth. \u201cI think these were very smart investments,\u201d he added.The budget announced includes $106 million for the Fair Fares program. That is expected to be enough to pay for the subsidy for six months, with further financing to come in future budgets.The budget also includes $125 million to be set aside as a financial reserve, in addition to the $1 billion in reserves that Mr. de Blasio has maintained as a general reserve in previous spending plans.Mr. Johnson had pushed a property tax relief plan that would have given a $400 rebate to many homeowners, but that proposal was left out of the budget agreement.The budget reflects a one-time boost in city revenues from the repatriation last year of offshore hedge fund and corporate money; those movements were in response to the recent federal tax law changes and an earlier change closing a loophole relating to hedge fund managers.While the lead-up to the budget agreement included sometimes tense wrangling between the mayor\u2019s office and the Council, Monday\u2019s event was jocular and full of good cheer.When Mr. Johnson jumped the gun on the ceremonial handshake, Mr. de Blasio joked: \u201cThe protocol has been violated! Shut down the press conference!\u201dIt also highlighted the altered dynamic between the mayor and the city\u2019s legislative body, with the Council under Mr. Johnson embracing its role at center stage.The spending plan included other Council priorities, including $150 million in capital budget spending to make schools more accessible for disabled students.Mr. de Blasio acknowledged that pressure from the Council persuaded him to give up on his opposition to the subsidized MetroCard.\u201cI believe that Speaker Johnson said the words \u2018Fair Fares\u2019 to me an unfair number of times,\u201d the mayor said, drawing laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s a profoundly good and moral idea. I felt that from the beginning. The challenge was always how to make it work.\u201dMr. de Blasio said that the passion of Mr. Johnson and the Council mattered to him, as did their agreement that the new spending would not go to the M.T.A. \u2014 the program will be administered by the city. They also agreed, he said, that additional funding for the authority, elsewhere in the budget, would be a one-time payment and did not represent a long-term increase in city support for the transit system.Mr. Johnson gave a speech that was almost as long as the mayor\u2019s, while Mr. de Blasio sat beside him nodding. Later, Laurie Cumbo, the Democratic majority leader, commandeered the microphone and led dozens of Council members in a cheer for Mr. Johnson.\u201cLet\u2019s give it up for Corey!\u201d she said, before giving bouquets of flowers to Mr. Johnson, the Council Finance Committee chairman Daniel Dromm and other Council and staff members.\u201cAnd Mr. Mayor, we didn\u2019t forget about you,\u201d she said, handing him his bouquet last.\u201cI was reliving high school here,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I wouldn\u2019t get flowers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To keep ideas flowing and creative assets centralized, Topps looked to Dropbox Paper, a collaborative online workspace where teams can generate new ideas and manage the entire creative process. In Dropbox Paper, Topps has cataloged each of the whopping 4.5 billion digital cards it has created since 2012. The Topps \u201ccatalog\u201d also acts as a wellspring of new ideas.

The companies recognized that growth \u2014 personal and professional \u2014 came from meaningful collaboration and culturally driven creative energy. As Vita Coco and Topps applied Dropbox across their organizations, organic teamwork took form and transformative ideas sprang forward.  \u201cWe try to create an environment where people are empowered to be creative,\u201d Olney says. \u201cI think our biggest fear is that one of our employees would have to show up in the office and go right to their cubicle to do reports all day while a manager manages them.\u201cThat's the day the collaborative culture we\u2019ve built dies.\u201dStudies about the intensifying grind and soaring levels of work stress have awoken us to the reality that the workplace has become harmful to our health and personal growth. Instead of treating symptoms of the grind, businesses need to examine root causes like mind-numbing busywork, pervasive groupthink and unstructured teamwork. As Topps and Vita Coco demonstrate, Dropbox can help businesses at various stages build cultures that are firmly rooted in meaningful teamwork, diversity of thought and boundless creative energy.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

I\u2019m a disciplined member of the A.N.C.\u201dMr. Zuma demurred, insisting there was no need to resign, Mr. Pillay said. Instead, the president dealt with the issue himself a few months later: He abruptly replaced Mr. Pillay with a loyalist who led a sweeping purge of the tax agency, setting off a blistering national scandal that is threatening South Africa in unexpected ways.Wielding a barrage of fictitious news stories and doctored assertions by one of the world\u2019s biggest auditing firms, KPMG, Mr. Zuma managed to thwart scrutiny into his own taxes, his family\u2019s affairs and his allies\u2019 finances, according Mr. Pillay and three other former senior tax officials who confirmed the account.Then, the president and his supporters went even further. They used the upheaval at the tax agency to seize greater control over the National Treasury, further enriching themselves at enormous cost to the country, according to government officials now trying to repair the damage.The national tax agency, as prosaic as it may sound, had once been an extraordinary triumph, even for the party that helped defeat apartheid. Just a few years after it helped usher in democracy, the A.N.C. switched from liberation to the mundane workings of government and persuaded millions of South Africans to do the unimaginable: pay their taxes.\u201cWhat has happened subsequently,\u201d he added, \u201cis a very, very, very seriously sad story.\u201dSouth Africa\u2019s version of the Internal Revenue Service is perhaps an unlikely setting for a national saga involving spies, spurned lovers, secret brothels, double agents and one of the biggest journalistic scandals of the post-apartheid era.But the story shows how an increasingly corrupt A.N.C. has undermined its own successes by betraying the very people who brought it to power.And the drama is far from over. In today\u2019s South Africa \u2014 dangling precariously between dueling factions inside the A.N.C. \u2014 the nation\u2019s new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is struggling to assert his authority and fulfill his pledge to root out corruption. He now stands knee-deep in a very messy fight to wrest the tax agency from the legacy of his predecessor, Mr. Zuma, and win back the confidence of an angry nation.With corruption and political warfare gutting the agency, more and more South Africans have simply stopped paying their taxes, a dangerous turn in a nation where tens of millions depend on government services that are already enfeebled by graft and misrule. In the eyes of many experts, the government\u2019s \u2014 and the country\u2019s \u2014 ability to right itself is at stake.The dismantling of the tax agency unfolded in full view of the astonished country, squandering so much of the public\u2019s dwindling trust that officials now wonder how they will be able to restore it.Once Mr. Zuma removed Mr. Pillay as acting commissioner in late 2014, he installed an ally who had been close to the president and his family for decades. Almost immediately, explosive leaks started coming from inside the tax agency, spicing up the pages of a major South African newspaper.The articles said Mr. Pillay had approved the creation of an illegal \u201crogue unit\u201d that had planted bugs at Mr. Zuma\u2019s home to intercept his conversations.The news grew juicier by the week: Hush money was paid to a former spymaster during apartheid to keep quiet about the illegal espionage. The rogue unit even set up a brothel to go undercover, the reports claimed.As the shocking details emerged, Mr. Zuma\u2019s new tax commissioner, Tom Moyane, called on KPMG to investigate, giving it a nearly $2 million contract to uncover the truth. A year later, KPMG came back with its results, confirming widespread abuses of power.Trouble is, it\u2019s not clear any of it was true.The newspaper, The Sunday Times, later retracted its articles. KPMG was forced to publicly dismiss its own conclusions as well, admitting that it had essentially copied a memo from its client\u2019s lawyers and passed off the allegations as its own, fully investigated findings.\u201cWhoever pays the piper calls the tune, unfortunately,\u201d said Bobby Johnston, the former chairman of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange who sits on a panel now investigating KPMG.The retractions came much too late for the tax agency. Mr. Pillay and leaders of the so-called rogue unit had already resigned or been forced out, undercutting the agency\u2019s capacity to investigate and pursue tax dodgers, according to current officials and independent tax experts.Hundreds of the tax service\u2019s best employees also left during the upheaval, many going into private practice, and some to tax agencies as far away as New Zealand.Even more damaging, the lurid tales of corruption and intrigue inside what was once an A.N.C. showcase of good governance contributed to sharp drops in the nation\u2019s tax collection: more than $6 billion short of what the government had expected in the previous two budget years.The shortfalls have left the nation with fewer resources to tackle its most pressing needs \u2014 housing, education, health \u2014 in a society that has grown even more unequal under the A.N.C.And in a stinging blow to the impoverished South Africans who have voted the party into power and kept it there for decades, the gaps have forced the government to raise the value-added tax on products for the first time since the end of apartheid \u2014 a move expected to hurt poor people the most.Much of the national ire over the scandal has focused on KPMG, which helped the chaos along by rubber-stamping some explosive accusations that it could not prove. Now the firm is facing collapse in South Africa, raising withering questions about the role Western companies play in providing a sheen of legitimacy while enabling corruption.KPMG is facing two inquiries in South Africa, and a few weeks ago the country\u2019s auditor general terminated all contracts with the firm. Private banks like Barclays Africa, one of the largest on the continent, have also ended their relationship with KPMG, citing the risks to their reputations.Yet the fate of the tax agency is still up in the air. It is only one of many government institutions that have been weakened through years of infighting and corruption by the party that built them. The A.N.C. has especially chipped away at agencies and posts that hold the powerful accountable, like the national police, prosecutors and the public protector\u2019s office.The president\u2019s office has accused Mr. Moyane of meddling in the KPMG inquiry, misleading Parliament and failing to properly investigate allegations of corruption, money laundering and tax evasion by his own deputy \u2014 charges that Mr. Moyane is preparing to rebut in court.\u201cThe tragedy is that SARS was a world-class institution,\u201d said Ismail Momoniat, the National Treasury\u2019s deputy director general for tax and financial sector policy. \u201cTax collection is very critical for nation building, because it\u2019s the kind of underlying foundation for the state.\u201dFor the leader of a country that often symbolizes the historic pursuit of democracy in Africa and beyond, Mr. Zuma certainly seemed to have grown weary of it himself, current and former officials say.During one of his visits to the president, Mr. Pillay said, Mr. Zuma started off making small talk but was clearly exasperated, openly complaining about the questions lawmakers expected him to answer.\u201cHe said, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m so tired and tomorrow morning I\u2019ve got to go to Parliament,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pillay recalled Mr. Zuma saying. The president had faced volleys of outrage, especially over the lavish use of public money to upgrade his private homestead.\u201c\u2018Why must I go and answer questions in Parliament? Putin doesn\u2019t go to Parliament to answer questions,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pillay recounted Mr. Zuma saying.\u201cThat\u2019s where he was\u201d in terms of being open to scrutiny, Mr. Pillay said.On top of that, one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s sons was suspected of hiding profits from contraband cigarettes. Red flags had also emerged with a nephew\u2019s used-car business and a foundation established by one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s wives \u2014 all of which caught the attention of tax investigators, the four former officials said.Mr. Pillay insisted that he never wanted to pursue Mr. Zuma directly through a formal investigation, but that the president seemed convinced otherwise.\u201cHe got it into his head that we are monitoring him,\u201d Mr. Pillay said.During the presidency of Thabo Mbeki, people cheated, of course, but the revenue service was largely protected from political interference, Mr. Pillay said. And while party loyalists enriched themselves in many ways, he said, \u201cthere was order at the trough.\u201dBut under Mr. Zuma, especially in his second term, which began in 2014, corruption began consuming nearly every corner of government \u2014 from the national utility giant, Eskom, to provincial agricultural departments, according to parliamentary hearings and the nation\u2019s former public protector.Inevitably, the tax agency\u2019s investigations into offenders, including Mr. Zuma\u2019s relatives and business allies, encountered stronger pushback, the former officials say.\u201cAlmost every big tax evader we were after would pull a political leader,\u201d Mr. Pillay said. \u201cAll sorts of politicians were unhappy with us. It became a perfect storm,\u201d helping seal his removal as the nation\u2019s chief tax officer, he argued. He and two other former officials now face criminal charges in a case that many experts see as politically motivated.Neither Mr. Zuma nor his choice for a replacement, Mr. Moyane, agreed to be interviewed. But Mr. Moyane, a little-known development economist who had been plucked from running prisons to lead the tax agency, has strongly defended his independence.Even so, in his four years as the nation\u2019s top tax official, Mr. Moyane earned a national reputation as Mr. Zuma\u2019s hatchet man, still guided by his loyalties to A.N.C. leaders who believe in the supremacy of the party over the country.A former anti-apartheid operative as well, Mr. Moyane had known Mr. Zuma for nearly four decades. They met in Mozambique in the late 1970s, when Mr. Zuma led the A.N.C.\u2019s underground operations in exile. Their families were close, too.Barely two weeks after Mr. Moyane took office, the wild stories began appearing in The Sunday Times, fed by unnamed sources inside the tax agency. The paper reported that Mr. Pillay had created the rogue unit, and that the tax agency had paid a former spymaster nearly $230,000 to keep quiet about surveillance devices planted at Mr. Zuma\u2019s home.\u201cSpy Scandal. Blondes, Brothels and Rhinos,\u201d blared one headline. In the article, an unnamed tax employee told the paper that an agent of the rogue unit had set up a brothel, and even hounded a colleague for the money he owed for \u201ctwo blondes.\u201dThe Sunday Times retracted most of the articles \u2014 18 months later. It settled with Mr. Pillay and another tax agency employee named in the accounts.But the coup de gr\u00e2ce had already been delivered.The impact on the nation goes far beyond that, threatening to drag South Africa back toward the days when people looked at the state of their government \u2014 and decided not to support it.While the tax agency blames the economy\u2019s slow growth and a drop in imports for the recent revenue deficit, it also acknowledges \u201ca deterioration in compliance.\u201d Businesses collected taxes on the goods they sold and the employees they hired, but then did not turn over the money to the government, the agency said.Beyond that, nearly half of the shortfall in the last budget year came from personal income taxes that officials had expected to collect but never did, according to the National Treasury.The trend worries the government, which relies heavily on personal income tax, about half of which is paid by the top 1 percent of South Africans. The tax agency says it has made one million calls to remind taxpayers of their obligation to pay.\u201cWhen you asked people, \u2018Why was that?\u2019\u201d Judge Davis said, \u201cthere were two or three reasons that were given. One was the erosion of tax morality, which was caused by increasing levels of government corruption.\u201d\u201cSecondly,\u201d he added, the tax agency had been so thoroughly gutted that \u201cpeople said they\u2019re never going to get caught.\u201dThe scandal did not end with the wreckage at the tax agency. The torrent of unproved accusations gave Mr. Zuma and his allies enough ammunition to grab control over another prize \u2014 the state coffers in the National Treasury.This chapter of the story, in particular, relied on the cooperation of a Western company that carried great weight and credibility in South Africa: KPMG.In December 2014, as The Sunday Times kept churning out headlines about the rogue unit, Mr. Moyane commissioned KPMG South Africa to investigate. A year later, the firm produced a report confirming that a division inside the agency \u2014 officially known as the High Risk Investigation Unit \u2014 had been set up illegally and gone rogue. It was the proof that seemed to justify Mr. Moyane\u2019s sweeping purge.Not surprisingly, Mr. van der Walt\u2019s dive into the tax agency focused on the leader of the so-called rogue unit, Johann van Loggerenberg. The two men, both Afrikaners, had carved out distinct roles for themselves in South Africa\u2019s new order. Now, they found themselves on opposite sides of a showdown roiling the nation.Mr. van Loggerenberg, the tax official, had an especially unusual background. Before joining the agency in 1998, he had worked as an undercover police agent. His work, venturing deep into organized crime, had left him estranged from his family.\u201cEven my parents believed I was a criminal,\u201d he recalled.Back then, as a young man in his 20s, Mr. van Loggerenberg was aware that he had been \u201ca beneficiary of the apartheid system,\u201d he said, but he also saw himself playing a \u201cpart in the renewal of the country.\u201dAfter his police unit was disbanded, he considered an offer from the national intelligence service. But a prominent A.N.C. acquaintance told him to consider the tax agency instead.South Africans, the A.N.C. member told him, had been liberated in 1994 but did not have social or economic freedom. The new government needed money to erase the legacies of apartheid. The thought stuck in Mr. van Loggerenberg\u2019s mind.By the time KPMG started digging into the tax agency, however, Mr. van Loggerenberg had become embroiled in a personal scandal that added even more fuel to the national bonfire.By his own admission, Mr. van Loggerenberg, who was leading an investigation into the tobacco industry, had a brief romantic relationship with a double agent \u2014 a lawyer who represented a tobacco manufacturer and had also operated as a government informant.When that relationship came to a tumultuous end, the lawyer gave The Sunday Times her WhatsApp exchanges with Mr. van Loggerenberg. In them, the couple simultaneously fight and discuss a tax settlement with a political leader, further eroding the public\u2019s confidence in the tax agency.KPMG even took on the relationship in its report: \u201cIt may be that either party had clandestine intentions and that the \u2018love\u2019 fired by physical and emotional sharing with each other was used to extract information of common interest (but with different application).\u201dThe KPMG investigation claimed to be exhaustive. Mr. van der Walt\u2019s team of \u201c20 to 30 professionals\u201d perused 860,000 emails and an \u201cexcess of 1.36 million documents,\u201d according to the firm.One Friday evening, from 6 p.m. until past midnight, a KPMG team took out documents from the tax official\u2019s safe, creating a detailed inventory of each item.\u201cIt was a clinical process,\u201d Mr. van Loggerenberg, the tax agent, said of the interactions with KPMG and its lead investigator. \u201cI was actually very hopeful that he would uncover the truth because of the reputation he had for being a meticulous forensic investigator.\u201dIn the end, the 139-page KPMG report found no evidence of a brothel or illegal wiretapping of Mr. Zuma.But it argued that members of the so-called rogue unit had bugged the offices of national prosecutors in an operation called Project Sunday Evenings, eavesdropping on the investigation of a crime boss and a former police commissioner who wound up in prison.Equally important was a single sentence, in KPMG\u2019s executive findings and conclusions, about Pravin Gordhan, the man who was widely credited with building up the tax agency as its commissioner from 1999 to 2009.Mr. Gordhan, KPMG said, \u201cought to have known of the existence of the unit,\u201d which it said had been established illegally.This sentence gave Mr. Zuma and his allies the tools to go after an even bigger target: the National Treasury, which Mr. Gordhan had moved on to oversee as finance minister. The authorities publicly summoned Mr. Gordhan in late 2016 and charged him with fraud.The charges were quickly withdrawn, but they gave Mr. Zuma political cover when he fired Mr. Gordhan from his post as finance minister a few months later.Mr. Zuma and Mr. Gordhan had often been at odds over the use of government money. Under Mr. Gordhan\u2019s stewardship, the National Treasury had become a bulwark against the freewheeling spending at state enterprises that was enriching Mr. Zuma\u2019s allies.Mr. Gordhan was widely respected in financial and business circles. But when he was ousted in March 2017, the president replaced him with an A.N.C. politician under whose leadership corruption had flourished in the Ministry of Public Enterprises.A few days later, South Africa\u2019s credit rating was downgraded to junk status, creating yet another major challenge for the nation. Just as the chaos at the tax agency was depressing tax revenues, it suddenly became more expensive for South Africa to borrow money, compounding its problems.From there, KPMG might have simply moved on to other government projects, had it not been for a surprising development.Emails leaked last year revealed the chummy ties between close Zuma allies and top KPMG officials. The supposedly ironclad audits KPMG had performed quickly fell under suspicion. Some of the companies the firm had cleared were even being investigated for money laundering and other illicit activities.Forced to audit itself, KPMG acknowledged that it did not have evidence to support the statement it had made about Mr. Gordhan, the finance minister Mr. Zuma had removed.\u201cWe recognize and regret the impact this has had,\u201d the firm said last September. \u201cKPMG South Africa had no political motivation or intent to mislead.\u201dEven more damning was KPMG\u2019s later admission in a hearing before Parliament that the report\u2019s conclusions and recommendations had not been the product of KPMG at all.Instead, they had been copied \u201cby and large verbatim\u201d from a memo drafted by lawyers employed by the tax agency, said Roy Waligora, KPMG South Africa\u2019s head of forensics.But the firm stopped short of disavowing other sections of the report, sowing even more national confusion over whether anything in it had actually been true.The lead investigator, Mr. van der Walt, left the firm last year. He declined to be interviewed.No other individual received more attention in the report than Mr. van Loggerenberg, the former head of the so-called rogue unit. But he said KPMG officials had never interviewed him, even after he \u201cbegged\u201d on several occasions to present his side of the story.The legal problems facing Mr. van Loggerenberg and Mr. Pillay are not finished. Both still face criminal charges linked to Project Sunday Evenings, accused of eavesdropping on national prosecutors.Legal experts say the case appears politically motivated, part of a continuing attempt by the national prosecutors \u2014 still led by a staunch Zuma ally \u2014 to maintain the narrative of a rogue unit at the tax agency. In recent years, the National Prosecuting Authority, which has been compromised by intense meddling by A.N.C. politicians, has increasingly been used for political ends, the experts said.The national prosecutors\u2019 spokesman declined to comment.For KPMG, the inquiry into the tax agency was a lucrative and prestigious contract, bringing in about $2 million and giving the firm a toehold on future work in government. Now critics accuse it of acting as little more than a hired gun in this case, ready to craft reports that fit its client\u2019s wishes.The investigation was one of many scandals involving KPMG in South Africa and elsewhere. Federal prosecutors in New York indicted four of the firm\u2019s former employees on conspiracy and wire fraud charges in January.Last month, two British parliamentary committees said KPMG was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in endorsing the misleading financial statements made by Carillion, a construction giant that collapsed early this year. KPMG, the company\u2019s auditor for 19 years, never raised questions and signed off on management\u2019s \u201cincreasingly fantastical figures,\u201d the committees said.Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, a British organization, said the KPMG case in South Africa provided the clearest example of a major Western auditing firm bending the rules to provide governments with \u201cassurance services.\u201d\u201cWhat you saw\u201d in South Africa, he said, \u201cis the government very much looking for cover to do something that appears to have been broadly illegitimate, and in order to get some cover for that, looking to these international players to give a stamp of approval.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Zuma\u2019s own party turned against him.With opposition figures gaining control of the nation\u2019s biggest cities, the A.N.C. removed Mr. Zuma as president of the country in February. The corruption he presided over had become too much of a political liability ahead of elections next year.But pledges of transparency in the aftermath of the tax scandal have yielded little. John Veihmeyer, the chairman of KPMG International at the time, promised \u201can independent investigation\u201d into the rogue unit report last September.\u201cGiven the significance of the issues involved in this matter to the country of South Africa, and the damage our actions have caused, the public deserves to know the full facts as quickly as possible,\u201d he said in a statement.But KPMG has not followed up in the eight months since Mr. Veihmeyer\u2019s pledge. KPMG International declined interview requests, saying only that it \u201ccontinues to cooperate\u201d with inquiries.That is not how some investigators describe it. Lawyers in one inquiry, conducted by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, were denied access to key documents, according to Dumisa Buhle Ntsebeza, who leads the organization\u2019s inquiry panel and once headed South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s investigation unit.\u201cWe\u2019re still stuck,\u201d Mr. Ntsebeza said.Mr. Ntsebeza has also leveled his frustration at the new leadership of the nation\u2019s tax agency.At a recent hearing, the agency\u2019s new acting commissioner, Mark Kingon, delayed its start by a couple of hours in an attempt to expel journalists, though the hearings had been open to the public since the inquiry began early this year.Then, unlike all previous witnesses, Mr. Kingon refused to speak under oath.\u201cIn order for us to be comfortable that you\u2019re serious about what you\u2019re saying, we need you to bind yourself to what you\u2019re going to say \u2014 the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth,\u201d Mr. Ntsebeza said, unable to conceal his anger.Now, South Africa is waiting to see how far its new president, Mr. Ramaphosa, will carry his anti-corruption drive. Many are skeptical, contending that he did little to prevent his fellow A.N.C. leaders from undermining the tax agency and other institutions during his nearly four years as Mr. Zuma\u2019s deputy president.Yet another inquiry, this one ordered by Mr. Ramaphosa, has promised to reveal the real, complete story behind the rise and fall of the tax agency. But it is far from clear whether it will restore the people\u2019s faith in government and persuade them to do what may seem, once again, unimaginable \u2014 pay their taxes.\u201cWe should put behind us the era of diminishing trust in public institutions and weakened confidence in leaders,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said in his first address to the nation in February.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. to Spin Off Health Care Division as Part of Major Reshaping", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen John L. Flannery took over as the chief executive of General Electric last August, he declared that he would not be nostalgic about the industrial giant\u2019s storied past when reshaping the company for the future.He wasn\u2019t kidding.General Electric said on Tuesday that it planned to spin off its health care business and sell its multibillion-dollar stake in Baker Hughes, a major producer of oil field equipment, as Mr. Flannery turns the embattled industrial titan into a much smaller company.G.E., once the ultimate American conglomerate and a symbol of corporate power, had endured a painful decline in recent years. Executives could not sell the struggling parts fast enough. In the past year, shares in the company have fallen by half, cutting its market value by $120 billion.In November, to help save some money, G.E. announced that it would cut its dividend, only the second time it had done so since the Great Depression.The current plan, Mr. Flannery said in a conference call with analysts, is to create \u201ca simpler, stronger and more focused company.\u201dShares in the company rose on Tuesday, closing 7.7 percent higher as investors welcomed the change.For decades, G.E. added businesses as varied as home-mortgage lending and entertainment programming with NBCUniversal. The company shed its final stake in the television network and movie studio to Comcast in 2013. The thinking was that its corps of elite managers could make all the divisions profitable, even though they were in far different sectors. Jack Welch, who led G.E. for two decades until 2001, championed that model, becoming a superstar chief executive along the way.But the weakness of the G.E. model eventually became evident, especially when the financial crisis hit. At the time, G.E. was the largest nonbank financial institution in America, and its liabilities weighed on the industrial company.Under Mr. Flannery\u2019s predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E. shed much of the finance arm, GE Capital. But Mr. Immelt also made big acquisitions, like building up its oil field machinery business. Soon after, oil prices fell sharply, dragging down profits.Although the decline of the company was obvious when he took over, Mr. Flannery\u2019s challenge quickly looked far more daunting. The troubles at G.E.\u2019s big power turbine business were deeper than expected. And earlier this year, the company took a multibillion-dollar charge and set aside $15 billion to pay for obligations held by its finance unit, mainly on long-term-care insurance policies.The travails were not Mr. Flannery\u2019s work, but he inherited them. It was clear that cost-cutting and getting rid of a few smaller businesses, like the spinoff last month of its railroad business, valued at $11 billion, would not be enough. More drastic action was needed, and Mr. Flannery took it on Tuesday.\u201cG.E. did what it had to do to move forward,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cThe vision makes a lot of sense.\u201dSpinning off the health care business as a separate company, G.E. said, is likely to take 12 to 18 months, and pulling out of Baker Hughes up to three years.The health care unit, which reported $19 billion in revenue last year, makes equipment ranging from M.R.I. machines to products that aid cellular technology research.In an interview, Mr. Flannery, who ran G.E.\u2019s health business before he became chief executive, said his experience led him to conclude that it would do best as a separate company, free to seek investment and opportunities on its own.\u201cIn all these decisions, the issue is what is the best environment for these businesses to flourish \u2014 and for the shareholders,\u201d Mr. Flannery said.Under the terms of the reorganization, G.E. will spin off a 20 percent stake in its health care unit into a new publicly traded company. It will then divest the rest of its holding to shareholders as a sort of tax-free dividend.The proceeds from both moves will help G.E. reduce its net debt by $25 billion by 2020, the company said, strengthening its financial position.Jet engines, electric power generators and wind turbines, Mr. Flannery said, share similar technologies for power generation and propulsion. Their products are long-lived industrial equipment, and G.E. holds strong market positions. There are 65,000 G.E. jet engines in use worldwide, 7,000 power generators and 35,000 wind turbines.\u201cThese three are stronger together,\u201d Mr. Flannery said.In the conference call and the interview, Mr. Flannery emphasized that G.E.\u2019s management culture was being overhauled, as well as its portfolio of businesses.Corporate management will be leaner, with most decisions made by the businesses themselves. By 2020, corporate overhead costs will be trimmed by $500 million. Those cuts are in addition to a program to reduce companywide expenses by $2 billion this year.\u201cOur businesses will be the center of gravity,\u201d Mr. Flannery said.The development of digital technology and advanced manufacturing, Mr. Flannery said, will remain vital to G.E. But the individual businesses will decide how much and whether they want to essentially buy that expertise from G.E.\u2019s research labs and digital unit.Much of the research at its labs, Mr. Flannery said, is consumed by the three businesses that will remain part of G.E. But the labs, he added, will have to make changes to sustain a strong research capability, perhaps including doing contract research for outside customers.The digital technology center in San Ramon, Calif., had as many as 2,000 workers last summer. But the work force has shrunk since then. G.E. invested billions of dollars in that unit, begun in 2011.\u201cThere will be no cost drag from digital by 2020,\u201d Mr. Flannery said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alabama\u2019s Longtime Hostility to Gambling Shows Signs of Fading", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Even more than its Bible Belt neighbors, Alabama has steadfastly resisted legalizing gambling for generations.The clout of evangelical Christians helped make sure of it: Joe Godfrey, the top lobbyist for the state\u2019s most powerful churches, once received an Inauguration Day promise from an influential politician that no proposal for gambling would make it through the State House while he was in office.But the resistance is now openly fraying, suggesting that gambling is no longer a potent moral issue that animates voters and politicians the way it once did.As the landscape shifts in Montgomery, the state capital, the consequences may reverberate across the South, where nearby states gladly rake in billions of dollars that Alabamians are not allowed to wager at home.\u201cI dread going back into session, if I\u2019m re-elected, knowing that there\u2019s probably going to be fantasy sports, there\u2019s going to be the lottery, there\u2019s going to be sports gambling, the Vegas-type gambling,\u201d said Rich Wingo, a Republican state representative who opposes all those things. \u201cI just feel like we\u2019re going to be inundated with this gambling issue.\u201dHardly anyone, Mr. Wingo included, believes that Alabama, which allows bingo, bets on horse and dog racing and a few tribal casinos with no table games, will quickly embrace other ways to wager. But the races this year for governor and for every seat in the Legislature are already accelerating debate about some of them, testing the political strength of the evangelical Christians who have blocked proposals in the past.Republican Party consultants say their polling now shows overwhelming support for a vote on a lottery, even among self-identified churchgoers. In recent interviews, elected officials, pastors, political strategists and voters all said they sensed far less ferocity around an issue that once electrified Alabama politics.No single theory has won out to explain why Alabama\u2019s anti-gambling fervor may have ebbed.And there is the reality that plenty of people who stay in Alabama are placing bets already. Illegal, untaxed gambling is thought to be widespread, and the state\u2019s three tribal casinos, limited as they are in what they can offer, attract patrons from all over Alabama. A local minister was known to drive Harper Lee, the author of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d to one of them before she died in 2016.Mr. Godfrey, the church lobbyist and executive director of the interdenominational Alabama Citizens Action Program, said the coalition against legalized gambling had fractured.\u201cIt used to be that we could count on the Republicans and the business community to fight, but we\u2019ve lost the Republicans, we\u2019ve lost the business community,\u201d Mr. Godfrey said at the group\u2019s offices in Birmingham. \u201cThe churches will be the last line of defense \u2014 that\u2019s the only firewall left.\u201dHe recalled how in 1999, after Georgia had started a lottery and casinos had opened in Mississippi, the Baptist church he pastored took $5,000 out of its missions budget to use in thwarting Mr. Siegelman\u2019s lottery plan.But opposition to gambling has dwindled as a priority for many Christian leaders across the country, and the confidence and vigor that Mr. Godfrey once saw has been replaced with worries about whether many Christians remain willing to fight the issue.\u201cThe biggest priority right now for me is reminding evangelicals of why we are opposed to gambling, which means teaching a biblical view of economic stewardship and a biblical view of concern for the poor,\u201d said Russell Moore, who leads the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s public policy arm and is a native of the casino-dotted Mississippi coast. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned that evangelicals are changing their position on gambling, as much as I\u2019m concerned that there\u2019s often a kind of fatalism that assumes that gambling is going to be part of every economy.\u201dEven so, some Christians and their leaders said they were comfortable with de-emphasizing gambling as an issue. The Rev. Neil Reynolds, the senior minister at the University Church of Christ in Tuscaloosa, said gambling, like alcohol, was not \u201can evil that\u2019s going to ruin our community.\u201d\u201cWe are too often known for the things that we\u2019re against, instead of the things we\u2019re for and who we are,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said in his office near the stadium of a Crimson Tide football program that many an Alabamian would bet on legally if they could. (Even Wayne Flynt, a Baptist minister and a professor emeritus of history at Auburn University, said the one bet he had made in his life had been a friendly $1 wager on Alabama.)With so much money potentially at stake both for Alabama and for its neighbors, there is plentiful speculation about how much resistance may remain to gambling in the state. Professor Flynt said he thought there would still be plenty, simply because many people are used to thinking of gambling as something done in \u201cgodless Yankee places that vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201dGambling proponents recognize the cultural headwinds and, like Mr. Maddox, are framing their plans as vital to the state\u2019s economic future.\u201cI think that evangelical Christians of all denominations, many of whom used to be opposed to the lottery, see that if the money is spent on our children, for our children\u2019s education or for some other important public purpose that it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Mr. Siegelman said, reviving some of his 1999 pitch. \u201cIt\u2019s like a donation to the church, or a donation to education, or a donation to veterans.\u201dMr. Godfrey said that he and his allies sensed the danger and expected to face a well-financed and well-crafted strategy to promote what they saw as an unmitigated vice.\u201cJesus never told us it would be easy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

How do we know it isn\u2019t a sovereign wealth fund from Saudi Arabia or some other place?\u201dTheir new ethics disclosures showed that the couple\u2019s trusts and other investment vehicles took part in nearly 80 transactions during the year, buying or selling swaths of development property in New Jersey, commercial real estate in Manhattan, condominiums in Brooklyn, stakes in mutual funds and at least one hedge fund.The couple\u2019s real estate holdings and other investments were worth as much as $811 million, up from $761 million in 2016. Their total income from the various investments was between $82 million and $222 million, compared with a range of $89 to $201 million in 2016.The value of the assets owned by Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump does not count the debt accumulated to purchase the properties. Mr. Kushner divested some of his Kushner Companies assets by selling them to a trust controlled by his mother.The White House released the ethics disclosures of numerous top officials late Monday, as the public was focused on President Trump\u2019s meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore.Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Abbe Lowell, who is Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump\u2019s ethics counsel, said, \u201cSince joining the administration, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have complied with the rules and restrictions as set out by the Office of Government Ethics.\u201dMr. Mirijanian added that they had not been involved in the various transactions that benefited them. \u201cAs stated on numerous occasions, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump removed themselves from their companies\u2019 operations and investment decisions when they entered government service,\u201d he said.The biggest transactions disclosed Monday involved buying or selling real estate in New Jersey, Indiana and Pittsburgh. In September, a limited liability company called Quail Ridge purchased residential real estate in Plainsboro, N.J., for $5 million to $25 million, according to the report. Mr. Kushner entered into a note transaction with Bank of America for the same value range, holding it with other members of the limited liability company.The ethics filing also disclosed income generated by Ms. Trump. She earned $3.9 million from her stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened in the fall of 2016. That was roughly on pace with what she reported in the previous year, when her filing showed that the hotel had generated $2.4 million in income during its first eight months.The hotel, just steps from the White House, has prompted concerns from ethics experts, who worried that guests may be trying to curry favor with the president by staying there.Ms. Trump\u2019s financial disclosures also show that she earned more than $5 million from the entity that controls her brand, and about $2 million in severance from the Trump Organization. Ms. Trump has resigned from her leadership roles at her fashion business and her family\u2019s real estate company since her father became president.Ms. Trump also earned $289,300 as an advance for her book \u201cWomen Who Work.\u201d She donated the money to the Ivanka M. Trump Charitable Fund, a \u201cdonor-advised fund\u201d dedicated to organizations that focus on women and girls, according to the filing.The filing also disclosed a few interests that Mr. Kushner had divested but inadvertently failed to report previously, including Vegas Seven, a Las Vegas website, as well as a stake in Brooklyn Beer.An earlier version of this article misstated the value of the real estate holdings and other investments belonging to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner in 2017. The assets were worth as much as $811 million, not $834 million.Rachel Abrams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pardon System Needs Fixing, Advocates Say, but They Cringe at Trump\u2019s Approach", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For those who view the Justice Department\u2019s pardon system as slow and sclerotic, with its backlog of more than 11,000 cases, they need only look to the case of Matthew Charles.Mr. Charles was sentenced in 1996 to 35 years in prison for selling crack cocaine. In prison, he took college classes, became a law clerk and taught fellow inmates. He was released early, in 2016, and began rebuilding his life, volunteering at a food pantry and even falling in love.Last month, Mr. Charles was sent back to prison after a federal court determined that he did not technically qualify for early release. His lawyers plan to ask the Justice Department to commute the rest of his sentence, and he appears to fall within its guidelines for clemency. But with nearly 9,000 petitioners for a commutation ahead of him, it could take years for federal law enforcement officials to decide his fate.Cases like Mr. Charles\u2019s make some criminal justice reform advocates say they would welcome a reform-minded president willing to bypass the system and more boldly wield the constitutional power to grant pardons.But by choosing to pardon political supporters whose cases largely failed to meet the basic guidelines for pardons, Mr. Trump could turn a slow and imperfect system into an unequal and unjust one, both liberal and conservative advocates warn, in which those with fame, money or access to the president\u2019s ear are first in line to receive clemency.\u201cA more regular and robust use of presidential clemency, and a willingness to go around the Justice Department process, would be applauded by many,\u201d said Kevin Ring, a conservative public policy expert and the president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. \u201cThe issue is whether the president will still apply standards and meritocracy. Will he weigh the injustices and mete out justice to reflect the needs of a situation? That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201dThe pardon office has a reputation for slow decision making, in part because of the time needed to carefully vet a case. Of the backlog of 11,203 pardon and commutation cases, only 2,876 have been filed since Mr. Trump became president.Since taking office, Mr. Trump has denied 180 pardon and sentence-reduction applications sent to the Justice Department. In the pardon cases, some felons had pleaded guilty to illegal possession of a firearm. One had served time for selling methamphetamines. And in another case, a man convicted in 1995 of mail fraud, extortion and fixing union elections had also worked as a government informant.Advocates who want to see the pardon system overhauled generally support its guidelines for granting pardons and commuting sentences. In general, felons wait five years after conviction or release to petition for a pardon. They must show evidence of rehabilitation and demonstrate that they have led responsible and productive lives after release for a significant period of time. The recommendations of officials including federal prosecutors and judges are also taken into consideration.\u201cA president that circumvents this system is not necessarily a bad idea,\u201d said Shon Hopwood, Mr. Charles\u2019s lawyer. \u201cLegal scholars have argued for years that it\u2019s inappropriate to have the office of the pardon attorney at the Justice Department. It asks the people who grant pardons and clemency to correct their colleagues, the prosecutors who put people in prison.\u201dMr. Charles\u2019s lawyers and the judge who allowed for his early release say that he takes responsibility for the crimes he committed.In the late 1980s, Mr. Charles was charged with domestic violence, fled the police while being questioned and wounded a man while trying to steal his car and escape. He served his sentence and was later caught selling drugs, earning him a 35-year maximum sentence in part because of his criminal record. He is not asking for those crimes to be pardoned, only to have his sentence shortened to reflect that his behavior meets the guidelines for commutation.\u201cI get that what he did was really bad, but he deserves an opportunity for redemption,\u201d said Kevin Sharp, the judge who released Mr. Charles. Mr. Sharp has since left the bench.Mr. Hopwood said he hoped to speak to White House officials while he prepared a clemency petition for his client.\u201cMatthew has kept a job and taken care of himself without public assistance,\u201d said Naomi Tharpe, Mr. Charles\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cBy returning him to prison, he will cost taxpayers over $55,000 a year, more than the average American makes. We should utilize our tax money for a greater need.\u201dBoth Democrats and Republicans have also called on Mr. Trump to commute Mr. Charles\u2019s sentence, and an editorial in the conservative National Review called for a full pardon.But doing so would have implications for the already frayed relationship between Mr. Trump and his Justice Department. Federal prosecutors have declined to recharge Mr. Charles with lesser offenses, according to Mr. Sharp, which could have paved the way for a shorter sentence overall and little to no prison time.Granting such a request would be difficult for federal prosecutors, Mr. Sharp said, because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has instructed them to ask for the most severe penalties allowed by law, including mandatory minimum sentences.Though federal prosecutors declined to recharge Mr. Charles, they do believe he is a good candidate for a commuted sentence.\u201cAs the government has previously noted, Charles\u2019s evident rehabilitation is commendable, and may well provide a compelling basis for executive clemency,\u201d Donald Q. Cochran, the United States attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, wrote in a briefing.Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leading Serbia at World Cup, Nemanja Matic Has One Foot Rooted at Home", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBREZOVICA, Serbia \u2014 There was no spontaneous round of applause and no official announcement when the owner of the visiting team arrived at the tiny stadium in this Serbian village about two hours southwest of the capital, Belgrade.The soccer match, between Brezovica and Vrelo Sport in Serbia\u2019s fifth tier, was something of a local derby. A few hundred supporters, paying about a dollar a ticket, filled the uncovered concrete bleachers along one side of the field. It was the biggest crowd of the season.That no fanfare greeted Vrelo Sport\u2019s owner was not unusual; club owners are not the most popular people, in Serbia or elsewhere, even when their teams are winning. Still, the arrival of Nemanja Matic, caused hardly a ripple even though he is Serbia\u2019s most famous player and spends most of his time playing for one of the world\u2019s biggest clubs.Matic, 29, entered the stadium here by walking past the two police officers guarding a flimsy fence and folding his tall frame under a broken metal guardrail. He took his place in the center of the stands among the home supporters and opened a packet of pumpkin seeds, the snack of choice at soccer matches anywhere in the Balkans.In 24 hours Matic would join his Serbia teammates as they made their final preparations for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. But he had important business to attend to first. Matic, who spends most of his year in England, where he plays for Manchester United, had come to see whether the team he founded in 2015 in his home village, Vrelo, would win this season\u2019s championship. Vrelo Sport had run away with the league, but Brezovica was still hanging on in second place.Few world-class soccer players are also team owners. Matic owns two. He also finances FK Jedinstvo, a third-tier club from nearby Ub, where he played as a boy. It is all part of a deep connection he maintains to Serbia, and more specifically to his hometown, with the help of the millions he has earned in the Premier League. Matic has also become known in Serbia for his philanthropy; he has financed an array of projects, including church improvements, equipment for firefighters and, reportedly, even the grocery bills of some retirees.\u201cWe all respect him very much,\u201d said Zivorad Vucetic, a Brezovica fan sipping a beer. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about sports.\u201cHe\u2019s invested in football clubs, yes,\u201d Vucetic added. \u201cBut he is also the kind of person that remembers his roots. He never gave up on his village.\u201dMatic took the long road to Old Trafford and the World Cup. He began playing for Vrelo\u2019s village team, coached by his father, before eventually joining the prestigious academy of Red Star Belgrade. Matic was tall and gangly, but Red Star saw a burgeoning attacking midfielder. He stayed four years but was let go, and another year at Partizan Belgrade\u2019s academy also ended in failure.At 16, Matic returned home and signed with the biggest team he could find, FK Jedinstvo. \u201cIt was a big disappointment for him,\u201d said Tomislav Jevtic, who grew up with Matic and now works at Jedinstvo. But, Jevtic added, \u201che didn\u2019t give up.\u201dUnable to claim a regular place on the team, Matic found himself, at 18, on trial up the road at FK Kolubara. \u201cMore than 15 youth players came, but we needed only five,\u201d said Veroljub Dukanac, who coached Kolubara at the time. When Matic scored with a fierce left-foot shot, even though he wasn\u2019t wearing any boots after injuring himself, Dukanac snapped him up.But as he climbed the ladder, Matic never forgot home or the people he believed had helped along the way. He started Vrelo Sport from scratch then agreed to take over Jedinstvo a year later, in 2016. Both clubs were filled with family, friends, players with connections to Ub, and others he had met during his early years.Dukanac, the coach who gave Matic his big break, is now in charge at Jedinstvo. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a conversation like with an owner of a club,\u201d he said of the day Matic called to offer him the job. \u201cWe made a deal in 30 seconds, like friends.\u201dThe president of both Jedinstvo and Vrelo Sport is Darko Matic, his cousin. The equipment man is an old school friend. The Jedinstvo assistant coach is Milos Obradovic, a buddy from the Red Star academy; when Obradovic had to retire as a player after breaking his leg a second time, Nemanja Matic offered him the job.\u201cThere are about 50 people whose wages he pays for in Ub,\u201d said Branko Matic, the club\u2019s secretary and one of the few people at the club not related in some way to Nemanja Matic.Jedinstvo was on its knees financially when Matic agreed to take it over two years ago. The club had just been relegated to the fourth tier and its stadium, Branko Matic said, was in bad shape. Nemanja Matic paid for its reconstruction and named it after Dragan Dzajic, perhaps Serbia\u2019s greatest player, who has roots in Ub, and at Jedinstvo.\u201cHis connection with this place is so strong,\u201d Branko Matic said of Nemanja Matic.He spoke while sitting in a restaurant overlooking the field. Forests rise on two steep banks around the stadium, where 1,300 new red seats were recently installed. Nemanja Matic paid for a new roof, too.The stadium, however, shows little trace of him aside from a framed Chelsea shirt in the trophy room and a large action picture of him on the wall of a clubhouse corridor. But he was never far away.\u201cWhen he plays in Manchester and Jedinstvo is playing at the same time, he calls at halftime\u201d to find out what the score is, Branko Matic said.\u201cSometimes he has too much time,\u201d Darko Matic said of his cousin, tongue in cheek. \u201cHe has a lot of free time between matches. He\u2019s always calling and texting.\u201dRunning two soccer clubs is not cheap, though. Jedinstvo costs about $29,000 a month to run, team officials said, and that does not count the renovation of the stadium, which cost more than $350,000. Vrelo Sport brings another set of expenses; there is, not surprisingly, little money to be made in the Serbian fifth tier.\u201cJedinstvo is not a profitable business,\u201d Branko Matic acknowledged, although the long-term plan is to polish talented young players and sell them to bigger teams. Even for a small club in Serbia\u2019s third tier, the potential rewards can be huge. In Europe and elsewhere, so-called solidarity payments to early clubs follow a player as he rises up the world ladder.\u201cWhen Nemanja went to Chelsea, we got 120,000 euros,\u201d Branko Matic said, even though Nemanja Matic had only made one senior appearance for Jedinstvo.The office of Ub\u2019s mayor, Darko Glisic, a 10-minute walk from Jedinstvo\u2019s stadium, can be found next to Nemanja Matic Street. The decision to rename it, Glisic said, was the easiest vote his municipality had ever taken.\u201cNo one ever said anything bad about him, and he united all the citizens of Ub,\u201d Glisic said. \u201cThat is why we gave him a street.\u201dThe vote, in March, was unanimous. The road is a little barren, but a hotel is being built and a large billboard featuring Matic was erected in time for the World Cup. People come to take pictures next to the street sign every day, Glisic said.Close to a dozen public soccer fields are walking distance from his office. Ub, Glisic said, has produced an inordinate number of professional soccer players. It has almost 40 fields in all, and 32 registered teams, almost as many as Montenegro, for a population of just 10,000 people. Matic, though, has become by far the most famous hometown player. \u201cTime stops here when Manchester United play,\u201d Glisic said.Everyone had a story about Matic. When Ub was hit by powerful floods in 2014, a disaster that killed almost 60 people in Serbia, Matic replaced many of the ruined soccer fields, as well as a kindergarten and a fire station. If a problem arises in Ub, Matic is willing to listen.\u201cWe can call him,\u201d Glisic said. \u201cOne day we watched him play against Liverpool, and that night he flew to Serbia and came to Ub to have a drink with people.\u201dIn his home village, Vrelo, a few minutes\u2019 drive away, a small brass plaque was all that marked the fountain he donated to the Orthodox Christian church where he was married and his children were baptized. Last year Matic paid for the church\u2019s new roof, the four clocks in its spire and the fences that surround it.On a visit in May, the only noise that could be heard over chirping birds was a bulldozer flattening a piece of adjacent land to build another field for Vrelo Sport. But despite his help, this remains a proud place. Some residents were angered by local news reports contending that Matic had visited grocery stores and paid off debts. They said the reports made them look as if they couldn\u2019t care for themselves.In one store, a woman working behind the counter responded angrily to a question. A priest at the church politely declined to talk.The championship match between Brezovica and Vrelo Sport kicked off to the sound of Serbian music from the second day of a raucous wedding party taking place next door. Vrelo was the stronger team and took a 2-0 lead. When Vrelo\u2019s goalkeeper was sent off and a penalty awarded to the home team, though, the atmosphere changed. But Vrelo Sport held out and won, 2-1, confirming its status as champion. The team owner, who began his journey to the World Cup the next day, stood and cheered with the rest.\u201cTonight we will have a big celebration because a player from Vrelo Sport is having a wedding as well,\u201d Darko Matic said.Nemanja Matic was the last person to leave the stands. He swept his pumpkin seed shells into a plastic bag, congratulated his players as they left the field, and headed to the party.Jovan Terzic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is the Trade Deficit?", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not a scorecard, and reducing it won\u2019t necessarily be good for jobs.A core idea that Donald J. Trump has embraced throughout his time in public life has been that the United States is losing in trade with the rest of the world, and that persistent trade deficits are evidence of this fact.In this accounting, the $69 billion United States trade deficit with Mexico or $336 billion gap with China is something of a scorecard reflecting diminishing American greatness. The vast majority of economists view it differently. In this mainstream view, trade deficits are not inherently good or bad. They can be either, depending on circumstances.As the president\u2019s emphasis on trade deficits puts the United States at odds with allies \u2014 in this case at the Group of 7 leaders meeting this weekend in Canada \u2014 the trade-offs in making this an overwhelming focus of economic diplomacy are becoming more clear.Trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.What is the trade deficit?Imagine a world with only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLanders got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a large trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $69 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dWhat does that have to do with savings and investment?When a country runs a trade deficit, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million. If CarNation doesn\u2019t want the value of its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.In effect, the flow of capital is the reverse of the flow of goods. And the trade deficit will be shaped not just by the mechanics of what products people in the two countries buy, but also by unrelated investment and savings decisions. The cause and effect goes both directions.So, for example, if a country enacts a giant tax cut that increases its budget deficit, it is effectively lowering its savings rate \u2014 which tends to increase its trade deficit.That, of course, is exactly the fiscal policy choice the United States has made, so the tax cut passed late last year will tend to increase the trade deficit relative to its level if tax rates had remained unchanged.But don\u2019t trade deficits mean fewer jobs?Maybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But the flow of capital into the country \u2014 the inverse of the trade deficit \u2014 creates benefits that can be good for jobs, by encouraging more domestic investment.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.When you see a headline about a Chinese company buying American hotels or factories, you\u2019re seeing the flip side of the trade deficit Mr. Trump bemoans. (The same when a citizen of China buys a luxury apartment in a Trump tower.) Money flowing into a country is usually considered a good thing. It makes borrowing money cheaper, drives up stock prices and can mean more investment in new businesses.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.So which is it?It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so fruitful. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.Wouldn\u2019t it be better if the U.S. didn\u2019t run a deficit?It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger \u2014 and American exporters less competitive \u2014 than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.If having the global reserve currency means bleeding jobs overseas, why keep it?Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Veers to a Korea Plan That Echoes Failures of the Past", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump never tires of pointing out that his predecessors left him the \u201cmess\u201d of a nuclear-armed North Korea \u2014 a legacy of errors he vows not to repeat.Rather than sticking with the demand that North Korea disarm immediately, Mr. Trump opened the door to a prolonged freeze on the North\u2019s existing nuclear capability, with vague declarations that disarmament will follow. That is essentially the deal Mr. Clinton embarked on with Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, in 1994.Rather than warning that he would keep the younger Mr. Kim\u2019s feet to the fire with sanctions until he complies, Mr. Trump said after meeting in the Oval Office with North Korea\u2019s spy chief that he no longer wanted to use the term \u201cmaximum pressure,\u201d a phrase drilled into the vocabulary of his aides for the past year.And rather than keeping a single-minded focus on nuclear weapons, Mr. Trump suggested that the most tangible outcome of his meeting in Singapore might be some kind of peace agreement to formally end the Korean War \u2014 a lofty idea that featured in a 2005 joint statement that inaugurated George W. Bush\u2019s failed effort with Kim Jong-il, the current leader\u2019s father, to halt the North\u2019s nuclear progress.Such comparisons are always inexact, because Mr. Trump has inherited a far more complex, potentially catastrophic, problem than his predecessors faced: a North Korea that has solved the mysteries of manufacturing a nuclear bomb, tested one with 15 times the power of the blast that leveled Hiroshima, and is now on the brink of proving its missiles could reach the continental United States.Still, if Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks on Friday are a blueprint for how he plans to negotiate with Mr. Kim, they foreshadow a process that would resemble \u2014 rather than reinvent \u2014 those undertaken by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush.\u201cThis is the way it\u2019s supposed to go,\u201d said Victor D. Cha, who negotiated with North Korea for Mr. Bush and was considered by the Trump administration as ambassador to Seoul. \u201cThe question is: Does Trump understand that this is what has been done in the past \u2014 that what he\u2019s doing is not big-bang historic?\u201dIn one way, of course, it is big-bang historic: No North Korean leader has ever met an American president as an equal. For Mr. Kim, that achievement alone will give the 34-year-old leader incalculable prestige in his broken country. For his part, Mr. Trump sees the meeting as a historic opportunity to use his dealmaker\u2019s skills and personal connections to bridge gaps that his predecessors could not close.In the process, Mr. Trump is upending the usual sequence of events in diplomacy: beginning with a leader-to-leader summit meeting, and then leaving the details to underlings.Without question, Mr. Trump has gotten farther with North Korea than any American president since that time. Until recently, White House officials said that was because of his laser focus on harsh sanctions and his threat to use military force, giving the United States leverage it never had before.But in the past few days, trying to coax the North Koreans to keep the June 12 meeting on the calendar, Mr. Trump now risks making Mr. Clinton\u2019s mistake: an agreement so thin and slow to execute that Mr. Kim may be able to run the play his father and grandfather mastered \u2014 giving just enough ground to weaken the sanctions on the North, waiting things out, then looking for a way to resume the fastest-developing nuclear program on earth.Indeed, Mr. Trump appears more willing to make concessions to North Korea than he is to Iran, which has a small fraction of the North\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, and no nuclear weapons. That may partly reflect the fact that ending the threat from North Korea is Mr. Trump\u2019s bid for history, much as Iran was Barack Obama\u2019s bid.Mr. Trump\u2019s concessions, some people involved in those past negotiations said, are also a sign that he recognizes the realities of dealing with a suspicious, reclusive government that is wedded to its nuclear shield.South Korea, China and Russia all seem poised to use the new era to resume trade and economic aid to North Korea \u2014 before any agreement by the North to give up anything has been achieved.\u201cTrump is in a box,\u201d Mr. Cha said, \u201cbecause if this doesn\u2019t go well, and he wants to go back to sanctions, the South Koreans and Chinese won\u2019t go along.\u201dMr. Trump seems alert to this danger. He has complained about recent meetings between Mr. Kim and leaders from China and Russia, voicing suspicions that those countries could play a spoiler role. While he reiterated his determination Friday to keep up the pressure, he raised questions in the same breath about the depth of his resolve.\u201cIt\u2019s going to remain what it is now,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the sanctions, after seeing off his North Korean guest, Kim Yong-chol. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to use the term \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 anymore because I don\u2019t want to use that term because we\u2019re getting along. You see the relationship.\u201dHe left unclear whether the change was in the sanctions, or how he described them.But critics say the president is squandering hard-won leverage, the product of 15 months of diplomacy that obtained the toughest United Nations restrictions on trade in history, as well as pushing China, which was angered by Kim Jong-un\u2019s relentless provocations, to embrace for the first time a strategy of isolating North Korea.\u201cTrump is gradually being molded into positions that have been tried before, but with none of the leverage that previous administrations worked to build, and which the Trump administration had acquired through 2017,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, who was involved in the Clinton-era negotiations and later advised Mr. Obama on North Korea.In the joint statement it signed with the United States and four other countries in 2005, for example, North Korea said it would give up its nuclear arsenal and join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as soon as possible.\u201cTrump apparently just agreed to a summit without any way forward on nuclear weapons or much of anything apart from a commitment to start a process whose purpose for now is \u2018getting to know you,\u2019\u201d said Christopher R. Hill, who led the negotiations with North Korea for Mr. Bush.Much of the oil was delivered, over congressional objections. The reactors were never built because the Agreed Framework was abandoned by the Bush administration after the North Koreans were caught cheating by creating a secret uranium enrichment program, another pathway to the bomb.When North Korea lashed out at Mr. Bolton, pointing out that Libya\u2019s leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, was killed less than a decade after he gave up his weapons, Mr. Trump quickly disavowed the views of his aide. Mr. Bolton was left out of Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. Kim\u2019s emissary on Friday.Some former negotiators said Mr. Trump had gotten a much-needed education in the complexities of dealing with North Korea. They said his drive for a meeting was still the best hope to avoid war.\u201cThe trick will be to reach agreements that may not be the Libya model of immediate disarmament but that stop, roll back and eventually dismantle North Korean programs in a way that gives us confidence that they aren\u2019t cheating,\u201d said Joel S. Wit, an expert on North Korea who was involved in diplomacy during the Clinton administration.\u201cThe only way to do that is to meet their concerns on issues like a peace treaty,\u201d Mr. Wit said. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, but that\u2019s what negotiations are about. It\u2019s not one side capitulates. It\u2019s both sides win.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fix the Volcker Rule, but Look for Alternatives, Too", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Calomiris\u00a0is an expert on\u00a0banking, corporate finance, financial history and monetary economics.The existing enforcement approach is simply too burdensome: It requires banks to show that each trade they undertake isn\u2019t speculative but is initiated to serve as a hedge or to make a market in a particular security. There is no clear criterion to use when making that argument, so there is a significant risk of getting it wrong. To avoid that risk, banks avoid some market making. Aggravating that problem, the rule presumes that any security held for more than 60 days in the trading book is a proprietary trade. To avoid having to defend a 61-day holding, banks may liquidate securities held for market-making purposes. This is a particular problem for certain bonds, where transactions are infrequent.The Volcker reforms rationalize compliance in two major ways. First, banks would be grouped into three tiers. The top tier \u2014 currently 18 banks, doing 95 percent of trading \u2014 would be subject to the strictest requirements. The second tier would face lower burdens, and the third tier, with very small trading books, would enjoy a presumption of compliance, unless it came to light that they were involved in proprietary trading.Second, compliance procedures would shift from legalistic box-checking toward meaningful economic criteria. Kevin Tran, a supervisory financial analyst at the Fed, said banks will be \u201crequired to establish a compliance program commensurate with the size, scope and complexity\u201d of their business. Their programs must include \u201cwritten policies and procedures, internal controls, a management review framework, independent testing and audit, training and record-keeping requirements.\u201dBanks would also have to establish approved risk guidelines to gauge whether they are engaging in proprietary trading. For example, if a bank never suffered a large gain or loss on a set of trades, that would support the presumption that it was engaged in market making, and consequently, less detailed monitoring of individual trades would be needed.Banks are not the only ones who will gain from the rule change. Anyone who might want to buy or sell debt securities or foreign exchange will benefit. Global banks are uniquely positioned to make markets in debts and foreign exchange, given their global reach and their knowledge of clients\u2019 holdings and preferences, which allows efficient matching of buyers and sellers. The fall in inventories of securities held by banks in recent years, which the Volcker Rule may have contributed to, makes it harder to maintain price stability.The reforms are well crafted, but they don\u2019t do enough to promote efficiency in financial markets.Regulations other than the Volcker Rule, such as limits on simple leverage and liquidity requirements, are probably more binding constraints on banks\u2019 market-making inventories in debt markets. Those regulations act as a disincentive to holding low-risk debt instruments in trading books. A carve-out from those rules would encourage banks to hold low-risk debt inventories and would improve debt market liquidity.Furthermore, encouraging market making isn\u2019t enough. Proprietary trading serves an important purpose in the market. Done prudently, with appropriate capital requirements to absorb losses, it can improve the liquidity and efficiency of financial markets.To be sure, there are risks to proprietary trading. But there are alternatives to prohibiting it, as the Volcker Rule does. Those risks could be dealt with by capping the amount of proprietary trading and requiring banks to maintain generous loss-absorbing equity buffers.It is important to mitigate the risks of proprietary trading, but just as important to understand its value.Charles W. Calomiris is a professor of finance and economics at the Columbia Business School and an author of \u201cFragile By Design: The Political Origins of Banking Crises and Scarce Credit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Vows to End Experiments on Animals", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe German automaker Volkswagen is promising that it will no longer support the use of animals in testing the effects of diesel exhaust, as the company tries to move past an emissions-cheating scandal in which it was found to have helped finance experiments on monkeys.The pledge was made in a letter to the German branch of the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. It is part of a push by Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, to cope with the toll of a scheme that has resulted in tens of billions of dollars in settlements and fines, the dismissal of successive chief executives and the arrest and imprisonment of top company officials.The cheating, which involved Volkswagen\u2019s illegally rigging the software on millions of vehicles to make it seem as if they complied with pollution standards, has also caused a major shift in the public\u2019s perception of diesel. The fuel had been promoted as an environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline, but governments in Europe and elsewhere are increasingly restricting its use.Volkswagen said in its letter to PETA, which was released on Monday, that it would abandon the practice.Herbert Diess, the carmaker\u2019s chief executive, questioned the ethical decision to conduct experiments on primates, even though he maintained that the studies, which were carried out in the United States, did not violate local laws.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cResearch projects and studies must always be balanced with consideration of ethical and moral questions,\u201d Mr. Diess wrote in the letter. \u201cVolkswagen explicitly distances itself from all forms of animal abuse. In the future, we will rule out all testing on animals, as long as there are no pressing \u2014 such as legal \u2014 reasons that would make this necessary.\u201dHe added that the company would add the new standard to its code of conduct this year and that it would apply to all 12 of Volkswagen\u2019s brands and all 640,000 of its employees.PETA welcomed the latest development.\u201cVolkswagen did the right thing in pledging to no longer conduct tests on animals, which are irrelevant to human health and not required by law,\u201d said Kathy Guillermo, a senior vice president at the group. \u201cPETA is calling on other carmakers that still test on animals to follow suit and embrace modern and humane, animal-free research methods instead.\u201dVolkswagen has pleaded guilty in the United States to charges related to the scheme, admitting that it illegally sold nearly 600,000 vehicles equipped with so-called defeat devices. It has paid more than $25 billion in fines and civil damages. Two executives have been sentenced to prison, and American authorities have brought charges against several others.A Volkswagen spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Fans Paid Dearly for World Cup Tickets That Never Materialized", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Xue Qiulian has been a die-hard fan of Argentina\u2019s national soccer team since his junior high school days in Guangzhou, a southern Chinese megacity. But his dream of seeing the team play live was always out of reach \u2014 until this year, when he could finally afford to attend the World Cup, in Russia.The catch? He paid $620, roughly four times the face value. \u201cJust let me get to Russia to see Messi,\u201d he recalled thinking when he made the purchase, referring to Argentina\u2019s star striker, Lionel Messi.The Chinese Embassy in Moscow said in a notice last week that it had confirmed the fraud with Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry and the local organizing committee for the World Cup. This week, one person was arrested in connection with the case.Anzhi Msk told the Chongqing agencies, which had collectively purchased nearly half a million dollars\u2019 worth of tickets from it, that it had intended to distribute the tickets, but that the Russian officials who had promised to provide them absconded with the ticket money, The Cover reported.Mr. Xue, the Argentina fan, said he bought his $620 ticket from an agency in Beijing called the Russian Chinese Culture Education Development Center. He gave The New York Times a copy of a power-of-attorney agreement he said the agency had sent him, concerning Anzhi Msk\u2019s relations with World Cup ticket buyers in China. The agreement lists Anzhi Msk\u2019s chairwoman as Zhanna E. Bryutova.Ms. Bryutova is also a co-founder of another Russian company, Obltransstroyresurs. Its other co-founder is Eldar A. Isaev, a former executive director of the Anzhi Football Club.In The Cover\u2019s story last week, a travel agent in the western Chinese province of Sichuan named Yang Jun was quoted as saying that someone claiming to be a former member of the Anzhi Football Club had once reached out to him, hinting at a possible collaboration and saying that he had extensive contacts within FIFA, soccer\u2019s governing body.Kommersant said that Mr. Isaev, who it said became a top manager at Anzhi Msk in October after quitting the Anzhi Football Club, was suspected of causing an estimated $1.1 million in losses for Chinese fans. It said Mr. Isaev had pleaded not guilty to the charges, saying he had been set up by his business partners.Ms. Bryutova, Mr. Isaev\u2019s business partner, was also detained, Kommersant said.In a statement on Thursday, Anzhi Football Club said that while Mr. Isaev was its executive director from January to October of 2017, his activity since then has had \u201cno connection\u201d to the club.The Russian Chinese Culture Education Development Center, the Beijing ticketing agency, declined to comment, and several travel agents in Chongqing referred questions to their local tourism office.An officer there said that five travel agencies and about 100 fans in Chongqing had been cheated out of tickets by Anzhi Msk. The officer, who only gave his surname, Guo, said on Wednesday that some of the agencies had purchased new tickets for their clients.But Mr. Xue, the Argentina fan from Guangzhou, said he dealt with an agency because he was desperate to see his favorite team in a tournament that he describes as \u201csacred.\u201dIn April, he said, he was relieved to receive a message from the Beijing ticketing agency with details of his purchase. But May came and went without any sign of the ticket itself.Days before the Argentina-Iceland match in Moscow, he received a letter in which the Beijing ticketing agency said it had \u201clost contact with the ticket holder\u201d and would be unable to \u201cdeliver the physical ticket to the customer as originally planned,\u201d according to a copy of the letter.\u201cI realized I had been cheated,\u201d Mr. Xue said.One of his friends later bought him a ticket, paying more than $1,500. Mr. Xue said he boarded a flight to Moscow last week wondering if that ticket, whose face value was $165, would prove to be fake.In an interview on Wednesday, hours before he flew back to Guangzhou, Mr. Xue said that his Beijing ticketing agency had offered to repay the cost of his $620 ticket, plus an additional 15 percent for his troubles. But he said he had demanded $3,100 \u2014 a sum that included the cost of both his tickets, plus what he called emotional damages.\u201cI\u2019ve been so nervous,\u201d he said.Sophia Kishkovsky and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.

Although she assumed she would be barred from driving the sleek, loud muscle car, she wanted the fun of taking the engine apart and rebuilding it.By 17, she had entered into an arranged marriage. Within a year, she had given birth to a child, divorced, then remarried and divorced again.\u201cI\u2019ve always been a tomboy and a rebel,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, others are thinking more like me. Parents have started to understand that marriage isn\u2019t everything, that girls might want a different life. And society is starting to accept this, too.\u201dAccording to the Saudi ruler, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and their many supporters, the monarchy is verging on a great feminist leap forward. The change reflects the tectonic shifts in a society that have helped women reach the pinnacles of academic and professional success, combined with the effects of globalization, which have brought more openness to the kingdom than at anytime in its recent history.The new law allowing women to drive removes a lightning rod for critics and allies who have long derided the Saudis, a bastion of conservative Islamic orthodoxy, for following a repressive practice embraced by groups like the Taliban and the Islamic State. The new law also dovetails with the monarchy\u2019s ambitious economic changes that aim to wean Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s top producer, from dependence on oil and to diversify the economy \u2014 shifts that require women to be workers and consumers.However, while the joy shared by tens of thousands of Saudi women over the right to take the wheel is undeniable, a bright red line keeps them from equality \u2014 the restrictive guardianship system. It is a mix of law and custom under which women remain dependents of male relatives \u2014 a father, husband, brother, uncle or son \u2014 their whole lives.Guardianship ensures that the gender balance of power at home, work and perhaps even on the roads favors men by allowing them to consent \u2014 or not \u2014 to letting their women work, travel or receive medical care.Beneath her free-spirited life, Ms. Bassem is legally tied to the consent powers of her brother, her current guardian, who has respected her choices. He helped find a progressively minded landlord to rent an apartment to her and acts as her guarantor. \u201cPeople get nervous when ladies live alone,\u201d she said.The rulers have announced that Saudi women will not need a guardian to apply for driver\u2019s education or receive a driver\u2019s license. But that is one of the rare exceptions where men have no role over women\u2019s lives.Saudi citizens still need to contend with the top-down system of governing in which they all are vulnerable to royal commands, whims and punishments.Eight leading women\u2019s rights activists remain behind bars, according to Amnesty International. They are facing serious charges, including spying and sedition.\u201cThere is no doubt that there is a deep transformation happening in Saudi now,\u201d said Kristin Smith Diwan, the senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cBut we are also witnessing a horrible crackdown on some of the people that made these changes possible. What\u2019s not changing is the nature of authority.\u201dThe crown prince has sent mixed messages about the guardianship system. In interviews with American media, he has declared Saudi men and women absolutely equal. Last year, a royal decree commanded government agencies to allow women access to many services without their guardians \u2014 and to list those services to thwart bureaucratic abuses. The lists, however, have not yet been made public.The structure of the guardianship system, which in many ways mimics the ruler\u2019s power over his subjects, means that individual freedom for women is precarious. Last year, a chilling case came to light when a 29-year-old woman, Maryam al-Otaibi, ran away from home, where she claimed male relatives had abused her. She fled to Riyadh, the capital, but her father \u2014 her legal guardian \u2014 filed a criminal complaint, saying she had been \u201cdisobedient\u201d after he commanded her to return home. She was jailed for more than 100 days before she won the right to break free from him.Many women in the fields of social work, women\u2019s empowerment and family law prefer to focus on the gains women have achieved, not the limitations that remain.Since the crown prince took power last year, judges who once would have automatically given fathers custody of children in divorce cases have started allowing some mothers custody instead. Women no longer need a guardian to register a business. More private companies are hiring women for technical and manual labor jobs, helping pull poor families or single mothers up the socio-economic ladder.A catalyst of social change, Ms. Rashid said, is the growing number of Saudi women who are graduating from college, traveling abroad on scholarships and entering the work force.\u201cSaudi Arabia is not black and white,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are incredibly diverse. The biggest engine that has driven these changes is economical. History shows this is the case everywhere in the world.\u201dIn the eastern province city of Al Khobar, Seham al-Amri, 39, is one of a significant number of Saudi women who have capitalized on the changes to make a better life.From the time she was young, she was the clever one in her family. She attended a public university and studied Arabic literature, married at 19, raised five children and taught at a girls\u2019 school.Three years ago, however, when the kingdom was pushing businesses to hire more Saudi citizens, she sought work in the private sector, where pay was much higher and opportunities for women were growing. A leading telecom company offered her a sales position, but Ms. Amri\u2019s husband \u2014 her guardian \u2014 refused to consent.Ms. Amri went behind his back. She took her brother to the company to act as her guardian, and she got the job. Her stellar sales record made her a standout candidate this spring when car companies were seeking Saudi women to help sell vehicles to the rush of new drivers they were expecting.Her husband still disliked the idea, she said, but her new company, the Saudi owner of the Range Rover franchise, did not ask her for a guardian\u2019s approval.She sold seven cars in her first three weeks. Her husband, she said, likes the larger paycheck she brings home. He also has grudgingly accepted her work because relatives and neighbors have not gossiped about it. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want any shame on the family,\u201d she said. \u201cAs for my family, they are all as proud as can be.\u201dA Saudi public opinion poll, commissioned in February by Uber, showed that more than 90 percent of respondents felt positively about lifting the driving ban.That has not diminished the sexism. A popular preacher last year strongly opposed letting women drive, saying their brains were half the size of men\u2019s. Several men said this week that they would stay home on Sunday, convinced that car accidents \u2014 already a problem in the country \u2014 would surge.The planned rollout for women drivers, despite months of buildup, has hit several bumps, partly because of insufficient driver\u2019s education programs and the overlapping bureaucracies needed to fulfill the royal decree.The government has said that women with valid licenses from abroad may obtain a Saudi license with minimal fuss. Several hundred will be ready to drive on Sunday.Yet for tens of thousands of others, the path to driving has been full of obstacles. Only a limited number of training courses have opened for women \u2014 and given the strict gender segregation in effect in schools and government agencies, it is challenging to staff them.Earlier this year, pilot driver\u2019s education programs were scrambling to find qualified women to instruct their Saudi sisters. That is how Sheikha al-Kadeeb, 29, who had been looking for work in finance, was recruited to teach driving.Ms. Kadeeb learned in Los Angeles, where she earned an M.B.A. She loved cruising California freeways in her Jeep Wrangler and jumped at the opportunity to impart her enthusiasm at home. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m on a mission,\u201d she said. \u201cI get a chance to help my country.\u201dParents and family members, meanwhile, have worried about what would happen to women if their cars broke down or the police pulled them over. Casual encounters with strange men are discomfiting to many Saudi women. Nor are some willing to risk the physical threats of being stuck alone.Another problem is the cost of driver\u2019s education for women, which is four to five times as expensive when compared with what men pay.Mohammed al-Ghanami, a diving instructor for the Saudi Marines, has been giving his wife lessons in remote areas where the police or other motorists will not disturb them. He moonlights as an Uber driver and wants his wife to be able to drive their child to the doctor or anywhere else in an emergency, given his extended absences.\u201cShe can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a careful person and a good driver.\u201dGroups of girlfriends, meanwhile, are making celebratory plans for their first drive. Rezan Ben Hassan, 29, learned when she was 16 on desert camping trips with her family. She intends to take the keys to the family vehicle on Sunday and cruise to a cafe.In Al Khobar, Ms. Bassem, the motorcycle lover, plans to hit the road with friends from the local Harley Davidson club. Of their roughly 700 members in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province, a handful of women love Hogs.In what appears to be an attempt to dissuade unqualified drivers on Sunday, the Ministry of Interior announced that the police would be fining drivers caught without a license 900 riyals, or approximately $240.The lack of an official license, however, is not discouraging Ms. Bassem. \u201cThis is going to be one of the most exciting days of my life,\u201d she said.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After #MeToo, the Ripple Effect", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey call themselves \u201cthe nine.\u201d They are nine women, eight scattered around the United States and one in France, each with accusations of having been sexually harassed or assaulted by a former mentor, the playwright Israel Horovitz. Last fall, they chose to speak out publicly against him, adding their voices to the chorus of women proclaiming #MeToo.\u201cThis group of nine women ground me,\u201d said Laura Crook, an actor who lives outside of Boston. She created small pendants \u2014 nine delicate stones and a pearl with \u201cx9\u201d engraved on a silver bead \u2014 for each of the women. \u201cIt\u2019s like we have spun our individual pain into solidarity.\u201dIt\u2019s a strange sisterhood that perhaps could exist only in this particular moment. But these small networks are one of a number of ways that the conversation around #MeToo has shifted to: What\u2019s next?In the 1960s and \u201970s, feminists had a saying: The personal is political. The idea was that when women shared their individual experiences, their struggles \u2014 the ones many believed they were alone in facing \u2014 suddenly became collective. A slight by a boss became about a system of slights; a problem that seemed insurmountable was less so with the power of the group behind it.It\u2019s difficult to assess a movement while it\u2019s still happening. Yet nine months after the allegations against Harvey Weinstein were first published and \u201c#MeToo\u201d became a rallying cry, one of the most sobering revelations \u2014 and one of the most powerful \u2014 has been the sheer universality of it.And it is not just about an array of abusive men. There is a system that perpetuates it: an elaborate \u201cmachinery,\u201d as Jodi Kantor, among The Times reporters honored with a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on the subject, has put it.It is a machinery that has long protected powerful men and prevented women from coming forward. It includes hefty payoffs and inept human-resources departments; complicit bystanders who include women and men; as well as a culture that, for a long time, simply did not accept that a woman coming forward to accuse a man could be telling the truth.\u201cIf survivors of sexual violation were believed and valued, across culture, society, and law, that in itself would be a major transformation,\u201d said Catharine A. MacKinnon, the legal scholar who, in 1979, first laid the groundwork for sexual harassment law and went on to argue it before the Supreme Court.\u201cWomen have been saying these things forever,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is the response to them that has changed.\u201dIf there are phases to this movement, it feels like we\u2019ve cycled through a number of them: First it was just a few women, then it was an army of them, followed by the collective recognition that perhaps those women should be believed. That was accompanied by \u2014 and still is \u2014 the staccato of men toppling, one after the next, and of proclamations of #MeToo around the world: #YoTambien in Spanish, #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cexpose your pig\u201d) in French and #quellavoltache (\u201cthat time when\u201d) in Italian. It was peppered by worries of a backlash.Then, seven months in, the image of Harvey Weinstein in handcuffs \u2014 led, restrained, into his arraignment by a female detective \u2014 symbolized a new stage: the possibility of real, criminal consequences for alleged perpetrators, even the most powerful among them.\u201cI have to admit I didn\u2019t think I would see the day that he would have handcuffs on him,\u201d the actress Rose McGowan, one of the first women to speak out against Mr. Weinstein, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on the day of his arrest.\u201cThis is a long-term project,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic one thing that\u2019s going to change an entire industry, whether it\u2019s Hollywood or Silicon Valley or the Ford Motor Company.\u201dThe European Parliament recently convened a special session on sexual violence, while France has made catcalling and other forms of public harassment a punishable offense. In May, Sweden became the 10th country in Western Europe to acknowledge, in the eyes of the law, that sex without explicit consent can be rape.\u201cThese first nine months have allowed us to start seeing the magnitude of the issue,\u201d said Tarana Burke, the activist who first coined the phrase \u201cMeToo.\u201d \u201cNow, the months and years ahead have to be focused on solutions.\u201dAnd members of Time\u2019s Up, the organization formed by Hollywood creatives and executives to combat harassment, which includes a multimillion dollar legal defense fund, recently wrote an open letter condemning years-old accusations of abuse against the pop star R. Kelly, prompting Spotify, the streaming behemoth, to stop promoting his music.\u201cThis movement has galvanized people into a community,\u201d said Ms. Hill, who now heads the entertainment industry\u2019s Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace.\u201cI had the letters people wrote me, but there was no organizing around the letters. I think this is how social change occurs.\u201dThe ripple effects have extended beyond sexual harassment.In every walk of culture, it seems, #MeToo has made us question: How did we ever think this was O.K.?\u201cCultural revolutions don\u2019t happen quickly,\u201d Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who is now board chairwoman at Miss America, told me a few weeks ago. (She took over after the chief executive was forced to resign over lewd comments.) \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re seeing so much happen in real time so quickly is really amazing. It\u2019s my greatest hope that there\u2019s no turning back.\u201dIn her 2017 book, \u201cButterfly Politics,\u201d Ms. MacKinnon, the legal scholar, delved into a concept from chaos theory in which a tiny motion of a butterfly\u2019s wings can trigger a tornado half a world away. Under the right conditions, she argued, small actions can produce major social transformations.So too, it seems, with the women who first spoke out against Mr. Weinstein \u2014 and a world that may be profoundly changed.\u201cWhen I embarked on this thing, when I decided to speak out, I was worried I was going to feel more alone than when I started,\u201d said Ms. Crook, one of the Horovitz nine. \u201cAnd to feel the opposite of that is pretty remarkable. We\u2019re one cell of this new organism.\u201dJESSICA BENNETT, the first gender editor of The New York Times, investigated allegations of rape and misconduct by nine women against the playwright and director Israel Horovitz.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Sailed Through Its Stress Test. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Not So Much.", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTests produce winners and losers. The one that the government imposed on the nation\u2019s biggest banks this week was no exception.The Fed said last week in the first round that all of the 35 banks it tested had sufficient capital to absorb the losses that might occur in the hypothetical crisis. Because banks are earning big profits right now, the first round of stress tests raised hopes that banks would be allowed to pay out most of those profits to shareholders when the test turned on Thursday to their operational capabilities.The Fed objected only to the capital payouts of an American entity belonging to Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank, which includes its large Wall Street operations. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley did not fail on Thursday, but their pass came with restrictions.Here, DealBook takes a closer look at how the tests played out.The limit on payouts carries a stigma, but it could have been worse. Morgan Stanley\u2019s planned $6.8 billion distribution to shareholders after this year\u2019s stress test is close to what it planned after last year\u2019s. Goldman\u2019s planned payout for this year, $6.3 billion, is lower than last year\u2019s request of around $9.9 billion. But it\u2019s important to note that Goldman has paid out only roughly $5.7 billion of last year\u2019s sum.One reason the Fed did not object to the two firms\u2019 capital plans is that, although their payouts would have taken their capital below minimum requirements in the stress tests, there were mitigating circumstances. The two banks\u2019 results were negatively affected by the recent tax bill enacted by Congress. Adapting to the new law, which meant doing things like repatriating money from abroad, caused losses at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that depleted their capital going into the stress tests. Because of the one-time nature of the losses, and the fact that the tax cuts will bolster earnings over time, the Fed did not object to the two banks\u2019 plans.Even so, it appears that Morgan Stanley had to reduce its plan by around $1.9 billion and Goldman Sachs by roughly $1.2 billion, according to calculations by The New York Times.In a statement, Deutsche Bank said Thursday that DB USA had \u201cmade significant investments to improve its capital planning capabilities as well as controls and infrastructure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the I.R.S. Should Go After Trump", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom\u00a02006 to 2011, Mr. Hackney was an attorney for the chief counsel of the I.R.S. specializing in nonprofit organizations.As a former attorney for the chief counsel of the I.R.S. who specialized in nonprofit organizations, I believe Mr. Trump is also criminally liable for his actions. If I were still at the I.R.S., based on the lawsuit, I would make a criminal referral, on charges of tax evasion or false statements on a tax return, or both.On the tax evasion charge, the government must demonstrate that the defendant willfully failed to pay a tax he owed and acted to disguise or attempted to disguise that evasion. For a false statement charge, the government must show the defendant willingly signed a return under penalties of perjury, making a materially false statement that he knew was false.These are not easy charges to prove, but the Trump Foundation is a nonprofit organization that is entrusted with money to be used exclusively for public charitable purposes. Any use of foundation money to benefit himself is akin to theft.The government could anchor a tax evasion and false statement case upon the multiple instances of self-dealing, as cataloged by the New York attorney general, between Mr. Trump and the foundation. The attorney general details occasions when Mr. Trump directed the foundation to acquire expensive things like paintings of himself for himself; paid $258,000 to settle two private lawsuits; and made political contributions by paying $25,000 to the re-election campaign of Pam Bondi, the Republican attorney general of Florida. The attorney general also amply documents that in 2016, Mr. Trump directed the foundation to operate as a political arm of his campaign.In 2016, when reporters were exposing these uncharitable acts, the Trump Foundation admitted that a contribution to Ms. Bondi\u2019s campaign violated tax law in a tax filing and paid a fine.The I.R.S. does not bring criminal charges for every violation of the tax law. While bad, none of the alleged acts by the Trump Foundation, combined with false statement on a return, would necessarily result in criminal tax implications.Still, the government would need to weigh many factors in considering prosecution. Mr. Trump appears to have signed a form, 990PF, on behalf of the foundation for most years through the 2014 tax return. However, he did not sign the 2015 or 2016 returns. The misuse of the most significant amount of money that the lawsuit alleges happened in 2016. This would make acts of evasion harder to prove.A criminal prosecution may be unlikely for both political reasons and issues of proof, but I still think the I.R.S. has a duty to open an investigation under the egregious set of facts the lawsuit laid out. If Mr. Trump has made false statements on these returns, is it possible he made false statements on other tax returns? He has never released his tax returns, so we have no way of knowing that.I do not believe these violations are within the norm of mistaken or accidental use. It represents a continued willingness to violate basic charitable norms. He may see it as a petty violation, but it is an enormous breach for the broader community.The I.R.S. owes it to the public to investigate such egregious acts for criminal violations.Philip T. Hackney, a professor of law at Louisiana State University Law Center, was from 2006 to 2011 an attorney for the chief counsel of the I.R.S. specializing in nonprofit organizations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Furniture to Cryptocurrency \u2014 Overstock Is on a Journey", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut you\u2019d be wrong. That description is as outdated as a chintz sofa.The company, created almost 20 years ago, has been a pioneer in the mysterious world of cryptocurrency. It was the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin and it\u2019s trying very hard right now to make an even bigger bet by selling off its retail arm and concentrating on the blockchain technology that not only supports cryptocurrency but could revolutionize an array of business sectors.Its founder and chief executive, Patrick Byrne, thinks there\u2019s a bigger future in using the blockchain for trading in capital markets, voting, protecting property rights and more.The plan is a bold one that is not without risks. The stock, which has risen steadily, dropped sharply earlier this year in the midst of overall uncertainty about the valuation of cryptocurrency. But it has stabilized and is now trading at nearly double its price last June.Mr. Byrne seems undaunted despite the gyrations. \u201cWhen we started off we were proud of saying we\u2019re not a tech company, we\u2019re a lemonade stand with a computer in it,\u201d he said.But now, \u201cit\u2019s a logical time to sell our e-commerce business \u2014 to cash in my chips and do this crypto stuff on my own. I want to share the upside with my shareholders.\u201d Mr. Byrne, along with his extended family, owns roughly 30 percent of Overstock.The evolution of Overstock has been both deliberate and serendipitous. The company initially relied on third-party technology for its sales, but more than 10 years ago it began building its own. A turning point came in late 2013 when Mr. Byrne gathered together a group of Overstock programmers to figure out how to accept Bitcoin for purchases. They moved quickly; within a month, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin was never the end goal, he said; instead, it was only the first step in seeing what was possible with the nascent blockchain technology. Nearly five years later, the company generates from $68,000 to $120,000 in cryptocurrency revenues weekly. That translates to roughly \u201c0.2 percent of our revenue,\u201d Mr. Byrne said, adding that Overstock \u201cconverts a lot of that into dollars.\u201dThe handful of programmers and developers who came up with the initial Bitcoin capability has grown into a corps of about 65, based at the company\u2019s new headquarters, which was built on a former Superfund site about 12 miles from Salt Lake City.The name tZero stems from the initial goal \u2014 to trade securities that settle immediately, rather than after the three-day waiting period that existed under federal securities rules. (That time period was shortened to two days last September.) After several years of working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create the system, tZero got the regulatory go-ahead in December 2016, and a small class of Overstock equity is trading via that technology.But that platform was itself upended by last year\u2019s proliferation of initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, which have created an alternative way to raise capital. Responding to the turnabout, tZero began focusing on the technology needed to develop a platform to trade the so-called coins or tokens created in offerings. And to raise capital, tZero itself designed what Mr. Byrne calls a security token offering \u2014 as opposed to an I.C.O. \u2014 saying that it complies with federal securities law.Whether the S.E.C. agrees with that characterization is an open question. Earlier this year, the commission escalated its oversight of I.C.O.s, asserting that many were really equity offerings in disguise. TZero is among those under investigation, Mr. Byrne acknowledged. But he called the heightened S.E.C. oversight \u201clong overdue\u201d for a market he viewed as rife with fraud and he expressed confidence that tZero\u2019s offering was properly done.He said he was looking forward to meeting with the S.E.C. again \u2014 a not-so-veiled reference to the agency\u2019s investigations into Overstock following several earnings restatements roughly a decade ago. No action has been taken against Overstock in the past.The S.E.C.\u2019s current investigation, on which the agency has declined to comment, hasn\u2019t slowed tZero\u2019s expansion efforts. Mr. Byrne recently met with potential investors overseas but hasn\u2019t yet disclosed how much money has been raised. In addition to technology under development, in May, tZero and Box Digital Markets announced a joint venture to create what they say is the \u201cindustry\u2019s first regulated security token exchange.\u201dMedici Ventures has backed other companies as well. With its president, Jonathan Johnson, a former Overstock board chairman from 2014 to 2017, Medici has so far invested an undisclosed amount in 13 blockchain companies.When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.Most recently, West Virginia became the first state to test the technology in its recent primary election, allowing overseas members of the military to cast their votes. Michael Queen, a spokesman for the West Virginia secretary of state, said in an email that \u201ca comprehensive audit is being conducted to evaluate the security of the blockchain used for the mobile application.\u201dEven with the prospect of selling its retail arm, Overstock continues to invest in its e-commerce efforts, including working on efficiency in its supply chain and adding a new distribution center to improve its two-day shipping.Although it\u2019s clear from interviews and earnings calls that Mr. Byrne\u2019s sights are set on cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology, he cautions this is not an asset class for the general public.\u201cWhile I wax enthusiastic, and while there\u2019s a pony in there somewhere, the public should stay away from cryptocurrency. At least until the S.E.C. gets its arms around it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Numbers That Explain Why Teachers Are in Revolt", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a quarter-century of steady growth on education spending, a shock to the system. American teachers are angry.They have taken to the streets in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado \u2014 and more recently in North Carolina. Dissent is building in Louisiana and Nevada, too.Moreover, the recovery that has lifted the private economy has not quite restored school spending to pre-recession levels, especially in states run by fiscal conservatives determined to hold the line on government spending.For a system that had experienced nothing but spending growth for a quarter-century, the past few years have been a major shock. K-12 spending per pupil rose 26 out of 29 years before 2010, only to tumble three consecutive years at the beginning of this decade.\u201cPer-pupil spending went up forever,\u201d says Matthew Chingos, director of the Urban Institute\u2019s education policy program. \u201cThe book highlighted these hideous inequalities in schooling, where there were 50 kids in a class with pipes that were broken and stuff like that, and there was a very good, earnest push toward increasing equity,\u201d said Marguerite Roza, a research professor and director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University.Then came a one-two punch to the growth in education spending: The recession worsened financial problems already widespread in many states, and voters began electing conservative governors and legislatures that promised to rein in budget woes with spending cuts.On top of fiscal policy decisions, a more fundamental concern is the increasing volatility of state tax revenues, says Bruce Baker, a professor of education at Rutgers University who studies school finance.States cover about 47 cents of every dollar spent on public education, with a further 45 cents raised locally, mostly through property taxes, and 8 cents coming from the federal government.The political climate has also made it tougher to overhaul the tax system in any way that could be perceived as a tax increase, whether in good economic times or bad.It\u2019s easy to see why teachers are in the vanguard of the protest. Teacher salaries make up the bulk of education spending \u2014 so when education spending stagnates or is cut, teachers feel the pain most directly.Protests over these cuts have been directed mostly at state capitols, where overall education policy is administered.Property taxes to fund education have been attacked by both small-government conservatives and by liberals who note the wide disparity in tax bases in wealthy and poorer communities.It now seems the pendulum is swinging toward spending growth in states that had been lagging.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fix for New York\u2019s Parking Problems", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Shoup is a professor of urban planning at UCLA.If you\u2019ve ever driven a car in New York City, you probably know the drill: The city\u2019s free on-street parking gives a small, temporary benefit to a few lucky drivers, but it creates big problems for everyone else. Drivers hunting for an open spot will circle the block, wasting fuel, congesting traffic and polluting the air.One approach is to charge for on-street parking. But how much? And how do you make it politically acceptable in a city where drivers are used to paying nothing?Fortunately, there\u2019s an answer to both questions: Sell market-priced parking permits for certain heavily trafficked parts of the city, then plow that money back to improve the nearby neighborhoods.The problem is a big one. Laid end-to-end, New York\u2019s three million on-street parking spaces would stretch almost halfway around the earth. They would cover about 17 square miles of land, 13 times the size of Central Park.Because 97 percent of New York\u2019s on-street parking is free, the indirect parking subsidy \u2014 what the city gives to drivers in the form of free parking \u2014 is astronomical. For example, if only half of New York\u2019s on-street spaces were metered and the average revenue per space were only $2,000 a year ($5.50 a day), the total revenue would amount to $3 billion a year.There are other, indirect costs as well. One study of 15 blocks on the Upper West Side of Manhattan found that drivers cruised more than a third of a mile, on average, before finding an open space. In a year, this cruising created about 366,000 vehicle miles of travel and 325 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.If New York charges market prices for curb parking \u2014 the lowest prices that will produce one or two open spaces on each block \u2014 drivers won\u2019t need to hunt for parking because they will always see open curb spaces available wherever they go. Parking won\u2019t be free, but it won\u2019t be scarce.The New York City Council is considering a proposal for residential parking permit districts, in which drivers would need to buy permits to park in certain parts of the city. If the permit prices are set by the demand for parking in the area, they will be higher near, say, Times Square and lower in northern Manhattan.Needless to say, this won\u2019t be popular \u2014 nothing is more political than parking. To create the necessary political support for market-priced curb parking, some cities have created so-called parking benefit districts that dedicate the meter revenue to pay for added public services on the metered streets. Everyone who lives or works in a parking benefit district can see their meter money at work cleaning the sidewalks, planting street trees and providing free Wi-Fi. New York could do the same with its permit plan.To avoid unequal public spending among the parking benefit districts, New York can use what in public finance is called power equalization: Regardless of the revenue each district earns, the city can give every district equal revenue per curb space to pay for added public services. Equal effort will produce equal results.Suppose the city\u2019s average revenue per curb space is $2,000 a year. The city can spend $1,000 per curb space for added public services in all the parking districts and spend the other half for citywide services, such as cleaning subway stations. Drivers parked above ground will pay to improve life for everyone traveling underground.Parking permit districts could also eliminate the need for drivers to move their cars on street-cleaning days: The revenue can pay for staff and equipment to clean under the parked cars. That cuts down on an annoyance for locals, and another major source of congestion and pollution.Market prices for curb parking do not mean only the rich will park on the street \u2014 remember, the permits are market priced, based on the users\u2019 willingness to pay. Because cities are typically segregated by income, the rich will compete with each other for curb parking in their own neighborhoods and pay higher prices than the rest of the city. Richer neighborhoods with higher parking prices will earn more revenue, but power equalization will send much of this money to poorer neighborhoods with lower parking prices.Diverse interests across the political spectrum can find things to like in a parking benefit district. Liberals will see that it pays for public services. Conservatives will see that it relies on market choices. Drivers will see that it frees them from moving their cars for street cleaning. Residents will see that it improves the neighborhood. Environmentalists will see that it reduces energy consumption, air pollution and carbon emissions. Elected officials will see that it depoliticizes parking and pays for public services without raising taxes.Cities can fairly and efficiently manage their curb space as valuable public real estate used for private parking. They can stop subsidizing cars, congestion and carbon emissions, and instead provide better public services.Parking benefit districts can improve cities, the economy and the environment, one parking space at a time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mo Salah, Now Starring in Chechnya", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe was apparently roused from sleep by the Chechen strongman Ramzan A. Kadyrov. Egypt\u2019s World Cup training camp has begun. GROZNY, Russia \u2014 Ramzan A. Kadyrov did not sustain himself as the autocratic leader of the Chechen republic by failing to understand the value of propaganda and spectacle.So he was not to be deterred when Egypt\u2019s national soccer team arrived here at its World Cup training camp on Sunday, and the whole squad showed up for an evening workout \u2014 except for the star forward Mohamed Salah.The bearded Mr. Kadyrov, 41, left the field in his turquoise and white track suit. Soon, he returned, this time making a grand entrance with Mr. Salah before about 8,000 fans, posing for photographers and television cameras, even grabbing the Liverpool star\u2019s arm and raising it as if crowning a boxing champion.Turko Daudov, a prominent adviser to Mr. Kadyrov, said Mr. Salah had been napping at the nearby team hotel and had been awakened and driven to the stadium in Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s car.Both the soccer star and the regional leader are in urgent need of their own forms of rehabilitation. Mr. Salah is attempting to heal his injured shoulder in time for Egypt\u2019s opening World Cup match on Friday against Uruguay in Yekaterinburg.Mr. Kadyrov is seeking a more elusive kind of rehab: repairing an image of ruthlessness and oppression as he seeks to draw more investors and tourists to this formerly war-ravaged capital in the North Caucasus region.\u201cIt\u2019s all about a positive image of the Chechen Republic,\u201d Jambulat Umarov, Chechnya\u2019s minister of national policy, press and information, said of hosting Egypt\u2019s training camp. \u201cIt\u2019s about dispelling myths.\u201dSo far, Mr. Kadyrov has struggled to burnish that image.Chechnya was involved in two brutal separatist wars in the 1990s and early 2000s. Since then, Mr. Kadyrov, a former rebel whose powerful family aligned in 1999 with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has aggressively suppressed dissent.Unable to persuade Egypt to train elsewhere, Human Rights Watch has been urging FIFA, soccer\u2019s world governing body, to attempt to get Mr. Titiev freed. Otherwise, anyone with a complaint regarding a FIFA-related activity here \u2014 a stadium worker, hotel worker or a protester \u2014 will have no place to turn for redress, said Rachel Denber, deputy director for the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch.\u201cFIFA really needs to step up and lean on Putin,\u201d Ms. Denber said.Mr. Umarov, the minister, bristled that Human Rights Watch should decide which team trains where, and he said FIFA could ask for Mr. Titiev\u2019s release, but \u201cwe have a constitution and laws that are higher than FIFA.\u201dLast year, when informed about the detention and torture of about 100 gay men and continued harassment of journalists in Chechnya, FIFA noted that its policy on human rights \u201cprohibited discrimination of any kind\u201d and said of the abuses, \u201cwe firmly condemn them.\u201dAsked recently about the propriety of a World Cup team training in Chechnya, a FIFA communications representative said in an email, \u201cThrough its activities, FIFA does not legitimize any regimes.\u201dAs Egypt\u2019s team arrived near the end of the holy month of Ramadan, it found in Grozny comfort in a fellow Sunni Muslim region, convenient access to one of the largest mosques in Europe and halal food. But there are practical reasons for the team\u2019s choice of a base, too: the players are staying in a new, five-star hotel with no other guests, and the stadium they are using for practices is only a five-minute walk from the hotel.Ihab Leheta, the general manager of Egypt\u2019s national team, declined to comment on the objections by Human Rights Watch, saying recently in Cairo: \u201cWe chose from the list FIFA gave us. If people have a problem with Grozny, they should speak to FIFA.\u201dThe Pharaohs, as Egypt\u2019s team is known, have qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 28 years. Their hopes depend largely on Mr. Salah, who scored 44 goals for Liverpool during the 2017-18 season and was named the top player in England\u2019s Premier League. He led his team to the Champions League final last month before injuring his shoulder early in that match against eventual champion Real Madrid.If Mr. Salah can recover sufficiently, Egypt holds reasonable hope of advancing beyond the group stage of the World Cup after round-robin matches against Uruguay, Russia and Saudi Arabia.This week, Egyptian national flags line the road from the airport to central Grozny. Billboards depict its players in celebration. The managers at the team hotel speak Arabic and English. Security, medical and firefighting personnel are on duty around the clock. Even traffic patterns have been adjusted to accommodate the team.This lavish welcome is an attempt to show outsiders that Chechnya is politically and economically stable, Mr. Umarov, the minister, said, adding, \u201cIt shows that big stars who are famous worldwide feel safe in Chechnya.\u201dThis is hardly the first time Mr. Kadyrov is making a theatrical attempt to ingratiate himself with the international sports world. In 2011, he coaxed the retired Argentine great Diego Maradona to play an exhibition match here in an effort to show that Chechnya had recovered from its wars.According to various accounts, Mr. Kadyrov captained the other team and either scored a hat trick or assisted on numerous goals in a 5-2 victory against a defense that was generous to the point of deferential.Mr. Kadyrov will seek similar public-relations benefits from Mr. Salah\u2019s presence and will be thrilled if Mr. Salah expresses that Grozny is safe, developed and culturally pleasing, said Karim Zidan, a Canadian-based journalist who has written extensively about sports and politics in Chechnya.At times when Mr. Kadyrov faces harsh criticism, Mr. Zidan said, \u201cYou can believe he\u2019ll have some celebrities in or football matches or fights going on to distract his citizens and people around the world from taking notice.\u201dThe outreach to the Muslim world is also an attempt by Mr. Kadyrov to make himself the leader of all of Russia\u2019s estimated 20 million Muslims, to mixed results. His forays into soccer, for example, have been both ambitious and clumsy. He is a former president of the local soccer team, then known as F.C. Terek and, since last year, as F.C. Akhmad in honor of his father, Akhmad H. Kadyrov, a previous president of Chechnya who was assassinated in 2004.Mr. Gullit\u2019s tenure was short and strange. He complained to The Daily Mail of London about training conditions, broken promises about player acquisitions and the inability to get a drink. After six months, he was gone.The team posted on its website an excoriating note: \u201cGullit must know that he was invited not to nightclubs and discos to disappear, but to work in a football club, in this case to achieve a result. Yes, we have no drugs, no indecent night life, which in the Netherlands and in Europe there is lots.\u201dThe strange events did not stop after Mr. Gullit departed.What happened next in the stadium tunnel, according to a complaint filed by the Russian players\u2019 union, was that Mr. Gogniev \u201cwas apprehended by a group of men dressed in police uniforms.\u201cThey grabbed him and dragged him aside,\u201d the report said, \u201cwhere they proceeded to beat him with batons\u201d and left him with \u201cbroken ribs, a broken nose, severe bruising and a concussion.\u201dIn 2013, Mr. Kadyrov, upset at the referee in a match against FC Rubin Kazan, admitted that it was he who shouted over the stadium loudspeaker, \u201cThe ref\u2019s been bought off! You\u2019re an ass!\u201d He later apologized.During the World Cup, Egyptian soccer players will be the most high profile athletes in the region. Of particular interest will be a match against Russia on June 19, and the possibility that Egypt could advance while knocking Russia out of the tournament.There are political angles to this story as well as sporting ones. Mr. Kadyrov has served as an emissary for Mr. Putin while forging relationships with Middle Eastern countries like the United Arab Emirates, which financed the Egyptian team\u2019s hotel here. And now Mr. Kadyrov has an opportunity to seek closer ties to the authoritarian Egyptian leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who would surely be elated if the Pharaohs advanced.But that could leave Mr. Kadyrov in a somewhat awkward position if Egypt\u2019s success came at the expense of Russia, and by extension, Mr. Putin. His advisers said this week that, were that to occur, he would feel disappointed for Russia but joyful for Egypt.Mr. Zidan, the journalist, said: \u201cKadyrov walks a fine line, presenting himself as an ethnic Chechen and a loyalist of Putin and Russia. I wonder how he really views this, if he would be so upset if Russia was knocked out. It\u2019s a little complicated.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}

Alito Jr. said, writing for the majority. \u201cA more direct affront to state sovereignty is not easy to imagine.\u201dWith its decision, the Supreme Court opened the door to legalize an estimated $150 billion in illegal wagers on professional and amateur sports that Americans make every year.Mr. Geisenberger said that the governor and the casinos had been assembling training materials, updating and testing software, working on logo options and training casino employees and gaming enforcement staff.\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting day here in Delaware, but days like this don\u2019t happen by accident,\u201d he said.When the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act was enacted in 1992, it included an exemption that allowed Delaware, Montana, Oregon and Nevada to continue at least some sports-betting operations.In Delaware, that was a very niche product of parlay-style wagering on N.F.L. football, Ms. Slane said.

But the discussions do not appear to have led to any financial help for the high-profile legal and public relations fight being waged by Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels.Mr. Brock\u2019s groups decided not to donate to the efforts because they saw little value in spending money on a legal fight that was largely being waged in the news media, especially given Mr. Avenatti\u2019s penchant for attracting press coverage, according to two Democratic political operatives familiar with the discussions.It is not clear why the other interactions did not lead to donations or other assistance.The solicitations call into question Mr. Avenatti\u2019s insistence that he and Ms. Clifford have never actively sought to raise money from major political donors because \u201cwe will not allow this to be politicized.\u201dIn an interview Thursday, Mr. Avenatti reiterated that \u201cthis isn\u2019t about politics.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the name of every person that I have spoken to, or not spoken to, over the last three months,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what I can tell you is that we have not taken any political-associated dollars from anyone on the right or anyone on the left.

Mr. Brock and Mr. Berkowitz declined to comment.Mr. Avenatti said he did not recognize the names of Mr. Beychok, Mr. Brock and Mr. Berkowitz, but did not dispute that he or his associates may have reached out to them.\u201cWe\u2019ve contacted people on the right and the left relating to a variety of issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not sought any money from anyone on the right or the left.\u201d In fact, he said, he had turned down \u201cbig money\u201d from political donors on both sides of the aisle \u201cbecause we\u2019re not going to have this politicized.\u201dSusie Tompkins Buell, a prominent Clinton donor who gave $500,000 \u2014 later refunded \u2014 to the effort funded partly by American Bridge to coax Mr. Trump\u2019s accusers to come forward before the election, said she had not heard from Mr. Avenatti.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I would be interested in supporting\u201d Mr. Avenatti\u2019s effort, she said.

{"Headline": "Greece Prepares to Stagger Back From Debt Crisis, the End of Bailouts in Sight", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European leaders announced early Friday a plan that would finally take Greece off financial life support, effectively declaring an end to a regional debt crisis that nearly destroyed the euro.The deal reduces Greece\u2019s dependence on its fellow European countries and on the International Monetary Fund, more than eight years after the Continent was plunged into a deep financial crisis that created lasting political fissures. Greece and several other countries in southern Europe were forced to impose painful austerity measures in return for bailouts from their richer northern neighbors. The actions included cutting pensions, raising taxes and in some cases even selling off public assets.\u201cAfter eight long years, Greece will finally be graduating from its financial assistance,\u201d said M\u00e1rio Centeno, president of the Eurogroup, which comprises the finance ministers in the eurozone. \u201cGreece joined Ireland, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal in the ranks of euro-area countries that turned around their economies and once again stand on their own feet.\u201dGreece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said his country was looking to the future after years of depression-like economic conditions.\u201cThis government will never forget what the Greek people went through these past years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people must very soon see a difference in their pockets. That is the promise that the Greek government gives.\u201dGreece will receive a final \u20ac15 billion in loans for the last two months of the program. After that, it will receive a significant debt relief package: a 10-year extension on loans that were granted during previous bailouts and a 10-year deferral on interests and amortization. A cash buffer of \u20ac24.1 billion should cover its sovereign financial needs for the next 22 months.The country will remain closely watched by European institutions and the International Monetary Fund, which will be monitoring its fiscal discipline and the reforms started under the current program.\u201cWith all these measures we can safely say that Greek debt is sustainable going forward,\u201d Mr. Centeno said.But Greece still faces daunting challenges.\u201cIf you look at the past three years, the Greek economy recovered, jobs were created,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels think tank. \u201cBut I think you can\u2019t just look at the past three years. You have to look at what happened in 2010, and clearly it was a huge disaster.\u201dPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who rose to power vowing to reverse austerity, has acknowledged that the end of Greece\u2019s third bailout program will not bring about a magical transformation. \u201cWhen you take a patient out of intensive care,\u201d he told a group of Greek entrepreneurs last month, \u201cyou don\u2019t make him run a sprint.\u201dMr. Tsipras\u2019s political opponents, who have been gaining ground in opinion polls, have noted that the country will remain under foreign supervision for years to come and will still be subject to harsh austerity measures, including a package approved by Parliament last week that includes further pension cuts, tax increases and privatization of state assets.That view is often echoed by regular Greeks. \u201cWhat exit? This is a life sentence,\u201d said Giorgos Amanatidis, a 67-year-old pensioner in Athens.

{"Headline": "A Prophet of Doom Was Right About the Climate", "Date": "2018-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterThe night before the day that would make him famous, James E. Hansen listened to a baseball game on the radio. But his mind kept wandering: What would he say to Congress the next day to convey that humans were endangering the planet?He had conducted rigorous studies of historical temperatures, concluding that the planet was warming sharply. He had helped to pioneer computer modeling of the climate, and the results predicted further warming if people kept pouring greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.June 23 turned out be a blistering day in Washington, and much of the nation was suffering through a drought and heat wave. Dr. Hansen took his seat in a Capitol Hill hearing room and laid out the scientific facts as best he understood them.He had thought up a good line the night before, during the Yankees game, but in the moment he forgot to deliver it. When the hearing ended, though, reporters surrounded him, and he remembered.\u201cIt is time to stop waffling so much,\u201d he said, \u201cand say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.\u201dHis near certainty that human emissions were already altering the climate caught the attention of a sweltering nation, catapulting Dr. Hansen to overnight fame. That year, 1988, would go on to be the hottest in a global temperature record stretching back to the 19th century.With the perspective of three decades, it is fair to ask: How right was his forecast?The question defies a simple answer. In 1988, Dr. Hansen had to offer a prognostication not just about how the Earth would respond to greenhouse gases, but also about how much of those gases humans would choose to inject into the air.He did what any cautious forecaster would do: He offered low, medium and high scenarios. The warming over the past 30 years has indeed fallen well within his upper and lower bounds.The bigger problem was that the computers he was using in the 1980s could not operate fast enough to give a realistic picture of the upper atmosphere; as a result, his model was most likely overestimating the Earth\u2019s sensitivity to emissions. In the years since, computer modeling of the climate, though hardly perfect, has improved.So while his temperature forecast was not flawless, in a larger sense, Dr. Hansen\u2019s 1988 warning has turned out to be entirely on target. As emissions have soared, the planet has warmed relentlessly, just as he said it would; 1988 is not even in the top 20 warmest years now. Every year of this century has been hotter.If his warning in 1988 had been met with a national policy to reduce emissions, other countries might have followed, and the world would be in much better shape.But within a few years after he raised the alarm, fossil-fuel interests and libertarian ideologues began financing a campaign of lies about climate research. The issue bogged down in Congress, and to this day that body has taken no action remotely commensurate with the threat.The congressional failure to respond to his warning might be seen now as a harbinger of the political crisis that has since engulfed the United States. How can Congress tackle global warming if it lacks the capacity to solve far smaller problems?\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see us fixing the climate,\u201d Dr. Hansen said, \u201cuntil we fix our democracy.\u201dMr. Gillis is a former New York Times environmental reporter and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Years After Eric Garner\u2019s Death, Secrecy Law on Police Discipline Remains Unchanged", "Date": "2018-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe city\u2019s explanation that it could not disclose the disciplinary history of the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, because the statute made the records confidential fed a national debate over transparency and police accountability and prompted promises from City Hall and the state Capitol to push for the law to be changed or repealed.But nearly four years after Mr. Garner\u2019s death on July 17, 2014, on Staten Island, the statute, Section 50-a of the State Civil Rights Law, is, if anything, stronger, its interpretation expanded at the insistence of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration, even as the mayor has vowed more transparency.\u201cIf it\u2019s led to this much confusion, it\u2019s a badly written law,\u201d said Cynthia Conti-Cook, a staff lawyer at the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit that sought Officer Pantaleo\u2019s records from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, a police oversight agency.The Assembly Speaker, Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, has not taken a position on the statute. The Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican, opposes changing it.While the Legislature has not moved on the statute, neither Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo nor Mayor Bill de Blasio has laid out a path forward.\u201cThe commissioner, his predecessor and I are united in wanting change in the law that will create the transparency everyone wants and once and for all settle the question,\u201d he said.Those who want the law changed concede it is unlikely as long as Republicans control the Senate. But they are still making the rounds in Albany, with the expectation that if they are not successful in the next few weeks, the political climate could be more favorable after November if Democrats regain control of the upper chamber.\u201cUnless the leadership changes, or unless the governor decides he wants to get behind the legislation, I do not see it changing,\u201d State Senator Kevin S. Parker, a Brooklyn Democrat, said. Mr. Parker is the sponsor of a bill supported by the Police Department that will allow some records to be disclosed once disciplinary proceedings have concluded, a process that can take years in high-profile cases, including fatal police encounters with unarmed civilians like Mr. Garner.Even if Democrats win control of the Senate, changing the statute will not be easy. Many lawmakers fear the dozens of police, fire and corrections unions across the state that have millions of dollars in resources to undermine a campaign or provide a financial boost.Ed Mullins, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association in New York City, said it was important to preserve the statute because releasing disciplinary records could serve to prejudice public opinion against police officers.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a balance where the public\u2019s interest is at the forefront, but so are the rights of the individual police officers involved because we don\u2019t get a do-over,\u201d he said.Joo-Hyun Kang, the coalition\u2019s director, said repeal had become necessary because of legal precedents that were established over the past two years affirming the de Blasio administration\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u2019s protections.\u201cThe body of case law and their public messaging promotes the idea that pretty much anything related to an officer should be kept confidential \u2014 it\u2019s just really irresponsible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes a segment of the public believe that we don\u2019t have the right to know about the people patrolling our neighborhoods who can use deadly force against us, and we should have that right.\u201dCouncilman Donovan J. Richards Jr., the chairman of the City Council\u2019s Committee on Public Safety, said he thought the Police Department was worried that the public would see that \u201cthe disciplinary measures don\u2019t match up to the cases that come before them.\u201d Mr. Richards, a Queens Democrat, noted that the police often release the names and pictures of officers to praise them for good work on potentially dangerous cases, like drug and gun busts.Lawmakers\u2019 inaction on the statute has left it to state courts to parse the law\u2019s meaning in litigation brought by transparency advocates seeking fuller disclosure and police unions looking to apply it more broadly.The Police Department reversed course in March, when it announced that it would provide disciplinary summaries on its website with officers\u2019 names removed. But that plan has been put off because the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, the city\u2019s largest police union, obtained a court order temporarily halting it.The union has also taken the city to court over the Police Department\u2019s policy of releasing edited body camera videos at Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill\u2019s discretion. City lawyers defend the policy with the assertion that edited videos do not fall under the statute because they are not used to evaluate officers.Councilman Rory I. Lancman, a Queens Democrat and the chairman of the Council\u2019s Committee on the Justice System, led the push for a law passed in 2016 requiring the Police Department to provide data on officers\u2019 use of force and related disciplinary outcomes by precinct.\u201cThere are people out here that are looking to do police officers harm, and I know you know that,\u201d he said at a Council budget hearing. \u201cSo, you know, we just don\u2019t sit over in 1 Police Plaza making these decisions without careful consideration.\u201dMr. Lancman said in an interview that the shifting position on whether it could comply with the disclosure law showed that the Police Department had \u201cno coherent policy for how 50-a should be interpreted and applied.\u201d\u201cIt really amounts to a game of three-card monte,\u201d he added.\u201cUntil we legislatively fix it,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be the whims of any mayor or police department to do with it what they want.\u201dDoris Burke and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Home Is Where the Horror Is", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "What happens when your family is what frightens you? A renaissance in terrifying movies skips jump scares in favor of dread based on adult fears.Supported byIn \u201cHereditary,\u201d bugs crawl from decapitated heads, ghosts lurk in the shadows and an artist tries to communicate with the dead. But the most jarring moment of this terrifying new movie might be when Annie, a mother played by Toni Collette, tells her son she never wanted to have him and tried to induce a miscarriage. Then she wakes from this nightmare, unsettled by the thoughts rattling in her subconscious. Parental guilt is the real monster here.Moving into territory once the preserve of prestige dramas, horror has never been more bankable and celebrated than it is right now. And while evil clowns and serial killers at sorority houses still haunt young viewers (and make tons of money), we\u2019re in the midst of a golden age of grown-up horror. Hushed and character-driven, this mix of indie fare and blockbusters works ferociously on adult anxieties in an age of dislocation.These movies have confronted liberal racism, economic worries and family dysfunction; and while horror has always reflected the social and political concerns of its day, if you had to pinpoint a unifying theme that distinguishes this renaissance, it\u2019s the ominous danger of overwhelming grief. A character coping with the death of a loved one is the new car of teenagers heading to a cabin in the woods. It\u2019s the starting point of \u201cHereditary,\u201d \u201cGoodnight Mommy\u201d and \u201cPyewacket,\u201d to name just a few movies from the last three years. Then there\u2019s the subgenre of apocalyptic movies (like \u201cIt Comes at Night\u201d), whose narratives revolve around coping with the vanishing not of one person, but possibly all of them.\u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d the horror blockbuster of the year, belongs to both categories. Directed by John Krasinski, it\u2019s an end-of-the-world movie about unstoppable monsters that appear to have wiped out most of humanity, but the engine of the story is a sibling\u2019s ill-advised decision that leads to the murder of her brother, fracturing and haunting the family. \u201cGet Out,\u201d Jordan Peele\u2019s triumphant debut of 2017, does not begin with mourning, but the inability to process grief is a critical theme. Though liberal racism is the source of the main character\u2019s terror, what allows him to be hypnotized, rendered frozen and helpless in \u201cthe sunken place,\u201d is the memory of his mother\u2019s death and his guilt over not doing more to save her.For most of its history, horror was considered kids\u2019 stuff. The publisher of the first major fanzine dedicated to scary movies \u2014 the influential Famous Monsters of Filmland \u2014 gave his editor one instruction at its start in 1958: I\u2019m 11 and a half years old. Make me laugh. The reputation of scary movies started to change in the late 1960s and 1970s, when a new breed of ambitious filmmakers pushed to make them darker, more realistic and mature. (See \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now.\u201d) While many of the films from this era explored the tensions of the generation gap, they were typically on the side of the younger counterculture. The poster for Wes Craven\u2019s \u201cThe Last House on the Left\u201d (1972) warned: \u201cnot recommended for persons over 30.\u201dIn the following decades, the business of horror expanded and became more diverse, as the genre shed its disreputable image, gaining more respect from critics and even attention from the Academy Awards. These days, the scary movies that dominate the discussion in popular culture are more likely to try to make adults tremble than children giggle.Like comedy, horror is drawn to transgression, as both a short-term shock and a cathartic outlet for repressed emotions. There\u2019s no one right way to mourn the death of a loved one, but this movie provides a litany of wrong ways. When Annie\u2019s son, a sulking, withdrawn teenager played with hollow eyes by Alex Wolff, witnesses an act of unspeakable violence, instead of screaming or calling the police, he freezes, silent, then heads home, goes to sleep and tells no one.A quirk of most horror movies is that the people in them tend to move on from violence much quicker than they do in real life, in part because they need to (no time to pay your respects when a sociopath is chasing you) but also because of the mechanics of scary movies: Horror directors like to keep frights at a brisk pace. But \u201cHereditary\u201d turns the teenager\u2019s denial into the subject of the scare, making the lack of sustained response to death appear chilling, even another kind of death.Like the found-footage or torture-porn genres before them, grown-up horror movies frequently lean on a high concept, but they are far more likely to blur the line between scary movie and bleak drama. Not only are there few jump cuts, but the camera work is also intentionally slow. Silence often operates the way the violins do in \u201cJaws,\u201d as a warning that something sinister awaits. \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe\u201d are both movies about keeping quiet to avoid unstoppable blind killers, making anything but silence equal murder. And in a family dinner scene in \u201cHereditary,\u201d all the sound cuts out except the clatter of silverware, which seems like the final blows of a bloody sword fight. Though horror has a long history of setting up scares with jokes, in these films, the mood is relentlessly grim.Mr. Blum pushed back, saying his films must be rooted in a coherent reality. Before finishing any project, he said, he tries an exercise: \u201cLet\u2019s take out all the scares. Would it work as a drama?\u201dThis is a very different attitude from that of past horror impresarios, and illustrates an aesthetic divide. No one wants to see \u201cHalloween\u201d or \u201cAlien\u201d without the scares.Mr. Ellis hinted at a concern that many fans, including myself, have about the growing respectability of the genre. Now that horror attracts better actors, bigger budgets and meatier scripts, there is a sense of fun missing in some of the tasteful scary movies. Has horror lost some of its disreputable pleasures, not to mention its single-minded determination to terrify?Part of the reason horror has long targeted young viewers is that it\u2019s harder to scare adults. We have seen too much, including other scary movies. But that experience can be used against us. H.P. Lovecraft famously wrote that the strongest kind of fear was that of the unknown. But the older you get, the less unknown there is. Vampires, werewolves and zombies don\u2019t frighten like they once did. But ghosts still do \u2014 when they remind us of what we have lost.5 Directors to watchThese filmmakers are shaking up the genre with hushed, character-driven movies.Where to watch: In theaters starting June 8.Where to stream or rent \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe.\u201dWhere to stream or rent \u201cIt Comes at Night.\u201dWhere to stream or rent \u201cIt Follows.\u201dWhere to stream or rent \u201cThe Babadook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Tuesday night, bouquets of roses and peonies piled up outside the storefront of 789 Madison, the latest expression of what has been an incredible public outpouring of emotion following the suicide of designer Kate Spade. There was deep shock, followed by growing discussion about the need to address mental health issues. There was acknowledgment of the fact that no matter how seemingly successful or sunny a surface can be, underneath it all, great pain can exist. There were intensely touching stories of personal experience and depression. But along with it all came wholehearted appreciation of the stuff she made.It sounds the least of it, but the handbag hymns are testimony to the fact that Ms. Spade\u2019s influence had resonated far beyond the store window and the runway. Her work had reached into people\u2019s minds and helped express their sense of self. A bag became more than a bag: it became a symbol of an important moment in a life and part of an individual\u2019s biography.Sometimes it was a gift from a family member to mark an important transition. Sometimes it was a gift to oneself, saved up for over months or longer. Sometimes it signaled arrival of sorts, or the beginning of a new stage; sometimes it was an entry point to an expanded identity. Often, it was saved.Kate Spade did not speak to everyone, nor were her products accessible to everyone. But the reaction shows that over almost three decades, she spoke to more people than anyone perhaps had realized.For her customers, whether they were famous or not, Kate Spade wasn\u2019t actually fashion. It was personal. And as a result those customers have taken to the streets, real and virtual, and to social media in all forms to express their feelings about what she meant to them. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power Politics of Gianni Infantino", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The leaders of soccer in Europe stood around the marble-floored lobby of a Hyatt hotel in Kiev, Ukraine, last month, trading gossip about one of their former colleagues: FIFA President Gianni Infantino.Infantino had worked for UEFA, European soccer\u2019s governing body, for nearly two decades, ultimately serving as the organization\u2019s equivalent of a chief executive. Then, in 2016, he became UEFA\u2019s handpicked candidate for his current role, the most powerful job in the sport. But two years later, the warm words and good feelings that had trailed Infantino as he left UEFA\u2019s lakeside headquarters near Geneva to run FIFA have all but evaporated.In fact, despite a seemingly endless string of public appearances and globe-trotting the past two years, Infantino remains an enigma: a workaholic administrator who has overseen the repair of FIFA\u2019s most serious financial and operational problems, but one whose rush to change the basic structure of the sport has annoyed enough constituencies that his re-election to a second term next year remains in the balance.So when Infantino, 48, touched down in Kiev for the Champions League final last month, weeks away from opening his first World Cup as FIFA president, it was amid a cloud of political turmoil, rising anger and warnings even from those who know him best.\u201cHe needs to slow down,\u201d said Evelina Christillin, a member of the FIFA Council from Italy, who has been largely supportive of his presidency. \u201cI\u2019m a close friend of Gianni Infantino. I\u2019ve known him for 20 years. I really have a lot of admiration for him. But still sometimes he can be a fiery southern Italian.\u201dMaking a motion as if pulling up a car\u2019s hand brake, a soccer official who has known Infantino for years explained how, during his time at UEFA, leaders there were able to bring out the best in Infantino while checking him when his bold plans threatened riskier outcomes.Now, the official said, that hand brake is off.Those who know him best describe Infantino, the Swiss son of southern Italian immigrants, as a tireless bureaucrat whose relentlessness is matched only by his ambition. They saw those qualities, and the pitfalls that come with them, in abundance earlier this year when tensions flared at a FIFA board meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.Around that time, African officials complained that FIFA was showing a bias against Morocco\u2019s campaign for the 2026 World Cup, but an effort to get FIFA to strip Infantino\u2019s handpicked committee of the right to eliminate a bid if it didn\u2019t meet technical standards failed. After the meeting, a senior African committee member sat forlornly and made dark predictions that FIFA had stacked the deck against Morocco in favor of the billions of dollars in revenue guaranteed by the North Americans.Longtime members of FIFA\u2019s board described the scenes in Bogot\u00e1 as unlike anything they had witnessed at any previous meetings, a debate that almost devolved into rebellion.The German soccer federation president Reinhard Grindel, an outspoken member of the council, fumed on the sidelines of the meeting, furious that Infantino had barely spoken with him.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to hear any opinions,\u201d Grindel said at the time.Infantino declined requests to be interviewed for this article. He would only agree to respond to questions emailed to him, though The New York Times was among the news organizations invited to a June 4 briefing with him in Zurich.Asked about the resistance he had confronted as he embarked on his mission to remake the world game, Infantino wrote in an email that he underestimated just how resistant the organization would be to change, even after the scandal-plagued era of his predecessor, Sepp Blatter, who was forced to relinquish the presidency in 2015.\u201cNo matter how much I prepared myself to face an atmosphere of reluctance, the level of mistrust I encountered around FIFA, and even within the organization, was unbelievable,\u201d Infantino wrote. \u201cAt that time, the institution\u2019s reputation had really hit rock bottom: Anything involving FIFA was soaked in presumption of guilt; anything you could say or propose was met with suspicion. It is not easy to accomplish things in an environment like that. For several months, this was a huge and constant obstacle. It still is, to a certain degree.\u201dChristillin agreed, adding that convincing a membership as diverse as FIFA\u2019s to change requires deft handling. \u201cWhen you are depending on 211 votes you are not that free, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cAll kinds of reforms have to be taken with caution.\u201dWeeks before the World Cup, Infantino called off an emergency board meeting he had hastily arranged to try to persuade members to accept the mysterious investment offer, perhaps deciding that another rebuke, even in private, would have been akin to a vote of no confidence a year before his planned campaign for re-election. In Moscow on Sunday, almost all controversial items were kept off the agenda in an effort to limit tensions as the council met for the final time before the World Cup.Asked directly about the scale of the opposition to his plans, Infantino wrote, \u201cDisagreement is a natural consequence of being an open organization.\u201dInfantino\u2019s critics see it otherwise. They say their resistance is a bulwark against an executive who won the presidency by promising to quadruple the money FIFA distributes to member nations, including many who derive most if not all of their revenue from FIFA, and is now focused only on finding the cash to fulfill that pledge before he must answer for it to voters.\u201cHe made a lot of promises without having enough money, and now additional tournaments and additional competitions should bring the revenues,\u201d Grindel said. \u201cI think this is the wrong way.\u201dBefore he became president, Infantino was part of a group tasked with implementing governance reforms at FIFA in the wake of the 2015 corruption scandal \u2014 allowing it, in FIFA\u2019s words, to become a \u201cmodern, trusted and professional\u201d organization. In the new structure, the role of the president would be limited in favor of an empowered secretary general who would act as a chief executive \u2014 a role some say suits Infantino\u2019s skills perfectly.That has not happened. As president, Infantino has overseen the biggest decisions facing the organization while his secretary general, Fatma Samoura, a former United Nations official from Senegal, has largely been marginalized.Samoura was not made available for interview. But Miguel Maduro, FIFA\u2019s former governance chief, said the secondary role she has assumed is a direct result of Infantino\u2019s having near total discretion on staffing matters.Less than a year into his tenure, Maduro was preparing to board a flight to Bahrain for Infantino\u2019s second congress when the FIFA president\u2019s chief of staff called tell him not to bother to attend. His mandate was not being renewed, because \u201cpolitics\u201d had made his position untenable.\u201cThey feel they are accountable to the political cartel that dominates FIFA but not to the outside world, not to public opinion, not to the media, not to the fans,\u201d Maduro said of Infantino\u2019s leadership team. \u201cUltimately Infantino\u2019s choice was one of political survival.\u201dFIFA said it does not comment on ethics committee investigations. Infantino has been investigated and cleared in the past following a complaint related to the use of a private jet and a visit with his mother to see Pope Francis at the Vatican.While Infantino took office declaring an end to FIFA\u2019s era of excess \u2014 first-class air travel, five-star hotels and $300,000 salaries for top officials \u2014 turning words into deeds has proved more difficult than he imagined. Some FIFA Council members objected to a drastic pay cut, and FIFA had to settle at a marginally smaller figure \u2014 $250,000 a year.Still, Infantino has his defenders. Christillin, who said, \u201cI think we are still paid too much,\u201d noted that Infantino had dragged FIFA up from what she described as \u201cthe less-than-zero\u201d position it was in when he took office. The organization\u2019s reputation will take years to heal, though Infantino insists FIFA has turned a financial corner \u2014 this week it will announce revenue of $6 billion for the four-year cycle leading to the Russia World Cup \u2014 and he has purged about a quarter of the organization\u2019s staff.Sponsors in the West remain wary, however. FIFA has not signed a new sponsor from North America or Western Europe since Infantino\u2019s election victory; its most recent partners have largely been drawn from China, and a further boost is expected from Saudi Arabia, whose growing interest in the game has unsettled some regional leaders.Then, in March, amid global condemnation of Russia\u2019s role in the deaths of civilians in Syria, Infantino agreed to be filmed playing soccer with the country\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, inside the Kremlin, a photo opportunity that some of Infantino\u2019s aides had advised against.In recent weeks, Infantino has felt just how treacherous the political waters of global soccer can be.The discussions about an expanded Club World Cup \u2014 including the secret talks with investors led by Japan\u2019s SoftBank \u2014 have even seeped into the bidding for FIFA\u2019s crown jewel, the World Cup. Had those proposals received the public backing from North American officials, the region\u2019s bid for the 2026 World Cup might have lost critical European support.For now, without a serious challenger or a mortal self-inflicted wound, Infantino is in position to retain the FIFA presidency when the election is held in June 2019. Until then, his battles will continue, and his opponents will continue to fume.\u201cYou cannot expect to choose when there will be an important decision to be made or an important discussion to be held,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cIt is what makes the job difficult, but also quite fascinating.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Trade Slump May Yet Happen: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump broke with protocol by tweeting about jobs report\u2022 Investors have compared Facebook\u2019s actions to human rights violations\u2022 Deutsche Bank can\u2019t catch a break\u2022 Goldman\u2019s consumer finance plans are bigger than you thoughtBefore Donald Trump became president, many feared that the combative trade policies he was proposing would sock the U.S. economy and send unemployment higher.Is this unexpected state of affairs sustainable?If anything, the strength of the economy might persuade Mr. Trump that he can pursue his trade agenda without causing too much collateral damage at home. That could mean following through on his threats to impose tariffs on Chinese products totaling as much as $150 billion.Whether Mr. Trump does so should become clear soon. On June 15, the administration is scheduled to release a final list of $50 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs, which would then be imposed shortly thereafter.Some in the administration have warned that a protectionist trade policy could drag the economy and the stock market. But the longer the economy keeps churning out jobs, and the longer the stock market remains resilient, the harder it will be for those advisers to make their case. Indeed, the U.S. may be less sensitive to trade frictions than economists and investors previously believed.But that is a very optimistic scenario, and much could still go wrong.The metals tariffs, alone, are unlikely to crater the markets or hammer the economy. But a full-blown trade war with China, involving $150 billion of tariffs and everything China has promised in retaliation, would almost certainly shake the confidence of investors and businesses. Tomasz Wieladek, an economist at Barclays, in a report on Friday said the metals tariffs and those against China, along with retaliatory actions, could knock nearly a full percentage point off global growth.The fact that the stock market hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since mid-February,when the trade rhetoric heated up, suggests investors never really shrugged off the prospect of trade wars. Now, as a confrontation with China approaches, markets may become volatile as investors prepare for the fallout.It\u2019s also important to remember that the strength of the economy is not an unalloyed positive. If the buoyant conditions, and the impact of new tariffs, produce higher inflation, the Federal Reserve will have less leeway to relax monetary policy in response to a big trade shock or a stock market plunge. In other words, investors would have no protection from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.One way to view the current situation is that Mr. Trump is an opportunist who has astutely ridden an economic expansion that had long been underway \u2013 and is now hoping it will carry him through a drawn-out trade battle.It\u2019s a bold, far from certain, bet.\u2014Peter EavisThe Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely releases its monthly employment report on the first Friday of the month.

{"Headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s Price Was Artificially Inflated, Fueling Skyrocketing Value, Researchers Say", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe paper by John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student, is likely to stoke a debate about how much of Bitcoin\u2019s skyrocketing gain last year was caused by the covert actions of a few big players, rather than real demand from investors.Mr. Griffin looked at the flow of digital tokens going in and out of Bitfinex and identified several distinct patterns that suggest that someone or some people at the exchange successfully worked to push up prices when they sagged at other exchanges. To do that, the person or people used a secondary virtual currency, known as Tether, which was created and sold by the owners of Bitfinex, to buy up those other cryptocurrencies.\u201cThere were obviously tremendous price increases last year, and this paper indicates that manipulation played a large part in those price increases,\u201d Mr. Griffin said.The new paper helped push down the already sinking price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Wednesday. The price of Bitcoin fell as much as 5 percent after the report was published, approaching its lowest point of the year. Bitcoin is now down more than 65 percent from the highs it hit late last year.The authors of the new 66-page paper do not have emails or documents that prove that Bitfinex knew about or was responsible for price manipulation. The researchers relied on the millions of transaction records that are captured on the public ledgers of all virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain, to spot patterns. This method is not conclusive, but it has helped government authorities and academics spot suspicious activity in the past.In particular, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Shams examined the flow of Tether, a token that is supposed to be tied to the value of the dollar and that is issued exclusively by Bitfinex in large batches. They found that half of the increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2017 could be traced to the hours immediately after Tether flowed to a handful of other exchanges, generally when the price was declining.Other large virtual currencies that can be purchased with Tether, such as Ether and Zcash, rose even more quickly than Bitcoin in those periods. The prices rose much more quickly on exchanges that accepted Tether than they did on those that did not, and the pattern ceased when Bitfinex stopped issuing new Tether this year, the authors found.Sarah Meiklejohn, a professor at the University College London who pioneered this sort of pattern spotting, said the analysis in the new paper \u201cseems sound\u201d after reviewing it this week.Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a firm that analyses blockchain data, also said the study \u201cseems credible.\u201d He cautioned that a full understanding of the patterns would require more analysis.Beyond his work at the University of Texas, Mr. Griffin has a consulting firm that works on financial fraud cases, including some in the virtual currency industry.\u201cThe relationship between Tether and the price of Bitcoin has been flagged for months within the community,\u201d said Christian Catalini, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in blockchain research. \u201cIt is great to see academic work trying to causally assess if market manipulation is taking place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upheaval in Italy and Spain", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Two of Europe\u2019s southern countries, Italy and Spain, got new governments last week, each a curious mix of disparate parties and neither particularly stable. That\u2019s pretty much where the similarities end.Mr. S\u00e1nchez owed his success less to any common program in what is being called his \u201cFrankenstein Coalition\u201d than to public frustration with a corruption scandal related to a secret campaign fund Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party ran from 1999 to 2005. Mr. Rajoy, prime minister since 2011, claimed ignorance of the goings-on, but popular indignation boiled over last month when 29 people, including a former party treasurer, were convicted of corruption.What next was far from clear, but unlike the reaction to Italy\u2019s government, the European Union and financial markets displayed little anxiety over Spain. Mr. Rajoy was credited with steering Spain through a period of E.U.-backed austerity, and though Spain\u2019s unemployment rate is among Europe\u2019s highest, the country has had three straight years of growth above 3 percent. Mr. S\u00e1nchez, a former basketball player nicknamed Mr. Handsome, is a solid Europeanist who has pledged to retain the outgoing government\u2019s budget and to honor obligations to the European Union.The biggest immediate challenge for Mr. S\u00e1nchez is the secessionist movement in the autonomous province of Catalonia. His swearing-in on Saturday coincided with the installation of a new government in Catalonia under Quim Torra, who promptly declared he would continue to press for independence from Spain. Last year, a unilateral declaration of independence by the Catalan government ignited a constitutional crisis in which Catalan leaders were arrested or fled and the Spanish government took direct control of the province. The Socialists supported the government at the time, but Catalan parties are part of Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s coalition, so he may be open to calls for talks.It is anybody\u2019s guess whether Mr. S\u00e1nchez survives until the next scheduled election in two years, but in any case he is not likely to do anything to destabilize the economy or challenge Spain\u2019s place in the European Union, if only because he doesn\u2019t have the parliamentary votes for it.Italy\u2019s government is a different matter. The populist coalition there has promised tax cuts and welfare spending that could exacerbate an already onerous national debt, and though the partners are no longer threatening to abandon the euro, blaming the E.U. is central to their message. Actually running a government, however, has a way of moderating populist bluster.As in any time of political turmoil, there\u2019s plenty of reason for the rest of Europe to be wary and watchful. But petty tutelage is the last thing Brussels should do. This is a tale of two democracies working out their own problems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From Tuesday\u2019s Primary Elections", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are some of our takeaways:National Democrats spent over $7 million in an effort to ensure they had a candidate reach the general election in three House districts in California held by Republicans. Their decision to not take their chances in the state\u2019s \u201ctop two\u201d system \u2014 in which the top finishers in nonpartisan, open primaries face each other in November \u2014 appears to have been a wise investment.The party\u2019s intervention in the districts held by Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Ed Royce and Darrell Issa, all Republicans, paid off: they angered some of their own activists but were virtually certain to advance candidates in each of the three districts, including their preferred picks against Mr. Rohrabacher and in Mr. Royce\u2019s seat.It did not come cheap, but if Democrats secure a narrow House majority in November they will have done so in part because they decided to aggressively compete in June.Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, talked about building the wall. She voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. She backed the president\u2019s tax bill.And yet.A key question now: Will Mr. Trump \u2014 who can be slow to forgive those who have opposed him \u2014 come forward to bolster Ms. Roby before her runoff in July, as many party officials hope? The answer will say a lot about whether the president can be persuaded to rally behind candidates, even those he might not adore, if congressional leaders nudge him.And while some voters on Tuesday plainly intended to punish Ms. Roby for her past position \u2014 articulated in 2016 after the publication of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video on which Mr. Trump made vulgar comments about women \u2014 her opponent in the Republican runoff, Bobby Bright, has his own baggage: He used to be a Democratic congressman, until Ms. Roby defeated him in 2010.But on Tuesday, Lisa McCormick, an unknown candidate with no federal finance filings, no television ads and no real campaign apparatus, earned nearly 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote.Of course, Mr. Menendez\u2019s Republican opponent, Bob Hugin, has been reminding New Jerseyans constantly, spending nearly $4 million before a primary vote had even been cast. Mr. Menendez has largely kept a low profile \u2014 minus a raucous high school rally kickoff \u2014 and maintains a sizable war chest.While New Jersey is a reliably blue state and Mr. Menendez has maintained leads in all polls (though the most recent one was much closer), the fact that many of the state\u2019s Democrats marched into polling places and voted for a woman they probably didn\u2019t know anything about shows a simmering level of frustration.On Tuesday, three of them won their primary elections.In New Jersey, Andy Kim, who most recently served as the director for Iraq on the White House National Security Council, joined the Obama administration in 2009 in the State Department. He ran unopposed in the Third District to take on Representative Tom MacArthur.Tom Malinowski, also in New Jersey, served as an assistant secretary of state for roughly three years, starting in 2014. He won his primary in the Seventh Congressional District to take on Representative Leonard Lance.And in New Mexico, Deb Haaland, who could be the first Native American woman in Congress, won her primary to replace Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat who is making a run for governor. Ms. Haaland was the Native American vote director in New Mexico for Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election campaign.However, not all of the Obama diaspora was successful on Tuesday. John Norris, who was the commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under Mr. Obama for four years, lost his primary bid for governor in Iowa to Fred Hubbell.In Iowa, Democrats overwhelmingly picked Mr. Hubbell, a wealthy businessman, from a field that included Cathy Glasson, a union leader. In Alabama, they nominated Walt Maddox, the mayor of Tuscaloosa, over Sue Bell Cobb, the former chief judge of the state\u2019s highest court. And in California \u2014 a state that embodies Democrats\u2019 hopes for a rising liberal coalition nationwide \u2014 Democrats rallied around Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and the lone white man among the major Democrats running.The night was hardly a rout for Democratic women, and in New Mexico it was Ms. Lujan Grisham who handily won the nomination for governor. But the convincing wins by Democratic men in most primaries in governor races underscore a persistent political barrier for women and minorities: Voters, including liberal-leaning ones, have typically been less willing to embrace diversity in executive offices than in legislative ones.There are just two Democratic women now serving as governors and only one Democratic governor who is not white, David Ige of Hawaii. Coming primaries in states like Nevada, Maryland, Michigan and Florida may give Democratic voters a chance to change that \u2014 if they want to.Jonathan Martin reported from Laguna Beach, Calif., Nick Corasaniti from Verona, N.J., and Alexander Burns and Matt Flegenheimer from New York.Advertisement"}

But they have so far produced no evidence to support accusations of a Russian role or any explanation why they needed to stage a phony murder.But, she added, it only defined the shape of the new court and did not order its immediate establishment. For that to happen, she said, Parliament needs to pass another piece of legislation.\u201cThere are loopholes and we still need another vote, but we have finally unfrozen the process,\u201d Ms. Kalenyuk said.The dismissal of the finance minister, she added, was \u201ca step backwards,\u201d but it was the \u201cthe bribe paid to members of Parliament to get their vote on a more or less good anticorruption court.\u201dThe finance minister, Mr. Danylyuk, an independent-minded reformer backed by the I.M.F., was fired on the recommendation of Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, who had accused Mr. Danylyuk of spreading \u201cdistorted information among our international partners.\u201dThis accusation related to a letter Mr. Danylyuk wrote to Ukraine\u2019s Western backers that accused President Poroshenko of trying to get one of his allies put in charge of tax policy and of blocking candidates put forward by the minister.

{"Headline": "International Court Throws Out War Crimes Conviction of Congolese Politician", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Appeals judges in an international court have thrown out the war-crimes conviction and 18-year prison sentence for Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former vice president of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was a blow to prosecutors, who had accused him of condoning the public rape of women and men, the killing of unarmed villagers and the pillaging of property.The ruling, announced on Friday at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, did not question that the atrocities occurred during a five-month rampage by a militia that Mr. Bemba founded and financed in 2002 to assist his ally, then the president of the neighboring Central African Republic.But in a 3 to 2 vote, the court found that the trial judges had made a series of legal errors. As a \u201cremote commander,\u201d the court said, Mr. Bemba would have difficulty knowing what his 1,000-fighter militia was doing and adequately investigating and stopping any crimes.The overturned conviction came as a shock to prosecutors and other court officials. The chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, called the acquittal \u201cregrettable and troubling.\u201d She noted that the judges had not denied that Mr. Bemba\u2019s troops had committed atrocities \u201cwhich resulted in great suffering in the Central African Republic.\u201dA large group of Mr. Bemba\u2019s relatives and supporters burst into cheers in court when the verdict was read, and in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, his followers celebrated.The trial judges had also included the use of rape as a weapon of war, a first for this court.While Mr. Bemba was imprisoned in The Hague, investigators made considerable efforts to track down his reported fortune in case damages were awarded to the victims. The court froze several Bemba family bank accounts in Belgium and Cape Verde, along with some properties. But investigators said they also ran into a wall of shell companies that they could not get through.The appeals judges seemed to have wrestled with the case, with all writing separate opinions. The presiding judge, Christine Van den Wijngaert of Belgium, reading out the summary, said the trial judges had \u201cignored significant evidence that Mr. Bemba\u2019s ability to investigate and punish crimes\u201d by the fighters of his Movement for the Liberation of Congo was limited. The appeals judges said the trial judges had made other errors in attributing crimes to him that had not been formally charged.But the two dissenting judges wrote that the majority had used the wrong standards for review and that its findings were, therefore, deeply flawed.Mr. Bemba, once the leader of Congo\u2019s opposition, is expected to return to politics once released. But it was not yet clear when he could return home.The sentence for witness tampering, however, is not likely to exceed the time already served by Mr. Bemba. He has been jailed in The Hague for 10 years.Details of how the coaching of witnesses and bribery took place remained confidential because most of the witnesses at the bribery trial had testified behind closed doors.But the ruling offered a few examples: In one instance, a lawyer called a witness on the eve of his testimony with instructions, but also cautioned the witness, \u201cNo one called you; no one from the defense called you.\u201d Lawyers also told witnesses to lie about payments they had received, the summary said.Some of the witnesses who had never been in the military were issued ranks and insignia, according to the summary, and some were promised a new life in Europe.Advertisement"}

It would take control of the 20th Century Fox movie and television studios, cable channels like National Geographic and FX, 22 regional sports networks, a 30 percent stake in the online video platform Hulu, 39 percent of the European satellite broadcaster Sky and control of the Indian broadcaster Star.(The Murdochs would keep Fox News, the Fox broadcast networks and the national sports networks FS1 and FS2.)\u201cThis reflects our continued belief in the strategic rationale of this transaction,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday.The higher overall bid is notable. But the way it\u2019s structured might be even more important.Adding a cash component to the bid is a response to Comcast\u2019s all-cash offer. It is meant to appeal to Fox shareholders, who simply want to be paid out now, rather than betting on the performance of Disney shares in the future.But the Murdoch family is in a different position.Receiving cash would expose it to a big tax bill, since Rupert Murdoch created the company and has enjoyed an enormous rise in the value of his holdings. And Mr. Murdoch does want in on the future: He has said that he thinks combining the Fox businesses with Disney would yield a media colossus that could take on streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.The option of still being paid in Disney stock appears to have been crucial in keeping the support of the Murdochs, as shown by Fox\u2019s board signing onto the new offer. But the family represents only 17 percent of the shares that can be voted in this deal, so other investors will have to feel comfortable with it as well.\u25a0 Shares in Fox were up 6.4 percent in early morning trading, at $47.57. Shareholders could be betting that the battle between Disney and Comcast is far from over.\u25a0 Disney\u2019s stock was up 1 percent in early morning trading, at $107.26, as investors may believe that the sweetened bid is financially sustainable.\u25a0 And Comcast\u2019s shares were up 0.7 percent, at $33.04. That\u2019s perhaps because of a hope that the company would walk away from an increasingly expensive bidding war.Disney executives could raise their bid even higher if necessary. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, told analysts that the company was financing the entire cash portion of the new offer through borrowed money and asserted that its balance sheet remained healthy despite the extra debt.Fox and Disney will reschedule votes on Disney\u2019s takeover bid, which was originally set for July 10.

{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Are Newly Hopeful About the Midterms. For Good Reason.", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After a turbulent first year confronting friendly fire from President Trump, Senate Republicans are entering the summer before the midterm elections feeling more hopeful about retaining their narrow majority than at any time since the president\u2019s election. And for good reason.This past week brought two developments that drew little attention for their Senate implications but could prove pivotal in November.\u201cThe Republican caucus in the Senate is feeling substantially more optimistic now than at this time last year,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, predicting his party will gain a handful of seats.But that Republicans are even discussing the prospect of gaining Senate seats, in the first midterm campaign of a president whose approval rating has never reached 50 percent, illustrates the wildly divergent electoral landscapes for the House and the Senate.While the fight for control of the House is playing out mainly in the affluent and highly educated suburban districts that have been hotbeds of anti-Trump fervor, many of them on the coasts, the Senate campaign is taking place on much more Trump-friendly terrain. Six of the most competitive Senate races are in states he carried by double digits: Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia. (Democrats hold all of those seats except Tennessee\u2019s.)A major question looming over the 2018 Senate contest is whether so-called wave election years \u2014 in which one party makes significant gains in both chambers of Congress, as happened in 1994 and 2006 \u2014 can still exist as the country grows more polarized and politics more shaped by hardening party preferences. With ticket-splitting fading, especially in federal races, voters are increasingly turning to lawmakers who reflect the presidential leanings of their state.That could spell trouble for Democrats representing largely conservative electorates and states where surveys show that, unlike in much of the country, the president is viewed more favorably than unfavorably.\u201cIn the middle of the country people are by and large center-right, and they see the national Democratic brand as really far left, which is a ball and chain those senators have to carry around,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said.But Democrats argue that the well-cultivated reputations and financial advantages of party incumbents like Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia matter as much as the red-leaning nature of their states.And they say that what passes for good news on the right \u2014 simply being competitive in states the G.O.P. otherwise dominates \u2014 underscores the Republicans\u2019 weakness in a year when the map is so favorable.\u201cWe\u2019re feeling very good about our chances,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, adding, \u201cAt a minimum, there\u2019s a 50-50 chance we\u2019re going to take back the Senate.\u201dThere are only nine Republican seats in play, but Democrats believe they have the chance to win in three: Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee.Yet even some Democrats concede that Republicans have seen their prospects brighten recently \u2014 thanks to their actions in some cases and their good fortune in others. \u201cThey are limiting their vulnerabilities,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, a Democratic strategist, conceding that \u201cit\u2019s entirely possible we lose two or three seats.\u201dThe sudden resignation of Mr. Greitens delivered immense relief to Republicans, and none more than Josh Hawley, the attorney general of Missouri. Mr. Hawley has been under fire for running a lackluster campaign against Senator Claire McCaskill, a wily political veteran trying to hang on in a state that has moved sharply away from Democrats.\u201cPeople will move very quickly to other issues that more normally would be part of a Senate campaign,\u201d Mr. Blunt said. He added wryly that \u201cif we have learned anything from President Trump, it\u2019s that people are willing to move on from a topic pretty quickly.\u201dEven if Mr. McCain were to vacate his office before November, Republicans believe that the governor would not be obliged to schedule a special election this year. They say that May 30 was the final day for candidates to submit petitions to run and that there is no mechanism in state law to add candidates to the ballot.Mr. McCain\u2019s presence does not just deny Democrats an opening to compete in two Arizona Senate races this fall \u2014 it may also strengthen Republican chances to retain Mr. Flake\u2019s seat.\u201cIt is a very low bar when you\u2019re celebrating the fact that a governor resigned because of a sex scandal and the candidate who had been criminally convicted in West Virginia is not your nominee,\u201d said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who oversees the Senate Democratic campaign arm.But after watching Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating hover in the 30s for much of last year, and absorbing his frequent gibes, Republicans will take it.\u201cThat\u2019s a very big deal,\u201d Mr. Thune said with a chuckle about how Mr. Trump is turning his fire toward the Democrats. He said Mr. Trump had come to realize that \u201cattacking Republicans isn\u2019t helpful.\u201d But Mr. Thune also acknowledged that Mr. Trump could undercut the economic gains if he goes through with his tariff threats and \u201cretaliation is leveled against farm states.\u201dIndeed, even as they grow more optimistic, veteran Republicans know they are placing their fate in the hands of an unpredictable leader.\u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, things look pretty good today,\u201d Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran strategist, said. \u201cBut Trump is like a suicide bomber: He could still blow himself up the day before the election and ruin everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Was Supposed to Get Political. It\u2019s Hanging Back in This Election.", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the last decade, this has become the tech industry\u2019s hometown.But as voters go to the polls Tuesday to choose a mayor in one of San Francisco\u2019s most disputed elections in recent memory, the industry that set off a high-rise construction boom and has been blamed for a housing crisis in the city is fading into the background.What is happening \u2014 or rather not happening \u2014 in San Francisco is part of a broader urge in the tech community to stay behind the scenes in state and national politics. The overwhelmingly Democratic-leaning Silicon Valley was shocked by the 2016 election of Donald J. Trump and aghast at his anti-immigration ban, which cut to the heart of their existence as a multinational industry whose companies have often been founded by immigrants.But predictions that, for better or worse, tech and politics were henceforth going to be inseparable did not hold up.Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, drew national attention in 2015 when he said he would move his employees out of Indiana if a new state law that would have legalized discrimination was not changed. (It was.)Mr. Benioff, a native of San Francisco and the most prominent tech executive in the city, was a financial backer of Mr. Lee. But he said in an interview Friday that the mayoral election was too important, too closely fought and too contentious for him to support any of the top four candidates: Jane Kim, Mark Leno, Angela Alioto or London Breed.\u201cThis is the hottest election San Francisco has ever had for mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cI care so deeply, I cannot support one of the candidates. I don\u2019t want to disenfranchise my ability to work with whoever is elected.\u201dSam Altman, the president of the influential start-up accelerator Y Combinator, has not tweeted about politics all year \u2014 surprising reticence for someone who flirted with the idea of running for California governor last year.Hunter Walk, formerly with Google\u2019s YouTube and now a venture capitalist, appeared in the 2011 video supporting Mr. Lee. \u201cThat was the beginning \u2014 and end \u2014 of my viral video career,\u201d he said. Others in the video were Marissa Mayer, then chief executive of Yahoo, and Biz Stone, a co-founder of Twitter.Mr. Walk said he was supporting Ms. Breed, the mayoral candidate who seems to have the most backing from tech. Mr. Stone said he was \u201cusually not public about politics\u201d but had been helping Ms. Breed \u201cwith social media strategy and expertise,\u201d introducing her to knowledgeable people. Ms. Mayer, who could not be reached for comment, gave $500, the legal maximum, to Ms. Breed.If tech is determined to be low key about San Francisco politics, there is an eminently practical reason: fears of a backlash.Mr. Conway championed Ms. Breed, a president of the board of supervisors who became interim mayor after Mr. Lee\u2019s death, as the next mayor. At Mr. Lee\u2019s funeral, he told Mr. Benioff, \u201cWe have to focus on getting London elected.\u201d (Mr. Conway disputed that, writing, \u201cAt most, I acknowledged the historic significance of an African-American woman succeeding the city\u2019s first Chinese-American mayor.\u201d)The venture capitalist moved too aggressively, however. The progressive wing of the board of supervisors removed Ms. Breed from the interim position after a few weeks, saying they did not want her to have an undue advantage in the election.Mr. Benioff called Mr. Conway \u201cthe Koch brothers of San Francisco,\u201d a reference to the siblings who are heavy backers of conservative causes. He added: \u201cThat is his prerogative as a citizen of the United States. He feels he\u2019s doing the right thing. He\u2019s a good person. But he doesn\u2019t speak for me or tech.\u201dMr. Conway now says he has more important places to spend his time and resources than the mayor\u2019s race.\u201cThe future of our country and our progressive values are threatened by this president and this Congress, and candidly stopping them is ultimately far more important to me than who is elected Mayor of San Francisco on June 5th,\u201d he wrote in an email.Mr. Conway emphasized that he is still backing Ms. Breed, citing his belief that \u201cshe\u2019s the only candidate who will truly tackle our city\u2019s housing and homeless crises.\u201dDomestic abuse, Mr. Conway said, is an issue he and his wife \u201chave long been passionate about.\u201d But the battle over the sheriff\u2019s reinstatement was really about the mayor\u2019s power to fire someone duly elected by the voters. A spokeswoman for Ms. Kim, Julie Edwards, said, \u201cRon Conway has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attacking Jane Kim because she believes City Hall belongs to the people, not the billionaires. It\u2019s that simple.\u201dMr. Conway declined to specify his contributions for national organizations, but said that \u201cthis year alone, we are directly supporting and raising more than $5 million\u201d for groups \u201cchallenging this terrible president and fighting for change to our gun and immigration laws.\u201dMs. Breed is the clear tech favorite, but none of the leading mayoral candidates are decidedly anti-tech. It is too big and powerful an industry here for anyone who opposes it to get elected.\u201cSan Francisco, despite its reputation, isn\u2019t especially left wing,\u201d said Ben Tarnoff, a San Francisco historian and editor of Logic, a new magazine focused on deepening the discourse around tech. \u201cIts political leadership is reliably socially liberal, but it has largely governed within the policy parameters set by the real estate and tech industries.\u201dChange arises from below. But that\u2019s where things get tricky. On Thursday morning, a group of housing activists renewed their protests against Google and the other tech companies by blocking a dozen commuter buses that carry employees from San Francisco to the campuses in Silicon Valley. One of their signs: \u201cCandidates won\u2019t save us.\u201d\u201cMany of the people who form the most natural constituency for left-wing politics are being forced out of the city,\u201d said Mr. Tarnoff. \u201cThe balance may tilt even further against them in the coming years.\u201dTo put it another way, whoever wins on Tuesday, tech will not lose.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the spokeswoman for Jane Kim, a San Francisco mayoral candidate. It is Julie Edwards, not Johnson.Advertisement"}

A Walmart executive signed a document that indicated the buyer was purchasing the property with a $4.5 million loan from a nonprofit that runs shelters for migrant children.When Walmart sold the building, Southwest Key was relatively unknown, even though for decades it had been running shelters for migrant children, as well as a juvenile justice program. The shelters have only recently provoked intense criticism after they began housing increasing numbers of children who had been separated from their parents as part of an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration by President Trump.A Walmart spokesman, Greg Hitt, acknowledged that the company had been aware that Southwest Key was financing the purchase as the deal was closing in December 2016. But he said the retailer had not looked into what the nonprofit did or why it was providing a loan to the buyer.Commercial real estate lawyers say Walmart was following industry practice. Sellers in commercial property deals typically do not look deeply into a lender\u2019s background, but instead focus their due diligence on the buyer.\u201cThis is a tragedy that children are being separated from their parents,\u201d Walmart said in a statement. \u201cAs we have said, when the property was sold to a developer more than a year ago, we did not know it would be used for what\u2019s happening today.

Walmart said that, at that time, the developer was considering using the store as a call center or a warehouse.As part of the sales agreement, Walmart made a long list of what the building could not be used for \u2014 mostly to thwart rivals and prevent adult or alcohol-related businesses from moving into the space.The developer could not convert the property into a grocery store or a discount department store that might compete with Walmart. Also banned: a billiards parlor, slot machines and video stores selling NC-17 films.There also could be no nude or \u201cbathing suit-clad\u201d models or dancers in the former store, according to real estate documents.The deed did offer some potential uses, exceptions to the restrictions that included an \u201cemergency care center, urgent or non-urgent medical service provider, or flea market.\u201dThe Walmart spokesman said the company \u201creasonably assumed what was laid out in exceptions is what the property would be used for.\u201dExecutives at Chacbak, the developer, did not return phone calls seeking comment.Jeff Eller, a spokesman for Southwest Key, said the nonprofit had agreed to finance the purchase because it could provide the money faster than a bank. At the time, Southwest Key was under pressure to increase its shelter capacity. Chacbak has already paid back the loan in full, he said.The United Food and Commercial Workers, a union pushing for change at Walmart, was organizing events with Latino workers and activist groups in San Diego, Dallas and Chicago on Wednesday to protest the use of the former supercenter as a shelter for children separated from their families.\u201cThe chances that Walmart \u2014 the largest retailer in the world, with billions of dollars of resources and entire legal and real estate departments at their disposal \u2014 didn\u2019t know about the intended use of this building is impossible to believe,\u201d said Amy Ritter, a spokeswoman for the union.Advertisement"}

Their identities are being verified through biometric data.But bearing the brunt of the decision are the desperate police officers, many of them pinned down by the Taliban in faraway outposts inaccessible to the inventory teams. The officers come from the poorest communities around the country, accepting the risky job for $200 a month when there are few other prospects. Each day last year, an average of about 28 Afghan police officers and army members were killed.\u201cOur district has been surrounded for a year and half,\u201d said Abdul Samad, the police commander of the Girziwan district in northern Faryab Province. \u201cThe police cannot go to the provincial centers for biometric registration, and biometric is not coming here.\u201dMr. Samad said: \u201cNot only the police, but even his brother or uncle or other relatives cannot travel the road to Maimana city. If the Taliban find out that he is a brother of a police, or the uncle of a police, they will slit his throat or fill him with bullets right there.\u201dWith salaries not arriving for three months now, Mr. Samad said, five members of his staff of 30 have laid down their arms and left.\u201cYou know how the police live \u2014 they go from paycheck to paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cThey borrow groceries from a shop with the promise of paying at the end of the month.\u201dAbdullah, a police officer in the Sarkano district of eastern Kunar Province who uses only one name, said he had missed the biometric team\u2019s visit to his headquarters because he had been dispatched to a front-line position.

When it came time for the transition, the numbers on paper were off by thousands from the actual number of men that could be accounted for, two senior officials said.Mohammed Saber Sarwary, the head of finance and budget at the Afghan Interior Ministry, said the donors had cut off pay for 30,000 police officers since March. The number was confirmed by one other senior official.\u201cWe have reached them time and again and asked them to give us access to the system to execute and process the salaries of 30,000 police who are fighting in the front lines, but they did not listen,\u201d Mr. Sarwary said.Donor countries put the money for the police salaries into a fund that is run by the United National Development Program. The salary freeze hit particularly hard, Mr. Sarwary said, because it is the month of Ramadan, which is followed by the festival of Eid al-Fitr.The donors\u2019 response to repeated pleas that they release the money?\u201cYou know, there is a saying which goes, \u2018He who feeds you can also command you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sarwary said.A spokesman for the American-led coalition directed requests for comment to the United Nations Development Program. Officials from that agency would not comment.While the police in major cities have gone through biometric registration, reaching all of them in faraway districts has been a difficult task.Officials in Kunduz, Zabul, Oruzgan and Farah Provinces, where there has been intense fighting, say the registration teams go to provincial centers and expect police officers from other districts to come to them. The roads are often either blocked or heavily infiltrated by the Taliban.Dost Mohammed Nayab, a spokesman for the governor of Oruzgan, said the biometric team had set up in the provincial capital, Tarinkot.\u201cThe problem is that the districts are cut off from the center,\u201d Mr. Nayab said. \u201cWe are targeting two districts now \u2014 Deh Rawood and Gizab \u2014 bringing the police by aircraft to Tarinkot for biometric and then taking them back.

{"Headline": "Prices Keep Rising for Drugs Treating Painful Sex in Women", "Date": "2018-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Lenny Hanson has watched in alarm as the price of a drug she takes has ticked steadily upward, doubling in the past five years to more than $200 a month today.The product, Vagifem, is one form of a drug, estradiol, that is used to improve women\u2019s sex lives by treating a painful, often unspoken condition experienced by older women: a dry vagina, which can cause uncomfortable intercourse and complications like urinary tract infections.Estradiol has been around for decades, but the price of the various creams, vaginal rings and tablets that contain the drug has climbed steadily in recent years, according to an analysis by the consumer website GoodRx. And insurance coverage is spotty \u2014 many plans refuse to cover some products or require that patients pay high out-of-pocket costs.While women privately fume about the costs, drug makers have been able to raise their prices without a public outcry in part because the topic \u2014 women\u2019s sex lives and their vaginas \u2014 is still pretty much taboo.The increases often result from secret, back-channel deals: Drug companies, pharmacy benefit managers and insurers all play a part, profiting along the way. Drug makers set higher prices because of the way they sell their product to insurers and employers.The New York Times would like to hear from people about their experiences paying for prescription drugs.Insurers, on the other hand, say drug companies keep raising prices to make more money.Health insurance has traditionally covered the bulk of patients\u2019 drug costs, so until recently, prices weren\u2019t on people\u2019s radars \u2014 drugs weren\u2019t seen as a consumer product like, say, breakfast cereal. But as manufacturers have raised prices, insurers have passed a larger share of the costs to patients in the form of high deductibles or co-payments.\u201cAlthough it is technically covered by the insurance company, your insurer is paying very little for the drug,\u201d Mr. Fein said.Representatives for drug manufacturers said their products were generally covered by insurance and that they offered assistance to patients who could not afford them.\u201cThese are medications that many women have to take for several years,\u201d said Thomas Goetz, chief of research at GoodRx. For those with poor insurance coverage or none at all, \"people are being exposed to what can be profound increases in price.\u201dMs. Hanson, 71, of San Francisco, has resorted to ordering her drug from overseas at a cost of about $80 for a three-month supply. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d she said.The newcomer, Imvexxy, has a few features that its manufacturer hopes will distinguish it. It comes in a lower, 4 microgram dose (the lowest Vagifem dose is 10 micrograms).

The same could become true for Estrace cream, which lost its patent protection at the end of last year and now has several generic competitors.With two generics for Vagifem now available, the drug companies are most likely negotiating big discounts with insurers, meaning patients with coverage may see their costs drop. Elizabeth Traynor, an illustrator in Guntersville, Alabama, had tried virtually every estradiol product and balked at the prices, frequently doing without. But she recently called her insurer, the Government Employees Health Association, and learned she would have to pay $20 for a three-month supply of Yuvafem. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d she said. \u201cHooray!\u201dEstradiol has been around for so long that it has survived several rounds of debate over high prices. In 1959, a Senate inquiry found that the drug maker Schering, now part of Merck, had marked up estradiol \u2014 which comes in many forms \u2014 by more than 7,000 percent over the cost of materials.Advertisement"}

Our strong banking system is frequently credited with having helped Australia survive that upheaval.The government\u2019s broad argument had been that the system works. Our banks are \u201cthe best run, the most prudentially supervised and the most well capitalized in the world,\u201d as the former prime minister and Liberal Party doyen John Howard put it.In 2014, the coalition slashed the securities regulator\u2019s funding by almost $90 million over four years, eliminating some 200 jobs. As the calls for the royal commission gathered momentum, the Turnbull government quickly returned some of those funds, but that only underscored how the government had refused to acknowledge the state of the banking system.Ultimately, this story is about not only the banks\u2019 collective reputation but also the collapse of the government\u2019s trickle-down economic worldview.The Turnbull government\u2019s most central policy is a corporate tax cut justified on the basis that the cuts will ultimately be passed on to people in the form of higher wages. There has long been a paucity of solid evidence for this proposition \u2014 in the United States, for instance, tax cuts are flowing overwhelmingly to shareholders.In the absence of either compelling data or lived experience, the government\u2019s plan rests on a trust that businesses have some interest in their staffs\u2019 well-being and will reward them with higher wages if they can.It is an awful time to be selling that theory. If the banking royal commission symbolizes anything, it is an egregious lack of concern among banks for the well-being of ordinary Australians. Trust in the benevolence of corporations is thin.And the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of a government that placed its faith in a supine regulator, that tried to convince us that all was well and that championed the institutions it must now recognize as villains means there is also precious little political trust left.Waleed Aly is a columnist and broadcaster and a politics lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Judge in California Halts Splitting of Migrant Families at Border", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction late Tuesday temporarily stopping the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the border and ordered that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days.Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the Federal District Court in San Diego said children under 5 must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, and he ordered that all children must be allowed to talk to their parents within 10 days.\u201cThe unfortunate reality is that under the present system, migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property,\u201d the judge wrote.The American Civil Liberties Union had filed a lawsuit to stop the separations before the president\u2019s executive order. In his order, Judge Sabraw said that children may be separated at the border only if the adults with them present an immediate danger to the children.He also said that adults may not be deported from the United States without their children.\u201cThe facts set forth before the court portray reactive governance \u2014 responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the government\u2019s own making,\u201d the judge wrote in the opinion. \u201cThey belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution. This is particularly so in the treatment of migrants, many of whom are asylum seekers and small children.\u201dA federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction temporarily stopping the Trump administration from separating families at the border, and he ordered that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days.In a statement, Lee Gelernt, the lead lawyer in the case for the A.C.L.U., hailed the judge\u2019s order.\u201cThis is an enormous win and will mean that this humanitarian crisis is coming to an end,\u201d Mr. Gelernt said. \u201cWe hope the Trump administration will not think about appealing when the lives of these little children are at stake.\u201dThe A.C.L.U. lawsuit was initially brought on behalf of two cases in which the children of immigrants were taken from them after they crossed the border.In one case, a woman entered the United States legally at a port of entry, fleeing persecution in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The lawsuit says that her 6-year-old daughter was taken from her and sent to a facility in Chicago, where she stayed for nearly five months.In another case, a woman from Brazil, identified as \u201cMs. C,\u201d crossed the border illegally with her 14-year-old son, who was separated from her and also sent to a facility in Chicago. The mother and son were apart for nearly eight months, according to the lawsuit.\u201cDuring the five months she was detained, Ms. C. did not see her son, and they spoke on the phone only \u2018a handful of times,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cMs. C. was \u2018desperate\u2019 to be reunited with her son, worried about him constantly and did not know when she would be able to see him.\u201dEarlier Tuesday, seventeen states sued Mr. Trump for his administration\u2019s practice of separating immigrant parents from their children, saying that the tactic is causing \u201cdevastating harm,\u201d even as a top official said the government was struggling to reunite families fractured by the policy.The states, including Washington, California and New York and joined by the District of Columbia, branded the forcible separation of immigrant families unconstitutional, \u201ccruel and unlawful,\u201d calling it a violation of the principles of due process and equal protection. They requested that the court halt it and immediately compel the government to reunite parents with their children.The Trump administration says it is trying to do just that, but success has proved vexing. The administration has appeared unprepared for the fallout from its decision to prosecute every immigrant apprehended entering the country without authorization \u2014 including those who are seeking asylum \u2014 without exceptions for parents.Even after Mr. Trump reversed course last week and moved to detain migrant parents facing charges of unlawful entry with their children, the challenge of reuniting families already torn apart has morphed into a crisis of its own.Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, told senators on Tuesday that his department \u2014 which is charged with taking custody of undocumented unaccompanied minors \u2014 was having trouble figuring out how to care for the children it was holding who had been separated from their parents.Some of them, he said, were in federal custody even though their parents had been sent back to Central America after trying to enter the United States illegally.\u201cAs to any parent who\u2019s deported, the child has independent rights,\u201d Mr. Azar said during a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, where his plan to discuss prescription drug pricing was upended by a grilling over the separated families. \u201cWe often do find, when a parent is deported, that they ask the child to remain separate and remain in this country.\u201dRaj Shah, a White House spokesman, conceded that the process of reuniting families would be difficult. \u201cThis is a complex situation,\u201d Mr. Shah told CNN in an interview. \u201cOur goal is to fully reunite as many families as possible, as quickly as possible.\u201dYet in the lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Seattle, the attorneys general for the states noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s order last week did not apply to families already broken apart, nor did it prevent the tactic from being used in the future.The president, emboldened by the Supreme Court\u2019s validation of the travel ban, continued on Tuesday to rail against immigration laws that afford those fleeing danger and persecution in their home countries the chance to have their asylum claims adjudicated by a judge. \u201cIf they step on our land, they have judges \u2014 it\u2019s insane,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He said the United States should adopt stricter laws that send an unmistakable message that only immigrants who have special skills to boost the American economy should be allowed into the country.\u201cIt\u2019s called, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t come in. You have to go in through a legal process,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said of his approach, during a lunch at the White House with Republican members of Congress. \u201cI have to let people come in, but they have to come in through a merit. They have to be people that can love our country and help our country.\u201dVice President Mike Pence, traveling in Brazil, implored would-be immigrants not to attempt to cross the United States border without authorization.\u201cDon\u2019t risk your lives or the lives of your children by trying to come to the United States on the road run by drug smugglers and human traffickers,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t come legally, don\u2019t come at all.\u201dThe lawsuit filed Tuesday took aim at the administration\u2019s hostility toward asylum seekers, maintaining that officials at the border were violating the law by turning them away before they could reach a port of entry to lawfully make their claim or, in some cases, before detaining them and taking away their children.\u201cBy criminalizing the pursuit of asylum, this policy runs counter to established immigration and refugee laws,\u201d the lawsuit said.White House officials did not respond to requests for comment about the legal challenge.Yet even as Mr. Trump vented his anger about the current state of immigration laws, his on-again, off-again push for a legislative overhaul of immigration policy appeared headed for defeat. The House was poised to reject a broad immigration bill slated for a vote on Wednesday, a result that is likely to prompt lawmakers in that chamber to shift their focus to narrower legislation meant to ensure that families are kept together at the border.The bill would provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, while keeping migrant families together at the border and providing billions of dollars for Mr. Trump\u2019s promised wall on the southern border with Mexico. Democrats are expected to broadly oppose it, and many conservative Republicans are also expected to vote against the measure, which has been criticized from the right as \u201camnesty.\u201dSpeaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin reiterated Tuesday that he wants migrant families to be kept together. But he held back from previewing how the House might take action if the broad legislation fails on Wednesday.\u201cI want to lean into that vote,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, adding, \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t succeed, then we\u2019ll cross that bridge. But the last thing I want to do is undercut a vote on what is a great consensus bill.\u201dWith the bill\u2019s defeat all but certain, Republicans in the House appear ready to pursue a narrower measure on the issue of family separation.\u201cWe want to make sure that\u2019s addressed regardless,\u201d said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative members.With the Fourth of July looming, it was not clear how quickly the House might be able to take action on that subject. The chamber is scheduled to finish its work for the week on Thursday and not return until July 10. Senators have also been pursuing stand-alone legislation intended to keep families together.The broader immigration overhaul had first been scheduled for a vote in the House last Thursday. But Republican leaders delayed the vote until Friday, and then pushed it to this week, as they tried to grow its support in the chamber.Advertisement"}

Mueller III.Mr. Trump established the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 1987, when he was a New York City real estate mogul, with the stated mission of collecting and maintaining money \u201cexclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary or educational purposes,\u201d either directly or by donating to other organizations.

{"Headline": "What Went Wrong for Villaraigosa: A California Stalwart Ponders His Loss for Governor", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "The former Los Angeles mayor said wealthy voters rejected his message \u2014 and working class voters failed to turn out.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Antonio R. Villaraigosa was the high-riding mayor of this city for eight years. His election as its first Latino chief executive in modern times was an electrifying moment. Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat, has over the years expressed high ambitions for his future: a cabinet secretary in a Hillary Clinton White House. Governor of California. A next-generation leader for Latinos across the nation.He drew just 13 percent of the vote after a campaign calling for California to confront an economic divide that he warned threatened its future. It was a stunningly poor showing given the arc of his career: City Council, State Assembly, Assembly speaker, mayor, chairman of the 2012 Democratic National Convention. And it came even after charter school advocates financed a $23 million independent campaign on his behalf.\u201cMy message resonated in areas where people are struggling \u2014 it didn\u2019t resonate where people are doing well,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said, sitting at a dining room table in his home, near wraparound windows that offered views of the Hollywood sign, downtown Los Angeles, the Pacific Ocean and Griffith Park. \u201cI understand Latinos voted two to one for me. They just didn\u2019t come out in big numbers.\u201d\u201cLook, I\u2019ve been out of office for five years,\u201d he said, after using his phone to adjust the volume of the jazzy music coming from hidden speakers scattered around the sprawling top floor of the house. \u201cI had never run for statewide office before. I had started at a big disadvantage.\u201dHis third-place finish suggested to some that Latino voters have yet to become the major political force in this state that their numbers would suggest. Or perhaps Mr. Villaraigosa, who left City Hall an unpopular figure after a tenure that included a high-profile affair with a television reporter, was not the man they wanted to be the symbol of modern-day Latino power.Mr. Villaraigosa lost to Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican businessman who won the endorsement of Mr. Trump: Those two will face each other on the November ballot. Mr. Villaraigosa said he and his aides saw his own prospects wane as support for Mr. Cox rose after the Trump endorsement.Over the course of a 45-minute interview \u2014 a break, he said, from writing thank-you letters to supporters \u2014 Mr. Villaraigosa said he took responsibility for his own loss.He acknowledged that he left City Hall a decidedly unpopular figure, as many in the city turned against him \u2014 viewing him more as a showman than as a chief executive, particularly after the affair. And his life today, as a wealthy businessman living in the Hollywood Hills, is a long way from his roots \u2014 growing up in a working-class family in East Los Angeles \u2014 which some analysts suggested might have contributed to any weak showing among Latino voters.Roberto Suro, professor of public policy and journalism at the University of Southern California, said that Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s campaign for governor never matched the excitement of his races for mayor, or for that matter, his early years in City Hall, when he was often seen with celebrities and presidents, showing up at the Oscars, Dodger games and glamorous Hollywood events.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any of the buzz he did in the first two mayoral elections,\u201d said Mr. Suro, who has studied Latino political power in California. \u201cWe had people on the West Side then who said, \u2018We have to show what kind of city we are by electing a Latino mayor.\u2019 I didn\u2019t sense any of that. It wasn\u2019t there.\u201dMr. Villaraigosa drew a somber contrast between what he found when he ran for mayor \u2014 crowds waiting to greet him, banks of television cameras at every news conference \u2014 and this relatively desultory campaign. \u201cEvery time we had a press conference we had multiple cameras,\u201d he said, recalling the highlights of his mayoral race. \u201cHere we had to do Facebook Live. Facebook Live! Nobody came to the press conferences.\u201dA key question going forward is whether Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s collapse offered a verdict on the power of the Latino vote. But it is difficult to measure because there were no exit polls \u2014 which gives researchers valuable information on who turned out and why \u2014 and the vote tally is not complete.\u201cThere is no question that there was a lack of turnout and a lack of enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Suro said. \u201cThis guy was a two-term mayor of Los Angeles running to be the first Latino governor since the 1800s and nobody stood up to salute?\u201dBut Matt A. Barreto, the head of the Latino Policy and Politics Initiative at the University of California, Los Angeles, said an early review of some vote totals \u2014 in heavily Latino districts in Orange County and Los Angeles County \u2014 suggested that those voters had turned out to a considerable extent, and voted for Latino candidates on the ballot, such as Xavier Becerra, a Democrat and the attorney general, and Alex Padilla, the secretary of state. He said that Mr. Villaraigosa had trailed behind them.\u201cI think it\u2019s more a function of him being out of politics longer and Newsom being a good candidate,\u201d Mr. Barreto said. \u201cIt was hard to attack Newsom for being bad for the Latino community. That made it difficult for Villaraigosa.\u201dThe former mayor has spent the past few days with his family and aides, thinking, he said, more about what to do next than what went wrong. Retirement, he said, glancing around his opulent home, its walls covered with art, and a sprawling deck outside the third-floor kitchen, is not an option. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to get some work,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably business.\u201dMr. Villaraigosa said he has made a point of trying not to read accounts of his loss, or pore over the data of what went wrong. But he noticed when Mayor Eric M. Garcetti, his successor at City Hall, offered criticism of his campaign, suggesting that money had been wasted and that his message had been muddled.\u201cI heard that he did that,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cIt\u2019s just noise. People say stuff off the cuff. If I don\u2019t know what happened, how does anyone else know?\u201dMr. Garcetti is now actively exploring a race for president. Asked if he had any advice to give back to the current mayor, the former mayor paused.\u201cWell after losing the election by the margin I did,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said, \u201cI think I\u2019m humble enough to reserve any advice I have to a one-on-one conversation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Courtside View of Scott Pruitt\u2019s Cozy Ties With a Billionaire Coal Baron", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 It was one of the biggest games of the University of Kentucky basketball season, and Scott Pruitt had scored two of the best seats in the arena: a few feet from the action, in a section reserved for season-ticket holders who had donated at least $1 million to the university.But there was more to the game last December than a superfan experience for Mr. Pruitt and his son, who joined him. They sat in seats belonging to Joseph W. Craft III, a billionaire coal executive who has engaged in an aggressive campaign to reverse the Obama administration\u2019s environmental crackdown on the coal industry. Mr. Craft and his wife donated more than $2 million to support President Trump\u2019s candidacy and inauguration.A major contributor to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s campaigns in Oklahoma when Mr. Pruitt served in state government, Mr. Craft saw Mr. Pruitt at least seven times during his first 14 months at the E.P.A., agency records and emails show, and they were scheduled to appear together on at least two other occasions. That is more than Mr. Pruitt has met with representatives of any environmental group.Heath Lovell, vice president for public affairs at Alliance, said that Mr. Pruitt had wanted to take his son to the game while visiting Lexington, and had reached out to Mr. Craft, who sold him the tickets at \u201cmarket value.\u201dJahan Wilcox, an E.P.A. spokesman, said that Mr. Pruitt paid $130 in cash for each ticket. An email from the E.P.A. ethics office approving in advance the purchase of the tickets said that payment would be made by check, but since it was a cash transaction, there is no receipt.\u201cAdministrator Pruitt and Joe Craft are longtime friends,\u201d Mr. Wilcox said. He did not respond to follow-up questions about why Mr. Pruitt paid in cash.Mr. Craft, 67, and Mr. Pruitt, 50, have deep ties to Kentucky. Mr. Pruitt, who was born and raised in the state, briefly played baseball at the University of Kentucky on a scholarship; Mr. Craft, also a Kentucky native, earned both his undergraduate and law degrees from the university. Both men later advanced their professional lives in Oklahoma, where Alliance has its corporate headquarters and where Mr. Pruitt served as a Republican state lawmaker and attorney general before joining the Trump administration.The two met in Oklahoma in the mid-2000s, Mr. Lovell said, when Mr. Pruitt sought out the coal executive after his hearing about his connection to Kentucky sports. Mr. Craft owns a mansion in Tulsa about a mile from Mr. Pruitt\u2019s home.Their targeting of the Obama-era controls imposed on the coal industry has angered environmentalists, who praised efforts by the E.P.A. under the Obama administration to reduce lead and other toxic substances in power plant emissions, while also addressing climate change concerns related to carbon dioxide releases.\u201cThe slash-and-burn approach Pruitt is taking to regulation may not materially affect outcomes in the coal industry,\u201d said Tom FitzGerald, director of the Kentucky Resources Council, an environmental advocacy group. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to stop them from trying in the short term, health and safety be damned.\u201dCoal companies have welcomed what they consider a sea change in the federal government\u2019s approach to balancing business interests with environmental protections. The industry, a shadow of its former self in terms of production and employment, views the Trump administration as offering it an overdue lifeline.\u201cThe fact that industry no longer has an adversary in its government, and specifically at the E.P.A., is a huge step forward in common-sense regulation,\u201d said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association.Mr. Lovell said that while Alliance welcomed the changes Mr. Pruitt had brought to the E.P.A., the coal company had not been treated differently from its industry peers.\u201cWe did not receive any special treatment from the E.P.A.,\u201d Mr. Lovell said.For years, coal companies have struggled with the industry\u2019s decline.There has been a fundamental shift in the way electricity is generated in the United States, with cleaner energy sources such as natural gas, wind and solar power ascendant. And many older coal-burning power plants are reaching the end of their useful lives.The E.P.A. was no longer in the business of \u201cpicking winners and losers,\u201d he added, a reference to the Obama-era restrictions that the industry has argued put coal producers at a disadvantage.\u201cThey\u2019ve chosen some good mines, so their costs are not being driven up like others,\u201d said Tom Sanzillo, a researcher at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a clean energy think tank.Mr. Craft wants to grow even more \u2014 allowing \u201cexisting fleets to expand their capacity,\u201d he said during an earnings call in January 2017, and exporting more coal \u2014 and he moved quickly last year to get Mr. Pruitt on board, according to public records.The next month, Mr. Craft and his wife were both listed as attending the board meeting of the National Mining Association in Florida, where 100 or so coal industry executives gathered.After Mr. Pruitt spoke to the group, the board backed the Trump administration\u2019s decision to leave the Paris climate agreement. The E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general is investigating an allegation that the board\u2019s decision came at Mr. Pruitt\u2019s request, which could amount to a violation of anti-lobbying laws.Mr. Wilcox, the E.P.A. spokesman, said that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s appearance had been cleared by agency ethics officials and that he did not eat dinner at the event.Documents show that Mr. Craft and others in the industry have sought the E.P.A.\u2019s help, particularly in decreasing costs related to air and water pollution controls at coal-powered plants.The companies have asked the agency to roll back at least eight Obama-era rules regulating water pollution, climate change, coal ash and air pollution, among other measures. Almost all the rules affect the 30 plants that burn coal supplied by Alliance, including a plant that powers Henderson, Ky., about 200 miles west of Lexington.Alliance\u2019s Warrior Coal mine, which has a contract to supply coal to the Henderson plant, is 30 miles away in western Kentucky, where the stillness of the hills is interrupted by the drone of the mine\u2019s ventilation fan and the occasional movement of rail cars.To continue burning the coal under current regulations, Henderson must build a $34 million water treatment plant to keep toxic metals from discharging into a nearby river. And it must spend $21 million more to clean up its handling of coal waste \u2014 which now sits in a giant unsightly pond near the plant \u2014 as well as $16 million to overhaul electricity-generating turbines.\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t make sense to keep them operating as is,\u201d said Chris Heimgartner, general manager of the Henderson utility that owns the plant, as steam billowed from the aging dual-stacks in the distance behind him. \u201cThere is just too much cheap energy.\u201dBasketball is king in Lexington, and on a bitterly cold afternoon last December, Mr. Pruitt was in the middle of the action as Kentucky beat its in-state rival, the University of Louisville, in a nationally televised game.Because his seat was so close to the court, he was visible during the telecast. A video clip on Twitter and Instagram showed Mr. Pruitt and his college-age son, Cade, standing in the players\u2019 entrance as the team walked to the court.In a message on Twitter, Ms. Craft posted a photo of herself with Mr. Pruitt and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the player of the game. \u201cGreat to see @EPAScottPruitt,\u201d she wrote, using his Twitter handle. The Crafts, who have 26 season tickets, did not sit with Mr. Pruitt and his son during the game. (The season tickets used by Mr. Pruitt cost $1,300 each, the equivalent of $130 per game, the university said.)Tony Oppegard, a lawyer based in Lexington and a former Kentucky mine safety prosecutor, described Mr. Craft as a powerful presence in a state with weak safety and environmental oversight that relies on federal regulations and enforcement.\u201cHe wields a lot of influence,\u201d Mr. Oppegard said.At the federal level, Mr. Craft bet big on Mr. Trump.\u201cThe Trump administration does appreciate the value that coal-fired electricity brings to the nation,\u201d Mr. Craft told investors soon after Mr. Trump was sworn in as president.Mr. Craft backed Mr. Pruitt when he ran for Oklahoma attorney general in 2010.As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt directed state officials to challenge the E.P.A., including a lawsuit that accused the agency of improperly trying to compel two Oklahoma coal-burning power plants to overhaul their emissions systems to improve air quality in nearby federal wilderness areas. That regulation affected plants fueled with coal from Alliance\u2019s mines.Even with the changes under Mr. Pruitt\u2019s E.P.A., the coal industry faces formidable obstacles, particularly because of the abundance of cheap natural gas.The Henderson plant is already moving toward a likely shutdown of its coal-burning units, Mr. Heimgartner said, making it one of at least nine power plants supplied by Alliance in the last year that are considering closing or have announced partial or complete shutdowns, an analysis by the Sierra Club shows.Steve Eder reported from Kentucky, Hiroko Tabuchi from New York and Eric Lipton from Washington.

{"Headline": "Getting Down Payment Help Now. Sharing Home\u2019s Gain (or Loss) Later.", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor aspiring homeowners, coming up with a healthy down payment has long been the biggest obstacle to owning a home.Now, a small but growing number of home buyers are trying something different: asking an outside investor to put down money alongside them.It is called shared equity, and Unison, a company based in San Francisco, is the largest of a handful of firms putting it to work. Unison will provide at least half of a consumer\u2019s down payment in exchange for a piece of any appreciation in the home\u2019s value when it is sold. If the home sells at a loss, the company absorbs a share of that, too.Until the home sells, Unison is mostly a silent partner. The homeowner pays taxes, insurance and all other necessary costs.The idea behind the program is to provide home buyers with more options. It can help those who are short on down payment funds increase their buying power, though it may also work for people who simply do not want to sink every last dime into their homes. But whether it is right for any individual buyer \u2014 upfront cash now versus less proceeds later \u2014 is a difficult and highly personal calculation.But relying on an outside investor challenges traditional attitudes about homeownership, even if the conventional approach may be just as risky: Where else in our lives are we encouraged to plunk a huge piece of our net worth into a single asset? The same sort of behavior would be considered reckless in a retirement portfolio.Giving up a stake in your home to diversify may make sense in theory. The question is at what cost, and whether the average person is in the position to figure it out.Here is how Unison\u2019s program works.Unison began in high-price markets like California, so most people using the program are at least in their 40s with incomes between $75,000 and $150,000. The company said it expected those numbers to fall now that it had branched into different areas.The company will invest in single-family and multifamily homes with up to four units, and in townhouses and condominiums. To discourage the quick flipping of properties for a profit, Unison requres buyers to occupy the properties, but they can sell whenever they want.Seven years later, the home sells for $575,556, 15 percent above the purchase price. Unison gets back its initial $50,000, plus 35 percent of the price appreciation, or $26,444, for a total of $76,444. The homeowner walks away with roughly $108,000, after selling costs. That figure includes equity and roughly two-thirds of the increase in value.If the same home sold for $469,000, a loss of $31,000, or 6 percent, Unison would offset some of that. The homeowner would absorb only 65 percent of the loss, keeping $46,600 after the sale versus only $35,720 if Unison were not involved.\u201cIn really negative return scenarios, Unison gets wiped out completely,\u201d said Paul Tucker, the company\u2019s director of business operations, \u201cbut our loss is capped at our initial investment.\u201d\u201cIf you truly can\u2019t afford to do anything other than rent, you will build more equity with shared equity than you would have as renter,\u201d Mr. Theodos said, adding that he was not sure whether such arrangements were the best option for people in more affordable areas. \u201cWhether this makes sense for Wichita and Duluth or even Chicago? I am less sure.\u201dMr. Theodos also said there was something else that home buyers should not ignore.\u201cInvestors are looking for a way to make money \u2014 most people\u2019s wealth is in their home,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not a fully tapped market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australians Can\u2019t Get Enough of the Barefoot Investor", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileAfter 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, possibly the longest stretch of any developed country in modern history, you\u2019d expect Australians to feel pretty relaxed about their pocketbooks. Yet the biggest-selling nonfiction title on record in Australia concerns \u2014 of all things \u2014 personal finance.In a country of 24 million people, Scott Pape has sold more than one million copies of \u201cThe Barefoot Investor: The Only Money Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need\u201d since its publication by Wiley in December 2016 (a third updated version comes out on July 2). Even more extraordinary than those sales figures is the devotion of Mr. Pape\u2019s followers. They use terms like \u201csplurge card\u201d (a debit card for everyday luxuries), \u201cmojo account\u201d (for when you feel like quitting your job) and \u201cfire extinguisher funds\u201d (emergency reserves) with an enthusiasm not normally associated with fiscal responsibility.Part of Mr. Pape\u2019s appeal probably comes from the fact that so many Australians are happy to have more money than they\u2019d expected, but it\u2019s also a function of just how Australian he is.The 39-year-old, who has since rebuilt his property from scratch, isn\u2019t big on tough love. Instead, his tone is relentlessly casual, as though to make us forget we\u2019re reading about compound interest. At the end of each chapter, he encourages the reader to head to the pub. \u201cMoney talk is better with garlic bread and wine,\u201d he writes, counseling couples to talk through financial issues on the back of a napkin at least once a month. Throughout, he displays a suspicion for authority and a disdain for the wealthy, which syncs with the Australian national mythology of a classless society. Have a drink, he suggests at the end of a chapter about cutting up your credit cards, reasoning that it\u2019s not every day you save yourself from paying off some banker\u2019s BMW.On the phone from his farm, Mr. Pape is clear on what his book is not. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a wealth creation book which will make you a millionaire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about security.\u201d He\u2019s \u201cbarefoot\u201d because that\u2019s how life was for him growing up in a rural area, working alongside his father who ran and later owned a gas station.After a business degree at a regional university, Mr. Pape worked for a short time as a stockbroker in Melbourne before starting his own financial advising business. \u201cI went into finance not for the wealth, or the $300 pair of jeans, but because I wanted to keep my freedom,\u201d he said. Ten years ago, he started writing a syndicated newspaper column on personal finance. He\u2019s proud to say he\u2019s never been in the business of making outlandish claims \u2014 like telling people they can retire early. Mr. Pape himself isn\u2019t interested in stopping work, ever. \u201cI enjoy what I do too much.\u201d He is skeptical of \u201cthose guys who run around saying, \u2018I retired at 35, and you can too.\u2019\u201dMr. Pape\u2019s folksy manner delivers down-home truths: Don\u2019t get swept up in trendy investments; pay off your debts; analyze how banks are managing your money. As a result, it\u2019s uncontroversial with experts. Chris Richardson, an economist at Deloitte in Canberra, said that Mr. Pape\u2019s major tenets, like his argument that Australians have generally overvalued property and undervalued stock trading \u201care more real then people realize.\u201dAnother cornerstone of the Barefoot Investor\u2019s plan that resonates with economists is the importance of renegotiating bank fees, which, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia, run to 480 Australian dollars, around $355, a household per year. \u201cOver ten years,\u201d Mr. Pape writes, that\u2019s \u201cenough to take you to New York City and stay at a five-star hotel.\u201dBank fees are lower in the United States; in Australia, just four banks represent about 80 percent of the total share of the market. \u201cWe certainly have high market concentration by international standards,\u201d said Danielle Wood, an economist at the Grattan Institute, a public policy think tank in Melbourne. Ms. Wood sees high bank fees as a result of status quo bias, or the tendency to accept things the way they are, perhaps understandable for a country doing so well economically. \u201cI think the message of the Barefoot Investor gets traction because he encourages people to think about things, and think about why they\u2019re paying too much,\u201d she said.Jackie Frankel, a 47-year-old factory worker from Australia\u2019s Mornington Peninsula, is a zealous Barefooter, as Mr. Pape\u2019s fans are known. She concedes that her two grown daughters don\u2019t completely understand his appeal. \u201cThey say to me, it\u2019s common sense stuff to figure out what you owe, but I say people need it in black and white,\u201d Ms. Frankel said. After reading the book, she and her husband, who also works in a factory, started going out for \u201cdate breakfasts.\u201d (Nights were out because of their shifts.) After talking it through over eggs, they moved their money from one of the \u201cbig four\u201d banks to an online-only account recommended by name in Mr. Pape\u2019s book. (He says that he does not accept any endorsements, and will pull a recommendation if he sees a company using his name in advertising.) \u201cWe saved $500 a month just doing that, and now we\u2019re going to New Zealand on a cruise,\u201d Ms. Frankel said.Australians love to travel internationally: about 60 percent hold passports, compared with around 40 percent of Americans. Mr. Pape doesn\u2019t come across as abstemious about these sorts of big-ticket expenses. Instead, he advocates for letting the good times roll by divvying money into \u201cbuckets.\u201d This approach ensures daily expenses are separated from \u201csplurges,\u201d like lattes, and \u201csmile\u201d purchases, which, like vacations, make you smile when you think of them. Call it the set and forget principle of money management.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t subscribe to the idea that you\u2019ve got to get down to the bare bones and have no fun,\u201d said Ali Cusack, a 31-year-old lawyer in Melbourne. \u201cHe just says, build it into your budget.\u201d Ms. Cusack has been to Europe each summer for the past two years and recently started her own maritime law practice. \u201cI got so ridiculously good at saving money that I didn\u2019t even need to take out a loan to start my own business,\u201d she said.Mr. Pape knows Australians have it good. \u201cYou and I won the lifestyle lotto,\u201d is how he puts it in the book. But Australians also don\u2019t generally like to be perceived as promoting themselves. Tall poppy syndrome, which refers to Australians\u2019 supposed aversion to high-achieving individuals, can extend to avoiding sensitive topics, including money. Mr. Pape wants to change that, and his next book, which is due out with HarperCollins in September, will focus on how families can be more open about their financial situation.\u201cI\u2019ve got three little kids so that\u2019s where I\u2019m at at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI have parents who come to me and say, \u2018my little Tim is such a saver, he doesn\u2019t spend any of his money.\u2019\u201d Mr. Pape says he worries about how miserly \u2014 and miserable \u2014 that kid will be when he\u2019s 28. \u201cYou want your kids to grow up generous and hardworking and enjoying their life.\u201d His advice to parents: Talk to your kids about money. It\u2019s a way of sharing your values.Amelia Lester is an Australian writer living in Japan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Helps Putin", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Rice was the national security adviser during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.Imagine if Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, had also written a letter to Mr. Trump, somehow inserting it in the top drawer of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. What advice would Mr. Putin have offered his American counterpart, the man whom Mr. Putin tried to help elect, according to the American intelligence community?Mr. Putin\u2019s objectives are plain: to restore Russia to global greatness at the expense of the United States and to divide Europe by weakening NATO and the European Union. In Mr. Putin\u2019s zero-sum calculus, when the United States and Europe founder, Russia benefits. The Russian leader knows that America\u2019s global power rests not only on our military and economic might but also on our unrivaled network of alliances from Europe to Asia. For some seven decades, our alliances have ensured that America\u2019s strength and influence are magnified. Accordingly, Mr. Putin seeks to drive wedges between the United States and its closest partners, to strain and ultimately rupture its alliances.If Mr. Putin were calling the shots, he would ensure that America\u2019s reliability is doubted, its commitments broken, its values debased and its image tarnished. He would advise the new president to take a series of steps to advance those aims:Second, criticize NATO and cast doubt on America\u2019s willingness to defend its allies on the grounds that they haven\u2019t paid their bills (when that\u2019s not how NATO works). Simultaneously, corrode the European Union by: lauding Brexit; sending Stephen Bannon to stoke European anti-establishment movements; and undermining Europe\u2019s most powerful country, Germany, most recently through installing a right-wing flamethrower as ambassador.Third, for the coup de gr\u00e2ce: start a trade war with our closest allies. Impose steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union with the threat of auto tariffs to follow so that, according to reputable economists, both the United States and its allies\u2019 economies will suffer. Justify the penalties on the preposterous grounds that allies threaten United States national security. Do so after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, following months of stringing along our European partners with the hope that we might agree to augment aspects of the pact. Then threaten sanctions on European companies for abiding by the deal, which has worked as intended.With the sum of these actions, President Trump has deeply angered our closest allies and offended almost every member of the international community, except Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates \u2014 and Russia. Meanwhile, Russia is ascendant in the Middle East. The European Union is reeling \u2014 with Italy, Slovenia, Austria and Hungary now led by populist nationalists who embrace Mr. Putin and wish to terminate sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. NATO\u2019s unity is similarly strained, provoking concern about its collective will to counter any new Russian aggression.All good for Mr. Putin and no one else.Four years ago, after the Ukraine invasion, the United States led the charge to throw Russia out of the G-8. Now, as leaders of the Group of 7 nations gather in Quebec, President Trump says he thinks Russia should be readmitted. The climate is so bitter that the French finance minister termed the meeting the \u201cG-6 plus one.\u201d In reality, it\u2019s the \u201cG-7 minus one,\u201d since President Trump has so alienated the United States from its core partners that we have effectively absented ourselves.America stands alone, weakened and distrusted. Without United States leadership, the G-7 can accomplish little. And, when next we need our allies to rally to fight terrorists, place sanctions against North Korea, combat a pandemic or check China and Russia, will they join with us after we have so disrespected them?There is no evidence that Mr. Putin is dictating American policy. But it\u2019s hard to imagine how he could do much better, even if he were.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How One Conservative Think Tank Is Stocking Trump\u2019s Government", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "FeatureBy placing its people throughout the administration, the Heritage Foundation has succeeded in furthering its right-wing agenda.Supported byThe job of staffing the government is the first, and in many ways defining, challenge faced by every president. As the size of the government has grown to accommodate the nation\u2019s economy, frequent military interventions and increasingly complex geopolitical obligations, so have the scale and gravity of the task. In 1933, there were just over 200 presidential appointees in the executive and legislative branches. At the end of the Barack Obama\u2019s second term, there were 4,100.Filling enough of these jobs in time to get the government off the ground on Jan. 20 is difficult in the best of circumstances, which is to say when the president-elect has some sort of pre-existing political infrastructure to draw upon. Even Ronald Reagan, who, like Trump, campaigned as a Washington outsider, relied on both his inner circle from the California Statehouse and a kitchen cabinet of mostly self-made millionaires who helped finance his political rise. Trump would be coming to the White House with little more than the remnants of a campaign staff that included his daughter and son-in-law, a contestant from his reality-TV show and his longtime bodyguard. What is more, in the days after his election, Donald Trump replaced the head of his preliminary transition operation, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and purged Christie\u2019s allies from the team, throwing away months\u2019 worth of their work recruiting and vetting personnel; a senior Trump aide, Stephen K. Bannon, made a show of gleefully dumping binders filled with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s into the trash.The Trump team may not have been prepared to staff the government, but the Heritage Foundation was. In the summer of 2014, a year before Trump even declared his candidacy, the right-wing think tank had started assembling a 3,000-name searchable database of trusted movement conservatives from around the country who were eager to serve in a post-Obama government. The initiative was called the Project to Restore America, a dog-whistle appeal to the so-called silent majority that foreshadowed Trump\u2019s own campaign slogan.In some ways, Trump and Heritage were an unlikely match. Trump had no personal connection to the think tank and had fared poorly on a \u201cPresidential Platform Review\u201d from its sister lobbying shop, Heritage Action for America, which essentially concluded that he wasn\u2019t even a conservative. (\u201cDespite his rhetoric, Trump\u2019s history suggests a reluctance to engage in debates over protecting civil society from the imposition of left-wing values,\u201d it read in part.) After Trump mocked John McCain\u2019s P.O.W. experience in Vietnam, Heritage Action\u2019s chief executive, Michael Needham, called the candidate \u201ca clown\u201d on Fox News and said \u201che needs to be out of the race.\u201d Trump claimed to want to shake up the Washington establishment. The Heritage Foundation is a Washington institution. Its large, stately headquarters sits just a few blocks from Capitol Hill.And yet Heritage and Trump were uniquely positioned to help each other. Much like Trump\u2019s, Heritage\u2019s constituency is equal parts donor class and populist base. Its $80 million annual budget depends on six-figure donations from rich Republicans like Rebekah Mercer, whose family foundation has reportedly given Heritage $500,000 a year since 2013. But it also relies on a network of 500,000 small donors, Heritage \u201cmembers\u201d whom it bombards with millions of pieces of direct mail every year. The Heritage Foundation is a marketing company, a branding agency \u2014 it sells its own Heritage neckties, embroidered with miniature versions of its Liberty Bell logo \u2014 and a policy shop rolled into one. But above all, Heritage is a networking group. It has spent decades fashioning itself into the hub of a constellation of conservative individuals and organizations united by their opposition to government regulations \u2014 from taxes to gun control to environmental protections \u2014 and socially progressive causes like same-sex marriage.Today it is clear that for all the chaos and churn of the current administration, Heritage has achieved a huge strategic victory. Those who worked on the project estimate that hundreds of the people the think tank put forward landed jobs, in just about every government agency. Heritage\u2019s recommendations included some of the most prominent members of Trump\u2019s cabinet: Scott Pruitt, Betsy DeVos (whose in-laws endowed Heritage\u2019s Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society), Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Jeff Sessions and many more. Dozens of Heritage employees and alumni also joined the Trump administration \u2014 at last count 66 of them, according to Heritage, with two more still awaiting Senate confirmation. It is a kind of critical mass that Heritage had been working toward for nearly a half-century.Heritage was born in the spring of 1971 in the basement cafeteria of the United States Capitol. Feulner had just turned 30 and was working for Representative Philip Crane, an Illinois Republican who had written a book, \u201cThe Democrat\u2019s Dilemma: How the Liberal Left Captured the Democratic Party,\u201d arguing that left-wing radicals inspired by the Fabian Society, a socialist group in Britain, were secretly trying to turn America into a socialist state via the Democratic Party. As an undergraduate at Regis College, Feulner had been drawn to an emerging conservative movement that saw as its enemy not only Democrats but also moderate Republicans who threatened to do to their party what they believed the Fabians had done to the Democrats. In 1964, as a graduate student at the Wharton School, he organized a campus group to support the insurgent presidential candidacy of his political hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona.Over breakfast at the Capitol, Feulner and another Hill aide, 28-year-old Paul M. Weyrich \u2014 later credited with coining the phrase \u201cmoral majority\u201d \u2014 commiserated over a recent study from the American Enterprise Institute, an established conservative think tank, about a proposed supersonic transport plane. The report could have helped buttress their argument that the government should continue to fund the plane as part of its effort to win the Cold War, but A.E.I. had withheld it until after the Senate voted on the issue so as not to bias the debate. This was, to their thinking, the wrong approach. What if they could create a new sort of think tank, one that would actively seek to cultivate and influence politicians, and in the process advance the cause of movement conservatism?Soon after, they made their pitch to Joseph Coors, the highly motivated Colorado beer baron who would later, at the suggestion of the Reagan White House aide and future National Rifle Association president Oliver North, wire $65,000 to a Swiss bank account to buy a cargo plane for Nicaraguan rebels. Coors had come to Washington in search of a conservative institution in which to invest. The meeting was held in the office of the irreverent ex-newspaperman and Nixon aide Lyn Nofziger. Weyrich had heard that Coors was also considering investing in A.E.I., which gave Nofziger the idea for \u201ca little artifice,\u201d as the official history of the Heritage Foundation describes it. Before Coors arrived, Nofziger sprinkled some cigar ashes on a thick American Enterprise Institute study resting on his bookshelf. When Coors asked about A.E.I., he took the book off-the-shelf and blew off the ashes. \u201cA.E.I.?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re good for \u2014 collecting dust.\u201dCoors invested $260,000 in the new venture, and within a few years, Heritage had taken its place at the center of the growing conservative counterestablishment. Its initial fund-raising success foreshadowed the rise of the Republican donor class as a political force: Another early and generous giver was the banking and oil heir Richard Mellon Scaife, who went on to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in conservative media outlets and nonprofit organizations that, among other projects, targeted the Clintons during the 1990s. (Heritage trustees used to joke that Coors gave six-packs; Scaife gave cases.)Feulner packaged his fledgling think tank\u2019s ideology into five basic principles: free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional values and a strong national defense. They would guide Heritage\u2019s agenda, which would be set by Feulner and his senior leadership team. Feulner also anticipated the danger of his new think tank\u2019s being dismissed as a tool of rich Republicans. To build a Heritage member base that would assert the foundation\u2019s anti-establishment identity, he turned to Richard Viguerie, the conservative marketing pioneer known for his high-quality mailing list and his uniquely apocalyptic warnings of imminent national collapse.Think tanks are sometimes referred to as universities without students, suggesting intellectual diversity within a general philosophical orientation. Heritage, by contrast, was strictly results-oriented. Feulner once likened his strategy to Procter & Gamble\u2019s approach to Crest toothpaste: \u201cThey sell it and resell it every day by keeping the product fresh in the consumer\u2019s mind.\u201d One way to promote Heritage\u2019s brand was to inundate Congress with an unending barrage of bite-size \u201cbackgrounders\u201d; another was by networking. Heritage hosted weekend retreats for lawmakers, study groups for young congressional staffers and semester-long internships for college students, complete with Heritage housing. In its early years, Heritage took up numerous political battles: It published papers advocating making Social Security voluntary, argued against giving striking workers access to food stamps and warned parents about the danger posed by the advancement of \u201csecular humanism\u201d in public schools. To Feulner, they were all worthy fights, but they were just a prelude to what Heritage\u2019s official history calls \u201cthe Big Gamble\u201d \u2014 its decision to invest in the presidential candidacy of the 68-year-old Ronald Reagan.Feulner saw something in Reagan long before he became president. \u201cWe had met with him when he was governor in California; we had visited his ranch and seen copies of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek with marginal notes in the book,\u201d Feulner told me. \u201cSo we knew that he was one of us.\u201d In the run-up to the 1980 election, Heritage spent $250,000 to assemble a comprehensive guidebook for conservative rule that it called \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d and aggressively marketed it to members of Reagan\u2019s transition team, in particular Edwin Meese, who was Reagan\u2019s chief of staff in California and later became his attorney general in Washington. The big gamble paid off: Meese told me that Reagan asked that the 1,093-page document be distributed at his first cabinet meeting. Reagan also turned to Heritage and Feulner to help staff and organize his administration. An enduring, mutually beneficial friendship was born. Meese wrote a letter on White House stationery stating that members of Heritage\u2019s President\u2019s Club \u2014 at the time, donors of $1,000 or more \u2014 would \u201cprovide a vital communications link between policymakers and those key people who made possible Reagan\u2019s victory,\u201d as Sidney Blumenthal reported in his 1986 book \u201cThe Rise of the Counter-Establishment.\u201d The relationship worked both ways. When Reagan\u2019s second term ended, Meese joined Heritage as its first Ronald Reagan Fellow in Public Policy, with an annual salary of more than $400,000. Now 86, he remains at the think tank as distinguished fellow emeritus of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies.Reagan\u2019s image is everywhere at Heritage, the informal poses and settings \u2014 on a horse, on a putting green, relaxing at his ranch \u2014 suggesting less a political actor than a beloved family member. But Heritage had its complaints about Reagan at the time. On the first anniversary of his presidency, the think tank issued a report characterizing his tenure as a disappointment to conservatives. Heritage laid much of the blame on personnel who were insufficiently committed to the president\u2019s agenda. \u201cThey were looking for competent people,\u201d Nofziger, who had gone on to become a key political strategist for Reagan, later recalled. \u201cI tried to explain to them that the first thing you do is get loyal people, and competence is a bonus.\u201dOver the following decades, Feulner continued to pursue his dream of turning the counterestablishment into the establishment. The prospects had perhaps never looked bleaker than they did in 2012, when Obama was easily elected to his second term. Having just turned 70, Feulner decided that it was time to retire. At that moment in conservative history, it was not difficult for him to see where the future of the think tank lay: the Tea Party. Heritage had helped organize and underwrite the anti-tax, anti-government \u2014 and, most of all, anti-Obama \u2014 movement, even creating a lobbying organization, Heritage Action, to help harness the energy it unleashed.A couple of years earlier, in 2010, Feulner heard a talk given by one of the movement\u2019s leading figures, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, at a meeting of a conservative dinner group in Georgetown. \u201cWhen it was over, Richard Viguerie said to Jim: \u2018That was such a fantastic speech. Why don\u2019t you run for president?\u2019\u2009\u201d Feulner told me, recounting the events of the evening. \u201cDeMint locked eyes with me and said, \u2018The only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted to be president of is the Heritage Foundation.\u2019\u2009\u201dFeulner decided DeMint was someone to watch, and the next year, the senator earned the highest possible rating on Heritage Action\u2019s new congressional scorecard, which evaluated lawmakers\u2019 voting records on the think tank\u2019s principles \u2014 higher than Michele Bachmann and much higher than Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell. (\u201cWith each vote cast in Congress, freedom either advances or recedes,\u201d Needham said when Heritage Action unveiled the new rating system.) DeMint had fought the federal bailouts of the banks and carmakers, supported school prayer and opposed abortion and Obamacare. No less important, DeMint, who had an M.B.A. from Clemson University, shared the Heritage belief that politics was as much about sales and recruiting as it was about legislating or governing. Before running for office at the age of 47, he had operated his own marketing company; as a senator, he created a political-action committee, the Senate Conservatives Fund, to raise cash for select conservative candidates. He was clearly a skilled fund-raiser, which was a big part of the Heritage job. He would have to be willing to give up his Senate seat to run a think tank, which was maybe not as far-fetched as it sounded. In addition to influence, Heritage offered something the government couldn\u2019t: money. Without even having to taint his reputation by becoming a lobbyist, he would get a roughly 400 percent raise from his government salary, to nearly $900,000 in his first full year.While Feulner and his senior staff had reserved the right to review policy papers, they generally avoided intervening in the research and publication process. DeMint and his leadership team were much more aggressive. Papers were heavily edited or even withheld from release altogether. Several scholars quit. DeMint replaced them, bringing in as Heritage\u2019s chief economist Stephen Moore, a Wall Street Journal editorial writer and a founder of the Club for Growth, a lobbying group that advocates cutting taxes.DeMint intensified the think tank\u2019s marketing efforts, targeting Obamacare in particular. A Heritage billboard went up in Times Square \u2014 \u201cWarning,\u201d it read, \u201cObamacare may be hazardous to your health\u201d \u2014 and DeMint led a \u201cDefund Obamacare Tour\u201d across the country. In Congress, he had been something of a one-man ideological enforcer. Now he had at his disposal the power of an $80 million institution whose name was a one-word shorthand for movement conservatism; the backing of some of the country\u2019s richest, most politically engaged Republicans; and a significant slice of the conservative base. Within months of his arrival, he was pressing House Republicans to send the president a spending bill that wouldn\u2019t fund the Affordable Care Act, thus inviting a government shutdown. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that I have more influence now on public policy than I did as an individual senator,\u201d he said in an interview with National Public Radio in 2013.But his most audacious bid for influence came the following year, when he inaugurated the Project to Restore America. \u201cWhat we learned from talking to Heritage folks who had been in the Reagan administration was that we needed to be in the game early,\u201d Ed Corrigan, one of DeMint\u2019s Capitol Hill hires, told me. With its focus on staffing, the new effort was the logical extension of his fixation on recruiting the right conservatives for Congress, not to mention the concept at the very heart of Feulner\u2019s vision for Heritage. To lead the project, DeMint turned to a woman who had spent decades building Heritage\u2019s network and knew just how to staff a government: Becky Norton Dunlop, a former deputy personnel director for Reagan. \u201cI know this is going to be hard to believe, but he said \u2014 and I agreed \u2014 that it was highly likely that a conservative would be elected president,\u201d Dunlop told me, recalling her first conversation about the effort with DeMint. \u201cWe needed to be prepared.\u201dDunlop\u2019s name may be unfamiliar to most Americans, but she is something of a legend among movement conservatives. She came to Washington in 1973 straight from college to work for the American Conservative Union, the lobbying group best known for organizing the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, and later married an aide to Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who gave her away at their wedding. (Her father, a Baptist minister, officiated.) Congress eventually pushed her out of the Interior Department for trying to demote or fire several National Park Service employees and replace them with political appointees. Years later, after a controversial stint as Virginia\u2019s secretary of natural resources \u2014 \u201cGunning for the Environment?\u201d was the headline of a 1997 Washington Post profile in the Style section \u2014 she landed at Heritage as its vice president for external relations and has been there ever since.Dunlop tapped her extensive network, groups like the Family Research Council, Liberty University and the Council for National Policy, an organization that brings together advocates of various conservative causes. \u201cI talked to them all,\u201d Dunlop said. \u201c\u2009\u2018You need to think about this, and you need to spread the word. If you\u2019re interested, get your house in order, talk to your spouse and get ready, because we need to save our country.\u2019\u2009\u201dNot only was Trump an awkward fit for a staunch conservative like DeMint, but the Heritage president had strong ties to two of his primary opponents. His PAC had raised close to $600,000 for Marco Rubio\u2019s 2010 Senate campaign, and he and Rubio were both associated with the C Street house, a group residence on Capitol Hill affiliated with the Fellowship Foundation, the nonprofit organization that sponsors the National Prayer Breakfast. Ted Cruz \u2014 to whom DeMint\u2019s PAC had given nearly $1 million for his 2012 Senate run \u2014 had been a featured speaker on DeMint\u2019s \u201cDefund Obamacare\u201d tour. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to punish American companies that export jobs were anathema to Heritage\u2019s 45-year history of support for free trade, not to mention the interests of some of its biggest donors. Even as Trump was gaining momentum, some senior staff members continued to resist the idea of embracing him, arguing that it would damage Heritage\u2019s reputation, but DeMint decided to get out ahead of the rest of his party and work with Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign.DeMint understood better than most what lit up the conservative base; after all, he had spent years stoking its anger at the Republican establishment. At a private dinner on Capitol Hill in January 2016, two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, DeMint was the only one of a group of a dozen conservatives, including Yuval Levin of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard, who predicted that Trump would win the nomination.Trump\u2019s political views were less important than his approach to hiring. With DeMint\u2019s guidance, he could bring in trusted conservatives who supported a Heritage agenda that included opening offshore drilling on federal lands; opposing mandatory labeling of genetically engineered food; reducing regulations on for-profit universities; revoking an Obama executive order on green-energy mandates for federal agencies; phasing out federal subsidies for housing; and opposing marriage equality and nondiscrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \u201cThe watchword of personnel is: Get people who you want on the bus, and then figure out what seat you want to put them in,\u201d Dunlop said.Later that month, Trump\u2019s campaign lawyer (and future White House counsel) Donald McGahn convened a gathering of conservative leaders at the Capitol Hill offices of his law firm, Jones Day. Only a small group attended: Newt Gingrich, Senator Jeff Sessions, a handful of other sitting lawmakers who were supportive of Trump \u2014 and DeMint. \u201cAt that time,\u201d Gingrich told me, \u201cTrump\u2019s views were so unknown to the average conservative the concern was, is he going to be reliable?\u201d As the conversation evolved, an idea emerged: What if Trump could present to the public a list of Supreme Court nominees? DeMint enthusiastically volunteered to help provide one. When he returned to Heritage\u2019s offices, though, some senior staffers balked. One concern they raised was that it would be counterproductive for Heritage to explicitly endorse possible judicial appointees: Because the think tank was considered to the right of the Republican mainstream, its approval of candidates could make them toxic in the confirmation process. But DeMint was adamant, insisting that this was an opportunity Heritage should not pass up. The head of Heritage\u2019s Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, John Malcolm, ultimately wrote the list in the form of a post for Heritage\u2019s news and commentary website, The Daily Signal. By then, Trump had already singled out Heritage at a news conference, announcing that it was one of the groups he was working with on a Supreme Court list.Feulner, still active at Heritage as a member of its board, was the first from the think tank to join the Trump transition after the Republican National Convention. \u201cAugust 2016, Christie calls, and then candidate Trump calls to confirm: Would I take over the domestic side?\u201d Feulner told me. As he saw it, Trump held even more promise for Heritage than Reagan had. \u201cNo.1, he did clearly want to make very significant changes, and No.2, his views on so many things were not particularly well formed,\u201d Feulner said. \u201cAnd so if he somehow pulled the election off, we thought, wow, we could really make a difference.\u201dYet even as he was drilling further into the Trump team, DeMint was running into trouble inside his own building. Over the summer, complaints about his heavy-handed management style started to reach some members of Heritage\u2019s 22-person board. DeMint and his loyalists rejected the criticisms of his leadership, suggesting that they were the work of Mike Needham, the 36-year-old chief executive of Heritage Action. Needham came from a different world than DeMint. He grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and joined the think tank straight out of Williams College, beginning as Feulner\u2019s research assistant and rising to become his chief of staff. He left in 2007 to work on the presidential campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani and then went on to attend Stanford Business School but returned after he graduated. As DeMint and his allies saw it, Needham was trying to orchestrate a palace coup, turning a handful of isolated complaints about his hiring practices and handling of Heritage\u2019s research into a major case against DeMint as part of his own campaign to take control of the think tank. They knew, too, that Needham and Feulner were close and were convinced that Needham was trying to undermine DeMint with Heritage\u2019s founder.By early November, the tension between DeMint and Needham had escalated, and the senior staff was divided by their respective loyalties. It was just the sort of factionalism that would soon come to define the nascent Trump administration, with its personnel conflicts and firings. As the election approached, it seemed to some at Heritage that DeMint\u2019s future was uncertain. The Republican Party appeared to be headed for defeat and years of soul-searching, which might present a natural occasion for new leadership at the think tank.Corrigan had been in close contact with the Trump campaign for months. Now he told the assembled crowd of about 200 people what Heritage had been doing for the campaign and previewed the opportunities ahead. There were thousands of jobs to fill, and the priority was to fill them with \u201cchange agents,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to personnel decisions, that is the most frequently asked question, even before \u2018Are they qualified?\u2019 \u2018Are they a change agent?\u2019\u2009\u201d In the coming days, employees were encouraged to join the transition and were assured that as long as they were working as volunteers, Heritage could continue to pay their salaries and hold their jobs for them.The Trump transition offices quickly filled with Heritage staff members recruiting and vetting hires for the administration. The upheaval inside the transition caused by Christie\u2019s firing worked to DeMint\u2019s advantage: Pence was an old friend and conservative ally on Capitol Hill. Christie\u2019s departure also opened the way for Rick Dearborn to take control of the daily decision-making. Dearborn, the longtime chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, had already been a strong presence on the transition team. He went back years with Corrigan, who was the director of the Senate\u2019s conservative caucus for nearly a decade before joining Heritage with DeMint. Corrigan had been informally feeding Dearborn names for months.Matthew Buckham, a project administrator in Heritage\u2019s communications department who joined the transition to vet ambassadors and diplomats, told me that he and the rest of Heritage\u2019s staff on the transition tried to put forward every Heritage employee who wanted to work for the administration, whether in policy, administration or management jobs. \u201cAny list we touched we made sure had as many Heritage people as possible,\u201d he said. One of Heritage\u2019s labor economists, James Sherk, an advocate of rolling back labor rights, joined the White House domestic-policy council; another, David Kreutzer, who was a co-author of a Heritage policy paper arguing that \u201cno consensus exists that man-made emissions are the primary driver of global warming,\u201d joined the Environmental Protection Agency. Roger Severino, the director of Heritage\u2019s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, who has opposed extending civil rights protections to gay, lesbian and transgender people, joined the Department of Health and Human Services to run its Office for Civil Rights. Sean Doocey, a former Heritage employee who had worked at the think tank\u2019s Training and Recruitment Center, joined the Presidential Personnel Office \u2014 the little-known agency responsible for recruiting and vetting appointees for the executive branch \u2014 as its deputy director.In the spring of 2017, just a few months into his tenure, President Trump expressed his gratitude to both DeMint and Heritage in a speech at the National Rifle Association: \u201cThose people have been fantastic; they\u2019ve been real friends.\u201d And yet even in this moment of triumph, DeMint was losing the battle to keep his job. Emboldened by Trump\u2019s victory, he asked for a new contract on the eve of the inauguration. (He earned $1.2 million the previous year.) Heritage\u2019s three-person leadership team \u2014 Barb Van Andel-Gaby, a member of one of the families that founded the multilevel-marketing company Amway; Thomas A. Saunders III, a private-equity executive; and Nersi Nazari, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur \u2014 were noncommittal. Soon after, they came to Washington for a few days to perform their own internal investigation of the personnel problems, interviewing various staff members about DeMint\u2019s leadership.By the time the foundation\u2019s largest donors \u2014 $10,000 or more a year \u2014 gathered in April 2017 for their annual retreat at the Fairmont Grand Del Mar in San Diego, Heritage\u2019s senior management, like that of the administration it was staffing, was consumed by chaos, confusion, resentments and infighting. DeMint, by now, was blaming Feulner as well as Needham; he was certain that Feulner still effectively controlled the board and was turning it against him. Shortly after DeMint and his management team returned to Washington, he was stripped of his power while his severance package was negotiated. Many of the people he had brought in, including Corrigan, James Wallner (a research executive), Wesley Denton (a communications executive) and Buckham, soon left, too. Rumors swirled that Stephen Bannon would be taking over. He was still at the White House at the time, but he was close to Mercer, and it was no secret that Trump was turning on his power-hungry, attention-seeking chief strategist.Amid the upheaval, Saunders, the board\u2019s chairman, issued a statement on the ouster. \u201cHeritage is bigger than any one person,\u201d it read. In his first address to the staff, the think tank\u2019s new interim president, Ed Feulner, assured them that Heritage would continue to be \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s favorite think tank.\u201dJames, who is 69, is an almost total anomaly in the political world: a black female Republican who supports Donald Trump. In her first address to the Heritage staff, she spoke about her difficult childhood in Richmond, Va., with an absentee father and a mother on welfare. The hiring of a black woman as its president seemed like a coup for an institution that has been widely accused of representing only the interests of white men. \u201cShe did not get the job because of her gender or race,\u201d Feulner told me. \u201cShe got it because she\u2019s such an extraordinary individual. My only regret is that she\u2019s not 10 years younger.\u201dIn many respects, James does have the perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for Heritage. She served under Reagan and George Bush and was the director of the office of personnel management for George W. Bush. Along the way, she worked for several conservative organizations, including Pat Robertson\u2019s Regent University, and served on the board of Focus on the Family, the evangelical group known for its opposition to abortion, premarital sex and gay and transgender rights. In 2005, she did a brief stint with a defense contracting firm whose founder, Mitchell Wade, pleaded guilty a year later to bribing a congressman with more than $1 million in return for favors and earmarks. James went on to start her own nonprofit, the Gloucester Institute, which describes itself as a leadership training center; it offers mentoring and networking programs to black and Latino undergraduate and graduate students. According to Gloucester\u2019s 990 tax form, she earned $50,000 as president of the organization in 2016, the year before she became president of Heritage.James worked on the Trump transition, overseeing the White House\u2019s budget and personnel management offices. In March, on a Politico podcast, she said that she had been eager to join the administration to work on the president\u2019s \u201curban agenda.\u201d She was blocked by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former \u201cApprentice\u201d villain and director of communications for the White House Office of the Public Liaison, who during the campaign was charged with African-American outreach. \u201cThe way it was described to me is she approached the whole thing like it was \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019\u2009\u201d James said on the podcast. \u201cSo she looked around Washington and said, \u2018O.K., who do I need to get rid of first?\u2019\u2009\u201d (Newman herself was pushed out last year.)I met James, who has short, graying hair and favors colorful blazers, in May in her new Heritage office, which is enormous and looks out at the Capitol. After we settled onto a large, comfortable couch, she described her new job at Heritage as \u201cthe crown jewel\u201d of her career in the conservative movement. I asked James how she thought Trump was doing. \u201cPeople are focused up here on the trouble and all of the noise that you hear in Washington,\u201d she said, gesturing at eye level. \u201cBut down here, the bass notes are strong and loud. There\u2019s a lot of good that is going on, but we are in such a partisan, vitriolic atmosphere in this town right now that very often we overlook the bass notes.\u201dIn recent months, James has applauded Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulatory agenda; his crackdown on illegal immigration; his choice of the hard-liner John Bolton as national security adviser; his effort to rescind funding for a variety of federal programs, including the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program; and an executive order that will curtail the amount of time that federal union representatives can spend helping colleagues file claims for workplace grievances, including sexual harassment. Part of her task at Heritage, James told me, will be to expose a more diverse audience to the think tank\u2019s ideology. \u201cIf you talk to anyone about shaping the future of this nation, they will tell you that there are certain demographics that must be touched \u2014 millennials, women and minorities,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I tell people that unless our ideas are reaching those demographics, then we are going to be looking at a shrinking minority view in this country.\u201dA few weeks later, on a rainy morning in Washington, Heritage held a party for the dedication of a new dormitory for its interns, a gift from the family of E.W. Richardson, a World War II bomber pilot who went on to become a successful Ford dealer. Donors ate finger food and drank mimosas under a tent on Heritage\u2019s rooftop. Some wore name tags on their lapels and dresses identifying them by their level of giving; those who had added Heritage to their wills wore an extra ribbon: \u201cLegacy Society.\u201d James was the only person of color I saw in a crowd that easily exceeded 200 people.Forty-five years after its founding, Heritage may finally be the establishment, but its self-image remains fixed in time. It is, as ever, the nation\u2019s last line of defense against the advancing forces of progressivism, perpetually in need of financial reinforcements. Speaking to the gathered group of donors and Heritage staff members, James, standing beside an American flag and a large portrait of Richardson in his flight gear, described the new intern dorm as an expansion of the think tank\u2019s \u201cbase of operations\u201d against what she characterized as a \u201cvery determined and very well-resourced foe. They want to change America into something she was never intended to be. And they might succeed if we don\u2019t fight every single day of our lives.\u201dThe president and his favorite think tank continue to draw closer. Administration officials speak regularly at Heritage and give frequent interviews to The Daily Signal. In April, Pruitt and Attorney General Jeff Sessions were both scheduled to speak at a Heritage donor conference in Palm Beach, Fla. (Sessions, under fire from the president because of the Russia investigation, dropped out.)Even with DeMint gone, Feulner is enjoying unique access to the Trump administration. During one of our conversations, he told me he had recently accompanied the vice president on Air Force Two to Hillsdale College, a Christian stronghold of conservative thought in Michigan. And last year, he was the lone think-tank head invited to a White House dinner for the conservative movement\u2019s \u201cgrass-roots leaders.\u201d He was seated right beside the president. Feulner\u2019s dream had finally been fulfilled. I asked him if he believed the Trump presidency would be transformative for the country. \u201cI think we\u2019re very, very optimistic,\u201d he said.There is still a huge number of vacancies across the administration. At this point in their presidencies, Obama had filled 584 of his politically appointed, Senate-confirmed positions, and George W. Bush had filled 652; Trump has filled just 450. The Presidential Personnel Office was portrayed in a recent Washington Post article as a frat house, with widespread workplace vaping and happy-hour drinking games involving Smirnoff Ice.The turnover rates have also been historic. In March, The New York Times reported that nine of the top 21 White House and cabinet positions have been emptied and refilled at least once; neither Obama nor Bush had lost a single cabinet member by that point in their administrations. Since taking office, Trump has replaced more than half of his 65 most influential advisers, according to a tracker created by the Brookings Institution. Christie recently laid the blame for the turnover on what he described as a \u201cbrutally unprofessional\u201d transition, saying that proper vetting would have caught a lot of Trump\u2019s most problematic appointees. A number of other senior advisers seem to be on shaky ground with the president, and an exodus is anticipated after the November midterm elections.Churn is a central feature of this administration, even for its unofficial staffing agency. Paul Winfree, a Heritage economist who helped draft Trump\u2019s first budget, is back at the think tank. So are Stephen Moore, who worked on the Trump tax cuts; David Kreutzer, who played a key role in dissolving a White House working group that was studying the monetary costs associated with climate-warming carbon dioxide; and Hans von Spakovsky, who helped run the now-defunct voter-fraud commission, which was created to find evidence to support Trump\u2019s baseless claim that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton.In a sense, the transition is still going, and as long as Trump remains in office it may never end. \u201cI get calls from people every day who still want to go in,\u201d Dunlop told me. \u201cOr I\u2019ll hear from the White House, or I\u2019ll run into someone at a reception or over coffee, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ve got a name for you. I\u2019ll send it along.\u2019\u2009\u201dAn earlier version of this article did not fully identify two employees who left the Heritage Foundation soon after the departure of Jim DeMint, its president. They are James Wallner, who was a research executive, and Wesley Denton, who was a communications executive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now, Erdogan Faces Turkey\u2019s Troubled Economy. And He\u2019s Part of the Trouble.", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, all he needs to do is deliver.\u201cHe won on a knife-edge,\u201d said Ugur Gurses, a former banker who writes for the daily newspaper Hurriyet. \u201cBut now he has in his lap all the problems.\u201dMr. Erdogan is contending with an array of economic troubles, an increasingly disgruntled populace and deteriorating relations with Turkey\u2019s Western allies. Among the many problems Mr. Erdogan faces is one fundamental roadblock: His foreign policy is fighting with his economic needs.The economy is Mr. Erdogan\u2019s most pressing problem, but analysts express doubt that he will be able to perform the necessary surgery and introduce needed austerity measures with municipal elections looming in March 2019.\u201cNow the first challenge is the deterioration of the economy, and he has no means, no perspective to change the course of events,\u201d said Kadri Gursel, a columnist for the newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was imprisoned by Mr. Erdogan for 11 months.After years of strong growth, the economy is languishing in recession, economists say, with rising foreign debt levels, double-digit inflation, the sagging lira and paltry levels of foreign investment, compared with past years. An increasing government role in the economy has led to charges of cronyism and corruption, with critics complaining of insiders becoming fabulously wealthy on government contracts and sweetheart deals.As the election results underscored, Mr. Erdogan still maintains the strong backing of the newly prosperous Islamists who were long marginalized under the secular republic founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk; people who, like Mr. Erdogan, as the historian Soner Cagaptay has written, were \u201cborn on the wrong side of the tracks.\u201dThe transfer of power and wealth to those newcomers over the past 15 years represents a transfer of capital that is permanently changing Turkey, said Bekir Agirdir, director of the polling firm Konda.\u201cThe government subsidizes them and they come up and become so successful,\u201d Mr. Agirdir said of the newcomers. \u201cIt is social and political engineering.\u201dAnd while ordinary Turkish citizens are hurting financially, they evidently still trust Mr. Erdogan. Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States said in an interview, \u201cThere is this worry that, \u2018What would happen if Erdogan goes?\u2019 \u201d\u201cThe economy is suffering, there is an issue of performance in some areas, but those were not reflected in the vote,\u201d he added.Economists say Mr. Erdogan needs to cut public spending, including expensive subsidies for gasoline and electricity. Turkey borrowed heavily in recent years on international markets, and now faces a bill of $250 billion a year to finance the debt and the country\u2019s current account, which is also deteriorating. This could force it to seek help from the International Monetary Fund.But few say they think he will take the necessary measures. \u201cErdogan must do a surgical operation on the economy,\u201d Mr. Gurses, the Hurriyet correspondent, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will be able to do it since municipal elections are coming in March 2019, but Turkey cannot sustain the situation any longer.\u201d\u201cThe Turkish economy cannot stay on hold,\u201d he added.In light of the growing economic gloom, it would seemingly behoove Mr. Erdogan to moderate his foreign policy, dialing back the anti-Western policies and language. But he comes across as a prideful man and seems reluctant to back down, especially now that he is relying to some extent on the Nationalist Movement Party, or M.H.P., which preserved Mr. Erdogan\u2019s majority in the Parliament.The leader of that party, Devlet Bahceli, has made it clear that he will demand concessions for his support, and that he will push an agenda that is anti-Syrian, anti-Kurd and anti-Western, at least rhetorically. He has indicated he would not agree to Mr. Erdogan reaching out to any of the opposition parties after the election.Mr. Bahceli\u2019s party is strongly opposed to the presence of over three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, and Mr. Bahceli has said he will push for policies to make them return home. Mr. Bahceli has also supported further operations against Kurdish militants inside Turkey and in neighboring Iraq and Syria.On that issue, Mr. Erdogan promised in his victory speech that he would act decisively against terrorist organizations and work toward liberating more Syrian land from Kurdish militants so that Syrian refugees in Turkey could return home.That is likely to lead to more demands from Turkey for the United States to end its cooperation with Kurdish militias in Syria that it has been using in the fight against the Islamic State.And it bodes ill for the Kurdish minority in Turkey. Even as the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party won representation in the Parliament, crossing the 10 percent threshold, nine party members from the last Parliament remain in jail along with dozens of local political officials and student activists.For now, Turkey\u2019s Western allies seem prepared to give Mr. Erdogan the benefit of the doubt. Going into the NATO summit next month, \u201cat least there will be clarity about the political situation in Turkey,\u201d said Amanda Sloat, who dealt with the country for the State Department during the Obama administration.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s warming relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia remain a potential point of contention, particularly the negotiations with Russia over the S-400 air defense system, problematic for a NATO member.But the Trump administration will not regard the sale as complete until it \u201cphysically takes place,\u201d Ms. Sloat said, and the Turks emphasize that they are also negotiating with an Italian-French military consortium.The NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has already congratulated Mr. Erdogan on his victory, and Ms. Sloat said she expected Washington quickly to follow suit.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s drift toward authoritarianism so strained relations with Europe that he was not welcomed in any European country to campaign among Turkish expatriates, except in Bosnia. And the process for Turkey to become a member of the European Union is at a standstill.Nevertheless, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, said that while the state of Turkey\u2019s democracy had to improve, Mr. Erdogan should be given the chance to do that. At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, she also said that the issues with Turkey\u2019s large Kurdish minority and the country\u2019s economic development were \u201chuge challenges.\u201dAnalysts held out the meager hope that despite an unfair campaign, Turks did vote freely and enthusiastically on Sunday. \u201cWith a turnout of more than 90 percent, and the very high mobilization of the opposition, Turkish society still holds its dynamism,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. \u201cIt gives hope for the future.\u201dSteven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murphy Visits Newark for the Portugal Match. His Guest? Portugal\u2019s Prime Minister.", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 It was barely past noon on Friday, and the Ironbound neighborhood in Newark was already a sea of red and white jerseys. Lines stretched down Ferry Street to get into Iberia, Mompou and other Portuguese restaurants. Red, green and gold garland draped across telephone poles. Portuguese songs blared from an open-air bar.It was game time \u2014 Portugal vs. Spain in a World Cup first-round match \u2014 and all work in the thriving Portuguese enclave essentially stopped.Among those focused on nothing but the game were the prime minister of Portugal, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who came to United States for a celebration of Portuguese culture, and the governor of New Jersey, Philip D. Murphy, who took a brief break from a budget standoff.\u201cThe budget does take priority, let there be no doubt about it,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, adding that he remained confident that a budget deal would be made in time for the end of the World Cup. \u201cI still remain optimistic that you\u2019ll be watching soccer on June 30.\u201dMr. Murphy and Mr. Costa watched the game at Sport Club Portugu\u00eas in Newark, where about 200 fans, fueled by liters of sangria, pints of Portuguese lager and plates of chouri\u00e7o, a Portuguese sausage, cheered raucously behind the politicians assembled in the front row.The governor was noticeably excited as he grabbed a red and green Portugal scarf and draped it around his neck, settling next to Mr. Costa, who was gesticulating with the same exasperated extended arm of a soccer fan whose team just blew a chance, or the same wincing grimace when the opposing team scores.It is a bit of a trope in politics to turn a passion into a political asset, though nothing helps offset the whiff of pandering like a verifiable devotion that brings a sense of authenticity.Chris Christie had Bruce Springsteen. Mr. Murphy has soccer.Never quite the player \u2014 the governor stopped in ninth grade, admitting simply that \u201cI was not good\u201d \u2014 he nevertheless retained an adoration for the game. He is the majority owner of Sky Blue FC, a professional women\u2019s team; a former board member of the U.S. Soccer Foundation; and the father of four soccer players, including his eldest son, who played at Tufts University. Mr. Murphy also attended some 2006 World Cup matches in Germany, and he has been to more than 100 professional matches in Europe.When Mr. Murphy was a newly appointed ambassador to Germany, with no elected or political experience besides serving as finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, he turned to soccer to help forge relationships. Almost every week, he found himself in the stands at a professional match.\u201cAngela Merkel is a big soccer fan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was something we knew we could find common ground in. When you\u2019re overseas, the assumption is that the American isn\u2019t going to be a deep, well-versed fan.\u201dMr. Costa was clearly an equal, if not more exuberant, soccer fanatic. Just before the start of the match, he held up his smartphone, attempting to take a selfie with the crowd, which erupted into syncopated chants \u2014 \u201cPor-tu-gal! Por-tu-gal!\u201d \u2014 with arms extended.\u201cI\u2019ve come back to share the pleasure and the suffering of this game with our community,\u201d Mr. Costa said at halftime. (At that moment it was pleasure, since Portugal led, 2-1.) He said he would be heading to Russia to watch Portugal\u2019s third match in the first round, but had decided to come to Newark for the first.It was the first time Mr. Murphy had hosted a foreign head of government in New Jersey, and the two talked the requisite business. After all, this was meant to be about work and not merely a chance for two soccer die-hards to watch one of the most anticipated of the early World Cup matches.They talked about potential trade (there was a discussion about how they could expand trade in the \u201clogistics economy,\u201d Mr. Murphy said). They talked politics (\u201che asked me my sense of the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Murphy said). And they talked about President Trump (Mr. Costa said he would not be visiting the White House).But, mostly, they talked soccer.\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think if I wanted to talk about business we could get much done,\u201d Mr. Murphy said with a laugh as he glanced over at a transfixed Mr. Costa, who was leaning on one knee and nervously chewing on his index finger as Spain repeatedly threatened to score midway through the second half.Then disaster struck. Nacho Fernandez, a defender on Spain\u2019s team, unleashed a long shot from about 25 yards that caromed off the post and into the net, giving Spain a late 3-2 lead. (The match ended in a 3-3 tie.)\u201cGoalie had no chance,\u201d Mr. Costa said to Mr. Murphy, sighing and leaning far back in his chair.\u201cNo chance,\u201d Mr. Murphy repeated. He glanced over at his three sons a few seats away, eyebrows raised and clearly impressed by the skillful volley.He sat back in his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful game.\u201d\u201cI also said to them, \u2018Hey, listen, no one is asking me to say this, don\u2019t worry about the politics in America,\u2019\u201d he recalled, adding later that the Trump administration should be credited for its efforts to win the World Cup. \u201cWhen it comes to soccer and this tournament, we\u2019ll figure this out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Candidate for Georgia Governor Bought Condo From Lobbyist", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 The leading Republican candidate in Georgia\u2019s high-profile governor\u2019s race, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, bought a condominium in downtown Atlanta 10 years ago from a State Capitol lobbyist, seemingly at a discount, a New York Times investigation has found.Real estate records show that Mr. Cagle, who faces a runoff for the Republican nomination on July 24, purchased the one-bedroom apartment at 24 percent less than its appraised value \u2014 below comparable sales prices \u2014 and sold it last year at a 29 percent profit. He was preparing for his first run for governor when, without an agent, he negotiated the deal with Terry E. Hobbs, a longtime lobbyist who represents the natural gas marketer Scana.Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, a government watchdog group, said that such cozy relationships raised suspicions of pay-to-play.\u201cLobbyists and elected officials should never be involved in business deals together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives the impression that the lobbyist and their interests will find favor with that official when it comes to awarding contracts and determining public policy that might financially benefit them.\u201dIn a telephone interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Cagle said that the deal did not show bad judgment, and that Mr. Hobbs had not lobbied him on any issue near the time of the sale.\u201cLet me just be very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a legitimate transaction, a purchase of real estate that was a willing buyer and a willing seller that had nothing to do with anything other than a willing buyer and a willing seller.\u201dMr. Cagle noted that the sale took place in an era of high volatility for real estate valuations, and disputed that his purchase price was out of line. He also argued that if it posed an ethical problem to enter a business transaction with a lobbyist, the same \u201cridiculous\u201d logic could extend to consuming products sold by industries with state interests. \u201cSo I can no longer purchase a car from someone who has representation at the gold dome, right?\u201d he asked, referring to Georgia\u2019s gilded Capitol.Mr. Cagle, who has been lieutenant governor for nearly 12 years, finished first in a crowded Republican primary last month but now faces a worrisome challenge from Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brian Kemp. The winner advances to a November general election against Stacey Abrams, a Democratic state representative who is drawing national attention and money as the first African-American woman to win a major party\u2019s nomination for governor.The contest is seen as an important gauge of how quickly states like Georgia, with growing minority and immigrant voting strength, could shift from red toward blue. It may also provide clues about the cohesion of President Trump\u2019s coalition in a Southern state that is both urban and rural, and about whether Democrats can win in the region by tacking left to energize their base.Although both men promote their business acumen, they are each worth less than when they took statewide office. Mr. Kemp, who has interests in agriculture and real estate, reported a net worth of $5.2 million on his financial disclosure last year, down from $6.3 million in 2009. Mr. Cagle, who earns about $91,000 as lieutenant governor, reported a worth of $1.58 million, down from $1.74 million in 2005.The Times\u2019s examination of Mr. Cagle\u2019s real estate holdings suggests he has consistently overstated their value in his disclosure filings.For instance, he bought Mr. Hobbs\u2019s condominium, on the 12th floor of a 55-year-old high-rise called the Landmark, for $97,000 in 2008. But in both his 2009 and 2013 disclosures he valued it at $175,000, well above its county appraisal. By 2011, with Atlanta\u2019s real estate market in a deep slump, Fulton County assessors had dropped their appraisal as low as $44,900 before it started to rebound. Mr. Cagle sold the unit last year for $125,000.He bought a second Atlanta apartment in 2008 for $65,500 but valued it at $130,000 on his 2009 disclosure report. He sold it four years later to a family friend for $40,000, roughly its appraised value at the time.In four quadrennial disclosure reports starting in 2005, the increase in Mr. Cagle\u2019s self-valuations relative to actual purchase prices had the effect of inflating his stated net worth by between 26 percent and 91 percent.Mr. Cagle said that improvements made to each of his real estate investments accounted for the increased valuations on his disclosure reports. But he could not explain why, in the case of the Landmark condo, his valuations remained high even after its appraised value plummeted.The lieutenant governor said he bought the apartment to house his three sons as they attended nearby Georgia State University. He said he liked the Landmark\u2019s location, posted a notice in the lobby and got a response from Mr. Hobbs. \u201cHe said he had a unit, take a look at it,\u201d Mr. Cagle said. \u201cI did and I said, \u2018What\u2019s your price?\u2019 He said, \u201897,000,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I\u2019ll take it.\u2019\u201dThe apartment had been appraised for four years at $127,800 by the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors, according to county records. It remained at that level in 2009 even as the recession battered Georgia real estate.Mr. Cagle pointed to other one-bedroom apartments that had sold for $2,000 less and $11,500 more than his. \u201cI am well within the range of what the value was,\u201d he said. But property records reveal those units are much smaller.Campaign finance records show that Mr. Hobbs has donated about $240,000 to Georgia candidates, including nearly $12,000 to Mr. Cagle and $1,700 to Mr. Kemp. In 2008, shortly before selling the Landmark condo to Mr. Cagle, he reported spending $1,500 during the three-month legislative session to stock a \u201chospitality room\u201d there for legislators.Reached by telephone, Mr. Hobbs, who has been a registered lobbyist in Georgia at least since 2006, acknowledged selling the property to Mr. Cagle but declined further comment.\u201cYou have all the records there, and I have no interest in talking to the press about anything, thank you,\u201d he said before hanging up.Agustin Armendariz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Ruling Delivers a Sharp Blow to Labor Unions", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court dealt a major blow on Wednesday to organized labor. By a 5-to-4 vote, with the more conservative justices in the majority, the court ruled that government workers who choose not to join unions may not be required to help pay for collective bargaining.Forcing those workers to finance union activity violated the First Amendment, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority. \u201cWe conclude that this arrangement violates the free speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern,\u201d he wrote.\u201cWe recognize that the loss of payments from nonmembers may cause unions to experience unpleasant transition costs in the short term, and may require unions to make adjustments in order to attract and retain members,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. \u201cBut we must weigh these disadvantages against the considerable windfall that unions have received\u201d over the years.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch joined the majority opinion, which overruled a four-decade-old precedent.Justice Elena Kagan summarized her dissent from the bench, a sign of profound disagreement.\u201cThere is no sugarcoating today\u2019s opinion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe majority overthrows a decision entrenched in this nation\u2019s law \u2014 and in its economic life \u2014 for over 40 years.\u201d\u201cAs a result,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit prevents the American people, acting through their state and local officials, from making important choices about workplace governance. And it does so by weaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.\u201dJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor joined the dissent.The majority based its ruling on the First Amendment, saying that requiring payments to unions that negotiate with the government forces workers to endorse political messages that may be at odds with their beliefs.Unions say that reasoning is flawed. Nonmembers are already entitled to refunds of payments spent on political activities, like advertising to support a political candidate.Collective bargaining is different, the unions say, and workers should not be free to reap the benefits of such bargaining without paying their fair share of the costs.The decision could encourage many workers perfectly happy with their unions\u2019 work to make the economically rational decision to opt out of paying for it.President Trump took to Twitter to praise the decision, saying it would be a \u201cbig loss for the coffers of the Democrats!\u201dThe new case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, No. 16-1466, was brought by Mark Janus, a child support specialist who works for the state government in Illinois. He sued the union, saying he did not agree with its positions and should not be forced to pay fees to support its work.The nation\u2019s highest court faced a far-reaching list of cases that renewed its central role in American life.The new decision struck down an Illinois law that required government workers who chose not to join a union to \u201cpay their proportionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.\u201d More than 20 states have laws that require such \u201cagency fees.\u201dAccording to Justice Alito, workers like Mr. Janus were charged about 78 percent of the dues paid by members of the union.\u201cAbood was poorly reasoned,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. \u201cIt has led to practical problems and abuse. It is inconsistent with other First Amendment cases and has been undermined by more recent decisions.\u201dThe distinction drawn in the Abood case \u2014 between a union\u2019s political spending and other activities \u2014 is untenable and unworkable, Justice Alito added. Taken together, he said, these factors justified a departure from the principle of stare decisis, Latin for \u201cto stand by things decided.\u201dJustice Alito wrote that \u201clabor peace\u201d did not justify the compelled payments allowed by the Abood decision, saying that there was \u201cno evidence that the pandemonium it imagined would result if agency fees were not allowed.\u201dFree riding may be the wrong metaphor, Justice Alito added. Mr. Janus \u201cstrenuously objects to this free-rider label,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. \u201cHe argues that he is not a free rider on a bus headed for a destination that he wishes to reach but is more like a person shanghaied for an unwanted voyage.\u201dIn dissent, Justice Kagan wrote that \u201cthe majority subverts all known principles of stare decisis.\u201dCiting earlier majority opinions from Justice Alito that paved the way for Wednesday\u2019s ruling, she said the supposed erosion of legal support for Abood was a \u201cbootstrapping.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t like a decision?\u201d Justice Kagan wrote. \u201cJust throw some gratuitous criticisms into a couple of opinions and a few years later point to them as \u2018special justifications\u2019 \u201d for overruling a precedent.\u201cThe majority,\u201d Justice Kagan wrote, \u201chas overruled Abood for no exceptional or special reason, but because it never liked the decision. It has overruled Abood because it wanted to.\u201dMore broadly, she wrote, the decision was one of several in which conservatives have misused the Constitution\u2019s free speech protections to achieve political ends. \u201cThe First Amendment was meant for better things,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt was meant not to undermine but to protect democratic governance \u2014 including over the role of public-sector unions.\u201dJustice Alito wrote that unions have survived in settings where compelled payments from nonmembers are not required. Only 27 percent of federal workers, for instance are members of a union, he wrote.Justice Kagan responded that the analogy to Illinois and other states was inapt. \u201cFirst,\u201d she wrote, \u201cmany fewer federal employees pay dues than have voted for a union to represent them, indicating that free-riding in fact pervades the federal sector. And second, that sector is not typical of other public workforces. Bargaining in the federal sphere is limited; most notably, it does not extend to wages and benefits.\u201dWednesday\u2019s ruling was not likely to be particularly disruptive, Justice Alito wrote, \u201cbecause public-sector collective-bargaining agreements are generally of rather short duration.\u201dJustice Kagan disputed that. \u201cThe majority undoes bargains reached all over the country,\u201d Justice Kagan wrote, adding that the decision \u201cwreaks havoc on entrenched legislative and contractual arrangements.\u201dIn New York City alone, she wrote, 144 contracts with 97 public-sector unions call for agency fees and will have to be renegotiated.The decision is unlikely to have a direct effect on unionized employees of private businesses, because the First Amendment restricts government action and not private conduct. But unions now represent only 6.5 percent of private sector employees, down from the upper teens in the early 1980s, and most of the labor movement\u2019s strength these days is in the public sector.Wednesday\u2019s ruling contained a final blow for public unions, saying that workers must affirmatively agree to support them.\u201cNeither an agency fee nor any other payment to the union may be deducted from a nonmember\u2019s wages, nor may any other attempt be made to collect such a payment, unless the employee affirmatively consents to pay,\u201d Justice Alito wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearing Wrath of Trump, Republicans Back Down on Free Trade", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 They have issued concerned news releases and sent solemn tweets. But when it came time to stand up to President Trump on tariffs this week, Senate Republicans took a pass, casting aside the party\u2019s long-held commitment to free trade for fear of poking the bear.At least that is how Senator Bob Corker interpreted the outcome of the intraparty fight over how to combat Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.\u201cGosh, we might poke the bear,\u201d Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is retiring, said with fake outrage as he laced into his colleagues for disavowing their beliefs on trade because they are scared of the president and the prospect of losing power.The decision by Republican leaders this week to block a vote on Mr. Corker\u2019s amendment to an annual defense policy bill that would have required the president to get congressional approval to impose tariffs on national security grounds was something of a watershed. Republican leaders maintained that the measure would have created procedural issues that could jeopardize the underlying defense policy bill. They privately called Mr. Corker\u2019s reaction hyperbolic, and other Republicans said they would continue to make their differences with the president clear.But the amendment\u2019s defeat, without a vote tallied, was a setback for a core Republican principle, and it played out in public on the Senate floor, underscoring just how far most congressional Republicans would go to avoid confronting Mr. Trump ahead of the November midterm elections. The increasingly lonely forces of opposition within the party are coming from those who are leaving politics or those in the chattering classes safely removed from a Republican electorate overwhelmingly aligned with the president.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that leadership in general is wary of doing anything that might upset the president,\u201d Mr. Corker said on Wednesday, describing his party\u2019s following of Mr. Trump as \u201ccultish.\u201dOther Republicans were equally deflated on Wednesday, but the path forward was not clear. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, is reluctant to put forward legislation that Mr. Trump does not support because he does not want to waste time making Republican senators take difficult votes ahead of a possible veto.\u201cIt\u2019s terribly disappointing,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who helped write the Corker trade amendment. He added: \u201cWe are the Senate. We\u2019re not potted plants. We should be doing what we think is right.\u201dDouglas Holtz-Eakin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and president of the conservative American Action Forum, said the Republican trade rebellion collapsed because the party is genuinely divided on the issue these days \u2014 and laying bare those divisions would not help Republican election prospects. The fear of a seething presidential tweet has left some in the party paralyzed.\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to pick a place to make a stand, and they haven\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.One area where many Republicans are continuing to hold strong against Mr. Trump is national security. While they have buckled on trade, the next test will be whether Republicans will dare Mr. Trump to veto the defense policy bill over ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications company.Senate Republicans have joined Democrats to include in the defense measure an amendment that would restore harsh penalties on ZTE for violating American sanctions that the Trump administration has moved to lift. If it makes it to the president\u2019s desk, the provision would undercut the settlement that the Commerce Department reached with the company this month that essentially threw it a lifeline at the request of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping.The White House on Wednesday signaled that it would try to strip that amendment out when House and Senate negotiators hash out a final National Defense Authorization Act.\u201cThe administration will work with Congress to ensure the final N.D.A.A. conference report respects the separation of powers,\u201d Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said, insisting that the new agreement makes ZTE pay for its violations and gives the government sufficient oversight of the company to protect the United States.Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who has been a vocal advocate of the Senate\u2019s approach, said the White House was entitled to its opinion, but he stood firm.\u201cZTE poses a significant national security threat to U.S. telecommunications, and we shouldn\u2019t be doing anything that allows them to stay in business,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Consternation over ZTE has created bipartisan backlash against Mr. Trump, and lawmakers have been more willing to defy him on national security issues than trade disputes.\u201cZTE combines two potent issues: economic security with China plus national security,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cBoth China trade policy and national security have broad and deep support in both parties.\u201dTrump administration officials have argued that the president is using the threat of tariffs and showing flexibility over ZTE as part of a broader strategy to overhaul America\u2019s trade deals, reorient commerce with China and strike a peace agreement with North Korea. His Republican allies in Congress contend that he should have the space to maneuver.\u201cI\u2019m tired of senators trying to undercut President Trump at every turn, especially in the middle of a negotiating process,\u201d Senator David Perdue, a conservative Georgian and ally of Mr. Trump, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.He moved on Wednesday afternoon to strip the ZTE provision from the defense bill, only to be blocked.While Republicans appear ready to swallow their worries about trade for the moment, an all-out trade war could restore their nerve. Breaking with the president has its risks, but rattled financial markets and slower economic growth are also problematic in an election year.Mr. Trump could roll out more tariffs on China as soon as this week, and countries are preparing to hit back with tariffs of their own on American products, from Kentucky bourbon to Harley-Davidsons.Next Wednesday, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, will hold a hearing on the tariffs and question Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, about their potential harm to American consumers.After a meeting at the Capitol with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, warned that her country had retaliatory tariffs ready to be unleashed on July 1. She said that Canada was rolling them out more in sorrow than in anger and that she hoped retaliation could be avoided.\u201cThe answer is very simple: The United States has to remove these unfair illegal tariffs from Canada,\u201d Ms. Freeland said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeing the Light in Waterfront Brooklyn ", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe huntTired of the \u201cdark, shoebox-style walk-ups\u201d in their old neighborhood, a couple of young Manhattanites find a home in a factory conversion in Dumbo. For three years, Emma Sisti and Gaj Manamperi lived in convenient proximity, 10 minutes apart. She was in the East Village and he on the Lower East Side, each sharing a rental with a revolving cast of roommates. Last summer, the couple decided to find a place together, preferably a one-bedroom for $3,000 to $3,500 a month. After living in a tiny room overlooking a courtyard with trash cans, Ms. Sisti craved light. \u201cI killed a cactus in my bedroom within three weeks,\u201d she said.She wanted a normal kitchen, too, with real appliances rather than miniature versions. In her rental, she said, \u201ceverything was shrunk down. You couldn\u2019t cook without setting off the fire alarm. If you opened the window, it would let in this gust of air directly next to the burners, which at one point set our cabinets on fire.\u201dMr. Manamperi, 29, a native of Sydney, Australia, wanted to remain downtown. But he learned that the predominant housing stock in their part of town was \u201cdark, shoebox-style walk-ups,\u201d with layouts that Ms. Sisti deemed \u201ccramped and weird.\u201d One exception was a one-bedroom rental in a 1988 condominium building, offered furnished at $3,950 a month. It included a wall of shelves in the living room and a small balcony. \u201cThat apartment was a work of art,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. The price had fallen from $5,000 two months earlier. The couple thought they could negotiate further or pay in advance, but their offer of $3,600 was declined. They realized they would have to look elsewhere for the space and price they wanted. A large and charming one-bedroom on West 72nd Street was available for $3,100. The tenant was breaking the lease mid-month and wanted someone to move in immediately. The couple felt pressured to make a quick decision.\u201cHe was trying to make us cover the difference for the rest of the month,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. \u201cOn principle, I felt that burden should fall on the lease-breaker.\u201d They decided against it. Two blocks away, they found another spacious one-bedroom in a prewar condominium building for $3,200 a month. It was beautifully renovated, with two exposures. But it came with a broker fee, and the lease was for only a year. The couple feared the rent would rise or the lease wouldn\u2019t be renewed and they would have to move again. Mr. Manamperi had been noticing concessions for renters, like waived broker fees and a free month or two of rent, and he wanted a similar deal. This one, however, came with a fee of close to $5,000, which \u201cwas contrary to everything I had been reading about,\u201d he said. They told themselves that such exorbitant fees came with the territory and submitted an application, leaving (and later losing) a $150 application fee. \u201cWe should have been overjoyed, but for some reason we weren\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. Mr. Manamperi continued checking StreetEasy, and up popped a listing for a factory conversion in Dumbo, Brooklyn. Ms. Sisti had thought Brooklyn would be too far to commute. But Dumbo was just a few more stops on the F train. As they arrived in the waterfront neighborhood, they immediately recognized the view, with the Manhattan Bridge looming in the background.\u201cSomeone told me it\u2019s the most Instagrammed view in all of New York,\u201d Mr. Manamperi said. They saw a one-bedroom with a full-size kitchen and plenty of light. It even had a washer-dryer. It wasn\u2019t huge \u2014 just under 600 square feet \u2014 but no space was wasted. \u201cI think we were sold from the moment we set foot in the neighborhood,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. They rented the apartment for a little more than $3,500 and arrived late last summer. There was no fee, and they received one free month of rent on a 24-month lease. Plants now line their sunny windowsills. \u201cPeople have gifted us cacti,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. They also use the building\u2019s rooftop, even if the noise from passing trains makes conversation difficult. \u201cThe view is so spectacular,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. \u201cIt is better than any rooftop I\u2019ve ever been on.\u201d The situation on the ground is not quite as ideal. They still buy their groceries in Manhattan, and Mr. Manamperi takes his shirts to a dry cleaner in Brooklyn Heights. \u201cEverything in Dumbo tends to have a premium,\u201d he said. Even the jumbo hot dogs from the cart outside are $7 apiece. \u201cIt\u2019s exorbitant,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. \u201cIn Midtown, they are pretty cheap, like $3. I love a good hot dog.\u201dThe couple are amused by the parade of sightseers outside, snapping those Instagram photos. \u201cWhen the tourists are gone in the evening, it is serene,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. \u201cWe get a lot of entertainment out of watching people pose. There are a lot of wedding parties.\u201dTheirs will be one of them. Their own wedding is scheduled for next spring at the Dumbo Loft on Water Street. \u201cThis neighborhood is so beautiful,\u201d Ms. Sisti said. \u201cWhy would we leave?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Yield Curve? \u2018A Powerful Signal of Recessions\u2019 Has Wall Street\u2019s Attention", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou can try to play down a trade war with China. You can brush off the impact of rising oil prices on corporate earnings.But if you\u2019re in the business of making economic predictions, it has become very difficult to disregard an important signal from the bond market.The so-called yield curve is perilously close to predicting a recession \u2014 something it has done before with surprising accuracy \u2014 and it\u2019s become a big topic on Wall Street.Terms like \u201cyield curve\u201d can be mind-numbing if you\u2019re not a bond trader, but the mechanics, practical impact and psychology of it are fairly straightforward. Here\u2019s what the fuss is all about.The yield curve is basically the difference between interest rates on short-term United States government bonds, say, two-year Treasury notes, and long-term government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes.Typically, when an economy seems in good health, the rate on the longer-term bonds will be higher than short-term ones. The extra interest is to compensate, in part, for the risk that strong economic growth could set off a broad rise in prices, known as inflation. Lately, though, long-term bond yields have been stubbornly slow to rise \u2014 which suggests traders are concerned about long-term growth \u2014 even as the economy shows plenty of vitality.At the same time, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates, so the yield curve has been \u201cflattening.\u201d In other words, the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates is shrinking.The gap between two-year and 10-year United States Treasury notes is roughly 0.34 percentage points. It was last at these levels in 2007 when the United States economy was heading into what was arguably the worst recession in almost 80 years.As scary as references to the financial crisis sound, flattening alone does not mean that the United States is doomed to slip into another recession. But if it keeps moving in this direction, eventually long-term interest rates will fall below short-term rates.When that happens, the yield curve has \u201cinverted.\u201d An inversion is seen as \u201ca powerful signal of recessions,\u201d as the president of the New York Fed, John Williams, said this year, and that\u2019s what everyone is watching for.Even if it hasn\u2019t happened yet, the move in that direction has Wall Street\u2019s attention.\u201cFor economists, of course it\u2019s always been traditionally a very good signal of directionality of the economy,\u201d said Sonja Gibbs, senior director of capital markets at the Institute of International Finance. \u201cThat\u2019s why everyone is bemoaning the flattening of the yield curve.\u201dSure, it seems like a strange time to be worried about recession. Unemployment is at an 18-year low, corporate investment is picking up steam, and consumer spending shows signs of rebounding.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see what\u2019s going to goose the economy further from these levels,\u201d Ms. Gibbs said.And the financial markets can sometimes sniff out problems with the economy before they show up in the official economic snapshots published on G.D.P. and unemployment. Another notable yield curve inversion occurred in February 2000, just before the stock market\u2019s dot-com bubble burst.In that sense, the government bond market isn\u2019t alone. Stocks have been in a sideways struggle since the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index last peaked on Jan. 26. Returns on corporate bonds are negative, as are some key commodities tied to industrial activity.An important caveat to the predictive power of the yield curve is that it can\u2019t predict precisely when a recession will begin. In the past the recession has come in as little as six months, or as long as two years, after the inversion, the San Francisco Fed\u2019s researchers note.In other words, there\u2019s a reason to look at the yield curve skeptically, despite its prowess at predicting recessions.As in all market moves, perceptions of its significance mean the yield curve can sometimes become a feedback loop.If enough investors begin to grow concerned about a recession, they will most likely put more and more money into the safety of long-term government bonds. That buying binge would likely help flatten, or invert, the yield curve.Then people will write articles about the curve\u2019s sending a stronger signal on recession. And that could, in turn, drive even more people to buy into long-term bonds. Rinse. Repeat.But it\u2019s not just psychology. The yield curve helps determine some of the decisions that are the most crucial to the health of the American economy.Specifically, the flattening yield curve makes banking, which is basically the business of borrowing money at short-term rates and lending it at long-term rates, less profitable. And if the yield curve inverts, it means lending money becomes a losing proposition.Either way, the flow of lending is likely to be curtailed. And in the United States, where borrowed money is the lifeblood of economic activity, that can slam the brakes on economic growth.There is an argument to be made against reading too much into the yield curve\u2019s moves \u2014 and it hangs on the idea that, rather than the free market, central banks have had a big influence on both the long-term and short-term rates.Since the last recession, central banks bought trillions of dollars of government bonds as they tried to push long-term interest rates lower in order to lend a helping hand to the economy.Even though they\u2019re reversing course now, central banks still own massive amounts of those bonds, and that may be keeping long-term interest rates lower than they would otherwise be.Also, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates since December 2015 and has indicated it will keep doing so this year.So if long-term rates were pushed lower by central bank bond buying, and now short-term rates are being pushed higher as the Fed tightens its monetary policy, the yield curve has nowhere to go but flatter.\u201cIn the current environment, I think it\u2019s a less reliable indicator than it has been in the past,\u201d said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Era of American Complacency on Trade Is Over", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Navarro is\u00a0assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy.It\u2019s time for our major trading partners \u2014 from strategic competitors like China to key members of the Group of 7 \u2014 to realize that the era of American complacency in the international marketplace is over. Going forward, President Trump will pursue two goals on behalf of the American nation and people.First, trade must be not only free but also fair and reciprocal. American tariffs are among the lowest in the world. Our generosity and free market good will has only led to a huge trade deficit and the transfer of wealth abroad.Second, President Trump reserves the right to defend those industries critical to our own national security. To do this, the United States has imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. While critics may question how these metal tariffs can be imposed in the name of national security on allies and neighbors like Canada, they miss the fundamental point: These tariffs are not aimed at any one country. They are a defensive measure to ensure the domestic viability of two of the most important industries necessary for United States military and civilian production at times of crisis so that the United States can defend itself as well as its allies.Neither of these goals of the Trump presidency should stand in the way of our longstanding and productive strategic alliances and economic relationships with members of the Group of 7. There will continue to be a strong need to cooperate on issues of mutual interest, including defending democracy and freedom against authoritarianism, and protecting our citizens from terrorism. This also means we should find common ground on fair and reciprocal trade in ways that favor market economics, lower trade barriers and are mutually beneficial to workers across the Group of 7 nations.President Trump welcomes continuing dialogue and cooperation with Group of 7 members and our other allies and trading partners. But the days of accepting unfair trade practices are over.Peter Navarro is assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s ZTE, Saved by U.S., Has a Checkered Past and Shaky Future", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese electronics maker ZTE has survived its brush with death. Now it has to figure out how to stay in business.It will also need to confront deeper questions about its way of doing business, which has left a trail of accusations of bribery, overbilling and rule-breaking.\u201cEven with the ban lifted, operators will think twice about bringing them in, no matter what sorts of measures are taken from a transparency or compliance perspective,\u201d said Bengt Nordstrom, chief executive of the telecom consultancy Northstream.Officials in China made rescuing ZTE a top priority during recent trade talks with Washington. The Trump administration gave the company a second chance in order to help cool tensions with Beijing ahead of a summit meeting next week with North Korea\u2019s leader.But the accusations of wrongdoing by ZTE \u2014 a previously little-known manufacturer that became an unlikely political football, then an even unlikelier object of sympathy for President Trump \u2014 speak to a broader issue for China.Chinese companies are going global in force, in areas as varied as construction, entertainment and railways. But the country\u2019s leaders want to foster national champions, brand names known worldwide for quality.A reputation for flouting the rules, combined with national security fears about high-tech products from China, does not help that effort.Violations of trade controls on Iran and North Korea were what got ZTE in trouble with the United States Department of Commerce. As part of the deal on Thursday, the company will replace its board and senior leadership. Compliance officers will be installed within the company and will report to Washington. ZTE did not respond to a request for comment.Zambia ended a contract with ZTE in 2013, after finding that an auction had not taken place, leading to suspicions that the project\u2019s costs had been inflated. In the Philippines, the company was accused in 2007 of bribing officials including the country\u2019s president at the time. (The corruption case against the president was later dropped because of a lack of evidence.)It has other issues in the United States, too. American officials have for years voiced concerns that ZTE equipment may be used by the Chinese government for espionage or network disruption, an allegation also leveled against the firm\u2019s main Chinese rival, Huawei.ZTE executives are hoping to move past at least one aspect of their fraught relationship with Washington. On Friday, in a letter to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times, the company\u2019s chairman, Yin Yimin, apologized for what he called \u201cproblems\u201d in the company\u2019s culture and management.\u201cOur executives and employees must reflect on this incident, absorb the lessons and earnestly hold ourselves to account to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,\u201d wrote Mr. Yin, who took his post last year.Today, with the development of the next wave of wireless technology, or 5G, both ZTE and Huawei are playing a major role in shaping global standards and preparing new equipment. ZTE\u2019s ability to be a leading 5G player now looks shaky, however.\u201cIn 5G, ZTE has successfully pushed themselves to the forefront with primary research and development,\u201d said Chris Lane, a telecom analyst in Hong Kong with Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cCarriers were considering using them, and that\u2019s clearly gone now.\u201dThis week\u2019s deal with Washington is the latest step in the long, tortuous narrative of ZTE\u2019s dealings in Iran.According to the Commerce Department, the company used American-sourced technology to build and maintain telecom networks there, employing seemingly independent businesses to dodge United States sanctions.After officials began investigating, ZTE falsely told government agents that it had already stopped shipments to Iran, according to United States authorities. It asked a team of employees to destroy materials related to the Iran business, the agency said. It even made plans to resume shipments to Iran while the investigation was underway, the agency said.But in March this year, ZTE told the Commerce Department that it had previously made false statements about what it had done to discipline employees involved in the Iran violations. The agency then ordered that American companies be banned from selling technology to ZTE for seven years.The pattern of falsehoods, the order said, was \u201cindicative of a company incapable of being, or unwilling to be, a reliable and trustworthy recipient of U.S.-origin goods, software and technology.\u201d Additional financial penalties were \u201cunlikely to lead to the company\u2019s reform,\u201d the department said.The financial penalty announced this week \u2014 $1 billion plus $400 million held in escrow \u2014 sets a record for civil and criminal penalties in a sanctions case, according to the agency.While mobile carriers in many countries may now be wary of buying from ZTE, that might not be the case in China, where the company makes most of its money.\u201cChinese carriers will be less sensitive, because they are state enterprises,\u201d said Edison Lee, a telecom analyst at Jefferies in Hong Kong. \u201cThey follow the government\u2019s \u2018Buy China\u2019 policy.\u201dStill, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Chinese government can help them again if they don\u2019t behave.\u201d\u201cMore and more Chinese companies have gone overseas in recent years, but once they are abroad, the key is to take it upon themselves to fully understand international standards and laws,\u201d the article says. \u201cPowerful as the motherland may be, companies still need to handle their own issues.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed reporting from Beijing, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Safe Haven for Giacometti\u2019s Restored Studio", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In December 1926, the young Alberto Giacometti moved into a small rented studio at 46, rue Hippolyte-Maindron, in the 14th Arrondissement of Paris. In that tiny ground-floor space, less than 300 square feet, poorly lit and for decades without running water, he produced masterpieces of modern art.After Giacometti died at age 64 in 1966, his studio was repossessed by the landlord, but not before Annette, his wife, had removed all of its contents including the studio\u2019s paint- and plaster-splattered walls.Now, about 52 years after the death of the artist, that studio is getting a permanent new home.When the Giacometti Institute opens its doors on June 21, the reconstituted atelier will be the centerpiece of the site\u2019s exhibition space, which the Fondation Alberto et Annette Giacometti plans to use as a vitrine for its collection of the artist\u2019s works.\u201cThe opening of the Giacometti Institute will be a milestone and a moving moment for us at the foundation,\u201d said Catherine Grenier, its director, in an interview in Paris. \u201cIt will be the first time the public will see the studio with its original walls and some of the last pieces Giacometti was working on just before he died.\u201d\u201cThe connection between the two artists is not stylistic; it is in their mutual obsession with the human form, the portrait, the pictorial space and their opposition to abstraction,\u201d Sam Keller, the director of Fondation Beyeler, said at the show\u2019s opening in April.\u201cThough Giacometti had lived in Paris for 30 years, recognition for his work first came from abroad, and particularly from the U.S., where most of his important collectors were,\u201d Ms. Grenier wrote in \u201cAlberto Giacometti,\u201d her biography of the artist.The foundation\u2019s extraordinary collection of Giacometti\u2019s work, the world\u2019s largest, includes around 350 mostly plaster sculptures, 90 paintings, more than 2,000 drawings and etchings, about 2,000 photographs, and extensive archives, all of which Giacometti had managed to keep in his studio and in a small storage space nearby.For the first time, the public will see many fragile or previously damaged pieces, including a painted plaster version of the delicate and stringy \u201cFemme Assise\u201d (\u201cSeated Woman\u201d), to be exhibited behind glass.\u201cMany pieces are so fragile that they tremble when you walk by them,\u201d Ms. Grenier said. \u201cThey are too delicate to travel and will remain here in our permanent collection.\u201dThe institute will also make its archives available to researchers interested in exploring themes around what Ms. Grenier called \u201cthe School of Modernities,\u201d namely the movements of the early 20th century that made Paris so attractive to foreign artists like Giacometti, who was Swiss, but also Picasso, Modigliani and Brancusi, many of whom lived in the same Montparnasse neighborhood.\u201cWe wanted the institute to be in Giacometti\u2019s old stomping ground,\u201d Ms. Grenier said. \u201cHe spent most of his life in this area, frequenting local hangouts like Le D\u00f4me, Le Select and La Coupole,\u201d she said. \u201cHis friend Simone de Beauvoir lived on this street. She came by the studio often, sometimes to bring hand-me-downs to Annette.\u201dAbout a mile from the original studio, the institute will occupy 3,770 square feet on the ground level and first floor of an Art Deco building at 5, rue Victor Schoelcher, in Montparnasse. Just down the street is the Fondation Cartier Pour l\u2019Art Contemporain, a private art center owned by the famed Parisian jeweler. Over the opposite wall is the Montparnasse Cemetery, where a number of Giacometti\u2019s friends, including de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, who share a tomb, are buried.Before the foundation acquired the site, the institute space was the showroom of the French decorator Paul Follot, a figure of the Art Deco movement. Unused and rundown since the end of World War II, it was renovated by the French architects Pascal Grasso and Pierre-Antoine Gatier.The building\u2019s facade and parts of its interior were protected by historic status, \u201cwhich made it challenging to create public access without altering the original structure,\u201d Mr. Grasso said.\u201cTo protect the structure, all of our installations were set away from the walls and are dismountable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe space had to be both respectful of its own history and give a real identity to the Institut.\u201dTo finance the 4.5 million euros (about $5.3 million) necessary to purchase and outfit the space, the foundation sold a 1954 Joan Mir\u00f3 painting titled \u201cPeinture,\u201d given by the artist to Giacometti. It sold for $12.2 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in London in 2015.\u201cWe will continue to explore the echoes of Giacometti\u2019s influence in the work of contemporary artists,\u201d Ms. Grenier said.Advertisement"}

What does a country owe to those it\u2019s discriminated against \u2014 and what are the best ways to move forward toward true equality and unity?The goal of these discussions \u2014 and all the events that our Australia bureau has been involved with \u2014 is to extend The New York Times journalism experience beyond the page or screen; and to broaden and personalize our coverage of important topics that matter to Australia and the world.A lot of work goes into these efforts, for our small bureau and our partners, so this week I figured I\u2019d open up the process and share a few of the articles and essays that we\u2019re reading and sharing as we prepare.What\u2019s below is by no means a comprehensive reading list; it\u2019s quite abbreviated, in fact, and errs toward the current, the varied and toward word counts that can be consumed in a single sitting. Read as much or as little as you can, and bring your questions to the events if you\u2019re coming.\u201cWhat\u2019s missing from the American conversation on race is the fact that people don\u2019t have to hate black people or Muslims or Latinos to be uncomfortable with them, to be suspicious of them, to fear their ascension as an upheaval of the natural order of things. A smart demagogue plays to those fears under the guise of economic anxieties. Things not as good as you hoped? These folks are the reason.\u201d\u201cIf the Uluru Statement from the Heart was an example of the transformative potential of liberal democratic governance through civic engagement beyond the ballot box, the aftermath of Uluru revealed the limitations of Australian retail politics.\u201d\u201cWe must stand in solidarity with our fellow Indigenous and African community members whilst cultivating an environment of leadership and inspiration so that we can all take pride in \u2018Black Panther.\u2019 There is no greater time than now and every child deserves a superhero they can connect with and look up to.\u201d\u201cPsychologists also point to another aspect of racial prejudice and motivations. People can take part in racist speech and behaviour, not because they subscribe to certain beliefs, but because it helps to form bonds within a group \u2014 it can help to create a stronger sense of \u2018us\u2019 by creating a stronger sense of \u2018them.\u2019 Racism can involve as much a group\u2019s needs for identity as it does actual hatred directed at others.\u201d\u201cAs Australia is working us out, we too are working out ourselves, finding a new language and greater flexibility to express who we are. Our struggle is too conveniently positioned as peculiar to this country. But the politics of identity are an international phenomenon \u2014 confusing and contradictory \u2014 heightened by the rush of post cold-war globalisation, the advance of new technology and the changing currents of geopolitics.\u201dNow here are some additional stories from this week, about Australia and the world.______I fell in love with the World Cup traveling through South America in 1998; for me, no event is more global, thrilling and surprising \u2014 not even the Olympics.______Let\u2019s assume you\u2019ve already read a boatload of news about the North Korea summit in Singapore. Here\u2019s some fresh analysis to go with that.______I usually link straight to our headlines here, but I\u2019ve gotten a few emails from people whose eyes speed right over the links, so I\u2019m returning to my old conversational tone.I\u2019ll be honest, we\u2019re a little light on coverage lately due to vacations and travel for bigger stories, but remember when I promised more culture coverage?Here\u2019s her description of what to expect:A collaboration by a group of Australian former child actors (think faces from \u201cRound The Twist\u201d and \u201cH20: Just Add Water\u201d), \u201cThese New South Whales\u201d parodies Australia\u2019s insider-y and blokey music industry, post-punk scene and inner-west life in an addictive, mockumentary-style web series.For anyone who\u2019s seen a gig at The Lansdowne, dealt with crap-talking A&R rep, or had anything to do with the Australian music industry, it\u2019s fun to see that world reflected back and sent up. Yes it\u2019s hyperlocal and insular \u2013 but if you\u2019re in that niche audience, you\u2019ll love it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Asks U.S. for an Exemption From Sanctions on Iran", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 In a letter to senior Trump administration officials, European foreign and finance leaders this week tacitly acknowledged that their efforts to preserve the West\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran were failing.\u201cIn their current state, U.S. secondary sanctions could prevent the European Union from continuing meaningful sanctions relief to Iran,\u201d said the letter, signed by the finance and foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, all signatories to the 2015 accord with Tehran, and by Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign-policy chief, who oversaw the negotiations.Without that sanctions relief, Iran has threatened to pull out of the deal. That \u201cwould further unsettle a region where additional conflicts would be disastrous,\u201d the ministers argue, asserting that the deal was \u201cthe best means through which we can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran,\u201d and that there appeared to be \u201cno credible alternatives at this time.\u201dThe letter was reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal and was then obtained by The New York Times.The plea is considered unlikely to produce the relief the Europeans want, since the Trump administration\u2019s stated intention is to pressure Tehran into agreeing to an entirely new set of negotiations that would encompass its ballistic missile program and its support for hard-line regimes and militias throughout the Middle East.The Europeans have been working with the State Department for some time to try to persuade Mr. Trump to remain in the nuclear agreement, which he has consistently called \u201cthe worst deal in history.\u201dThey proposed discussing parallel new sanctions on Iran for its missile program, its support of the Syrian government and its backing of the Houthi rebels in Yemen and of groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad elsewhere in the Middle East. But the Europeans failed to convince American officials that they could fix the so-called sunset provisions in the original deal, which allow Iran to resume various nuclear activities after a period of years.Tehran has always denied that it ever intended to build a nuclear weapon, though Western intelligence agencies said Iran tried to do just that before abandoning the effort in 2003. While Iran continued to work on ballistic missiles, there has been no evidence found of a nuclear weapons program since that date.On Tuesday, however, Iran announced that it was preparing its nuclear facilities to resume large-scale uranium enrichment and had built a factory for constructing advanced centrifuges should Europe fail to preserve the deal.On Wednesday, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said that Iran\u2019s announced intention to increase its enrichment capacity still left it within the limits set out in the agreement, but, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s always dangerous to flirt with the red line.\u201d So far, he told Europe 1 radio, the deal remained intact.Iran\u2019s leadership is divided, but some would prefer to stay in the deal even without the Americans, to avoid possible military strikes from Israel and from the United States and to try to upgrade the economy. But that prospect seems unlikely if European companies are denied a waiver from the \u201csecondary\u201d sanctions.Iran negotiated the 2015 deal in order to get relief from those crippling secondary sanctions, which Washington is now reimposing and which would deny access to financial systems in the United States to any company doing business with Iran.It is very difficult to persuade large companies with interests in the much larger American market to violate the sanctions or to act as guinea pigs in a trans-Atlantic scuffle over legal mechanisms when there is no certain outcome.Without special exemptions from the secondary sanctions, French companies like the energy giant Total and the PSA Group, which makes Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn vehicles, have already announced that they will pull out of Iran.The European ministers asked the Americans for specific exemptions for companies, individuals and banks who invested in Iran after the deal went into effect on Jan. 16, 2016; for \u201ckey sectors,\u201d like health care, pharmaceuticals, energy, autos and civil aviation; and for banking with the Central Bank of Iran. They also asked for extended periods to wind down their projects for companies that choose to leave Iran, and they made it clear that other requests would be forthcoming, including from individual companies.The ministers say that their countries \u201cshare most of the concerns expressed by the U.S. regarding the status of Iran\u2019s nuclear program after 2025, Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles program and its destabilizing actions in the region.\u201d But they assert that \u201cpreserving\u201d the deal \u201cis the best basis on which to engage Iran and address these concerns,\u201d adding that, \u201cAs allies, we expect that the United States will refrain from taking action to harm Europe\u2019s security interests.\u201dUnfortunately for the Europeans, perhaps, Mr. Trump does not seem to share their views on Iran, and he has proved not to be much swayed by appeals based on trans-Atlantic relations.\u201cThis action reversed an ill-advised and dangerous policy and set us on a new course that will address the aggressive and hostile behavior of our enemies,\u201d he added, \u201cwhile enhancing our ties with partners and allies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Class Struggle According to Donald Trump", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.If only.As Adam Cobb, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, put it in an email conversation:Life doesn\u2019t operate so cleanly and the fact that a worker\u2019s wealth and well-being is much more dependent upon her employer than the employer is on a given worker tilts things in the employer\u2019s favor.The trend in recent years has been an inexorable shift of bargaining power to employers at the expense of employees.Worker power has already suffered death by a thousand cuts, some political, others judicial and regulatory; some at the hands of a changing domestic workplace, others stemming from relentless global forces.Corporate America recognized these trends early on and capitalized on them ruthlessly. Labor organizations were ill equipped to do so and have been on the defensive for the past four decades.In response to my query, Martha McCluskey, a professor of law at the University at Buffalo, emailed:The decline in worker bargaining power in the United States is the cumulative effect of numerous small and large changes over recent decades reaching into almost every area of law and policy. This combines with a decline in the enforcement of existing laws that could protect workers\u2019 bargaining power \u2014 laws protecting unions, laws against wage theft, nondiscrimination laws, and more.The \u201csmall and large changes over recent decades\u201d to which McCluskey refers increase the clout of corporate management and reduce the power of workers over wages, benefits and job security.Among these changes is the requirement that employees sign what are known as \u201cnoncompete\u201d and \u201cno-raid\u201d agreements, both of which restrict workers\u2019 ability to extract pay hikes by threatening to take similar jobs at competing companies.When entry-level workers at fast food restaurants are asked to sign two-year non-competes, it becomes less plausible that trade secrets are always the primary motivation for such agreements.The treasury report estimated that 30 million American workers have signed noncompete agreements.New practices have emerged to facilitate employer collusion, such as noncompete clauses and no-raid pacts, but the basic insights are the same \u2014 employers often implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, act to prevent the forces of competition from enabling workers to earn what a competitive market would dictate.Nearly 1 in 5 labor force participants were bound by noncompetes in 2014, and nearly 40 percent had signed at least one noncompete in the past.These included what the authors decried asJust as companies have weakened employee power through agreements like these, they have capitalized on the increased use of mandatory arbitration of employment disputes to limit their obligations to workers.fueled employer use of mandatory arbitration clauses to cover individual employment disputes, including allegations of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment.If these untoward consequences stemmed from legislative choices, I would be obliged to accede to them. But the edict that employees with wage and hours claims may seek relief only one-by-one does not come from Congress. It is the result of take-it-or-leave-it labor contracts harking back to the type called \u201cyellow dog,\u201d and of the readiness of this Court to enforce those unbargained-for agreements. The Federal Arbitration Act demands no such suppression of the right of workers to take concerted action for their \u201cmutual aid or protection.\u201dThese developments may be masked for a while when unemployment declines, but not forever.By exchanging direct employment for contract work or outsourcing, David Weil, dean of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis, writes in his book \u201cThe Fissured Workplace: Why Work Became So Bad for So Many and What Can Be Done to Improve It,\u201d major corporations succeed insubstantially reducing costs and dispatching the many responsibilities connected to being the employer of record.This shift, in turn,creates downward pressures on wages and benefits, murkiness about who bears responsibility for work conditions, increased likelihood that basic labor standards will be violated.The percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements \u2014 defined as temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract workers, and independent contractors or freelancers \u2014 rose from 10.7 percent in February 2005 to 15.8 percent in late 2015.That\u2019s roughly 24 million workers.In addition, Katz and Krueger found that \u201cworkers in alternative work arrangements earn considerably less per week than do regular employees with similar characteristics and in similar occupations,\u201d that \u201cworkers in alternative work arrangements work fewer hours per week\u201d and that alarger share of alternative workers are involuntary part-time workers compared with employees in traditional jobs.Perhaps more significant, Katz and Krueger found:A striking implication of these estimates is that 94 percent of the net employment growth in the U.S. economy from 2005 to 2015 appears to have occurred in alternative work arrangements.The growing emphasis on \u201cshareholder value\u201d has provided additional justification for all of these anti-worker developments.Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at Wharton, wrote me that \u201cthe shareholder value movement starting in the late 1980s and now institutionalized through industry analysts\u201d was crucially important in the devaluation of employees:Accounting in business is mainly about costs. Finance people hate fixed costs because of the challenges they raise to share price valuation when there is uncertainty, and the biggest fixed costs are labor. Simply moving the same labor costs from employees to outside staffing companies moves it from one part of the accounting ledger to another and makes analysts happier.This mentality, in turn, encourages \u201cthe use of temps and contractors\u201d to fill high-wage jobs because \u201cthat way the employer doesn\u2019t have to raise wages for all their employees.\u201dHirsch, of the University of North Carolina, explained that the automobile industry provides the classic example of these trends:When that industry was dominated by the Big Three in Detroit, union organizing was relatively easy. The U.A.W. could organize all of the competitors by controlling most of the relatively generally homogeneous, geographically tight work force.Once \u201cautomakers in other countries, and now the South, made more inroads, the UAW\u2019s task became far more difficult,\u201d Hirsch argued, becauseCompanies could outsource work to areas with cheaper labor and less of a union presence. This both weakened the union and ramped up competitive pressure on the companies that were unionized. The result was fewer unions. This has obviously played out in many other industries.In addition, Hirsch pointed out,many union jobs are simply no longer in the U.S. Entire industries (e.g., textiles) were essentially moved offshore.The result is a \u201cdeath spiral effect,\u201d according to Hirsch:As membership declines unions are able to exert less influence. Moreover, as fewer employees have experience with unions or know others who have, it becomes harder to organize.The end of labor-management d\u00e9tente \u2014 and the emergence of a merciless assault by business and the Republican Party on workers\u2019 pay, security and bargaining strength \u2014 have been especially cruel to workers without college degrees.In their book, \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, both economists at M.I.T., don\u2019t hold out much hope for this broad class of workers:Rapid and accelerating digitization is likely to bring economic rather than environmental disruption, stemming from the fact that as computers get more powerful, companies have less need for some kinds of workers. Technological progress is going to leave behind some people, perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead.For those with special skills or the right education, they write, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a better time.\u201d For those \u201cwith only \u2018ordinary\u2019 skills and abilities to offer,\u201d however, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a worse time to be a worker.\u201dIn many cases, machines both substitute for and complement human labor. Focusing only on what is lost misses a central economic mechanism by which automation affects the demand for labor: raising the value of the tasks that workers uniquely supply.At a more concrete level, Krueger and Posner, in their Brookings paper, offer a series of well-thought out legal and regulatory reforms aimed at improving the bargaining power of workers.First, they would alter antitrust enforcement to require consideration of the likely effect of mergers on concentration in the labor market, in order to prevent \u201ctoo high a risk of wage suppression.\u201dIn the case of \u201cno-raid\u201d agreements between companies that bar participating businesses from making job offers to employees of competitors, Krueger and Posner would ban no-poaching arrangements altogether:We propose a per se rule against no-poaching agreements regardless of whether they are used outside or within franchises. In other words, no-poaching agreements would be considered illegal regardless of the circumstances of their use.The reality, of course, is that the Krueger-Posner proposals have no chance with President Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of both houses of Congress.For the time being, at least, the problems of the least skilled workers in the labor market will fester.In the 2016 election, Trump profited from the conviction of rural and working-class voters that they were on a downward trajectory. If anything, Trump appears to be gambling that letting those voters\u2019 lives continue to languish will work to his advantage in 2020.Trump campaigned as the ally of the white working class, but any notion that he would take its side as it faces off against employers is a gross misjudgment.His administration has turned the executive branch, the federal courts and the regulatory agencies into the sworn enemy of workers, organized and unorganized. Trump is indisputably indifferent to the plight of anyone in the bottom half of the income distribution: look at his appointments, look at his record in office, look back at his business career and look at the man himself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Justice Department Investigate the Trump Foundation?", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Election law experts from across the political spectrum largely agreed that the New York attorney general made a compelling case this week that President Trump\u2019s campaign and his charitable foundation violated federal campaign finance laws during the 2016 election.What they could not agree on, though, was whether any federal investigators will pick up the case.And, for good measure, on the letter to the F.E.C., she copied two top officials from the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity Section, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting criminal violations of election laws.The copying of the letter to the Justice Department attracted wide notice in Washington\u2019s close-knit election-law bar, as did the claim in the lawsuit that the use of the Trump Foundation to benefit the Trump campaign \u201cwas willful and knowing.\u201dThat phrase, combined with the \u201ccc,\u201d appears to be an effort to set the stage for a criminal election-law prosecution. That would be handled by the Justice Department rather than the F.E.C., which can only levy civil penalties and fines.\u201cThe evidence collected by the attorney general is so compelling that she was able to make a case that the Trump Foundation knowingly and willfully violated the source prohibitions and dollar limits of the Federal Election Campaign Act,\u201d said Brett Kappel, an election lawyer with the firm Akerman who has represented clients on both sides of the aisle, including the former Texas congressman Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.The referral to the Justice Department cheered advocates for more aggressive enforcement of election laws, who have bemoaned what they see as the F.E.C.\u2019s plunge in recent years into a state of near-constant deadlock and almost complete toothlessness. The agency, which by statute is composed of six members evenly split between appointees from both parties, has two vacant seats, leaving it with only four commissioners. That\u2019s the number required to advance a complaint or referral for formal investigation, meaning that the two Republican appointees would have to join the two Democratic counterparts to proceed with an investigation of a sitting Republican president \u2014 a highly unlikely outcome.\u201cThere are certainly grounds to open an investigation on the merits,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, vice president for policy and litigation at the campaign finance advocacy group Common Cause. \u201cBut the F.E.C. has been dismissing complaints that I think are much stronger slam dunks than this.\u201dWhile the F.E.C. mostly directs enforcement actions at campaigns and their treasurers, the Justice Department can bring criminal charges that can carry jail time against anyone involved in a campaign finance violation.If the Justice Department takes up the referral from the New York attorney general, Democrats and government watchdog groups can be expected to call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself \u2014 as he did from the investigation of Russian meddling \u2014 because of his involvement in the Trump campaign.The campaign finance violations alleged by the New York attorney general primarily center on a fund-raiser for veterans\u2019 groups held by the foundation in Iowa ahead of the state\u2019s pivotal caucuses, which fell on Feb. 1, 2016. The fund-raiser \u2014 which had many trappings of a campaign rally, including a speech by Mr. Trump skewering his opponents and celebrating his own accomplishments \u2014 raised more than $2.8 million for the foundation for distribution to other charities benefiting veterans.But records the attorney general obtained show that officials for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, including the digital operative Brad Parscale, who is now the manager of Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election bid, were involved in planning the fund-raiser and raising money for it. Other officials, including the campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, were involved in directing how and when the money was disseminated to the veterans\u2019 groups, according to emails obtained by the attorney general.In one email, Mr. Lewandowski wrote to a foundation official, \u201cI think we should get the total collected and then put out a news release that we distributed the $$ to each of the groups.\u201d He later sent a list of veterans\u2019 groups, and asked that some of the disbursements be made in Iowa in the days before that state\u2019s presidential nominating caucuses, which mark the kickoff of the primary calendar.The activity around the fund-raiser ran afoul of campaign finance laws on two main fronts, Ms. Underwood\u2019s office charges. The $2.8 million raised for the foundation amounted to illegal and undisclosed in-kind donations that exceeded the federal contribution limit of $5,400 per election cycle per person. And Ms. Underwood\u2019s lawsuit says that the communication between the campaign and the foundation represented a violation of rules barring campaigns from coordinating with nonprofit groups or other entities in the spending of funds. The referral to the F.E.C. also asks it to investigate a $25,000 donation made by the foundation in 2013 to a nonprofit that was devoted to helping the political prospects of an ally of Mr. Trump.\u201cThe letter is pretty devastating in terms of building the case that bedrock campaign finance principles and laws were violated,\u201d said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a nonprofit government ethics group.Republican campaign finance lawyers mostly declined to comment for attribution on the case, though several said that the best defense for the Trump Foundation and campaign may be that they simply didn\u2019t know the laws, and therefore couldn\u2019t knowingly and willfully violate them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Japan, Too, Outrageous Is the New Normal", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Nakano is a political scientist in Japan.This is what passes for government accountability in Japan today.The senior official in question is Taro Aso, the finance minister, who \u2014 with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s backing \u2014 has refused to resign.Details of the land deal, which involves a school operator with ties to Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, remain unclear. But it already is clear that the cover-up is worse than the crime and yet its culprits may get away with it. Although roiled by scandals and deflated by low popularity ratings, the Abe administration seems to think it can ride out the turbulence, banking on the few remaining checks on its power and public apathy about politics. And it may be right.Japan has long had problems with political accountability. A multimember-district system was established after World War II. By giving even small parties a chance of getting elected, it could have encouraged proportionality and representativeness. Instead, it quickly entrenched the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, which learned to toggle its candidates in response to shifts in the popular mood, and it fragmented the opposition. The L.D.P., Mr. Abe\u2019s party, ruled for nearly four decades. A set of cozy relations known as the \u201ciron triangle\u201d developed between politicians, bureaucrats and corporations, and these groups\u2019 pursuit of their narrow interests came to dominate politics, breeding collusion and corruption.In the post-Cold War era, various reforms were introduced in hopes of creating a British-style two-party system and ensuring alternation of power. It was also thought that centralizing authority in the hands of the governing party\u2019s leader, who had received a popular mandate by being elected, would increase democratic accountability.So why, then, hasn\u2019t there been more pushback?Unless the opposition can strengthen itself enough to threaten the L.D.P.\u2019s grip on power, no internal rebellion is likely to materialize within the party itself. Mr. Abe is expected to seek a third term as party president during internal elections in September, and despite muted grumbling over his stewardship, a serious opponent has yet to emerge.This suits Mr. Abe fine. In Sunday\u2019s election in Niigata, for instance, which the L.D.P. candidate appears to have won by a bit more than 3 percent of votes, turnout was about 58 percent.There was a time in Japan when if an administration was caught red-handed in as vast a cover-up as in this land-sale scandal, the mainstream media would have cried out in unison that Mr. Aso\u2019s position was untenable. No longer.Key democratic principles like transparency and accountability, which were never as entrenched here as in the United States anyway, no longer seem to be the lingua franca of public discussion. In this respect, the Abe administration is not unlike the Trump presidency: In Japan, too, what was once outrageous has become the new normal.Koichi Nakano is a professor of political science at Sophia University, in Tokyo.Advertisement"}

Developments advertise second kitchens designed to seal off the aroma of Asian cooking. In-law suites cater to the Asian custom of multigenerational living. Asians smile out of ersatz family photos in the model homes. And Asian immigrant couples have been buying homes up \u2014 often for millions, often in cash.\u201cAsians,\u201d said Sukhee Kang, who became the first Korean-American to run a major American city when he was elected mayor of Irvine in 2008, \u201care good for business.\u201dIn the 45th Congressional District, whose biggest city is Irvine, three of the four Democratic candidates were born to immigrants, including one of the front-runners, Dave Min, a Korean-American law professor at the University of California, Irvine. Whichever Democrat does best in the June 5 primary will challenge Representative Mimi Walters, the Republican incumbent, in a district that has never elected anyone but Republicans \u2014 an area once famous for nurturing the political careers of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan.Hence the double-takes when Orange County chose Hillary Clinton in 2016, the first time a Democratic presidential candidate had carried the county since Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s second term.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s edge seems like less of a stretch in the diverse precincts of Irvine, whose demographics increasingly look like the future of Orange County.But when half the residents of this city of a quarter-million are Asian, it is not clear whether demographics will be destiny for the Democrats, or just, well, a faux-Mediterranean cul-de-sac.Turnout is one reason. Asian-Americans tend not to vote in high numbers, put off by language barriers, lack of outreach from either party and a historical absence of political engagement.Those splits reflect the diversity of an Asian population that is one-third Vietnamese, one-sixth Korean and one-sixth Chinese, with smaller shares of Filipinos, Indians and Japanese. Those who live in Irvine are often highly educated and affluent, especially the businesspeople from mainland China and Korea who often buy up new subdivisions. But there remain pockets of poverty among the county\u2019s Vietnamese, Cambodians and Pacific Islanders.\u201cBecause of Republican rhetoric against immigration, Republicans are really turning off Asian-Americans,\u201d said Jennifer Lee, a Columbia sociologist and one of the 2016 survey\u2019s authors. She said both parties needed to work harder for Asian votes. \u201cAs they grow as a larger voting bloc, they\u2019re really up for grabs,\u201d she said.What could cut through the political crosscurrents this year is a simple maxim: Asians vote for Asians.The few Asian politicians in Orange County have tended to be Republicans, not least because the party has been the only game in town. A front-runner to replace Ed Royce, a retiring Republican congressman who represents heavily Hispanic and Asian parts of northern Orange County, is a Korean-born Republican former state legislator named Young Kim.A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.But younger Asian-Americans, especially those born in the United States, have tended to swerve left of their elders. They include Mr. Min, a former adviser to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York who calls himself a housing finance wonk. Depending on how several other races turn out, he could become the only Korean-American in Congress, a prospect that finds its way into his pitch when Asian voters are around.Running in Irvine, where Asians, whites and Persians alike buy million-dollar homes in large part to put their children in ultracompetitive public schools, Mr. Min has reasons both for doubt and for hope. \u201cI joke that it\u2019s the one district in the country where being an Asian-American law professor is an advantage,\u201d he said.Resistance City, this is not. Lawn signs advertising open houses tend to far outnumber those endorsing politicians. And then there is the question of Asian voters, who, beyond inconsistent turnout, are not numerous enough on their own to pick winners.\u201cThe more you can engage them in the place they\u2019re comfortable, in the language they\u2019re comfortable in \u2014 it\u2019s a sign that we value their vote,\u201d said Katie Porter, a U.C. Irvine law professor who is considered Mr. Min\u2019s main rival.She said her campaign, which highlights her consumer protection work with Senator Elizabeth Warren, was energizing previously apathetic voters: \u201cI think that this is a place where historically, politics wasn\u2019t discussed, but this most recent election, I think, changed that.\u201dMr. Min speaks only minimal Korean, making it difficult for him to tap into the community on his own. So his parents, who arrived in the United States as graduate students in 1972, have campaigned for him at Korean churches and restaurants, and Mr. Kang has prodded local Korean-language media to cover him more.On a recent evening in Turtle Rock, a neighborhood near U.C. Irvine, virtually every white voter whose door Mr. Min knocked on was familiar with his campaign, including an ex-Republican who pledged his vote.Some of the Asian voters on his list proved harder to engage.A woman named Celeste grimaced when Mr. Min told her that Ms. Walters, the Republican incumbent, was \u201c100 percent with Trump.\u201d\u201cThis feels like an attack on the values that brought my parents to this country and that I grew up with,\u201d Mr. Min added.The woman listened, but did not ask questions or linger.Nowhere is Orange County\u2019s accelerating diversity more obvious than in its schools and shopping centers, where, in the absence of downtowns, community life unfolds.Zion Markets (Korean) and 99 Ranches (Taiwanese) jostle with, or even replace, Vons and Albertsons supermarkets. There are so many Chinese students in Irvine now that the city supports several competing Chinese-language schools, and the public schools have been known to send notices to parents in English and Chinese.Here are the pieces you need to read to understand the state, and what may happen there on Tuesday.Apparently it is. Why? \u201cKids like us grew up,\u201d said Sarah Mosqueda, his partner, who is from a Mexican family in Tustin. \u201cThat\u2019s what changed.\u201dBut the chef, Carlos Salgado, the son of Mexican immigrants, said he had no illusions about how far immigrants still had to go in Orange County. \u201cI have a tall white guy in my kitchen; people think he\u2019s the chef,\u201d Mr. Salgado said.Most of them were predominantly white communities.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the last gasp of a ruling group of Republicans who are on their way out the door,\u201d said Kia Hamadanchy, a son of Persian immigrants who is running for Congress as a Democrat in Irvine.Whether immigrants will replace them remains to be seen.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get Asian-Americans to run,\u201d said Cyril Yu, a deputy district attorney who lost his race for the Irvine school board in 2012. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re going to get people who are excited, nonetheless, because an Asian-American\u2019s on the ballot.\u201dVivian Yee grew up in Irvine, Calif., and graduated from University High School, and she still has family there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Same-Sex Dances, Anyone Can Lead", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cEvery other week I\u2019m reborn on the dance floor. It\u2019s a ritual, it\u2019s a renewal and it\u2019s also community,\u201d said Mr. Vaughn, who works in finance.Big Apple Ranch dances enable Randy Arroyave, an associate scientist for a flavors and fragrance company, to meet \u201cmathematicians, lawyers, scientists, actors, dancers and carpenters. I\u2019ve met a wonderful, beautiful spectrum here, even lovers whom I\u2019ve broken up with.\u201dMr. Vaughn and Mr. Arroyave\u2019s experiences reflect the many pleasures enjoyed by aficionados of same-sex social dancing, popular mostly in metropolitan areas across the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe and Australia. (Same-sex ballroom dancing traditionally has devotees in Europe.)\u201cWe can dance in our own queer Olympics \u2014 the Gay Games is every four years,\u201d Ms. Balfour added. \u201cWe have same-sex dance competitions; we are a lot more visible. We are more open about our sexuality and our right to be who we are.\u201dNational and international same-sex dance events not only attract a wide following but have also globalized the same-sex dance community, Mr. Yun said, adding, \u201cThis is why we all know each other, and it\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201dThe reference here is to the gender-neutral concept of leaders and followers, roles assumed by dancers and terms that are favored by L.G.B.T.Q. dancers. These terms replace the more traditional concept and role of a man leading his partner, a woman. In same-sex social dancing, anyone can assume either role, regardless of the gender the dancer identifies with; dancers sometimes even switch roles mid-dance, a difficult skill developed by more experienced participants.Midsummer Night Swing features a different type of dance each night, offering a lesson and a dance, as well as frequent demonstrations. The Big Apple Ranch in recent years has sent instructors and dancers to demonstrate and teach country-western dance. Last year, the Manhattan Prairie Dogs performed, wearing poodle skirts that converted into wedding dresses.Same-sex social dancers sometimes encounter homophobia, particularly at straight dance clubs, said Scott Lappin, a professional ballroom dance instructor in Florida. He said that he and his frequent dance partner, Lee Fox, a fellow professional, \u201csometimes get cockeyed looks and under-the-breath comments at straight clubs. But because we\u2019re good dancers, they watch us and start to really like it. It looks great, it\u2019s a transformational thing. It\u2019s not a magic bullet. However, it is helpful to see it, because it does transcend normal gender-identity views.\u201dBut for same-sex dance aficionados, what matters most is getting out on the dance floor to celebrate their passion.The Sundance Saloon community greatly appeals to Dan Goldes, a San Francisco-based meeting and board retreat facilitator and active country-western dancer, because, he said, \u201cI know people going to Sundance Saloon would not have been in my life in any other way.\u201dAnd dancing there, he added, lets him follow. \u201cIn my work life, I\u2019m a director when I run retreats and help people get through programs. When I go to dance, it\u2019s much more relaxing to be a follower.\u201dMs. Balfour said same-sex social dancing could also improve posture, circulation and general well-being, and create bonds of intimacy and trust.\u201cI love to see the look of delight on people\u2019s faces when they get it,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Industries, Looking for Efficiency, Turn to Blockchains", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf some financial institutions had used blockchains before the last recession, we may not have had one. After all, banks sometimes didn\u2019t know which company\u2019s books held bad mortgages, and a blockchain is essentially a single time-stamped ledger transparent to all its users.Since that time, companies in a wide variety of industries, such as health care, government, food, supply chain management and trade finance, have begun exploring blockchain technology. The problems they\u2019re trying to solve mostly come down to inefficiency and fraud.Gartner, a research firm, projects the global business benefits of blockchain technology will total $5 billion in 2018 and more than quadruple to $21 billion by 2021.IBM is helping many companies adopt blockchain technology.\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen over 400 client engagements, and we\u2019re starting to see the results of those in the commercialization of those efforts,\u201d said Marie Wieck, IBM\u2019s general manager for blockchain, contrasting it with 2016, when she saw \u201cblockchain tourism \u2014 everyone was sightseeing,\u201d she said. IBM emphasizes that a blockchain works best as a network, so she\u2019s now seeing more initiatives focusing on getting a minimum number of companies on a blockchain.However, blockchains for businesses are mostly still experiments, said David Furlonger, a Gartner vice president.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of proof of concept work being done in pretty much every industry and government, and the interest remains extremely high from all those participants,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus is very much on research and development work, not massive implementation.\u201dWhether the testing is taking full advantage of the technology\u2019s capabilities is another matter. Noting that one of the core advantages of blockchains is decentralization \u2014 the ability for a network to decide by group consensus, not top-down authority \u2014 Mr. Furlonger said: \u201cMany of the enterprise initiatives are heavily centralized replatforming initiatives, not reimagining the way business can be conducted. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re necessarily bad if you\u2019re able to produce savings, improve efficiency. But it could, to some extent, reinforce the prior paradigm, which was a very heavily centralized model.\u201dOne product, called a distributed contracting network, was just announced for Microsoft\u2019s Xbox. Paul Brody, blockchain global innovation leader at EY, which helped create the product, said it was \u201ca blockchain-based tool for enabling companies to execute digital contracts with each other \u2014 and very specifically, the primary focus is on digital media content, rights and royalties around everything from video games to media and entertainment \u2014 music, movies, etc.\u201dXbox, which features games by publishers around the world, has traditionally tracked and calculated the royalties its content creators were owed manually and with spreadsheets, said Rohit Amberker, director of royalties and content operations at Microsoft. The process typically took 30 to 60 days. The new system is transparent, cutting down costs by a projected two-thirds, Mr. Brody said.One of the first to use it will be Ubisoft, a game publisher, though once it is in use across Microsoft\u2019s gaming ecosystem, it will encompass thousands of content partners, Mr. Amberker said. Eventually, the goal is for the blockchain to also handle payments and for it to be useful to anyone dealing with intellectual property or digital asset rights, including authors, songwriters and developers, he said.The financial services industry is further along than other. Insurwave, a marine insurance program created by seven companies, started at the end of May for more than 1,000 ships. Shaun Crawford, the global head of insurance for EY, which is building the program with GuardTime, said insurance for ships has traditionally been a paper-intensive business.It uses historical data and standard estimates to quantify insurance coverage divorced from the reality of any one ship\u2019s particular risk. That can vary based on a vessel\u2019s age, service history, the routes it travels (whether it passes through conflict zones where ships are more likely to be hijacked) and other factors. With Insurwave, insurers can, for instance, increase a premium on a ship set to sail through a dangerous zone, which might in turn prompt it to choose another course. Everything is signed through the blockchain.The blockchain is in place across the shipping company A. P. Moller-Maersk\u2019s vessels. The insurance companies Willis Towers Watson, XL Catlin and MS Amlin are also on the platform.\u201cIt\u2019s a very sleepy old industry \u2014 insurance \u2014 and we\u2019re shaking it up a bit,\u201d Mr. Crawford said. In building the product after working on proofs of concept, he said: \u201cWe realized we\u2019re not digitizing existing processes, but transforming the way we do business. We had to re-architect our proposition two or three times to really get the blockchain thing working, so there\u2019s a big difference between a proof of concept and the reality of blockchain.\u201dWhen the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.Another blockchain-based product in use is at the bank Northern Trust, which began automating the paper-intensive process of investing by pensions and endowments in private equity.Peter Cherecwich, president of corporate and institutional services, likened the traditional process to buying a house. \u201cYou have to have all the contracts, pass them back and forth, everyone has to sign them at the same time, you move the money at the same time,\u201d he said. All this is automated, and the auditing firm PwC audits the ledger in real time, as opposed to after the fact.By year\u2019s end, a joint venture between Maersk and IBM will use a blockchain instead of masses of paper to manage the movement of goods on ships from suppliers to consumers. This blockchain is complementary to Insurwave. A shipper of avocados from Kenya to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for example, needs a certificate of origin signed by authorities in Nairobi, another document stating the fruit has been inspected, and a bill of lading, packing list and commercial invoice. All the documents, which have to be certified by the authorities, are often shuttled by motorbike in Kenya for signatures.After traveling on a ship, those documents are sent by courier to the Rotterdam customs broker. It takes four to six weeks to validate the documents, so the cargo is released under bond; if anything doesn\u2019t check out, it can be drawn upon to pay penalties. That single shipment involves 30 entities encompassing more than 100 people, requiring more than 200 exchanges of documents, said Mike White, chief executive of the joint venture. A problem anywhere along the line causes a delay, a drawback with perishable food.\u201cAll those documents are digitized, available electronically, and with the government authority, the customs agents, the shippers, the carriers and the terminals,\u201d Mr. White said of the blockchain. \u201cEverybody has access to the documents they need to see, and everybody involved in that transaction can identify immediately if there\u2019s been changes made.\u201dThe venture aims to have more than 50 percent of the major trading routes connected to the platform in three years, but will have competition from Foxconn Technology Group\u2019s coming blockchain-based supply chain software.Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, an open source blockchains project managed by the Linux Foundation, says companies that work in transactions or that serve as a system of record for an industry will have to adapt.The technology, he said, \u201cdoes force them to transform in the same way that companies that were information-centered have had to transform with the rise of the internet. That same kind of thing will hit any company about transactions or about being a system of record for an industry. If they transform themselves before their competitors do it, they\u2019ll have a future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Moves to Shore Up Economy as Slowdown and Trade Fight Loom", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina in essence told the country\u2019s banks on Sunday that they do not have to sock away as much for a rainy day, allowing them to lend the money instead. The central bank said that, effective July 5, it would reduce by half a percentage point the share of overall deposits that commercial banks and other savings institutions are required to deposit at the central bank, a measure known as the reserve requirement ratio.It came with a catch: The banks must use the money to help heavily indebted companies or lend more to small businesses with little or no collateral to offer. It is the second time in just over two months that China has freed up money but given banks specific instructions on how to lend it.A further expansion of credit now could weaken confidence in China\u2019s currency, which has already slid in value against the dollar over the past week because of worries about a possible trade war with the United States.China has been cautious in the past about cutting the reserve ratio during times when its currency appears to be under strain. The move on Sunday \u201cmeans the People\u2019s Bank of China has put internal economic development as the priority,\u201d said Deng Haiqing, an economist at the China Finance 40 Forum, a Beijing research group.For 17 of the country\u2019s biggest banks, the rules announced on Sunday will free up $77 billion for lending. But the central bank said that this money had to be used as part of programs in which banks obtain shares in deeply troubled companies in exchange for writing off some of these companies\u2019 debts.Banks have been cautious about entering into these debt-for-equity programs, to the annoyance of government regulators. The regulators see the programs as a way to stabilize the balance sheets of heavily indebted companies.But the big banks have been wary of holding very large blocks of stock in troubled companies. They have tended to keep lending to these companies, often in the hope that government agencies might bail out the companies and help them pay off their bank debts.For the rest of the banking system \u2014 a hodgepodge of smaller commercial banks, postal savings banks and other savings institutions \u2014 the central bank\u2019s move frees up $31 billion. They were instructed to lend more to small businesses.Chinese-owned banks hold more than 98 percent of the Chinese banking market, and they operate under tight government control. But just in case any might not be inclined to follow closely the instructions on how to use the money from the reserves being freed up, the central bank also included a warning in its statement on Sunday evening: Government bank examiners would include compliance with Sunday\u2019s instructions in their compliance assessments.Officials in Beijing have taken other steps in recent months to tackle China\u2019s mountain of debt. They ordered bank auditors to use tougher standards by June 30 in labeling loans as overdue and nonperforming. Those instructions have put pressure on the banks to find solutions for deeply indebted borrowers instead of continuing to wait and hope that the government will offer bailouts.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trumps and Kushners Cut Ties on Hotel Deals That Raised Eyebrows", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trumps and the Kushners are parting ways \u2014 not the White House power couple Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, but their family businesses on hotel collaborations in New Jersey, according to people briefed on the situation.Ethics watchdogs had taken aim at President Trump and Mr. Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, for retaining stakes in their family businesses while the companies were financially entangled in New Jersey. The families\u2019 dealmaking, the watchdogs suggested, could have influenced Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment about Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in the administration. And Bobby Burchfield, the Trump Organization\u2019s outside ethics adviser, had also asked questions about the potential collaboration with the Kushners on the Jersey Shore property.While both sides were in agreement about the decision to forgo the deals, it is the latest frustration for the Trump Organization. Although the Kushners represented only a fraction of the Trump Organization\u2019s overall business, the Westminster Hotel, the Kushner-owned property in Livingston, was one of the few new ventures undertaken by the Trump Organization since it adopted new ethics restrictions after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. The company earned $20,000 in fees for managing the hotel for part of last year, according to the president\u2019s financial disclosure last month.The Trump Organization and Kushner Companies declined to comment for this article, but the head of the Trump Organization\u2019s hotel division, Eric Danziger, said this year that the pipeline of current deals was \u201cstill very active,\u201d and that he continued to line up new Scion and American Idea hotels.The Trumps and the Kushners first teamed up around the time of the election on a Trump-branded residential project in Jersey City. There is no indication from disclosure statements that the building, owned by the Kushners, is producing fees for the Trump Organization, though the name remains in place.The Trump-Kushner partnership in Livingston was unusual from the start. It was the first hotel the Trumps managed that did not carry their name. And its suburban location contrasted with the five-star urban high-rises synonymous with the Trump hotel brand, though the Trumps had hotel management experience that the Kushners lacked, and the family connection helped bring them together.The first sign of change came late last year, when Kushner Companies hired a new executive, Will Obeid, to help run its hotel operations. Mr. Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, then broached ending the Westminster Hotel deal with the Trumps this year, according to the people briefed on the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.The split at the Westminster came as Mr. Obeid planned to take the Kushner hotel business in a new direction, the people said, and as the Trumps and the Kushners had differing strategies for handling potential union negotiations. While the Trump Organization offered to help work out a deal with the union, Kushner Companies preferred a different approach.Around that time, Kushner Companies also voiced reservations about the Jersey Shore collaboration, according to the people briefed on the decision. Those concerns were raised after the private talks between the two companies were reported by The New York Times in March, drawing scrutiny from ethics watchdogs and compounding public opposition in the town.The long-running discussions between the Trumps and the Kushners \u2014 the companies signed a letter of intent about two years ago to team up on the deal \u2014 had initially called for the Trump Organization to manage a hotel in Long Branch, N.J., and brand it as a Scion.One potential solution, the companies decided, was to initially limit the Trumps\u2019 involvement to a behind-the-scenes role, as they had at the Westminster, according to the people briefed on the discussions, who were not authorized to speak publicly about private negotiations.But this spring, Kushner Companies expressed concern to the Trump Organization about the public scrutiny of the arrangement, the people briefed on the situation said, and eventually the Trumps and the Kushners agreed to part ways.The Kushners\u2019 role in the Long Branch project also had consequences for the city\u2019s longtime mayor, Adam Schneider, a Democrat, who along with the city council approved $20 million in redevelopment area bonds to support the Pier Village development and was voted out of office last month. During Mr. Schneider\u2019s re-election campaign, opposition mailers and fliers highlighted his cooperation with the Kushners: One, which pictured him with various Kushner executives at a recent groundbreaking, read, \u201cMayor Schneider \u2014 Looking out for them.\u201dMr. Schneider, a critic of the president, dismissed the attacks as \u201cnonsense,\u201d but he was defeated in a landslide. \u201cAfter having been in office for 28 years, you piss off a few people along the way,\u201d he said.Jesse Drucker contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tech Companies Conquered America\u2019s Cities", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI\u2019m not saying America\u2019s cities are turning into dystopian technocapitalist hellscapes in which corporations operate every essential service and pull every civic string.But let\u2019s take a tour of recent news from the metropolises.O.K., so maybe I am saying that America\u2019s cities are turning into dystopian technocapitalist hellscapes.Into this void march the techies, who come bearing money, jobs and promises of out-of-this-world innovation. But there\u2019s a catch. Corporations are getting wide latitude in determining the future of cities. They are controlling more key services and winning important battles with once-indomitable city governments. Local officials find themselves at the mercy of tech: They can\u2019t live without tech money, even if tech interests have a way of eclipsing every other civic priority.How did tech companies become America\u2019s most-powerful local power brokers?Here are some reasons.One reason tech companies can command greater say in local issues is that many other local institutions, from small businesses to local newspapers, have lost much of their influence \u2014 thanks, in large part, to the internet.\u201cWhen the framers of the Constitution designed the American political system, they assumed that people would care a lot more about local issues that were tangible and concrete than they would care about the distant ways of Washington,\u201c Mr. Hopkins said. \u201cContemporary American politics is exactly the opposite \u2014 we are focused on the spectacle far away.\u201dThe \u201ckey question for voters is always their national loyalties,\u201d Mr. Hopkins said. There\u2019s much less room for voting based on what\u2019s happening nearby.What does this have to do with tech companies? While the fall of local media undermined interest in local issues, tech companies began to notice that their platforms gave them direct access to new levers of local influence. And they began to deploy those levers to withering effect.Uber wrote the script. Travis Kalanick, the ride-hailing company\u2019s founder and now-ousted chief executive, pushed into dozens of cities without asking permission. In many cities, the pushback was intense \u2014 Uber was disrupting local taxi cartels that had spent decades building their own political power base.But what Uber lacked in political support it made up for in local popularity. Through its app, the company had a direct connection to thousands of riders and drivers who were making a living from its service.The plan worked beautifully. In New York in 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio floated a proposal to cap Uber\u2019s growth. The mayor had the support of most of the City Council; Uber\u2019s fight looked impossible.You might argue that this is all to the good: Cities are drowning in red tape, local leaders are naturally averse to change, and tech companies are doing exactly what innovative companies should do. Shouldn\u2019t we be celebrating these innovators?Which was all by design. The scooter companies were just following Travis\u2019s Law. In Santa Monica, Bird\u2019s scooters appeared on city streets in September. Lawmakers balked; in December, the city filed a nine-count criminal complaint against Bird.If you love the scooters, you see nothing wrong with this. But there was a time, in America, when the government paid for infrastructure and the public had a say in important local services. With Ubers ruling the roads, Birds ruling the sidewalks, Elon Musk running our subways and Domino\u2019s paving our roads, that age is gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicare Allows More Benefits for Chronically Ill, Aiming to Improve Care for Millions", "Date": "2018-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress and the Trump administration are revamping Medicare to provide extra benefits to people with multiple chronic illnesses, a significant departure from the program\u2019s traditional focus that aims to create a new model of care for millions of older Americans.The changes \u2014 reflected in a new law and in official guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 tackle a vexing and costly problem in American health care: how to deal with long-term illnesses that can build on one another, and the social factors outside the reach of traditional medicine that can contribute to them, like nutrition, transportation and housing.To that end, the additional benefits can include social and medical services, home improvements like wheelchair ramps, transportation to doctor\u2019s offices and home delivery of hot meals.The new law is a rare instance of bipartisan cooperation on a major policy initiative, embraced by members of Congress from both parties. The changes are also supported by Medicare officials and insurance companies that operate the fast-growing Medicare Advantage plans serving one-third of the 60 million Medicare beneficiaries.\u201cThis is a way to update and strengthen Medicare,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and an architect of the law, the Chronic Care Act, which was included in budget legislation signed recently by President Trump. \u201cIt begins a transformational change in the way Medicare works for seniors who suffer from chronic conditions. More of them will be able to receive care at home, so they can stay independent and out of the hospital.\u201dHalf of Medicare patients are treated for five or more chronic conditions each year, and they account for three-fourths of Medicare spending, according to Kenneth E. Thorpe, the chairman of the health policy department at Emory University.Under the new law and Trump administration policy, most of the new benefits will be reserved for Medicare Advantage plans, which will be able to offer additional benefits tailored to the needs of people with conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s disease, heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis and some types of cancer.\u201cThis is a big win for patients,\u201d said Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Officials hope that combining social and medical services will produce better outcomes for patients and save money for Medicare.\u201cAn inexpensive railing in the bath can avoid a fall that can cause a hip fracture and potential complications,\u201d said David Sayen, who worked at the Medicare agency for 37 years.Treatment for a broken hip, including hospital care and follow-up services, can easily cost Medicare more than $20,000, and the costs are much higher in some regions than in others.Medicare plans could also reduce co-payments and deductibles for people who receive treatment for a particular medical condition from certain recommended doctors, hospitals or other health care providers.Mr. Sayen said the new federal policy gave health plans \u201ca whole new toolbox to address social determinants of health.\u201dAlthough Medicare Advantage plans will wield most of the tools, their experience will be useful to policymakers who want to extend similar benefits to people in the rest of Medicare.Medicare Advantage plans must cover all the services that the original Medicare program covers except hospice care, and many offer extra benefits as well. Until now, the government has generally required each Medicare plan to offer the same benefits with the same cost-sharing to all beneficiaries.The Trump administration has reinterpreted the \u201cuniformity requirement\u201d to allow different supplemental benefits for people with different medical needs. Congress went further and allowed Medicare officials to waive those requirements for patients with chronic illnesses.Moreover, Congress allowed Medicare plans to offer a wider array of supplemental benefits to the chronically ill, eliminating the current requirement that the extra benefits must be \u201cprimarily health-related.\u201dJohn G. Lovelace, the president of government programs at UPMC Health Plan in Pittsburgh, said the extra benefits could include visits by a personal assistant to help with bathing and dressing; visits by a nurse or a pharmacist to make sure a Medicare beneficiary with a dozen prescriptions is taking the right medicines; and special supervised housing for a person with dementia who cannot be left alone.John K. Gorman, a former Medicare official who is a consultant to many insurers, predicted rapid growth in the use of high-tech pill dispensing machines, remote monitoring of homebound people and telehealth services to connect patients with doctors hundreds of miles away.The Chronic Care Act provides new financial incentives for the use of telehealth services, including coverage for stroke patients in traditional Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage.Sue Nelson, a vice president of the American Heart Association, said these provisions \u201ccould help tens of thousands of stroke patients every year, increasing survival rates and reducing disability and the need for rehabilitation and nursing home care.\u201dMany hospitals do not have stroke experts readily available. But under the new law, Medicare will pay for consultation with a neurologist at a distant location, using special medical equipment for videoconferencing. The doctor can review CT scan images and recommend treatments, including the use of highly effective clot-busting drugs.Dr. Lee H. Schwamm, the chief of stroke services at Massachusetts General Hospital, said Medicare could also pay neurologists to evaluate patients with stroke symptoms while they were in an ambulance. The doctors could then direct paramedics to the most appropriate hospital.David M. Certner, the legislative policy director of AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said his group supports the idea of allowing greater coverage for supplemental benefits, including nonmedical services that can improve care. \u201cWe believe such coverage should be available under both Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare,\u201d he said.Defining eligibility and limiting the scope of benefits in traditional Medicare could be a challenge. But Eva H.

{"Headline": "How Mnuchin Keeps a Steady Grip in a Tug of War on Trade", "Date": "2018-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two weeks ago, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, declared that the trade war with China was \u201con hold\u201d and that the United States would temporarily holster its tariffs. The reassuring comments calmed markets and raised hopes that Mr. Mnuchin, one of President Trump\u2019s most enduring and trusted advisers, was winning the internal trade battle that has gripped the White House.Then Mr. Trump weighed in. In a one-two punch last week, the president doubled down on the trade war with China and threw in ones with Canada, Mexico and Europe for good measure.This weekend, some of those countries hit back, as finance ministers from the six other nations attending the Group of 7 meeting in Canada issued an unusual rebuke over America\u2019s trading practices and the use of tariffs against allies. The statement said that tariffs \u201cundermine open trade and confidence in the global economy\u201d and called on Mr. Mnuchin to make their worries known to Mr. Trump.The scolding laid bare the uncomfortably familiar spot that Mr. Mnuchin finds himself in: trying to be a voice of moderation and a statesman in an administration that sees diplomatic norms and protocols as signs of weakness.He has so far managed to stay in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces while advocating a more free-trade approach, but that balancing act is showing signs of strain.Mr. Mnuchin, unflappable in public, is privately making his case with a president who campaigned on blowing up trade agreements and surrounded himself with hard-line advisers who continue to toe that line.\u201cYou have an intellectual slugfest going on in the White House,\u201d said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201cSometimes Mnuchin has victories and sometimes he has failures, but he is clearly one of the strongest voices for the free-trade position.\u201dThe internal tensions boiled over in May during a trade mission Mr. Mnuchin led to China, when he got into an argument with Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s hawkish trade adviser, by reminding him where he stood in the administration\u2019s pecking order after Mr. Navarro confronted him about his sidelining of the rest of the team from the talks.On the plane ride home, Mr. Navarro sat in a separate cabin from Mr. Mnuchin and remained publicly silent for days about the trip while Mr. Mnuchin declared the talks a success and said the trade war was on hold.The victory was short-lived.\u201cHe didn\u2019t say it was on hold indefinitely,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said last week as the White House announced that the China tariffs and investment restrictions would be coming, after all.\u201cAnd look, the president ultimately makes the decisions on trade,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when he does, we announce them. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s taken place in this process.\u201dMr. Mnuchin has managed to remain in Mr. Trump\u2019s good stead by rolling with the punches, avoiding the fate that has befallen Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign managers, chiefs of staff and cabinet secretaries by pleasing a president who prizes the unpredictable and governs by whim. That has given Mr. Mnuchin a key role inside the West Wing and the president\u2019s ear.Current and former White House and Treasury officials say Mr. Mnuchin has managed to thrive by employing a mix of assertiveness and obsequiousness, staking out his position to the president but quickly changing course to carry out Mr. Trump\u2019s marching orders, even if his message did not win the day.\u201cHe\u2019s kept the focus on the president\u2019s agenda, rather than himself,\u201d said Jason Miller, a former campaign spokesman for Mr. Trump who worked closely with Mr. Mnuchin. \u201cHe\u2019s managed to do it without elevating his profile too high.\u201dThat skill was on display in mid-May, when Mr. Trump tweeted that he was going to find a way to help put back in business a Chinese telecommunications company that had been punished for violating American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. The decision blindsided administration officials and lawmakers, including Democrats who publicly criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s decision and said the president was caving to China.Mr. Mnuchin, along with the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was dispatched to Capitol Hill to try to calm angry Republican lawmakers and explain the rationale behind allowing the company, ZTE, to remain in business. Several of the lawmakers appeared unconvinced and, according to a person who was in the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin advised them to take their concerns directly to the president.He has also learned when to fight and when to toe the president\u2019s line. While colleagues describe Mr. Mnuchin as someone who believes in free markets and views trade barriers as a last resort, those close to the secretary say he has learned to appreciate Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tool.In talks with China, he has been focused on the president\u2019s desire to see the bilateral trade deficit reduced, rather than emphasizing some of the other trade barriers that many lawmakers and executives say put American companies at a disadvantage.Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former top strategist, has said that Mr. Mnuchin is in over his head in the negotiations and that he is letting Mr. Trump\u2019s leverage slip away by failing to force China to make major changes to its industrial policy.David Loevinger, the Treasury Department\u2019s senior coordinator for China from 2009 to 2012, said it was apparent that the Chinese government was trying to elevate Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s role in the negotiations because they see him as the American official most likely to cut a deal.\u201cAmong the possible choices, they see Mnuchin as being less hawkish than some of the other counterparts,\u201d Mr. Loevinger said.Mr. Trump dispatched Mr. Ross to Beijing to continue talks through Monday, but the president has expressed wavering confidence in his deal-making abilities. The China hawks within the administration, Mr. Navarro and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, continue to have sway with Mr. Trump. And populist voices outside the administration have already been heckling Mr. Mnuchin as inept amid reports that the United States was on the verge of making an agreement with China that was viewed as merely symbolic.Mr. Mnuchin has at times found himself the subject of derision, characterized as a fawning banker who cannot tell the president \u201cno.\u201dLast year, the Treasury secretary was scoffed at by economic policymakers from across the political spectrum for insisting that the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts would pay for themselves. Nearly every independent economic analysis found otherwise, and the analysis produced by the department was mocked for its lack of rigor.He has also clashed with some of the more conservative members of the Republican Party. Last year, as the White House pressed lawmakers to raise the ceiling on how much the government can borrow, Mr. Mnuchin told members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to \u201cvote for the debt ceiling for me.\u201d His plea was met with groans and hisses.His stance on social issues has also propelled him into controversy. Last August, fellow alumni of Yale, where Mr. Mnuchin earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, called on the secretary to resign when he defended Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of racially inspired violence in Charlottesville, Va. A month later, Lawrence Summers, a Clinton administration Treasury secretary, called Mr. Mnuchin the \u201cgreatest sycophant in cabinet history\u201d for supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of football players who knelt during the national anthem.Mr. Mnuchin publicly brushes off the criticism and points to his role in successfully steering the Republican tax cut package, which many said would never pass, through Congress.Within the Treasury Department, Mr. Mnuchin has developed a reputation as a micromanager. He resisted choosing a full-time deputy for more than a year, preferring to oversee everything from carrying out the new tax law to overseeing financial sanctions.That has at times created problems. When the Internal Revenue Service systems failed on Tax Day, the response to the crash was slowed because Mr. Mnuchin was in New Hampshire at a tax event with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter. He had required that any big decisions be cleared by him, according to a senior government official.A Treasury spokesman said that this reflected the secretary\u2019s commitment to being hands-on when problems arose and did not slow the response.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s closest aides describe him as a collegial and mentoring figure. Despite his earnest persona on television, he is known to possess a wry sense of humor, even occasionally brandishing impressions from old movies such as \u201cThe Pink Panther Strikes Again\u201d to lighten the mood.But when it comes to the president, Mr. Mnuchin puts up little resistance when policy decisions are made, and he even keeps his pet peeves to himself.While Mr. Mnuchin insists that most people refer to him by his given name, Steven, he does not flinch when Mr. Trump just calls him Steve.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Verizon, a Changing of the Guard as It Pursues 5G", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe telecom giant Verizon said on Friday that it was installing its head of technology as chief executive. The changing of the guard comes at a time when the wireless industry as a whole is grappling with new technologies and a wave of consolidation.The choice of Mr. Vestberg, who has overseen the deployment of next-generation 5G mobile services, underscores the importance Verizon places on that technology, which will greatly increase download speeds and lay the wireless foundation for self-driving cars and smart appliances.\u201cI am humbled to be appointed C.E.O. of Verizon at such an exciting and dynamic time for our company and industry,\u201d Mr. Vestberg said in the statement. \u201cWe are experiencing unprecedented changes in the way users interact in the digital world, and we are racing ahead to remain at the forefront of technology, connectivity and mobility.\u201dAfter leaving his post on Aug. 1, Mr. McAdam, 64, will continue as Verizon\u2019s executive chairman until he retires at the end of the year, the company said.His legacy includes a deal that was years in the making \u2014 the purchase of Vodafone\u2019s stake in Verizon\u2019s wireless business for $130 billion. The transaction gave Mr. McAdam and his team more control over the company\u2019s main business at a crucial time.In addition, Mr. McAdam put together a $3.1 billion deal for Straight Path, a telecommunications company specializing in the network airwaves carrying data, and he led the purchase of Fleetmatics, an Irish company that helps large corporations manage employees on the road, for $2.4 billion.On Mr. McAdam\u2019s watch, the company also flirted with old-school media and entertainment companies, having briefly considered buying the assets of 21st Century Fox before the Walt Disney Company ended up agreeing to acquire them in a $52.4 billion deal. Verizon also expressed interest in the CBS Corporation, according to a lawsuit filed last month by CBS against its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone.While visiting the New York Stock Exchange last month, however, Mr. McAdam sent a strong signal that the company would focus on making 5G technology a reality and would not pursue takeovers of the traditional content companies.\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at that over the years, and we made our decision to go digital,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s why we bought AOL and Yahoo, and we talk now about superchannels of sports and finance and news and some entertainment.\u201dVerizon\u2019s appointment of its chief technology officer to the top spot suggests that the focus on infrastructure will drive the company\u2019s strategy in the years to come. Interestingly, though, Mr. Vestberg, unlike the executive he is set to replace, is not an engineer.Mr. Vestberg began his career in the travel expenses department of Ericsson soon after earning a degree in business administration at the University of Uppsala. During two decades, he worked his way up at the company and was mentored by its chief executive, Carl-Henric Svanberg, who is now the top executive at BP and Volvo. In 2009, Mr. Vestberg replaced his boss, becoming the first chief executive in Ericsson\u2019s long history without an engineering background. In recent years, he has served as the president of the Swedish Handball Federation and the chairman of the Swedish Olympic Committee.A Verizon public relations executive, Bob Varettoni, noted the change in nationality of Verizon\u2019s leadership with a jaunty Twitter post on Friday. It included a photograph taken from the Verizon boardroom in Midtown Manhattan of a huge billboard advertising a Swedish brand, Yupik Parka.Mr. Vestberg will oversee a company of more than 150,000 employees as it navigates an industry undergoing rapid change, with consumers all over the world flocking to wireless devices and online media. The shift has persuaded the industry\u2019s major players to pursue deals to become ever larger and, in some cases, more diverse in their offerings.Other Verizon competitors have been offering more of everything. Comcast, for example, has lured hundreds of thousands of new customers to its mobile phone service by bundling it with cable television plans. In a second line of attack, it has made itself a surprise player for the purchase of the Fox assets \u2014 a potential deal that would require a bid bold enough to upend Fox\u2019s agreement with Disney.Despite Verizon\u2019s recent feints toward old-line companies, Mr. McAdam largely stuck to a strategy of improving the company\u2019s network \u2014 it regularly receives industry accolades for its performance and reach \u2014 and leading the quest for the industry\u2019s latest holy grail: 5G.Last month, Mr. McAdam told CNBC that Verizon would roll out 5G in four cities \u2014 starting with Los Angeles and Sacramento \u2014 by the end of 2018.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Europe, an Unpleasant Question: Confront Trump or Avoid a Costly Trade War", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next move is more complicated and uncertain. Though European leaders project unified resolve in confronting what they portray as American bullying that breaches the rules of global trade, they have not proved adept at setting aside national differences in pursuit of common aims.And Europe at the moment appears especially divided and internally conflicted.Britain is headed for the exits. A potentially destabilizing, populist government just assumed power in Italy. Spain unexpectedly changed leaders as well, while Hungary and Poland are testing the values of the European Union with policies anathema to democracy. In addition, European economic growth appears to be slowing, with factory orders down in Germany.In European corridors of power, anger at the Trump administration is intense \u2014 not just because of the tariffs, but also because of the American decision to revoke support for the Iran denuclearization deal. Yet given the difficulties Europe confronts in orchestrating any policy and given competing economic interests across the 28-nation bloc, Europe is in a compromised position as it squares off with a bellicose American president.Many trade experts assume Europe will be forced to cede ground, further opening its markets to American exports to gain relief from Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs.\u201cThe U.S. is more powerful than the E.U., and the E.U. is facing many challenges,\u201d said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will be strong enough to rally against this. They are not willing to pay the price.\u201dFrance is especially inclined to punish the United States, viewing Mr. Trump\u2019s justification of the tariffs on national security grounds as an affront to the concept of rules-based international trade, as overseen by the World Trade Organization.Germany \u2014 the bloc\u2019s largest economic power \u2014 is reluctant to escalate the conflict, lest tit-for-tat tariffs jeopardize its lucrative exports of automobiles and other industrial goods to American shores.Yet to the extent that tactics may be divined, the Trump administration appears to be deploying the constant threat of tariffs to create uncertainty for business in a bid to force trading partners to accede to American demands.The Trump administration had hoped to use that agreement as a template in extracting similar concessions from the European Union. It suggested the bloc could gain an exemption from the American tariffs so long as it reduced its own duties on American autos while limiting its exports of steel.But European leaders balked at that approach, enraged at what they viewed as demeaning treatment from a longstanding ally.\u201cWe will talk about anything in principle with a country that respects W.T.O. rules,\u201d the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters in Brussels in March, shortly after the Trump administration announced its metals tariffs. \u201cWe will not talk about anything when it is with a gun to our head.\u201dThe Dutch, whose economy is especially tied to trade, were particularly incensed by the Trump administration\u2019s approach. They were joined by other European bloc members still angry that Mr. Trump had withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate accord and, more recently, revoked support for a deal brokered by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, committing Iran to renouncing the production of nuclear weapons.The apparent demise of that deal and the resumption of American sanctions against companies transacting with Iran is expected to cost European firms billions of dollars in sales, with French, German and Italian interests especially vulnerable.All of which has reinforced European predilections to treat the battle over tariffs as a fight the Continent must engage and win, lest the foundations of international cooperation break down, yielding a new era in which rules are eclipsed by raw power.As the word came on Thursday that Europe would not be spared from the American metals tariffs, its leaders quickly declared they would follow through on threats of retaliation.\u201cThis is a bad day for world trade,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, during a speech in Brussels. \u201cWe will immediately introduce a settlement dispute with the W.T.O. and will announce counterbalancing measures in the coming hours.\u201dBut whether that stance can be maintained appeared uncertain.Despite its name, the European Union is not generally a model of unity. If Mr. Trump was banking on internal division stymieing the European response, he picked an opportune moment.Britain is consumed with domestic sniping over its pending departure from the European Union, making it a bit player in these proceedings.\u201cEurope is in disarray,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss, a university in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s even difficult to understand who is in power in Europe.\u201dIn deliberating how to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, the key schism appears to run between Germany and the rest of the bloc.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a unified consensus for how to deal with the Americans,\u201d said Meredith Crowley, an expert on international trade at the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cThe Germans benefit from open markets globally, so they don\u2019t want to throw up more barriers to free trade.\u201dThere is also the not-insignificant question of whether Europe should adhere to the bounds of the World Trade Organization, the referee for global trade disputes.The European position \u2014 one shared by many economists \u2014 is that the Trump administration has undermined the institution\u2019s workings in citing national security as an imperative for its metals tariffs. But if Europe immediately responds with its own tariffs, that would itself violate the organization\u2019s rules, which require the filing of a formal case and a deliberative process requiring months to adjudicate.At a meeting last month with his counterparts from European nations, Peter Altmaier, the German minister for economic affairs, urged that Europe avoid an escalating round of tariffs with the United States, according to European diplomatic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. The German minister suggested that Europe should accept quotas on its exports of steel to the United States as the cost of gaining a permanent exemption from the American metals tariffs.European Commission officials responded angrily to the German proposal, calling for stiff and unequivocal retaliation. They were adamant that the conflict with the United States went well beyond the number of cars or the volume of steel sold to the United States: It presented an existential threat to the rules-based trading system.Publicly, that view carried the day.The list of retaliatory tariffs Europe has prepared for this eventuality is engineered to apply political pressure. The list of products includes bourbon, made in Kentucky, the home state of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and motorcycles, which are made by Harley-Davidson in Wisconsin, the home of Speaker Paul D. Ryan.In seeking to extract an exemption from the tariffs, the European Union was prepared to agree to some sort of deal. According to the diplomatic officials, it floated the possibility of buying large volumes of liquefied natural gas from the United States while joining the Trump administration in pressing to alter the rules of the dispute settlement system at the W.T.O. \u2014 a longstanding American goal.But European leaders insisted they would entertain none of that so long as Mr. Trump threatened tariffs.Now that the threat has become reality, many think Europe will wind up blinking, assenting to some concessions, having learned that Mr. Trump is prepared to go to war.\u201cThe U.S. is now exercising its power,\u201d said Ms. Haugland, the DNB Markets economist. \u201cWhen push comes to shove, the E.U. definitely doesn\u2019t want a trade war.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then a pro-Europe government in Spain suddenly collapsed, even as the bloc\u2019s leaders were contending with trade tariffs imposed by President Trump.The political uncertainty in Europe\u2019s south, combined with yet another humiliation from Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington, has only added to the sense of consternation, if not crisis, on the Continent.In fact, Mr. Trump seemed bent on increasing the pressure on his putative allies in ways that widen fissures both within the European Union and with the United States.\u201cI\u2019d hate to see what\u2019s in store for people who aren\u2019t allies,\u201d said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a German analyst with the Brookings Institution.Every European effort to find compromise \u201chas met with a brutal slapdown, and these things add up,\u201d Ms. Stelzenm\u00fcller said. \u201cWhile Europe now has relatively little leverage against Washington, there will be a moment when the U.S. needs Europe on a major issue \u2014 and what if there\u2019s just silence?\u201dThe growing confrontation with the Trump administration is making some Europeans think about how to make Washington pay a price.Europeans were told to pay attention to deeds, not words and Twitter messages, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, vice president of the German Marshall Fund in Washington. \u201cBut now the actions are piling up,\u201d he said, \u201cand Trump is proving himself not to be a self-proclaimed deal maker, but a deal breaker.\u201dIf restrictions on car imports come next, he said, it will only enhance the growing sentiment in Germany to stop accommodating Mr. Trump, as Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to do, and instead \u201cfind a strong response, so that Europe puts a price on U.S. actions \u2014 this is the language Trump understands.\u201dEuropean governments are now looking into ways to find leverage over Washington, said Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff, a former adviser to the German president.\u201cThat\u2019s not something that occurred to anyone to do for the last 70 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have leverage with Trump, you get pushed around.\u201dMore Germans and Europeans regard traditional trans-Atlanticists as \u201cdinosaurs who don\u2019t understand that Trump has changed the world order, and who are keeping us from drawing necessary conclusions,\u201d Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff said.They want to distance Europe from Washington, build up European autonomy and find new accommodations with Russia and China.But for European governments \u201cthere is a real dilemma here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you put a high price on Trump\u2019s behavior, you\u2019re accelerating the very process of deterioration of the alliance that you don\u2019t want.\u201dIn Brussels, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, told reporters that the bloc\u2019s relationship with the United States had become \u201cless warmhearted.\u201d\u201cThe situation is worrying and could escalate,\u201d she said, but \u201cwe are not escalating the situation.\u201d\u201cThe United States is playing a dangerous game,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said, which risks undermining \u201cthe economic recovery that we have seen lately, notably in the E.U., but also globally.\u201dEven without Mr. Trump\u2019s antagonism, the dangers for Europe are already considerable. The most vexing ones can be found at home.A new Spanish government led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez, a pro-European, is not expected to challenge Brussels. And it may try to calm tensions with independence-minded Catalonia by opening talks on more devolved powers, something the departing prime minister, the center-right politician Mariano Rajoy, refused to do.But Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s government will be a highly vulnerable minority one, and it is likely to usher in a period of weak leadership and potential instability.Even the breath of air taken after Rome finally formed a government was shallow and anxious. The government is a peculiar coalition of the populist left and populist right, one that is deeply euroskeptic, friendly to Russia and confrontational with Brussels.The battles are likely to come not just on economic grounds, but on key European policies on migration and sanctions against Moscow.President Sergio Mattarella of Italy had earlier vetoed an anti-euro economist, Paolo Savona, as finance minister, raising the chilling prospect of new elections that would have effectively been a referendum on membership in the euro.In the end, the two populist party leaders named another finance minister, but pointedly made Mr. Savona the new Europe minister instead. There, he will have cabinet rank and get to annoy other European ministers in Brussels meetings \u2014 including, presumably, the country\u2019s own pro-European foreign minister, Enzo Moavero Milanesi.The new finance minister is Giovanni Tria, a little-known economics professor who in recent opinion pieces has denounced Germany\u2019s trade surplus as an indicator of the failure of the euro.And, of course, the fundamentals of Italy\u2019s economic situation have not changed \u2014 a cumulative debt of over 130 percent of gross domestic product, low growth, high unemployment, and banks with mounds of nonperforming loans.Even if the new government keeps Italy in the euro, it promises to reverse a rise in the retirement age and sharply increase government spending and the fiscal deficit, which could create another credit crisis.\u201cThe magnitude of the increase in the deficit implied by the combined measures will likely violate all E.U. and domestic fiscal rules and put debt on an unsustainable trajectory,\u201d she said.All that is a crisis foretold, with a new budget due in autumn. But there are likely to be other confrontations, with Matteo Salvini \u2014 the leader of the League and the incoming deputy prime minister and interior minister \u2014 vowing a crackdown on migration and the expulsion of up to 500,000 migrants already in Italy.That could force Brussels to start an Article 7 process against Italy for breaking the fundamental commitments to the rule of law.And the new Italian leaders have already expressed their desire to improve relations and trade with Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin.That may mean that the European Union is unable to renew economic sanctions against Russia stemming from its behavior abroad, including its annexation of Crimea, violation of the Minsk accords in eastern Ukraine and the assassination attempt on a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain, which the Kremlin continues to deny.\u201cNo one should relax, given the election result, with 60 percent of legislators on record as euroskeptic, let alone with Salvini\u2019s extreme line on migration and the budget,\u201d said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian diplomat. \u201cWe\u2019re a democracy and you can\u2019t ignore the will of the people, any more than Europeans can ignore that America has elected Trump.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s latest blow against allies, the tariffs, only piles on the humiliation, Mr. Stefanini said.\u201cOn every single major issue in the last 18 months, the Trump administration has made decisions in total disregard of its allies\u2019 position,\u201d he said, listing climate, the Iran nuclear deal, the move of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem and \u201cthis one, tariffs, which clearly hits European economic interests.\u201dAnd now Mr. Trump is threatening restrictions on car imports, which may be aimed at Germany but will also hit France, Britain, Italy and others. \u201cWith good will, Europe has laid down to accommodate Trump and indulge his whims, but it doesn\u2019t pay off,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said.Europeans are concluding that if Mr. Trump \u201cchooses to give priority to being a competitor over being a partner and an ally, then we\u2019ll compete hard.\u201dStill, a post-Brexit Europe that needs NATO and the American nuclear umbrella will work hard not to break the Atlantic link, he said, because the fundamentals of the alliance matter, and no president lasts forever.Milan Schreuer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For House Flippers, Reality Meets Reality TV", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by17 PhotosWatch enough HGTV and flipping houses starts to look easy.At the time, Mr. Levitt, now 41, had recently sold his tech company and was taking care of his wife, who was on bed rest with a difficult pregnancy, and their toddler. He had no background in real estate, design or construction, yet watching all that television convinced him that he could make big money buying, restoring and reselling dilapidated properties.Then a neighbor introduced Mr. Levitt to his brother and sister-in-law, Graham and Krista Blundell, who were flipping houses in the area. By April 2015, Mr. Levitt was at an auction with Mr. Blundell, 44, who previously worked in investment banking, bidding on a vacant house in South Orange.A few weeks earlier, Mr. Levitt had tried to gather information about the property, driving past it after a snowstorm to see if the mail had been collected and the snow had been shoveled, or any other evidence that someone might still live there. He peered in the window and saw standing water in the basement and piles of trash and belongings scattered inside.\u201cIt was like a combination of \u2018Storage Wars\u2019 and \u2018Flip or Flop,\u2019\u201d Mr. Levitt said. \u201cIt was a disaster.\u201dHe and Mr. Blundell won the house, paying $318,000 in cash and hiring a locksmith to let them in. And so, with a cashier\u2019s check and a leap of faith, Mr. Levitt joined the growing ranks of small-time real estate investors who model themselves on spunky TV personalities.Home improvement shows have for some time played a role in America\u2019s relationship with real estate. After the housing market collapsed in 2008, HGTV was criticized for fanning the flames of an overheated market, encouraging a culture of rampant investment that contributed to the eventual bust. Today, the cable network is among the most popular on television, reaching 1.11 million viewers in May.In the New York metro area, home flipping is on the upswing, with flips accounting for 5.6 percent of all 2017 sales, an increase of 29 percent from 2016, according to ATTOM. Most of these investments happen in boroughs other than Manhattan or in the suburbs, primarily because Manhattan prices leave little room for profit. Of the 2,894 properties that were flipped in New York City in 2017, only 187 were in Manhattan, while 1,367 were in Queens, according to data from StreetEasy.The shows \u201cmake it look very easy,\u201d Mr. Levitt said, pointing to deceptively short timelines and unrealistic cost estimates. Where a show might describe a six-week renovation schedule from start to finish, the real world moves at a slower pace.\u201cYou could spend four weeks with an architect before you even get started,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you have to pull permits and that can take another month.\u201dDuring that time, an investor is paying property taxes, insurance and interest on a mortgage or construction loan.\u201cYou\u2019re not seeing pricing. You\u2019re not getting full spectrum of the process,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking through a very small lens.\u201dFrom the bench where he sat, Mr. Levitt watched workers building the framing for an addition that will expand the house from three bedrooms to five. \u201cI pulled up to this house and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to buy it because of the location,\u2019\u201d he recalled. He hopes to list the property in about three or four months for around $900,000.If anyone should understand how far television often is from reality, it would be the producers of home improvement shows \u2014 the ones who spend months following celebrity flippers around with a camera, setting up the drama and delivering the Big Reveal, the moment when the homeowner gets to see the ugly duckling re-emerge as a beautiful swan.In 2015, Mr. Weissman enlisted two Departure employees, Timothy Robbins, 52, an executive producer, and Jennifer Di Lullo, 40, a senior producer, to help him start a new venture off screen. Ms. Di Lullo left her television job to become the project manager for the houses that Mr. Weissman would buy. The first, a five-bedroom in Maplewood, N.J., lost money. The next three netted between $10,000 and $20,000 apiece.Mr. Weissman bought the dilapidated house in November 2016 for $710,000, invested more than $700,000 in it and hopes to net a six-figure return.Renovating the 6,500-square-foot house has been an enormous effort. Ms. Di Lullo has 12 spreadsheets for the 1912 center hall colonial that now has five full bathrooms, two half baths and a chef\u2019s kitchen with Calacatta quartz countertops.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to remember we aren\u2019t doing this for TV,\u201d she said, surrounded by upended furniture that arrived earlier in the day for staging.For television, producers need to finish only what viewers will see within the frame. For one episode that Departure Films produced, the crew painted just two sides of the exterior of a house to get the perfect shot. (T he owners didn\u2019t like the color and planned to repaint it once the filming was done.) But when you are listing a property for sale, everything down to the outlet covers needs to be done before the open house.On the shows, the producers, not the homeowners, call the shots, dictating the finishes and materials that will be featured on screen. For the 25 houses filmed for \u201cVacation House for Free,\u201d no two kitchens looked alike: The audience has to be entertained, after all.Television thrives on drama: The roof is leaking! The foundation is cracked! In real life, nightmare scenarios are just nightmares.At a South Orange six-bedroom that the team flipped in 2017, a toilet started backing up after the house was in contract. An investigation revealed that the waste pipe had been mistakenly removed earlier in the renovation. The error cost $10,000 and meant ripping up a newly laid driveway.\u201cI was not making a TV show, so it was only horrifying,\u201d Ms. Di Lullo said.She and the other team members have brought the HGTV look to their projects, with sconces and chandeliers selected for a universal appeal, rather than a regional one.\u201cThere\u2019s a Jersey style, and we decided not to go that way,\u201d Mr. Robbins said, referring to a Tuscany farmhouse look with dark wood kitchens, stone features and ornate fixtures.The staging they prefer \u2014 heavy on brass, glass and shag \u2014 looks like something you might see on an episode of \u201cFixer Upper.\u201d\u201cHGTV has set the style and the tastes for a large part of America,\u201d Mr. Weissman said. And it has set the style for the Weissman projects, too.Not everyone, of course, wants to mimic the HGTV look. When Sydney Blumstein, an associate broker at Corcoran, decided to invest in real estate in 2014, she was determined to avoid the monotony. She watched the shows religiously, particularly the ones about flipping property, mainly for a lesson in what not to do.Reality TV producers may agonize over the details of things like cabinets, to make sure no kitchen looks like a rerun, but the overall effect tends to be a made-for-TV look, leaving viewers with a nagging sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, one that is often repeated in real life renovations and new construction.\u201cWhat I find fascinating with every renovation show is everybody does the exact same renovation,\u201d said Ms. Blumstein, 34, who has witnessed a homogenization of design in the city\u2019s real estate, too. \u201cI go into these new developments and I\u2019m so bored by them. The only differentiation is what floor you\u2019re on.\u201dSo when she found a dated one-bedroom in the East Village, she saw an opportunity to reimagine it with an anti-HGTV look. She would expose the brick walls and reveal the beams and joists in the ceiling. Her parents, both real estate brokers, agreed that the property was a great investment. In 2014, she bought the 650-square-foot space on East 12th Street for $749,000, and planned to continue living with her parents on East 11th Street during the renovation.Four contractors estimated the work would cost around $120,000 and tried to steer her toward a more traditional look, raising concerns that creativity could cost her buyers. The fifth contractor, however, shared her creative vision and offered to do the work for half the price.\u201cSo, obviously, I hired the $65,000 contractor,\u201d Ms. Blumstein said. \u201cThat was a huge mistake.\u201dOther mistakes followed.The alteration agreement she submitted to the co-op board omitted her plans to expose the ceiling beams and joists. \u201cI was planning on asking for forgiveness instead of permission,\u201d she said.That plan did not go over well. An upstairs neighbor complained that the soundproofing between the two apartments had disappeared with the ceiling.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that the joists that I loved was actually the floor above,\u201d Ms. Blumstein said.The board halted the work and insisted that Ms. Blumstein consult the building\u2019s architect, who charged $350 an hour. To correct her error, she had to reinstall the ceiling, which cost $8,000. The project dragged on for two years, with spiraling costs that soured her relationship with the contractor.She hired a second contractor to fix the mistakes made by the first. The renovation ultimately cost $120,000, exactly what the other contractors had estimated. But she got to express her creativity, using reclaimed materials like floor joists as open shelving and painting the cabinetry a sea-foam green.Going it alone has its downside. By rejecting the more generic style used on television shows, she found herself without a road map, susceptible to rookie mistakes.\u201cThere are 15 different shows showing you how to go from A to B,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wanted to go from A to Paris.\u201dBy the time the work was done in 2016, Ms. Blumstein\u2019s life was no longer the same as it was when she bought the apartment. She now had a fianc\u00e9, Brett Lichtman, so instead of selling the renovated apartment, they moved into it. But the space where Ms. Blumstein had once seen only potential felt cramped.So in January 2018, Ms. Blumstein sold the apartment for around $1 million, making a $90,000 profit, \u201cbut not enough money to pay for the mental torture of the experience,\u201d she said.She and Mr. Lichtman, 33, an event producer, now live in a converted warehouse loft in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that Ms. Blumstein bought with her brother, Cole Blumstein, for $2.4 million.And her dream of being a real estate investor is on hold, at least for the time being. \u201cI think I\u2019ll focus on just one place for the moment,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Major Cases Where Justice Kennedy Left His Mark", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJustice Anthony M. Kennedy served as the decisive vote in several closely watched cases during his tenure. Here are some major decisions where he left his mark. For much of his 30-year tenure on the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy served as the decisive vote in several closely watched, divisive cases. His retirement at the end of next month will pave the way for a contentious fight to determine the future direction of the Supreme Court. A Trump appointee would likely create a five-member conservative majority that would potentially cripple or undo previous rulings on abortion rights, affirmative action and the death penalty \u2014 cases where Justice Kennedy left his mark by siding with the four liberal justices. The following are some of the landmark cases where Justice Kennedy served as the deciding factor. On GAY RIGHTS\u201cNo longer may this liberty be denied,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority in the historic decision. \u201cNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were.\u201dJustice Kennedy was joined by the four more liberal justices on the court at the time in declaring that the plaintiffs in the case sought \u201cequal dignity in the eyes of the law.\u201dVote count: 5-4 On ABORTIONAt the time, legal experts said it was the only case in which Justice Kennedy had found an abortion restriction unconstitutional in his 28 years on the Supreme Court.Vote count: 5-4 Justice Kennedy was a crucial vote in the 2016 case that reaffirmed and strengthened constitutional protections for abortion rights, striking down parts of a restrictive Texas law that could have drastically reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state, leaving them only in the largest metropolitan areas. Vote count: 5 -3 On AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONJustice Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in 2016, was a critical vote in the unexpected decision to deny a challenge to a race-conscious admissions program at the University of Texas at Austin. He had never before voted to uphold an affirmative action plan, and had dissented in the last affirmative action case before this one. \u201cConsiderable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote on behalf of himself and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.\u201cBut still,\u201d he added, \u201cit remains an enduring challenge to our nation\u2019s education system to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity.\u201dVote count: 4-3 On ELECTIONS AND CAMPAIGN finance Justice Kennedy, along with Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, were the only two justices whose names did not appear separately on any of the other opinions, signaling that one or either wrote the unsigned majority opinion. \u201cWe are presented with a situation where a state court with the power to assure uniformity has ordered a statewide recount with minimal procedural safeguards,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cWhen a court orders a statewide remedy, there must be at least some assurance that the rudimentary requirements of equal treatment and fundamental fairness are satisfied.\u201dVote count: 5-4 \u201cIf the First Amendment has any force,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority, \u201cit prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.\u201dPresident Barack Obama criticized the decision as a victory for \u201cpowerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans.\u201d It overruled two precedents: a 1990 decision that upheld restrictions on corporate spending to endorse or oppose political candidates and a 2003 decision that upheld the part of a bipartisan law that restricted campaign spending by corporations and unions.Vote count: 5-4 On GUN RIGHTS The case marked the first time in nearly 70 years that the Supreme Court weighed in on the meaning of the Second Amendment. The opinion, which Justice Kennedy signed on to, rejected the argument that the \u201cright of the people to keep and bear arms\u201d applied to gun ownership only in connection to service in the \u201cwell regulated militia\u201d referenced in the amendment.Vote count: 5-4 On Capital PunishmentA sharply divided Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the death penalty was unconstitutional as a punishment for crimes against individuals other than murder. The decision spared the lives of the only two men in the country who had been sentenced to death for child rape.Justice Kennedy, again writing for the liberal majority, said there was \u201ca distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individual persons,\u201d even when considering \u201cdevastating\u201d crimes like the rape of a child. Vote count: 5-4 Justice Kennedy sided with the court\u2019s liberal wing in 2014 to impose more limitations on capital punishment, ruling that Florida\u2019s I.Q. score cutoff was too stringent in deciding which mentally ill individuals should be spared from the death penalty. The ruling affected a handful of other states in requiring them to take a less mechanical approach to mental disability when considering capital punishment.  \u201cThe death penalty is the gravest sentence our society may impose,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPersons facing that most severe sanction must have a fair opportunity to show that the Constitution prohibits their execution. Florida\u2019s law contravenes our nation\u2019s commitment to dignity and its duty to teach human decency as the mark of a civilized world.\u201dVote count: 5-4Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Koch Steps Down From Business and Conservative Political Group", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavid H. Koch, the billionaire industrialist who combined his vast wealth and libertarian-tinged brand of conservatism to influence candidates and campaigns at all levels of American politics, is stepping away from his political and business interests because of declining health, his company announced Tuesday.Mr. Koch\u2019s brother Charles said in a letter to employees at Koch Industries, the company the two controlled, that David Koch\u2019s health problems had made it impossible for him to continue working. \u201cUnfortunately these issues have not been resolved and his health has continued to deteriorate,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by this.\u201dWith millions of dollars in donations over the years, the Kochs\u2019 contribution to today\u2019s Republican Party has been seminal, helping to solidify doctrine that favored businesses and worked against stricter environmental regulations. Now, the absence of David Koch, 78, who was the more public and political of the brothers, will inevitably raise questions about whether the Kochs\u2019 mission will shift further toward nonpolitical endeavors.The family\u2019s network had already started to scale back its campaign work and focus more of its efforts on issues like criminal justice and sentencing reform as David Koch\u2019s health worsened and he took on a smaller portfolio.People close to the brothers, who are two of the world\u2019s wealthiest men, said that over the last three years David Koch became a much less frequent presence in the social and political circles he once ran in at the highest levels. Koch Industries did not disclose the nature of his illness.The Kochs have been a driving force behind the Republican Party\u2019s gains over the last decade, not just at the federal level but also at the state and local level where they recognized and seized an opportunity to install conservative lawmakers while Democrats were far more focused on higher office.Americans for Prosperity played a pivotal role in the 2010 elections that put Republicans back into power in the House of Representatives \u2014 and catapulted the Kochs from relative obscurity to the center of the country\u2019s political debate. The group provided much of the financial and organizational backing that helped the Tea Party movement become a national force.Democrats accused the Kochs of using their money to back candidates who would be friendly to their pro-business, deregulatory vision, and tried to turn the brothers into the poster children for a broken and abused campaign finance system.As the brothers\u2019 political ambitions expanded and they created a larger coalition of Koch-affiliated groups aimed at mobilizing various constituencies \u2014 including Latinos, veterans and small-government conservatives \u2014 their network became almost a shadow political party with a sophisticated data-gathering operation and employees all over the country.The 2016 election, however, changed their outlook and caused them to dial back their political efforts. They would have preferred almost any candidate to Donald J. Trump, whom they viewed as unserious and unwedded to any principle beyond self-advancement, and worked to promote a number of his competitors for the Republican nomination, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin.The president\u2019s view that American trade policy needs to be more restrictive and punitive toward large partners like China is also antithetical to how the Kochs see economic policy.Once Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee, they shifted their political giving away from the presidential campaign to focus exclusively on congressional races.On Tuesday, when Charles Koch wrote to company employees to inform them of his brother\u2019s retirement, his words read at times like a eulogy. \u201cMy thoughts of David will always be overflowing with the experiences, challenges, laughter and love of our life together,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDavid has always been a fighter and is dealing with this challenge in the same way.\u201dRobin Pogrebin and Liam Stack contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Is Coming to Its Financial Senses. That Has Its Own Risks.", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla, the electric car company defined by the moonshot mentality of its chief executive, Elon Musk, has started to act with apparent caution.Still, sizable layoffs and moves to conserve cash typically are not the acts of growth companies that are having just a little trouble achieving their goals.And there is a danger for Tesla if it starts to behave like a normal company: Investors may start to value it as one, and its high-flying stock may tumble.For most of Tesla\u2019s history, Mr. Musk has proposed groundbreaking new products and convinced investors to finance them. The challenges of this approach became clear with the Model 3, a sedan aimed at a broader customer base than its previous cars. Its production problems have weighed on Tesla\u2019s cash flows, leading some analysts to predict that the company will have to raise more money in the markets.Mr. Musk has said that he does not plan to ask investors for more money in the coming months, and Tesla\u2019s reduced capital expenditure forecast and the new push for profitability appear to be part of his efforts to avoid that. But even if this rough patch passes, and the company makes it through it without raising significant amounts of new capital, investors may be less willing to believe in the next grand vision.That may force the company to take a more circumspect approach to growth and how it communicates its dreams.Of course, a more conservative approach would reduce the chance that Tesla will face cash shortages. And shareholders would get a more dependable grasp of Tesla\u2019s future profitability.But investors would probably then value the company much more on its core current earnings and place much less emphasis on products that are years from production. That could weigh heavily on its shares. Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Cowen, forecasts that Tesla will make $8.73 per share in 2020. If Tesla traded at 20 times those earnings \u2014 a multiple well above that of the wider stock market \u2014 the company\u2019s stock would change hands at $175, roughly half the level of where it closed on Tuesday.Becoming sensible may save Tesla. But perhaps not its stock price.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Larry Silverstein Flees the \u2018Old Fogeys\u2019 of Midtown", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy, after 33 years of living in a Park Avenue high rise, has New York developer Larry A. Silverstein decided to leave Midtown for Lower Manhattan?\u201cIt was full of old fogeys,\u201d Mr. Silverstein, 87, said recently about his longtime home. He was sitting in his corner office on the 38th floor of 7 World Trade Center, beneath a wall-mounted skateboard emblazoned with an image of the downtown skyline \u2014 a housewarming gift from his employees. Behind him, three humidifiers crowded his desk, misting at full blast.\u201cI felt it was a wonderful opportunity to come down to an area we had just finished, with a population that is all young,\u201d said Mr. Silverstein, who has been instrumental in the rebuilding of the World Trade Center complex.Last month, he and his wife, Klara, moved into an 80th-floor penthouse at 30 Park Place, an 82-story limestone tower completed by Silverstein Properties in 2016. Their roughly 6,200-square-foot, four-bedroom apartment comes with a terrace overlooking his office \u2014 not to mention most of Manhattan, New Jersey and parts beyond. He bought the full-floor unit for $32.6 million.\u201cIf you look far enough,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can see the curvature of the Earth.\u201dMr. Silverstein isn\u2019t the typical empty nester looking for a change of pace. As the chairman of Silverstein Properties, his move downtown into a building just minutes from the World Trade Center site is an endorsement of an area that remains a work in progress. With the opening this week of 3 World Trade Center, his firm\u2019s third completed office tower at the site, he sees another chance to raise the profile of Lower Manhattan. The area south of Chambers Street that includes Battery Park City and the financial district has undergone major changes since 2001, roughly tripling its population to 61,000, according to Jessica Lappin, the president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business-improvement organization. The median age of residents there is 32, she said, about five years younger than the median age in Manhattan.Meanwhile, in the nearly 17 years since the attacks, other pockets of the city also have redeveloped, adding competition for both the residential and commercial markets of Lower Manhattan.In the first quarter of this year, 818,391 square feet of commercial space was leased downtown, the least of the city\u2019s major office markets, said Richard Persichetti with Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial brokerage. The average commercial rent was $59 a square foot, about 23 percent cheaper than Midtown. The quarter finished almost 40 percent below its average over the last 10 years, he said, and \u201ccould point to signs of concern.\u201d In May, though, leasing looked stronger, he said.Lower Manhattan \u201chas a residual perception as a back-office location,\u201d said M. Myers Mermel, chief executive of TenantWise, a real estate advisory firm, adding that office space downtown leases for around $25 a square foot less than comparable space at Hudson Yards in Midtown, despite having more transportation options. Many prospective tenants still view Midtown as the premier area for office headquarters, he said, while others may have reservations about relocating so close to the site of the attacks. Companies are also eyeing the newly rezoned Midtown East, where a slate of new projects is expected, he said.The residential market in Lower Manhattan is also changing. \u201cIt\u2019s a market in transition, from 9-to-5 to 24/7,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, a New York real estate appraiser, referring to pockets of the area that can still feel isolated on nights and weekends.In the first quarter, the median sales price in the area fell to $1,105,000, a 31 percent drop from the same period in 2017 \u2014 the steepest decline of any submarket in the borough, according to a Douglas Elliman report. The decline reflects, in part, a large number of new luxury condo sales that closed last year, pulling this quarter\u2019s numbers down. But that doesn\u2019t account for the entire drop-off, said Mr. Miller, who prepared the data. \u201cI think it\u2019s a reset, just like in the greater market,\u201d he said, referring to the softening of prices at the top of the market.There are other challenges. Frances Katzen, an agent with Douglas Elliman, said quirks to buying in parts of the area have scared away some clients. In Battery Park City, the land is owned by a public authority that charges developers a payment in lieu of taxes, which can inflate monthly carrying costs. For instance, condos in Battery Park City listed for an average of $1,523 a square foot, practically the same as in Murray Hill, according to Gabby Warshawer with CityRealty, a real estate data website. But the average combined cost of common charges and taxes in Battery Park City was $3,466 a month, about $1,000 more than the Midtown neighborhood.But new condo developments, like Mr. Silverstein\u2019s 30 Park Place, are in a different class. Located on the cusp of the more affluent downtown neighborhood of TriBeCa, the 157-unit project has just 18 unsold units left (sales began in 2014), with an average price of around $7.2 million, said Rob Vecsler, president of Residential Development at Silverstein.The tower, designed by the firm of Robert A.M. Stern, has a Four Seasons hotel at its base, which offers its services to condo residents. The remaining units range in price from $6.7 million to $30 million for the smaller penthouse above Mr. Silverstein\u2019s.To help entice buyers, the developer agreed to pay a total of $20.5 million toward residents\u2019 common charges over five years, lowering the fees from $2.20 a square foot to 84 cents a square foot, Mr. Vecsler said.After a recent tour of their 80th-floor apartment, Mr. and Mrs. Silverstein stood on a private terrace overlooking the site\u2019s mammoth towers. Helicopters whirred above and below.\u201cIn the beginning, people thought we were crazy,\u201d Mrs. Silverstein said about their move, calling it \u201ca complete departure\u201d from their longtime Midtown home and its views of Central Park. But it has brought them closer to their daughter, Lisa Silverstein, an executive vice president at Silverstein Properties, who lives in the tower with her family. It has also meant a much shorter commute for Mr. Silverstein, who is spry at 87, but not bold enough to ride his new skateboard to work.Plus, it takes time to change people\u2019s minds, Mr. Silverstein added, wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s only been 17 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was the end of our family\u2019s innocence and the start of a yearslong battle against substances.Our job as parents got even harder when the law turned against us. In 2012, with our boys on the verge of high school in Seattle, the state of Washington approved Initiative 502, which would begin to phase in legalized marijuana. It was as if the electorate had conspired to legalize arson, or dropped the drinking age to 14. My wife and I felt betrayed.How were we supposed to raise drug-free boys in a drug-happy city? How was I to enforce \u201cjust say no\u201d in one of the kush-friendliest states in the nation?We\u2019d lost a vital tool, as did parents in Colorado and D.C., followed by six more states, and potentially more to come. In the years since, each time I read about another state tilting toward legalization, I\u2019d think, Oh, you poor parents \u2026 Do you know what\u2019s coming? Legalization triggered a cat-and-mouse game in our house. We\u2019d find glass bowls in sock drawers, rolling papers in jeans pockets, shredder devices and Phillies Blunts packages in backpacks, a bong behind the furnace. Incriminating evidence practically fell into my lap. \u201cBut pot is legal,\u201d the boys would say in response to any attempt at pot-shaming them.They\u2019d roll their eyes. Whatever, Dad.Seattle had long been a land of \u201cjust say yes.\u201d Legalization created an even deeper sense of tolerance. It seemed too easy for my kids to get weed \u2014 easier than booze, and easier to hide.I drafted a \u201cRules of the House\u201d list, the first of which was: \u201cNo drugs or drug paraphernalia in the house.\u201d They both hated the \u201cD\u201d word. In their view, pot was a plant, not a drug.The other rules were an attempt to set benchmarks for grades, attendance, curfews, chores and jobs. But they all tied back to rule No. 1. I made them sign the document.I love my boys. Love their passion for skateboarding, their clutch of goofy friends, their independence and street smarts and their persistent search for fun. And as a smoker in high school, I wasn\u2019t totally na\u00efve. I knew some version of this was coming, as did my wife. I just didn\u2019t expect that I\u2019d be dealing with my state government endorsing \u2014 if not encouraging \u2014 my kids\u2019 stoner-skater-slacker lifestyle.Decriminalization turned my house rules into a house joke. Stalking my sons on Twitter and Instagram, I\u2019d find arty photos of fat blunts and baggies of bud. If I found anything \u2014 rolling papers, bowls, baggies, bongs \u2014 I\u2019d toss it into a neighbor\u2019s garbage can. They\u2019d accuse me of violating their privacy, of \u201cstealing my stuff.\u201d I\u2019d ground them and confiscate their skateboards.By 2015, with legalization in full bloom, Seattle had become a stoner mecca. Pot tourists lined up out the door at shops like Uncle Ike\u2019s and descended on the annual Hemp Fest. A family friend got into a pot finance group; a journalist friend started reporting for the cannabis industry. We met growers, sellers, financiers. Betrayal, betrayal, betrayal.\u201cIt\u2019s only POT,\u201d they\u2019d insist, with more eye rolls. \u201cIt helps me relax,\u201d they\u2019d say.My older son later tucked a Sharpie-written note inside that book: \u201cSERIOUSLY?!\u201dNothing my wife and I said or did, from punishment to lecture, seemed to make enough of a dent. Not until we began experimenting with containment, in place of zero tolerance. If you have to smoke, I\u2019d tell them, just keep it out of the house, or wait for the weekend, or at least until after you\u2019ve finished homework. Sometimes they complied, sometimes not. But for us to survive as a family, some form of acceptance had to be part of the solution. Some nights we\u2019d have to decide how to handle two giggly, watery-eyed teenagers at the dinner table. My wife\u2019s approach was to stay positive: How was school? Did you have a nice day? What\u2019s for homework? I\u2019d sit there sipping a beer, and stewing. In time, we reluctantly inched toward a more hands-off approach. We threatened rehab or wilderness camp or kicking them out if things veered too far. We grounded them when they skipped class, praised them when they brought home A\u2019s. We bent our own rules, and let Jeff Spicoli into our home. Prohibition wasn\u2019t the answer.It wasn\u2019t always pretty. We talked to them. We yelled. We kept the pressure on. We never gave up or gave in. We compromised. We enforced. We punished. We wept.Our tactics changed daily. We swung from despondent to hopeful and back. We persevered. We kept our kids close.And now? With our boys out of high school, out into the world of college and jobs, I can look back and say that, for us, trying to ban pot from our home was a failed policy. Our story is neither a victory for cannabis nor a defeat for drug-free parenting. Other parents may roll their eyes at this, but I view it simply as our family\u2019s means of survival. On a recent trip to see my youngest at college, in a Pacific Northwest town in Canada \u2014 where medical marijuana and beer are legal at age 18, and where fully legalized pot is coming soon \u2014 we found ourselves in front of an \u201cartisanal\u201d pot shop. \u201cWell?\u201d I said to my 19-year-old. \u201cShall we?\u201d I filled out a form, listing my medical condition as arthritis (true), and a tattooed young woman sold me a gram of sweet-smelling bud called Purple White Lightning and a bottle of 20:1 Sleepytime tincture. My son bought a tan-papered pre-rolled blunt of a joint.We later shared beers at a rooftop bar, and I looked over at my (suddenly) A-student college kid, and silently toasted away those wasted years of conflict and chaos.Advertisement"}

The tour roused her curiosity and led to two decades of work that challenged her to create living facilities for humans in the rarefied environment of space.\u201cHow could the child of a historian resist?\u201d she said in an interview with Metropolis magazine in 1999. \u201cThis is a big historical effort of our time.\u201dA full-size prototype of TransHab was built, but the project never received the government financing that was needed to deploy it to outer space.She added: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be conducting lab experiments next to someone on a treadmill. Remember, in microgravity, sweat floats. It\u2019s gross.\u201dThe prototype comprised 12,000 cubic feet of living quarters, communal spaces, a galley, a sick bay and work and exercise areas, all protected by thick, bulletproof woven Kevlar.Ms. Adams\u2019s role focused on the human and performance aspects of the interior design.\u201cShe was very persistent and determined,\u201d Mr. Kennedy, who recently retired from NASA, said in a telephone interview. \u201cShe was a strong, independent thinker who was not shy about sharing her thoughts and views and stood up for what she thought was right in the design.\u201dMarc M.

An elite Chinese think tank affiliated with the government warned this week that the chances of a financial panic had risen significantly, shaking markets even more.Chinese officials are trying to help factories deal with American tariffs by weakening the value of the country\u2019s currency.

The country\u2019s main stock index lost nearly 1 percent on Thursday.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what Trump is going to do next,\u201d said Hong Hao, the chief market strategist in the international unit of the Bank of Communications, one of China\u2019s biggest banks. \u201cNormally at this level, there should be a technical rebound.\u201dChina\u2019s moves with its currency reflect its difficult balancing act. The Chinese central bank has guided the currency steadily lower against the dollar, particularly in the past two weeks, as the likelihood of further American tariffs on Chinese goods has increased. The currency is down more than 5 percent from its peak in February.The value of the renminbi has fallen somewhat faster lately in the less-regulated Hong Kong market than in Shanghai trading. A widening gap between the two markets has long been a sign that investors are worried about the currency.China faces still more obstacles. The United States Federal Reserve has begun raising short-term interest rates. That increases the cost of borrowing money for Americans and, given the vast influence of the American economy, for the rest of the world. Such rate increases have caused unpleasant economic surprises worldwide in the past, which could hurt China if growth slows in the markets where it sells its goods.As if investors did not already have enough to worry about in China, a deeply pessimistic internal government analysis has widely circulated on social media this week. The analysis was written by Li Yang, the chairman of the National Institution of Finance and Development, a Beijing-based research group, and by three other economists.A person who picked up the phone at the think tank said that the document was genuine and that its release had not been intended.The document said that with \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes and the long-term and highly uncertain trade conflicts between China and the United States, we believe that in China there is currently a high probability of financial panic.\u201dOther economists cautioned that the analysis should not necessarily be treated as representing a consensus view within the Chinese government.Mr. Li has a reputation as being more bearish during financial crises than other Chinese government economists. He has also used periods of financial stress in China to oppose economic reformers who seek the opening up of the country\u2019s financial system to greater competition and more international flows of money, Mr. Hong said.The document leaked this week said that the way to prevent a financial panic was to create a separate stabilization fund to prop up the currency, rather than selling dollars and shrinking the money supply. Such a move could help insulate China\u2019s economy, because reducing the money supply makes it harder for families and businesses to borrow for purchases and investments, from buying an apartment to building a factory.By contrast, many economic reformers say that China would benefit from more openness. The closed Chinese financial system tends to steer money to state-owned enterprises instead of smaller and more entrepreneurial private sector businesses.Predictions by the report\u2019s authors aren\u2019t gospel, said Qian Qimin, the director of wealth management research at Shenwan Securities, a Shanghai brokerage.\u201cThey consider problems from a theoretical perspective and they look forward and alert government to the worst consequences, which is understandable,\u201d he said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Cement Giant Lafarge Indicted on Terror Financing Charge in Syria", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a rare move against a major French corporation, a panel of French judges appointed by the Paris High Court also charged the company, Lafarge SA, with violating a European Union embargo on oil purchases. The judges said they would investigate the company for endangering the lives of its employees, as well, in order to keep its Syrian cement plant running as the conflict worsened.The investigation underscores the costs and complexity of doing business in war-torn regions, a challenge faced by companies around the world, especially those in the energy and industrial sectors. In the case of Lafarge, those trade-offs have left it exposed to a French criminal investigation and a lawsuit by 11 former employees, who claim that the company ignored the dangers they faced, and pressured them to keep working.The case centers on Lafarge\u2019s operations in Syria in the years after 2011, when protests against the rule of the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad erupted, eventually leading to a civil war. While other multinational companies pulled out of Syria, Lafarge made a calculated decision to stay.They said Lafarge made payments to the Islamic State and other armed groups to provide free passage for employees to and from the cement plant, and to resolve sporadic kidnappings by militant factions, accounts backed up by the court documents, which include testimony by former Lafarge executives to French investigators. The former employees also provided accounts of a work environment in which Lafarge\u2019s local managers threatened to dismiss or cut the pay of those who balked at the worsening safety situation.The panel of French judges is examining whether Lafarge and the former executives violated international sanctions by paying the Islamic State and other armed groups to keep operating. They are also reviewing the extent to which Lafarge funneled money to intermediaries who conducted negotiations with the Islamic State, as well as Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria and other factions, to move supplies and employees through dangerous areas, and to secure raw materials.All told, Lafarge agents shelled out over $5 million to armed groups, according to the French court documents, which also include company correspondence and a confidential internal review of Lafarge\u2019s Syria operations by the global law firm Baker McKenzie.All of the former Lafarge executives have denied the charges against them, which could be dropped if judges find the evidence insufficient. The charges against Lafarge SA could also be dropped.Nonetheless, the decision by the judges to place the company under formal examination means the authorities believe they have serious evidence that could result in a prosecution.\u201cThis case must create a precedent for all the corporations that fuel armed conflicts,\u201d the group said in a statement. Sherpa said it would press Lafarge to open an independent compensation fund for former employees.It is rare for international companies anywhere to face charges for crimes against humanity. Of a handful of cases brought in the past, most have been abandoned. Among them was a 2008 lawsuit brought by Burmese refugees against the French oil giant Total, which accused the company of providing logistical support and financing to the Burmese junta that allegedly engaged in forced labor, executions and torture. The case, brought in a Belgian court, was ultimately dismissed.In the Lafarge case, Sherpa is arguing that crimes committed by the Islamic State in Syria between 2013 and 2015 must be considered crimes against humanity, and that Lafarge acted as an accomplice by financing the group to keep cement flowing at its Syrian plant, and by failing to ensure the security of its employees.Elian Peltier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Prince Who Would Remake the World", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "OpinionIn Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Saudi Arabia, women will take the wheel. How much is really changing?Supported byOpinion ColumnistAt the approach of members of the Saudi religious police, whose official mission is to promote virtue and prevent vice, she reached for her head scarf. She did not, however, put it on. Enough already, she thought.\u201cCover your head!\u201d the agents ordered her.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d they muttered, \u201cmay God protect you.\u201dWith that, the bearded enforcers limped away. They used to descend on stores that sell the shapeless black gowns called abayas imposed on Saudi women, scoop up those with any adornment \u2014 a trace of color, beads \u2014 and burn them. No longer: These once-feared upholders of a puritanical Islamic order are now defanged \u2014 completely neutered, as the woman put it to me.The prince\u2019s apparent aim is to upend just about everything, except the absolute rule exercised since 1932 by the House of Saud, with the help of oil and American power. He wants to liberalize, at least economically and socially, and so demonstrate that Islam, in the nation of its holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, is not a harsh, unbendable rule book based on ancient scripture but is rather compatible with modernity and tolerance.That\u2019s a bold project. The prince\u2019s father, the 82-year-old King Salman, is \u201cthe custodian of the two holy mosques.\u201d Custodianship is a conservative business. Look no further than Egypt\u2019s assassinated Anwar el-Sadat or the toppled shah of Iran to see the fate of tradition-trampling Westernizing leaders of Muslim Middle Eastern states. Saudi Arabia is not any such state. It\u2019s the lodestar.Perhaps his most radical proposition is the empowerment of women because the genuine liberation \u2014 and that\u2019s still in doubt \u2014 of half the Saudi population would transform the country and send a clear message of a modernized Islam.The prince\u2019s makeover could, in theory, change more than Saudi Arabia. Five times a day many of the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims turn toward the country in prayer. \u201cWhen people look at Saudi Arabia, see Mecca and Medina, they want to emulate it,\u201d the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told me in an interview. \u201cWhen they see openness and moderation and tolerance and innovation, that\u2019s what they want to be.\u201d No other country, he argued, has \u201cthat soft power.\u201dIn other words, change Islam in its Saudi nucleus and you change the world. It was not, of course, Saudi moderation that put 15 Saudis on the 9/11 planes. It was the well-funded metastasis of extreme Saudi religious intolerance \u2014 its Wahhabi orthodoxy \u2014 into forms of murderous Islamist hatred of the apostate West. It was the House of Saud\u2019s unseemly deal with fundamentalist clerical firebrands: Spare us here at home, and we\u2019ll grant you license abroad.It could still be that M.B.S. is the great Make Believe Show. But something is moving. Cynicism is too facile. \u201cI get annoyed with the West telling us the changes are cosmetic,\u201d Hoda Abdulrahman al-Helaissi, one of the first female members of the Shura Council, an advisory body to the king, told me. \u201cWe are changing at the rate of a high-speed train, not of a rocket. Young people, and 70 percent of the population is under 30, don\u2019t want to live as we lived. The prince understood we have to pull the tooth from the mouth!\u201dPrince Mohammed is everywhere, even when, as in recent weeks, he scales back his public appearances. I went to see Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, the economy minister, to find out how the heir to the throne operates. He told me he\u2019d met six times with the crown prince the previous week. M.B.S. fires rat-tat-tat questions at him: What do you need from me? What do you think of that crowd-management software for the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca? How do we make things happen? One meeting took place at 4 a.m.Things are happening, all right. A new Jeddah airport opened last month. The Riyadh subway will begin operation next year. Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil giant, is to be partly privatized. Ground has just been broken near Riyadh on a vast, multibillion-dollar \u201centertainment city\u201d that will include a Six Flags theme park and create 50,000 Saudi jobs, the minister said.Instead of husbands ferrying their wives around, women will be able to drive from A to B. Saudization of the work force is also feminization. \u201cOur preference ultimately is no difference between men and women in terms of involvement and seniority in the economy,\u201d the minister said.Rulers over 80, a Saudi norm, may be wise, but they are not risk-takers. Now, with the crown prince, gradualism is gone. It\u2019s all \u201cVision 2030,\u201d his slogan, and K.P.I.s (key performance indicators) on a forced march to a less oil-dependent country of mass tourism, empowered women, renewable energy, theme parks and the rest.Believe it if you will. This is the Saudi Arabia the crown prince sought to sell during a three-week American roadshow that ended in April. From Trump to Richard Branson, from Jeff Bezos to Oprah Winfrey, he peddled his message of reinvention and urged American investors to join the party. The second school is the pride-before-a-fall faction. They see a rash leader, as corrupt as those he\u2019s accused of corruption, embarked on the helter-skelter pursuit of modernization as he reinforces rule by royal decree, cutting subsidies even as he acquired a French chateau for several hundred million dollars. \u201cM.B.S. is erratic, irrational and immature,\u201d Samer Shehata, a professor of Middle East studies at the University of Oklahoma, told me. \u201cIs he really the man who can reconcile Saudi Arabia with the modern world?\u201dAt a restaurant, over rice and lamb, I met with a man in his 30s, a former journalist who\u2019s taken himself off Twitter and decided to go abroad for a few years to sit out what he sees as an unpredictable, troubling moment. What sort of transformation, he asked me, includes no political change and shuts the door on more freedom? In what kind of society are you a national security risk if you question the bungled war in Yemen? Saudi society, he mused, never challenges the government \u2014 as a public, press or parliament. Nor, it seems, will it any time soon.In a transition to democracy, the core question is often the degree to which civilian leaders can bring the military under control. But democracy is a nonstarter in Saudi Arabia. In the hybrid Saudi transition, the question is how far the Wahhabi religious conservatism that created security problems around the world, and made Saudi Arabia a very repressive place, can be curtailed on the way to \u201cnormality.\u201d Judged on that basis, I\u2019d say Prince Mohammed\u2019s chances of success are good for two reasons: He has amassed tremendous power, and tens of millions of restive young Saudis back him.That sounded much more like a needed Saudi mea culpa.A huge CNN screen behind the minister churned through stock prices, Trump and tumult. It\u2019s a reactionary moment in world affairs, yet maybe, just maybe, Saudi Arabia can inch in the other direction under the crown prince. Tuwaijri said: \u201cI'm not sure if the pace is sustainable. But 90 percent of the time he's cool.\u201d The minister paused before adding, \u201cAnd he's ready to change his mind.\u201dCould the Saudi prince, Qataris wonder, be suffering from a touch of pique and envy? Certainly, he has shown recklessness, both here and in Yemen, where the military coalition Saudi Arabia leads has been placed on a United Nations \u201clist of shame\u201d for the killing and maiming of children.The thrust was clear: To heck with Big Brother\u2019s demands to shut down Al Jazeera and cut off all relations with Iran!In response, Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, was equally defiant. I asked him in Riyadh why Saudi Arabia \u2014 along with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt \u2014 had imposed the blockade. \u201cHate!\u201d he said. \u201cInterfering in our affairs, paying money to terrorists.\u201d He urged Qatar \u201cto move from denial to introspection,\u201d adding that \u201cuntil they change, we\u2019re not going to talk to them.\u201dThe Qatar blockade was imposed on June 5, 2017, two weeks after Trump\u2019s lovefest in Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip as president. Trump exulted on Twitter: This was a blow to \u201cradical ideology.\u201d The president has since tried to row back his elation, and he hosted Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar at the White House in April. The fact is that neither Saudi Arabia nor Qatar is innocent when it comes to having funded Islamist extremism.Trump, at heart, has no interest in the details. His uncritical embrace of Saudi Arabia reflects a radical gut-driven, money-tinged reorientation of American foreign policy in the Middle East.This infuriated Saudis and the United Arab Emirates. It terrified them. In Trump they saw opportunity, plying him with flattery and blandishments. He has duly shredded Obama\u2019s attempted Saudi-Iranian rebalancing.The problem is Iran is a big, resource-rich country. Qatar and Iran share the world\u2019s biggest gas field. As Thani, the Qatari foreign minister, told me, Qatar has \u201clegitimate reason to have a relationship with Iran.\u201d In fact, it has no choice. But for Trump, and Prince Mohammed, any tie with Iran is heinous. Several times from Saudi ministers I heard Iran compared to Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime. The crown prince himself uses the analogy. This is pure Iran Derangement Syndrome. Iran is a repressive country with a hideous human rights record (just like Saudi Arabia) and an expansionist agenda in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. It needs to be confronted, with great firmness and creative diplomacy. It will not, however, surrender to Trump\u2019s braggadocio or Prince Mohammed\u2019s absolute demands, which play into the hands of Iranian hard-liners. So, as the United Arab Emirates\u2019 ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba, told me over lunch in Washington, a big push went into backing the counterrevolution \u2014 that is, along with Saudi Arabia, plying tens of billions of dollars into backing the movement that ousted Morsi and installing as president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, whose repression of the Brotherhood has been brutal.This is the fundamental disagreement with Prince Mohammed, the basic Middle Eastern schism. He is betting that he can crush the Brotherhood and its sympathizers in Qatar, as well as crush Iran and its sympathizers in Yemen.Three years after it began, the Yemen war continues unabated, with widespread starvation, cholera, thousands dead, accounts of indiscriminate Saudi bombing of hospitals and schools, Houthi missiles being fired into Saudi Arabian towns, and spreading misery. If the prince can indeed change his mind, Qatar and Yemen would be good places to start. Qatar is not going to genuflect to every demand. Yemen is not going to be an Iran-free zone. \u201cWhere would we be if the Yemen war had not taken place?\u201d Helaissi, the Shura member, asked me. \u201cBut this has been terrible for our image around the world. I think it\u2019s our Vietnam.\u201dI went down to Jeddah, the Red Sea Saudi port and gateway for pilgrimages to Mecca. On the corniche, dotted with beaches, flanked by a new bike path, high-rise condos are going up beside luxury hotels. I tried to imagine this pleasant, uncluttered stretch of coast as a kind of Saudi Canc\u00fan a decade from now, with busloads of tourists clogging the streets.It was a stretch. What I saw was a pier with shaded areas down which formless black shapes \u2014 that is to say, women \u2014 glided with their faces veiled, one woman lifting the black flap over her mouth to insert an ice cream cone; and an official telling a little girl to get off her tricycle. I turned from the sea, where nobody swam, and looked for somewhere to get a cold drink by the beach. The Starbucks was closed for prayer. I waited in the blistering heat.At the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, I asked Saud Bin Saleh Al-Sarhan, the secretary general, and Abdullah bin Khalid Al-Saud, the director of research, how far the Saudi makeover could go. They suggested that where there is disagreement between Islamic scholars change would occur, but where there is unanimity it would not.Women would go uncovered; store closings for prayer and restaurant gender segregation would end; the crippling system of \u201cguardianship\u201d (already crumbling) that allows men to control the movement and lives of Saudi women would unravel; Medina might be accessible to non-Muslim tourists, Mecca probably not.However, alcohol, same-sex marriage and going public about homosexuality would never be allowed.I visited the Riyadh driving school for women, out on a university campus. It has a waiting list of a mere 70,000. Here, some 3,000 registered students go through 30 hours of training, for about $600, or about six times the cost of the course for men. (Saudi authorities insist the quality of the training is higher.) Her analysis of her country at the cusp struck me as about right. The crown prince is genuine. He\u2019s put his finger on what is keeping Saudi Arabia back. He lacks wisdom, especially on Qatar. There are lots of red lines, new and old, constant censorship, calls to blacklist any \u201canti-Saudi\u201d media. The centralization of power is alarming. Changes have occurred but have not been framed in law, which makes them vulnerable. And so? \u201cI am hopeful,\u201d Fassi told me. \u201cHopeful that 10 years from now we will have a public sphere that is more humane and safe for women, freed of the guardianship\u2019s abuses, and that will be good for the Saudi economy.\u201dI also think that will happen. If it does, Saudi Arabia\u2019s embodiment of a harsh, troublemaking Islam will have collapsed, and that could usher in the post-post-9/11 era. As a sign of his intent, Prince Mohammed should immediately release the female activists recently detained.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tells Republicans Not to Undercut Him on ZTE", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump urged Republican lawmakers on Wednesday not to scuttle his administration\u2019s efforts to help the Chinese telecom firm ZTE, warning them that his reprieve for the company was part of a broader geopolitical negotiating strategy.Mr. Trump ordered his Commerce Department to water down the penalties, which would have put ZTE out of business, after President Xi Jinping of China personally lobbied him to reconsider. The deal helped defuse tensions with Mr. Xi, whom the president has relied on to help pave the way for discussions with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. China and the United States are also locked in a contentious dispute over trade, with both countries threatening tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, suggested on Wednesday that lawmakers would be willing to compromise with the president to avoid undercutting his leverage in talks with China and North Korea. The ZTE penalty was tucked into a large military policy bill that passed this week in the Senate and still must be reconciled with the House bill, which did not include the penalty. That gives lawmakers and the White House a chance to either jettison the penalty or make it more palatable to Beijing.\u201cI\u2019m pretty optimistic we\u2019ll be able to come up with something that preserves the president\u2019s leverage,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said after the meeting. \u201cBecause he\u2019s telling us \u2018Look, when I\u2019m negotiating with Xi, this is more than just trade, this is more than just sanctions. This is about North Korea and other geopolitical issues.\u2019\u201dHe added: \u201cSo we wanted to make sure we weren\u2019t stepping on his need to have credibility and to be able to use his authority to negotiate well in these other spaces.\u201dLawmakers suggested that a decision has not yet been reached. For one thing, the lawmakers who will be charged with reconciling the Senate and House versions of the bill in which the ZTE provision was included have not been named. But any final legislation will also likely require at least some Democratic support to get through the Senate, which will have to vote on the reconciled bill.Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who as acting chairman of the Armed Services Committee is expected to help shepherd the bill through the conference committee, said he made clear to Mr. Trump at the meeting that he and other Republicans would be willing to respect his approach.\u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of negotiations with China, and he doesn\u2019t want anything that is going to be passed that would encumber his ability to get things done,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said. \u201cWhat I said to him was, \u2018We don\u2019t want to interfere with your ability to negotiate, so we can make changes in conference and probably take care of the problems that you have with that.\u2019\u201dIt was not clear on Wednesday what those changes might be or how such a compromise would come together.\u201cWe came to no conclusion that I could discern,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. \u201cThis type of meeting really isn\u2019t one where you\u2019d think you will really come to any conclusion.\u201dThe Commerce Department initially barred ZTE from buying American products, including semiconductors, for seven years as punishment for violating United States sanctions against Iran and North Korea. It then reconsidered the penalty and decided to levy a $1 billion fine on the company, replace its senior leadership and install American compliance officers. The Senate measure would undo that agreement.Trump administration officials have defended their approach to ZTE, insisting that they are being tough on the company while protecting American businesses that deal with ZTE.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, reiterated that position on Wednesday at a Senate Finance Committee hearing about trade.\u201cFrom a strictly enforcement point of view, I think if that had been our original solution, everyone would have applauded,\u201d Mr. Ross said of the ZTE fine.Shares of ZTE have been fluctuating wildly amid the machinations between the Trump administration and Congress, and that is likely to continue as the debate proceeds this summer.Democrats remain unconvinced by the administration and have seized on the opportunity to call Mr. Trump soft on China. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, pressed Republicans on Wednesday not to relent under pressure from the president.\u201cMy Republican colleagues must resist efforts by the Trump administration \u2014 at the behest of the government of China \u2014 to get them to water down or back off of the Senate\u2019s strong language on ZTE in the defense bill,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cAs my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have already stated, it is vital that our colleagues in the House keep this bipartisan provision in the defense bill as it heads towards a conference.\u201dAna Swanson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Trump-Kim Deal Could Send China\u2019s Trade With North Korea Soaring", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUNCHUN, China \u2014 In the Chinese border town of Hunchun, garment factories gladly employ squads of North Koreans, who are valued as skilled and dutiful workers. Live crab from the North wriggle in huge tanks in the fish market. Informal bankers promise to deliver the equivalent of thousands of dollars in Chinese currency to North Koreans across the border in a matter of hours.Up and down the 900-mile border, in fact, Chinese businesspeople export and import things like Chinese-made street lighting and exotic North Korean-grown mushrooms.By all indications, China has at least officially enforced the international sanctions that have been imposed on the North to curtail its nuclear weapons program. But on the border, the signs of North Korea\u2019s economic dependence on China are evident in a shadow economy of cash couriers, short-term workers and gray-market trading that has persisted despite the sanctions.And with President Trump\u2019s summit meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, back on track, excitement is growing about the opportunities that could open up should the sanctions be eased.\u201cThat\u2019s their neighborhood; it\u2019s not our neighborhood,\u201d said Mr. Trump, leaving aside the fact that American troops have been stationed on the peninsula for decades.Much of the business is driven by demand from a nascent North Korean middle class, which Chinese traders said could become a group of avid new consumers once sanctions are eased.The changes in the North are largely the work of the young leader, Mr. Kim. He has lifted the controls of the command economy to allow small-time trading, smuggling and \u201cshuttle traders\u201d who move with ease between China and his nation, economists and Chinese businesspeople say. In a New Year\u2019s speech in January, Mr. Kim said that having developed a nuclear arsenal, he would now turn his attention to improving the lives of his people.While this growth has bolstered popular support for the Kim family dynasty, the North Korean leadership is aware that it can also be a two-edged sword, he said. Having set itself on this road of economic improvement, North Korea must continue to find ways to expand and develop a national economy whose output is still just $20 billion \u2014 half the size of that of South Korea\u2019s sixth-largest city, Gwangju.\u201cNorth Korea is now a place where you can enjoy a normal life compared to the 1990s,\u201d said Mr. Kim, the economist. \u201cMoney has become very important. People there are saying if they can have money they have no reason to flee to South Korea.\u201dThe support of the middle class is vital for the North Korean leader, and so far he seems to have gained it. That holds true not only in the capital, Pyongyang, but in other towns to the north, said Andrei Lankov, a Russian expert on North Korea who has lived in the North and maintains ties there.\u201cKim Jong-un is popular,\u201d Mr. Lankov said. \u201cEveryone supports him.\u201dChina is anxious to repair its tattered alliance with the North and is determined to play a dominant role, along with South Korea, in any reset of the North\u2019s economy. In perhaps the most telling sign of a revival in trade, Air China announced Tuesday that it would resume regular flights from Beijing to Pyongyang on Wednesday. The sudden resumption came after flights were suspended last November because of negligible demand, the airline said.The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, met in Beijing last month with a delegation of North Korean mayors and governors, an unusual gesture by the powerful Chinese president to meet such low-ranking foreign visitors. The North Koreans were given a grand tour not just of Beijing but also of Shanghai and the rural central province of Shanxi, traveling on state-of-the-art bullet trains and receiving tutorials on how China rapidly built up its cities and industries.For now, China is providing visible help to the North in smaller ways. One is by serving as a conduit for money transfers back home by North Koreans living abroad who are trying to help family members maintain their improved living standards despite the sanctions.A restaurant owner in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, who fled the North several years ago, said she sent the equivalent of $5,000 a year to her mother, husband and school-age son who stayed behind in Pyongyang. She uses a money dealer here, not far from the border, to send $2,500 twice a year.The money has gone to pay for a tutor for her son, and also to buy him a $200 secondhand Japanese bicycle, the restaurant owner said. She asked that her name not be used for fear of attracting the attention of the South Korean security services, who she fears might not welcome such money transfers.While her husband has a good job as a manager at a state-owned enterprise, she said, they need the money because food is short after the long winter and the price of rice is rising. She said she sent the money in Chinese currency, the renminbi, which is used in the North to buy consumer goods.Other North Koreans living in Seoul said relatives had been requesting more money over the last year, not only to ride out the sanctions but also to cover what they said was the growing cost of bribes paid to North Korean officials, who are also trying to profit from the new cash economy.In Hunchun, one of China\u2019s biggest garment manufacturers, Younger, recently built a sprawling factory complex where North Korean workers make men\u2019s suits for the Chinese market. The North Koreans work alongside Chinese workers, receive the same wages and live in apartment blocks about three minutes from the plant, a manager said.Even though the sanctions require that North Korean workers return home, those working in Hunchun are most likely doing so legally, local businesspeople said. Their contracts appear to be written for short-term work, which is not covered in the sanctions, they said.In Hunchun, seafood sellers said they were still fetching top prices for North Korean live crab, considered a delicacy because it comes from the North\u2019s unpolluted waters.The crabs were trucked on a short trip from North Korea into the port of Vladivostok in Russia, then south over nearly 60 miles of bumpy road to Hunchun, a journey of up to 10 hours. They said the detour through Russia gave the crabs a cover of legality, and the Chinese are building a new road that will allow them to arrive more quickly.The customs paperwork needed to resume direct shipments of crab and frozen seafood has already been completed and is ready to be submitted as soon as sanctions are lifted. That will make the Russia detour unnecessary, said one seller as he watched over a dozen tanks filled with green crabs.\u201cWe have been told it will be soon,\u201d he said.Iris Zhao contributed research from Yanji and Hunchun, China; Luz Ding from Beijing; and Su-Hyun Lee from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump, Deal Maker? Not So Fast", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews Analysis\u201cTrump is an anarchist,\u201d said Jack O\u2019Donnell, a former president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, who became a sharp critic. \u201cIt was his approach in business, it is his approach as president. It does not take good negotiating skills to cause chaos. Will this ever lead to concessions? Maybe, but concessions to what? Not anything that resembles a deal. I just do not see him getting much done.\u201dUltimately, his advisers said, his hard-line positions that for now have left him at an impasse with negotiating partners should pay off in ways that did not for presidents like Barack Obama and George W. Bush. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that counterintuitive to say that playing hardball will lead to better trade deals eventually,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former aide to Mr. Trump.\u201cWe weren\u2019t even talking about these under Obama or Bush,\u201d he added. \u201cThere was no talking about renegotiating better trade deals. You couldn\u2019t even get China to the table before Trump came along. We\u2019ll see what the final outcome is, but it\u2019s already a success just to get them to the table.\u201dIn effect, the agreement with Mr. Kim is like a deal to sell parts of Trump Tower without settling on a price, date, inspection or financing. It is not nearly as advanced as agreements that President Bill Clinton and Mr. Bush made with North Korea, both of which ultimately collapsed.To be sure, these issues can be enormously complex and forging consensus can take time. Negotiations over such matters have frustrated more seasoned presidents with more bipartisan or internationalist instincts. Any judgment before the end of his four-year term may be premature.But no modern president has sold himself on the promise of negotiating skills more than Mr. Trump has. He regularly boasts that deals will be \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201cquick\u201d and the best ever.Just this month, he predicted that \u201cwe\u2019ll probably very easily make a deal\u201d with Mexico and Canada to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, but later made blistering attacks on both countries. He has pulled out of Mr. Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal, Paris climate accord and Trans-Pacific Partnership, but promises to negotiate better versions of those deal have gone nowhere.\u201cWhat the president seemingly fails to understand is that in foreign policy and in trade policy \u2014 unlike in real estate transactions \u2014 the parties are all repeat players,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, who advised Mr. Bush on trade negotiations. \u201cThe country you insult or seek undue advantage over today you will have to work with again tomorrow.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s approach so far has been to make expansive demands and apply as much pressure as he can. He argues that crushing sanctions he imposed on North Korea forced Mr. Kim to meet. He now hopes to extract concessions from China, Canada and Europe after slapping punishing tariffs on them.\u201cTrump is a bilateral player, in part because that\u2019s what he is used to from his building days, but also because he keeps himself the king, the decider, the strongman,\u201d said Wendy Sherman, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s lead negotiator on the Iran nuclear deal. \u201cIn the case of North Korea, however, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten this far \u2014 which isn\u2019t all that far \u2014 without the South Koreans or the Chinese.\u201dWhen it comes to Congress, other presidents have run into walls of resistance by the opposition \u2014 what both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump have called \u201cobstructionism.\u201d Some had hoped Mr. Trump might be able to bridge that divide because at different points he has been a Democrat and Republican.It was in effect an acknowledgment by Mr. Trump that he cannot reach across the aisle and can only govern with Republicans. Mr. Trump is right that Republicans, who currently have 51 seats in the Senate, need Democrats to muster the 60 votes needed to overcome any filibuster. But no major political strategist is projecting that Republicans could actually win nine more seats this fall, meaning that Mr. Trump's party would still need Democrats even after the election.Mr. Surabian, the former Trump aide, said the challenge on immigration is that the president has to grapple not just with Democrats but also with Republicans who do not share his philosophy on the issue. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about a normal negotiation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more complicated.\u201dMr. O\u2019Donnell, the former casino president, said Mr. Trump has always oversold his deal-making skills. The casino he managed, Mr. O\u2019Donnell noted, brought in $100 million a year yet still went bankrupt. \u201cThe fact is, Trump casinos should have been one of the greatest success stories in the history of casino gambling, but bad deal making caused him to lose all three properties,\u201d he said.Now the consequences are much higher. \u201cDeal making as president,\u201d Ms. Sherman said, \u201cis a multidimensional proposition where the stakes are war and peace, prosperity and depression.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Mexico Is Swinging Left", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Grillo is an author based in Mexico.ACTOPAN, Mexico \u2014 In this arid farming town in central Mexico, a crowd packed the plaza under a punishing sun to hear the leftist presidential hopeful Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador promise to end the corruption that plagues the nation.\u201cThey have even said that corruption is part of Mexican culture,\u201d he said to a chorus of supportive shouts. \u201cThat is a falsehood. A big lie. In our people, there is a great reserve of values, cultural, moral, spiritual, in the families, in the pueblos, in the communities.\u201d He pointed upward. \u201cThe problem is above. The rulers always set a bad example.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador went on to promise cuts in government expenditures, including a reduction in the president\u2019s salary and the selling of the executive air fleet. He said he would redirect money to the poor through pensions, scholarships, apprenticeships and free fertilizer for small farmers, a vow greeted with raucous cheers.The colossal lead comes as a surprise, considering that in his previous two bids for president, in 2006 and 2012, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador won no more than 35 percent of the vote. His message has changed little over the years \u2014 some of the phrases I hear at his rallies are almost identical to ones that I wrote down when I covered his speeches 12 years ago. What has changed are his expressions: He looks happier, more relaxed, less angry.Back in the 2000s, leftist politicians were sweeping Latin America. Now, conservative-leaning leaders have made a comeback in countries like Argentina and Peru. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador appears to be bucking the trend.So why is he finally surging? The main reason is that confidence in Mexico\u2019s established parties has nosedived in the last five years amid rising prices and brutal crime alongside horrendous corruption scandals. In this environment, his message resonates louder. For many who are struggling, his words promise hope.\u201cWe are tired of the same people in power, the same dinosaurs \u2014 we want them out,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Sampedro, a 52-year-old builder, said at the Actopan rally. \u201cWe want it so Mexican citizens don\u2019t have to go to the United States to work, so they don\u2019t have to be mistreated\u201d by the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Mr. Sampedro, like many in this area, has traveled north for work \u2014 in his case, construction jobs in Florida.In these circumstances, promises of more government help for the poor are applauded. A huge chunk of P.R.I. voters \u2014 especially in poorer states like Hidalgo, where this town is situated \u2014 appear to have migrated directly to Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador. They are the biggest bloc of voters pushing him into the lead.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has also made inroads in wealthier northern states, where the center-right National Action Party, known as the P.A.N., has historically been strong. A likely reason is that former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n, of the P.A.N., waged a military crackdown on drug cartels during his tenure, from 2006 to 2012, which led to an explosion of violence in the north. The bloodshed has continued under Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, with 2017 being Mexico\u2019s most homicidal year in decades.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador blames both parties for the violence, and has pledged that he will bring peace to Mexico, even floating the idea of an amnesty for some criminals and inviting the pope to oversee a reconciliation process. His rivals denounce these proposals, but many here find it hard to see how violence could get any worse and are open to new ideas.The rise of President Trump could also be helping Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, convincing people that a stronger, more nationalist figure could better defend their interests against threats from the north. But this is probably a minor factor; most people I talk to at rallies are far angrier with their own rulers than those over the river in the United States.Critics retort that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is himself a member of the establishment he rails against. He began his career in the P.R.I. in the 1970s, then left to help found the Democratic Revolution Party in 1989; he founded his new party, National Regeneration Movement, or Morena, in 2014. When he was mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005, his minister of finance was caught on camera as a regular in a Las Vegas casino and subsequently imprisoned for embezzlement and money laundering. Many P.R.I. and P.A.N. politicians are switching to Morena as it surges in the polls.But while Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador may indeed be another career politician, his style and discourse contrasts with those who have governed this nation the last few decades. This is enough of a signal of change to attract the votes of millions of people who are struggling to provide for their families, to escape violent gangs, or to recover from being deported from the United States. Time will tell if it is enough to really solve Mexico\u2019s fundamental problems.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Humanitarian Crisis Worsens in Yemen After Attack on Port", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe air and ground attack by forces loyal to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates was aimed at tipping the balance in Yemen\u2019s long-running civil war and driving Iranian-backed rebels out of the port of Al Hudaydah. Although fighting appeared to be limited to the outskirts of the city on Wednesday, the prospect of sustained fighting there stands to produce one of the bloodiest urban battles of the war, deepening what is already a catastrophic humanitarian situation.A protracted battle for Al Hudaydah could rival the fighting that ravaged Aleppo, Syria, or Mosul, Iraq, cities that have come to symbolize the brutality of warfare in the Middle East, according to humanitarian workers and diplomats. About a quarter of a million people in Al Hudaydah, a city of 600,000, are in danger of injury or death in an urban assault, the United Nations said.But a battle there will have consequences far beyond the city, whose port is the main entry point for aid to the rest of the country.\u201cThis attack risks more people dying, but it also risks cutting the lifeline of millions of Yemenis,\u201d said Jolien Veldwijk, the acting country director in Yemen for the aid agency Care International. \u201cFood imports already reached the lowest levels since the conflict started, and the price of basic commodities has risen by a third. We are gravely concerned that parts of the population could experience famine.\u201dThe Saudi-led coalition attacked the southern edge of Al Hudaydah by land and air on Wednesday. The Emiratis have signaled that they are planning a separate naval offensive to take the port.The Houthi rebels, an armed movement with ties to Iran, said they had foiled a sea landing near the port. \u201cThe Saudi coalition has not advanced at all in Hudaydah,\u201d Dayfallah al-Shami, a Houthi official, told Mayadeen television, a satellite channel based in Beirut, Lebanon.The war between the Saudi-Emirati coalition and the Houthis is just one facet of the unrest that has splintered the impoverished country. In the south, Emirati-backed local forces, assisted by American drones, are battling the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda. A southern insurgency wants to secede from the north. And the country\u2019s internationally recognized president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has no natural constituency in the country and instead lives in exile in Saudi Arabia.The Saudis and Emiratis intervened in the war three years ago with hopes of a quick victory over the Houthis, whom they see an Iranian proxy. Instead, the two nations have been stuck in a quagmire.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has been sharply criticized for the decision to carry out an air war in Yemen, keeping Saudi casualties low but killing thousands of Yemeni civilians. The airstrikes have crippled the country\u2019s infrastructure and created the conditions for one of the world\u2019s worst cholera epidemics in 50 years.The stalemate with the Houthis, and the lack of a clear strategy or exit plan, have raised questions about whether Prince Mohammed and his ally, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the Emirates, have locked their nations in a costly and unwinnable conflict.The assault on Al Hudaydah appears to be their effort to break the logjam and gain an upper hand in peace negotiations.The Saudi coalition said the invasion was intended to be limited and swift. A military spokesman, Col. Turki al-Maliki, said the plan was to take control of the airport, seaport and the route leading to the capital, Sana. \u201cWe will not fight a street war with the Houthis in Hudaydah for the safety of civilians,\u201d he told the Saudi-owned Al Hadath TV.\u201cWe would like this to be over quickly,\u201d Reem al-Hashimi, the Emirati minister of state for international cooperation, said by phone. \u201cI think that is the aspiration of everyone. But we are also preparing for the long haul.\u201dBut experts say that even a victory in Al Hudaydah is unlikely to significantly alter the underlying dynamic in Yemen. The Houthis still control the capital, Sana, as well as territory in northern Yemen, their ancestral lands.\u201cThe battle for Hudaydah is not going to end the war,\u201d said Gregory D. Johnsen, a resident scholar at the Arabia Foundation and one of the authors of the United Nations report on Yemen. \u201cThe Houthis are a major actor in Yemen. They have been fighting the Yemeni government in one form or another for years. There were times when they looked like they were eradicated but they have risen from the ashes time and time again.\u201dThe United States has backed the Saudi-led coalition, but American military officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have warned their Arab allies that the assault could end in failure both militarily and politically, and result in further civilian suffering.More and more Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress are criticizing the American role, accusing the Pentagon of being complicit in the bombing campaign.\u201cThe U.S. must now withdraw all its military support of the Saudi and U.A.E. military coalition,\u201d Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat of California and a former Air Force lawyer, demanded in a separate email on Wednesday. \u201cThe U.S. already has blood on its hands in the Yemen crisis, we should not make them even bloodier.\u201dIn the past few days, it appeared that American officials were resigned to the offensive going forward, and they began focusing on ensuring that an assault did not worsen conditions on the ground.\u201cIt seems as though the U.A.E. argued strongly that this is the game-changer, that they\u2019re sensitive to the risks, and can get the job done quickly and restore port operations,\u201d said Stephen A. Seche, a former United States ambassador to Yemen. \u201cI guess the administration decided not to get in its way. We\u2019ll find out pretty quickly if they were right.\u201dYemeni troops, trained and financed by the United Arab Emirates, led the ground offensive on Wednesday, beginning around daybreak on the southern edge of the city. There were also airstrikes on two pro-Houthi neighborhoods in the same area, according to residents.The Emirati-backed troops broke through defensive perimeters on the southern outskirts of town, according to the state news agency WAM, and some pushed as far as the perimeter of the airport. The reports could not be independently confirmed.A commander of one of the Emirati-backed infantry units, Abu Zara\u2019a al-Muharami, said that they were awaiting orders to move toward the airport and then to the seaport, their final objective.Aid workers who have remained in Al Hudaydah said the center of the city remained mostly quiet.The Houthis reinforced their defensive positions, deploying armored personnel and combat vehicles on the city streets, residents said. Mr. Shami, the Houthi official, said his forces had burned 11 military vehicles belonging to the Saudi alliance.The Emirates said Wednesday night that four of their soldiers had been killed.The United Nations, which had been frantically trying to unload two shiploads of food aid before the hostilities broke out, was setting up distribution hubs for emergency relief and food packets in the event of large civilian evacuations from the city. The United Nations Security Council was scheduled to meet on Yemen on Thursday.The Saudis and Emiratis claim that the Houthi rebels have been smuggling arms through the port of Al Hudaydah, including missiles used to attack Saudi Arabia.A United Nations team of monitors said in a recent report on Yemen that their findings did not support those allegations, concluding that it was more likely that weapons were being smuggled across land borders.The operation in Al Hudaydah began while Washington\u2019s attention was still focused on the summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un.It was not immediately clear what role, if any, American military advisers would play in the campaign.The Pentagon insists that all of its military aid is noncombat assistance, such as advising the Saudi Air Force on adopting bombing practices that kill fewer civilians. But at the same time, the defense contractor Raytheon is courting lawmakers and the State Department to allow it to sell 60,000 precision-guided munitions to the Saudis and Emiratis, in deals worth billions of dollars.American advisers do not give direct or indirect approval on target selection or execution of bombings against Houthi rebels, Pentagon officials say. Rather, they give advice on targeting procedures and facilitate checks of a list of \u201cno strike\u201d buildings, like mosques and marketplaces.Yemen\u2019s civil war began in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring protests that toppled the country\u2019s longtime autocratic president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Divisions over power sharing gave way to military conflict, and competing forces now hold separate areas of the country.The Houthis, who are from northern Yemen and represent one of the country\u2019s major political constituencies, swept south three years ago and seized control of Sana. Soon after, they stormed Al Hudaydah.Saudi Arabia and the Emirates intervened militarily, funding and training Yemeni forces opposing the Houthis.Most Yemeni analysts and diplomats view the war as a battle of political supremacy, not religion. The Houthis, as well as several other Yemeni factions, belong to a Shiite sect indigenous to their country and different from the one followed by most Iranians.The Saudis and Emiratis say they want to help restore Yemen\u2019s territorial integrity. But whatever happens in Al Hudaydah, it is unlikely to do that.\u201cIt\u2019s a very messy and challenging situation,\u201d Mr. Johnsen, the Yemen scholar, said. \u201cYou have multiple Yemens and multiple wars. You have a sectarian war that has been laid on top of a civil war. The country has been broken and broken again. I\u2019m not sure that anyone can put the country back together again.\u201dMargaret Coker reported from Dubai, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.

{"Headline": "G.E. Dropped From the Dow After More Than a Century", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were none.General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index late Tuesday and replaced by the Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstore chain.The decision is a fresh blow to General Electric, which has stumbled badly in recent years. Last fall, John L. Flannery, the company\u2019s new chief executive, warned that the power-generation unit was reeling. G.E. cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, G.E. surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, the company\u2019s financial services unit, mainly on long-term care insurance policies.Over the last year, G.E.\u2019s shares have fallen 55 percent, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Dow. G.E., which closed Tuesday at $12.95, has the lowest share price of any of the index\u2019s 30 components.S. & P. Dow Jones Indices \u2014 which owns the Dow \u2014 suggested that the slide in G.E.\u2019s stock price contributed to the decision to remove the company from the index, where it had been a member continuously since 1907. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction.\u201cThe low price of G.E. shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point,\u201d said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWalgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s share price is higher, and it will contribute more meaningfully to the index.\u201dThe move also is freighted with economic symbolism. With the inclusion of Walgreens Boots, the index \u201cwill be more representative of the consumer and health care sectors of the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Blitzer said.The removal of G.E., which will formally occur June 26, reflects a shift in the economic composition of the United States, which long ago tilted away from heavy industry and toward services, such as technology, finance and health care.And it also amounted to a milestone for General Electric. It was the last remaining original member of the index, when the stock market measure was introduced in 1896.Back then, just a few years after the company was formed through a merger of Thomas Edison\u2019s electric companies with a rival, G.E. was the modern-day equivalent of a technology stock, and the Dow itself was geared heavily toward the growth industries of the day such as railroads. In the more than 120 years that followed, the company was often at the center of American capitalism. And as recently as the 1990s. G.E. was at times the most-valuable American company by market value.Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the United States today.After G.E.\u2019s departure from the index, the company with the longest presence in the Dow will be Exxon Mobil, whose corporate predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, joined the Dow in 1928, according to S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Does It Mean to Play the \u2018Best\u2019 of Bach?", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookLEIPZIG, Germany \u2014 \u201cBach\u2019s best.\u201d It\u2019s an irresistible concept, but does it mean anything?Such judgments are always fraught when it comes to artistic creations, even more so where the primary purpose of the works was not artistic but religious. That is the case with Bach\u2019s sacred cantatas, the focus of this year\u2019s Bachfest Leipzig, which ran from June 8 through 17.\u201cAnd the truth he served was bitter,\u201d Mr. Taruskin continued. \u201cHis works persuade us \u2014 no, reveal to us \u2014 that the world is filth and horror, that humans are helpless, that life is a pain, that reason is a snare.\u201dSo what exactly can \u201cbest\u201d mean? The works that seduce our ears most, or the ones that most effectively scare the dickens out of us with visions of fire and brimstone? (The festival seemed to favor pretty and vividly dramatic sounds without immersing itself unduly in blood and gore.)The festival, financed mainly by the city of Leipzig since its founding in 1999, is administered by the Bach Archive here, in the city where Bach lived and worked from 1723 to his death in 1750. The idea of a ring of cantatas, loosely modeled after presentations of Wagner\u2019s \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d down the road in Bayreuth, arose from a 2016 discussion between John Eliot Gardiner, the president of the archive, and Michael Maul, then the dramaturg and now the artistic director of the festival.Mr. Maul was looking for a way to elevate Bach\u2019s 200 or so surviving sacred cantatas, in some ways the very heart of his output, to a level of public awareness comparable to that of the Passions (\u201cSt. Matthew\u201d and \u201cSt. John\u201d) and the Mass in B minor. Mr. Gardiner, one of the few living conductors who has performed and recorded all the sacred cantatas, many of them repeatedly, hatched the notion of a ring.The two enlisted Peter Wollny, the director of the archive, to join them in drawing up lists of the 30, ahem, best. All nominated more than 30, and Mr. Maul culled the lists with an eye toward keeping the church calendar as complete possible.So there was the Ring, which dominated the festival\u2019s opening weekend \u2014 astounding, exhilarating, exhausting, a major artistic and audience success. 33 cantatas, some 18 hours of music performed within 48 hours by top-flight interpreters. The list was unquestionably impressive in variety and dramatic range, as fellow completists can attest, especially as brought to life by Mr. Gardiner.Bach\u2019s cantatas, exalted as some of them seem, were utilitarian creations. As Thomaskantor, Bach was responsible for music in the city\u2019s major churches, St. Thomas and St. Nicholas. Each week he presented a cantata by himself or by another composer \u2014 a \u201csermon in sound,\u201d as it was often called at the festival \u2014 relating to the Gospel text for the particular Sunday.During his first years in Leipzig, Bach, though busy with teaching and family, usually presented his own works, developing several annual cycles. He often wrote from one week to the next. What that meant, Mr. Wollny said, was that Bach typically had to write a cantata in three days \u2014 from, say, Sunday afternoon to Wednesday morning \u2014 before turning it over to copyists to prepare the parts for rehearsal.Given such stringent demands, the level of workmanship and imagination in these works is remarkably high. But how to choose one work over another for today\u2019s listeners? (They are already somewhat falsified, as was pointed out by several speakers, by being presented three or four at a time in a concert setting.)Mr. Maul, for his part, backed off the notion of \u201cbest\u201d a bit in a conversation after the Ring weekend, allowing that these selections might more properly be called merely personal favorites (on whatever basis).Christoph Wolff \u2014 the dean of Bach scholars, a Harvard research professor and a former president of the Bach Archive \u2014 observed the festival closely, and he, too, said he found the notion of \u201cbest\u201d slightly embarrassing. But he praised the Ring as \u201ca good way to get a feel of these works as the prime core of Bach\u2019s output.\u201dIn a way, Mr. Wolff added, what he called the \u201crandomness\u201d of the selections \u201cmakes the point better, in the range of construction, of features, of the tricks Bach uses.\u201dThe larger Bachfest returned to earth after the Ring. In the next big event, on June 12, one of the cantata interpreters, Masaaki Suzuki, led his Bach Collegium Japan in Mendelssohn\u2019s great oratorio \u201cElijah,\u201d at the Gewandhaus, the city\u2019s main concert hall. (Mendelssohn conducted the work\u2019s premiere in Birmingham, England, in 1846, in English; the German version used by Mr. Suzuki is called \u201cElias.\u201d)Mendelssohn, the director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra from 1835 to \u201947, was largely responsible for a 19th-century revival of Bach\u2019s music in Germany, spurred by his 1829 performance of the \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d in Berlin. He also had a Bach monument, which still stands near St. Thomas, erected in 1843.Appropriately, Mr. Suzuki beefed up his forces for \u201cElias\u201d \u2014 adding American student groups he has worked with, the Yale Voxtet and Juilliard415 \u2014 and he showed a fine flair for Mendelssohn\u2019s incandescent style, with excellent work from the expanded chorus and orchestra. The German baritone Christian Immler, also familiar to early-music audiences in New York, gave a game if somewhat underpowered account of the title role.Then it was back to Bach for the rest of my stay in Leipzig. On June 13, again at the Gewandhaus, Andras Schiff, a consummate Bach pianist, offered an ample program of works he has played often: the \u201cItalian\u201d Concerto, the French Overture in B minor and the \u201cGoldberg\u201d Variations.You never know entirely what to expect from the impish Mr. Schiff, whose stamina is no less amazing than his capacious memory, and he often displays both at the end of a concert with a generous helping of encores. Here he did something different.Having finished the \u201cItalian\u201d Concerto to the obvious delight of the audience, he took a bow, sat down and, without comment, played the whole 12-minute piece again. The first attempt had been fast and seemed slightly out of control at moments, to be sure, though most other pianists would have proudly accepted such results.\u201cI repeated the whole \u2018Italian\u2019 Concerto because I was not happy with the first performance,\u201d Mr. Schiff later explained in an email. \u201cIt happens. This is a piece that I can play in my dreams, and it\u2019s very often one of my encores. However, at the beginning of a recital, it\u2019s much harder to get into the spirit, and therefore I wanted to give myself a second chance, like a second serve in tennis.\u201dAs he has done so often, Mr. Schiff showed complete mastery in the French Overture and \u201cGoldberg\u201d Variations, his concentration and stamina clearly unaffected by the early detour.On the next evening came the \u201cSt. Matthew Passion,\u201d performed in St. Thomas, where Bach led the work\u2019s premiere in 1727. Beno\u00eet Haller conducted La Chapelle Rh\u00e9nane, based in Strasbourg, France. Mr. Haller\u2019s forces were obviously well drilled, and several fine moments included the countertenor Paul-Antoine B\u00e9nos-Djian\u2019s moving account of the aria \u201cErbarme dich,\u201d a plea for mercy on behalf of all humanity.But Mr. Haller\u2019s ministrations seemed intrusive at times, nonexistent at others. He tended to gloss over big moments with infuriatingly brisk tempos, and the crunching appoggiatura on the work\u2019s final chord, one of the most eloquent dissonances in all of music history, simply failed to register.This performance, despite the distinguished setting, served in the end mainly to reaffirm the consistently high quality of the cantata performances over the weekend. So does the Ring have a future?As much as it may disappoint fellow Ring pilgrims (and those who missed it), Mr. Maul has no current plans to repeat the event. He has already settled on other projects, running three years out.The 2019 program features Bach in a secular vein, as court composer, with works he wrote as organist and concertmaster in Weimar; as Kapellmeister in C\u00f6then; and while freelancing for the courts of Dresden and Berlin. In 2020, Mr. Maul plans to feature Bach societies from around the world.Not until 2021 will Mr. Maul attempt anything as ambitious as the Ring. A concept he is calling Bach\u2019s \u201cMessiah\u201d will trace the course of Jesus\u2019s life and death through major works of Bach in 11 concerts, proceeding from the \u201cMagnificat\u201d and \u201cChristmas Oratorio\u201d to the \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d and including some 20 cantatas.Bach at his unmatchable best? Possibly not, in every case. Still, plenty good enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Most Powerful Conservative Couple You\u2019ve Never Heard Of", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFew political donors are as influential, yet little known, as Liz and Dick Uihlein.The Midwestern couple has joined the upper pantheon of Republican donors alongside names like Koch, Mercer and Adelson. They have spent roughly $26 million on the current election cycle, supporting more than 60 congressional candidates, working outside the party establishment to advance a combative, hard-right conservatism, from Washington to the smallest town.Perhaps nothing illustrates the couple\u2019s determination to set the agenda more than their efforts in the Wisconsin town of Manitowish Waters. They have spent millions remaking the small community and buying up much of its downtown. In 2016, shortly before Mrs. Uihlein joined the Trump campaign as a major fund-raiser, she threatened to divert $300,000 in planned donations if the town didn\u2019t move a boat ramp that was near a pavilion she had built.\u201cI find this delay unnecessary and unacceptable,\u201d she wrote to a local official, in an email with the subject line, \u201cThe Derailment of What is Best for Manitowish Waters.\u201d\u201cI need an answer now,\u201d she added. \u201cI am done waiting.\u201dMarried for 51 years, both in their 70s, the Uihleins rarely grant interviews. But in a statement responding to questions provided by The Times, the couple said,\u201cWe care about our community and our country and choose to personally support candidates that share our policy beliefs.\u201dThey have reinforced their message by supporting a network of broadsheets and websites that resemble news outlets but that make one-sided attacks against their opponents.Those who get in their way are \u201cCAVERS (Citizens Against Virtually Everything),\u201d as Mrs. Uihlein said in a 2014 email to an official at the Manitowish Waters Chamber of Commerce.Those who join them are well rewarded. A political action committee supporting Chris McDaniel, the polarizing Mississippi Senate candidate, received $750,000 from Mr. Uihlein. Mr. McDaniel called Dick Uihlein \u201cinstrumental in the conservative movement,\u201d adding, \u201cthere\u2019s no way to overstate his importance.\u201dThe couple\u2019s spending this election cycle puts them atop all Republican donors listed in federal filings so far. Dan K. Eberhart, a Colorado drilling-services executive and major Republican donor, called them \u201cthe new Mercers.\u201d\u201cThere were all these articles: Who is going to fund the Bannon insurgency?\u201d Mr. Eberhart added, referring to Stephen K. Bannon, the estranged Trump adviser who championed attacks on the Republican establishment.\u201cBannon has blown up and is no longer a factor, but post facto, Uihlein is the answer.\u201dCandidates and strategists courting the Uihleins come to Uline\u2019s 200-acre campus in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., just over the border from their hometown, Lake Forest, Ill. Called the Lodge, the headquarters looks like a rustic retreat made over as a corporate office. Men wear ties and tattoos are frowned upon.It is usually Mr. Uihlein they want to see.\u201cThe times I\u2019ve been to Wisconsin to meet with him, he\u2019s the kind of individual who will leave his office and walk down to meet somebody,\u201d Mr. McDaniel said. \u201cHe treated me like family.\u201dDan Proft, a Chicago talk show host who runs the Uihlein-backed Liberty Principles PAC, has visited frequently. He called Mr. Uihlein an \u201cacross-the-board conservative\u201d interested in \u201cshrinking the size and spending and scope of government.\u201dMr. Uihlein also gave more than $7 million to PACs affiliated with Club for Growth, an anti-tax group that supported conservatives in 13 recent races nationwide.\u201cLike a lot of conservatives, they bounced between a few candidates,\u201d said Eric O\u2019Keefe, director of Club for Growth\u2019s Wisconsin arm.Inside the company, Mrs. Uihlein is more visible. In a corporate video, she is shown meeting employees and reviewing Uline catalog pages.The couple work both in tandem and apart. After they each wrote $5,000 checks to redo a Manitowish Waters playground, \u201cwe called to see if it was a duplicate,\u201d said John Hanson, chairman of the town board. \u201cThey said no.\u201dThe Uihleins responded to questions for this article both jointly and individually.\u201cDick is much more interested in policy and politics,\u201d Mrs. Uihlein wrote. \u201cMy passions are in investments and charitable work in our community.\u201dUline lacks a visible corporate communications department and has a moribund Twitter account, unusual for a company with more than 6,000 employees. But it aggressively advertises digitally, and by widely distributing its catalog, which features more than 34,000 items, from gift wrap to shelving.Mrs. Uihlein\u2019s politics emerge in her essays.The couple own a summer home in Manitowish Waters, a remote Wisconsin village northwest of Green Bay that Mrs. Uihlein has transformed into her vision of a vacationer\u2019s utopia. Her hands-on approach has upset some residents.\u201cThe town is pretty much divided in half,\u201d said Karen Dixon, a longtime homeowner. \u201cThere are those who think she\u2019s doing wonderful things. I think she is. I guess it\u2019s the way she goes about it that sometimes turns people off.\u201dMrs. Uihlein is known for buying up businesses, spending millions on public improvements and dispensing unsolicited advice.On the main strip, barely a mile long, she has offered beautification tips and free renovation services to fellow merchants \u2014 from paving parking lots to installing fences around dumpsters.Bill Dietz, who runs a gas station and convenience store, said Mrs. Uihlein came by one day and offered to regrout his floor.Another day, Mrs. Uihlein visited the Timberline Inn with two legal-pad-size pages of suggestions, according to the former manager, Eric Behnke.\u201cShe didn\u2019t like some of the shrubs out front and some of the trees out back,\u201d Mr. Behnke remembered. \u201cShe thought that part of the building should be restained \u2014 a variety of stuff like that. She sent some of her guys over to help.\u201dThe sale of the Timberline in 2014 highlighted the Uihleins\u2019 penchant for managing the town\u2019s affairs.Richard Gilman, a former Manitowish Waters resident who built the Timberline in 1996, said in an interview that Mrs. Uihlein purchased the property amid widespread rumors in the town that a Pakistani buyer was interested.\u201cNot in her little town, Heaven forbid,\u201d said Mr. Gilman, who served as an adviser on the sale.Mrs. Uihlein appears to refer to a mystery buyer in an email to a Chamber of Commerce officer in 2014, shortly after her purchase.\u201cDo you think I wanted to own a motel like this? Huh?\u201d she wrote, in an email that circulated around town. \u201cI bought the motel as a defensive move for Manitowish Waters because the owner \u2026 was going to sell to what several of us, including the Mayor, thought was not in the best interests of the town.\u201dIn her email, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, Mrs. Uihlein added, \u201cYou all should be happy there are folks like my husband and myself who can afford to buy old, dilapidated buildings, rehab them and put businesses in them without worrying about a profit.\u201dAsked about the rumored Pakistani buyer, Mrs. Uihlein said in a statement: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see one absentee owner replaced with another, with another investment doomed to fail because they didn\u2019t know the economics of the North Woods.\u201dSo rapid was the town\u2019s transformation that the community held a forum in 2014 where Mrs. Uihlein\u2019s influence was a major topic of discussion.In addition to the hotel, now called the Lodge at Manitowish Waters, Mrs. Uihlein\u2019s holdings include a coffee house, two shops, a spa, vacation rental homes and a restaurant. Her favorite $90 chardonnay is on the menu.\u201cI\u2019m not sure she sleeps,\u201d he said.As Mrs. Uihlein ruffled feathers in rural Wisconsin, her husband immersed himself in hyperlocal politics touching on race and social issues. In affluent Lake Forest, Ill., where 90 percent of students are white, he backed a school board slate led by the chief critic of Lake Forest High School\u2019s first black principal, who had criticized honors classes for tracking black students into lower classes.\u201cWe saw slick, expensive-looking signs all over,\u201d said Daye Pope, organizing director for Trans United Fund, which supported the policy.\u201cIt was probably the most offensive thing I\u2019ve seen in a state race,\u201d said Pat Brady, the former Illinois Republican chairman.Mr. Uihlein said he \u201chad no involvement with the ad,\u201d and the couple said, \u201cWe value diversity in our community and at Uline.\u201dMr. Straub initially welcomed support from a Uihlein-funded PAC, but not anymore. \u201cIt sounded good because I didn\u2019t have a big war chest, but I became no better than my opponent,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, I would not do it again.\u201dControlling the message has become a priority for the Uihleins, a goal made easier by the decline of local news operations.Mr. Uihlein is the largest donor to Mr. Proft\u2019s Liberty Principles PAC, which supports hard-right candidates and funded more than a dozen publications resembling newspapers, with names like North Cook News and East Central Reporter.A nonprofit run by a longtime Uihlein adviser, John Tillman, also contributed money to the newspaper network, drawing scrutiny because of restrictions on the political activity of such groups.\u201cThey are riding the fine line between legal and illegal, and coordinated and not coordinated, in terms of political messaging allowed under state and federal campaign finance laws,\u201d said Colin Williams, policy director of Illinois Campaign for Political Reform.Mr. Tillman said his group had complied with relevant tax law. Mr. Proft said the publications are now funded by a private company. Disclaimers on their websites, however, say funding \u201cis provided, in part, by advocacy groups.\u201d Mr. Proft called that out of date.Mr. Brady, the former Illinois Republican Party leader, suggested that Mr. Uihlein was an easy mark for political operatives; he also criticized Mr. Proft and his associates for spending Mr. Uihlein\u2019s money wildly on long shots.\u201cThey\u2019ve just given him such bad advice that it makes him look kind of goofy, and he\u2019s not: He\u2019s a serious guy,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cThese guys are making hundreds of thousands of dollars off him.\u201dMr. Proft dismissed Mr. Brady as \u201ca flack for Rauner.\u201dIn his responses, Mr. Uihlein said he had long worked with Mr. Proft and Mr. Tillman \u201cadvancing conservative principles\u201d and believed \u201cthey have both done so admirably.\u201dThe Uihleins want to bend the world their way.Nowhere is that clearer than in Wisconsin, where the Republican establishment has one candidate to take on Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat and the first openly gay United States senator, and the Uihleins have another.Their pick, Mr. Nicholson, was a virtual unknown until Uihlein millions made him viable overnight, starting with a $2 million donation in March of 2017 to a new \u201csuper PAC\u201d seeking to elect him. At the time he had not even announced his candidacy.Mr. Nicholson\u2019s long shot status seems to be almost beside the point. The Uihleins have made big donations to various super PACS and other groups that support him and attack his opponents, perhaps testing the concept of whether big money \u2014 theirs \u2014 can spawn, nurture and deliver a winning candidate.Their civic engineering can be just as calculating, as the people of Manitowish Waters can attest. After Mrs. Uihlein replaced a primitive bandstand there with a $1 million pavilion, she bolted down new furniture to prevent theft. That made it impossible to clear space for bands.\u201cI went over and unfastened it,\u201d said Barry Hopkins, a local motel owner who organizes free concerts. \u201cLiz removed the furniture. It was kind of her way or the highway.\u201dMr. Gilman, the former owner of the Uihlein\u2019s lodge, likens the town\u2019s transformation under the Uihleins to the couple\u2019s grander ambitions.\u201cShe\u2019s done in that community what they\u2019re trying to do on a national scale,\u201d he said, \u201caffect elections and do their drawing of how the world should be.\u201dReporting was contributed by Nicholas Confessore, Jonathan Martin and Kenneth P.

{"Headline": "A Roy Moore-Less Campaign in Alabama Was Still Pretty Crazy", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Hillyer\u00a0was the\u00a0chief editorial writer\u00a0of The Mobile Register for eight years.She didn\u2019t, however, take the lead on much of anything during her 14 months in office. Sure, she could claim Alabama\u2019s lowest unemployment rate ever \u2014 almost exactly tracking the national numbers \u2014 but without specifying anything she had done to achieve that success.Alabama voters seemed not to hold Ms. Ivey\u2019s disappearing acts against her. Until the campaign\u2019s final weekend, at least, they seemed just to want to avert their eyes from politics altogether.\u201cRepublican voters in particular are getting kind of fed up with the whole process,\u201d said Candace Cooksey, a Republican consultant in Alabama with no client in the governor\u2019s race but a dozen other clients this cycle.That gambit failed, as did the crack by Tommy Battle, the mayor of Huntsville, about Ms. Ivey attending too many cocktail parties. So the fourth major Republican candidate, the evangelical pastor Scott Dawson, attacked Ms. Ivey for not blocking a state government grant to a poorly managed nonprofit whose mission was to protect and support gay youths victimized by bullying. When Ms. Ivey responded that the grant was a federal mandate, not a state choice, and that she did not agree \u201cwith the agenda or the values of that organization,\u201d Free2Be, Alabama\u2019s first openly gay legislator erupted in response.State Representative Patricia Todd, a Democrat, tweeted that she had \u201cheard for years that she is gay,\u201d and that Ms. Ivey\u2019s denigration of the anti-bullying group was thus hypocritical.Governor Ivey strongly denied Ms. Todd\u2019s assertion, Mr. Dawson apologized for raising the innuendo in the first place, and the whole thing seemed to blow over. Sort of. Even after his apology, Mr. Dawson\u2019s fund-raising solicitations criticized Ms. Ivey for giving \u201ctaxpayers\u2019 dollars\u201d to \u201ca fringe activist group that promotes transgenderism and alternative lifestyles to Alabama\u2019s children.\u201dNone of it seemed to matter. The other candidates, with the exception of some trial balloons \u2014 flat tax, earmarking reform, vocational education \u2014 from the earnest Mr. Hightower, barely even tried to galvanize voters with policy ideas.For example, Mr. Battle, the Huntsville mayor, repeatedly refused (in a 45-minute interview with me) to take firm positions on anything other than demanding audits of state spending. His main message seemed to be that his successes as mayor of a thriving city proves he\u2019s a good manager. No preference for or against tax reform. No suggestions for reforming the state\u2019s system of earmarking revenues. No position on Common Core educational standards. No proposals for providing more money to state troopers or rural hospitals.The key line toward the end of Mr. Battle\u2019s interview: \u201cGiving you specifics today is not something that we are ready to do.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to gear up for a campaign behind a message like that. Yet the tenor of the whole race was just that vapid.Mr. Maddox won big in the Democratic primary. In the general election, he will try to disprove the proposition that the only way a Democrat can win statewide in Alabama is if his opponent gets evicted from office twice and makes passes at teenagers.His opponent seems to think that as long as she can avoid controversy, Alabama\u2019s solid red-state wall will hold her up.Advertisement"}

There was a \u201cblockchain yacht\u201d and a \u201cblockchain villa\u201d and more ros\u00e9 than any group of people could, or perhaps should, want to drink.Mr. Harris, who joined the festival at the behest of the agency Hearts & Science, and Scott Hagedorn, the agency\u2019s chief executive, appeared on a panel for clients where they discussed smartphone addiction, the feelings of depression and anxiety that social media can produce in teenagers, and the methods that popular apps like Facebook use to harness human attention so they can serve more ads to people.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be scorching the playing field when we\u2019re extracting attention,\u201d Mr. Harris said in an interview. \u201cIt would just suck the air out of democracy and there\u2019s no shared truth and then it\u2019s like, great, we can advertise to people, but they\u2019re lonely, depressed and they don\u2019t believe in facts. No one wants that world.\u201dMr. Hagedorn, who acknowledged that some might look askance at advertisers taking up the cause of ethical persuasion, said he heard Mr. Harris on a podcast last year when his agency was manually reviewing tens of thousands of YouTube videos to figure out what kind of content its clients\u2019 ads were appearing with.\u201cI ended up basically giving myself PTSD because I saw so many horrible things,\u201d Mr. Hagedorn said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been, as an industry, blindly telling clients that being \u2018video neutral\u2019 is fine \u2014 you can follow the eyeballs from platform to platform \u2014 and I think we\u2019ve been unaware, or not paying attention potentially, to what we\u2019re monetizing and funding.\u201d\u201cDigital advertising as an industry has grown really, really rapidly and the unintended consequences of that sort of rapid growth means there are things happening that no one had anticipated,\u201d Mr. Weed said in an interview. He said he expected to work directly with platforms like Instagram on such issues, adding that social media sites are grappling with a decline in trust.Jon Kaplan, the global head of sales at Pinterest, said that he had observed \u201ca growing backlash\u201d against automated, data-driven advertising. In an interview on a pier that the company rented for the week, which welcomed \u201cfriends of the Pin,\u201d he recalled the disenchantment of major advertisers at an industry gathering last year.\u201cEvery story was like, we thought this was the panacea, and while it has its place, we may have over-rotated into that kind of data-driven marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s kind of no soul and no creativity and no real brand love associated with that.\u201dThe big tech companies also had an unexpected neighbor on the beach \u2014 Big Tobacco. Philip Morris International hosted a concert by the band St. Lucia and served drinks by robot bartenders. As the week closed, the company issued \u201ca bold call to action for the creative, media and communications communities\u201d to support its efforts in advertising tobacco products.Wendy Clark, the chief executive of DDB Worldwide, said that in the 1990s the beachfront space now ruled by tech had been dominated by ad agencies. She was optimistic, however, about technology forcing advertisers to come up with increasingly creative ways to reach people.\u201cThe best ads don\u2019t feel like ads,\u201d she said. Terms like \u201cadvertising\u201d and \u201cmarketing\u201d have come to mean less, she said, recounting a meeting she had during the week with a young YouTube influencer. \u201cShe would never describe herself as a marketer, but she\u2019s a modern-day marketer,\u201d Ms. Clark said.Still, Shane Smith, Vice\u2019s co-founder, appeared to remain popular with the ad industry, judging by the long line to enter the company\u2019s annual party.As more reports have emerged about misconduct of varying levels at advertising or media companies, it has posed a challenge for brands.Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble, the world\u2019s biggest advertiser, said in an interview that, generally, such situations are \u201cfew and far between,\u201d but that when they do arise, the company has to examine whether they are \u201cisolated incidents or is there a pervasive pattern that you need to do something about.\u201dMr. Pritchard added that the company has been working to build up its own databases to make its digital ads more precise and pointed to new partnerships it announced last week with Katie Couric and Queen Latifah.\u201cThe bigger thing we\u2019re pushing on,\u201d he said, \u201cis we\u2019re just trying to take more control over things.\u201dEmily Steel and David Gelles contributed reporting.Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or follow her on Twitter: @sapna.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Bloomberg Will Spend $80 Million on the Midterms. His Goal: Flip the House for the Democrats.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has decided to throw his political clout and personal fortune behind the Democratic campaign to take control of the House of Representatives this year, directing aides to spend tens of millions of dollars in an effort to expel Republicans from power.By siding so emphatically with one party, Mr. Bloomberg has the potential to upend the financial dynamics of the midterm campaign, which have appeared to favor Republicans up to this point. Facing intense opposition to President Trump and conservative policies, Republicans have been counting on a strong economy and heavily funded outside groups to give them a political advantage in key races, especially in affluent suburbs where it is expensive to run television ads.While Mr. Bloomberg has not chosen his list of targeted races yet, he is unlikely to get involved in rural, conservative-leaning districts where his views on guns and other issues could stir an uproar, according to people briefed on his plans, some of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.The new alliance between Mr. Bloomberg, 76, and congressional Democrats marks a fresh stage in the former mayor\u2019s political evolution. And it promises to put New York and its political leaders even more squarely at the center of a midterm campaign already stocked with prominent characters from the city, including a president who made his fortune in Manhattan real estate; the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer; and Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s predecessor in Gracie Mansion, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who serves as a lawyer for Mr. Trump.Massive campaign spending by partisan billionaires \u2014 like Mr. Adelson and Mr. Steyer, and the powerful conservative donor network led by the Koch brothers \u2014 has yielded a hodgepodge of results over the years. In many cases, it has helped to amplify existing political trends, allowing parties already on the rise to gain ground even more rapidly. In other instances, billionaire-funded \u201csuper PACs\u201d have helped parties limit their losses in difficult political conditions, as Republicans hope their outside groups will do this year. But money alone rarely determines the outcome of national elections.Calling Republican leaders in the House \u201cabsolutely feckless,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg criticized them for failing to check Mr. Trump or to exercise rigorous oversight of his presidential administration.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought that the public is well-served when one party is entirely out of power, and I think the past year and half has been evidence of that,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, lamenting that Republicans \u201chave done little to reach across the aisle to craft bipartisan solutions \u2014 not only on guns and climate change, but also on jobs, immigration, health care, and infrastructure.\u201dMr. Bloomberg continued: \u201cRepublicans in Congress have had almost two years to prove they could govern responsibly. They failed.\u201dMr. Bloomberg is said to be intrigued by a list of candidates Mr. Moulton has endorsed, many of them also veterans.\u201cEspecially in these marginal suburban districts, he\u2019s someone whose resources and credibility can help candidates in tough races,\u201d Mr. Moulton said, adding that Mr. Bloomberg would likely be cautious about where to deploy his operation: \u201cThere are places where you want to go in very obviously, and other places where you want to do work behind the scenes.\u201dMr. Crowley said in an interview that Mr. Bloomberg had expressed dismay to him about Republican lawmakers\u2019 refusal to challenge Mr. Trump.\u201cHe recognizes the threat of this presidency,\u201d Mr. Crowley said.In a sign of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s deep alienation from the Republican Party, he has recently told associates that if he were to run for president in 2020, he would likely do so as a Democrat, according to people who have spoken with him directly.It is unclear whether Mr. Bloomberg, who would be 78 on Election Day in 2020, is actively contemplating another presidential campaign or simply leaving the door open to the possibility.\u201cHe plays very well in the moderate suburbs where we need to win seats,\u201d said Mr. Gottheimer, adding: \u201cFrom my perspective, I want more pro-business, moderate Democrats in Congress next year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sombrero and a Dream: One Desperate Fan\u2019s World Cup Odyssey", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Mexican college student ventured to the World Cup with a sombrero and a plan. What he did not have was a match ticket.YEKATERINBURG, Russia \u2014 A sombrero, out here, has special powers.It provides 360-degree cover from the summer sun, obviously. But it can also disarm a stranger, start a conversation between people who speak different languages, get its owner onto an international television broadcast, or even slip open a door to romance.\u201cLadies love the sombrero,\u201d said Jose Ramon Diaz, who bought his sombrero two years ago in Tehuac\u00e1n, Mexico, his hometown, for 47 pesos, or about $2.50. \u201cIt\u2019s a key that opens a lot of doors.\u201dDiaz has learned these lessons, and more, during his time alone in Russia this month, rooting for Mexico at the World Cup. A college student, he made some sacrifices to finance his first trip outside North America, starting with leaving Tehuac\u00e1n, where he lives with his father, to go to Los Angeles (Diaz was born in the United States) and sleep in a homeless shelter for a month while working two jobs to stockpile cash.In Russia, Diaz has been eating as infrequently as possible. When he does, he aims to spend no more than 300 rubles, or about $4.75, per meal. This has left him subsisting mostly on Subway sandwiches (\u201cGive me the cheapest,\u201d was the first Russian phrase he learned) and baby food (\u201cIt\u2019s cheap and nutritious,\u201d said Diaz, a 23-year-old adult man).The Mexican national team, as it happens, has a lot of these fanatics.Oscar Martinez, 26, for example, had a job at a San Diego shipping warehouse, until he asked his boss for time off to go to Russia. \u201cThey said if I go I won\u2019t have a job anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, \u2018O.K., bye!\u2019\u201dThe prelude to Diaz\u2019s trip here was its own mini-adventure. Diaz seemed momentarily taken aback when asked why he had subjected himself to all this. He loves soccer, he said, and he thinks Mexico is going to win the World Cup.Many others seemed to have subscribed to this same soccer calculus. Mexico had the sixth-highest number of ticket buyers for this tournament, 60,302, and it is reasonable to assume that a big chunk of the 88,825 sold to the United States were scooped up by fans of El Tri, as well.\u201cHalf the people really love soccer and half want to be around the party,\u201d said Pablo Calderon, 31, a lawyer from Mexico City who had tickets to all of Mexico\u2019s games.\u201cI\u2019m so blessed,\u201d Diaz said.Early this month, before the international hordes arrived, Diaz caused a stir wherever he went with his sombrero. Eight times he was happily plucked off the street for television interviews. Locals formed lines to take pictures with him. Multiple women gave him their phone numbers. (\u201cA recommendation for everyone who hasn\u2019t arrived: bring a sombrero,\u201d Diaz said on one Mexican television broadcast.)By the day of Mexico\u2019s first game, Moscow was brimming with visitors. People stopped to make small talk.\u201cSombrero!\u201d said a man wearing a German flag over his shoulders.\u201cSombrero,\u201d Diaz said back.Later, a woman from Kyrgyzstan asked if she could borrow his sombrero, and he sat silently for several minutes as each person in her group of six took turns taking selfies with it. (A sombrero, it turns out, can be a burden, too.)For the most part, though, Diaz and his sombrero were drawing far less attention than before. Others, like a group of tipsy Swedes wearing horned helmets, were stealing away some of the demand for pictures. Anyway, he was more focused on finding a way inside the stadium.\u201cDo you know how many girls want to talk to Maluma?\u201d Diaz said, sounding amazed.Shut out of the game, Diaz had to watch Mexico\u2019s stunning upset of Germany at an outdoor fan festival. It was less than ideal, but a couple of days later, it felt like his luck might turn. His father\u2019s cousin\u2019s husband sent him a text asking if he was in Russia. He and his three adult children were driving to Rostov-on-Don for Mexico\u2019s second game, and he invited Diaz to join them. The five piled into a rental car and headed south.On Saturday, a couple of hours before Mexico would face South Korea, Diaz rambled around looking for a ticket outside Rostov Arena. He had little luck, until he ran into an older man wearing a white jersey. When the man took off his baseball cap and sunglasses, Diaz realized he was Enrique Meza, a former Mexico national team coach known as \u201cOjitos\u201d for his sharp eyes and the current manager of Puebla in the Mexican league. Meza sold him a spare ticket, a field level seat behind the goal, for $100.Inside, Diaz put on his sombrero and bounced along with the other 43,472 people at the game, all of whom had undertaken mini-odysseys of their own to get there.\u201cI don\u2019t know how, but I completed a dream,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m blessed.\u201dOn Monday afternoon, he was back in the back seat of a car on a 1,000-mile, multiday drive from Rostov to Yekaterinburg, where Mexico will play its final game in the group stage on Wednesday. He has no plans beyond that. He does not even have a return ticket home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brahms, the Berlin Philharmonic \u2026 and Me", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Gelles was executive director of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra.On a Thursday in May, 101 musicians gathered on the stage of the Philharmonie in Berlin to rehearse the First Symphony by Johannes Brahms and then perform the work under the direction of Simon Rattle, the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s conductor. For Mr. Rattle, or Sir Simon, or his preferred Simon, this would be one of his final concerts at his home for the past 16 years before taking over at the London Symphony Orchestra.Despite the imposing venue, those 101 musicians were amateurs all. They came from 30 countries, their ages ranging from 10 to 75. I was the elder bookend, one of six French hornists selected, and lending the event a special sweetness was the fact that I, like many others who play for sheer pleasure, chose not to pursue a professional career. In fact, I played virtually not at all for 37 years, and returned to my first love only 15 years ago.This was our route to Berlin: Having seen the event announced online by the Berlin Philharmonic at the start of the year, we auditioned by video for members of the orchestra. The ad hoc ensemble, known, cunningly, as the Be Phil Orchestra, offered a remarkable opportunity \u2014 to be a weeklong guest of one of the world\u2019s great ensembles, attending its rehearsals, being coached by its musicians and performing under its music director.Of the 1,900 avocational instrumentalists who expressed interest in participating, 1,000 were auditioned online, and the Berlin Philharmonic musicians then selected the 101. The occasion was a reprise of similar events that the Philharmonic hosted twice before, though not in recent years. Whether the tradition will continue after Mr. Rattle relinquishes his post of music director and relocates to London \u2014 his successor is the Russian Kirill Petrenko \u2014 is at present unknown.Among other reasons, the event was notable for advancing a notion put forward by the British social scientist and journalist Charles Leadbeater in \u201cThe Pro-Am Revolution.\u201d Mr. Leadbeater\u2019s book, published in 2004, suggests that there is an overlap, slight but significant, between the realms of professionals and amateurs, that \u201cPro-Ams \u2014 people pursuing amateur activities to professional standards \u2014 are an increasingly important part of our society and economy.\u201d It should be stressed, however, that as adept as an amateur instrumentalist might be, the skills and stamina of the professional musician are of an altogether different order.Mr. Leadbeater cites the best-known of these manifestations, the Pro-Am sports tournaments, but he mentions, too, the various streams of expertise and interests that create open-source computer programs, that make astronomical discoveries, that lead to political engagement and change. He argues convincingly that just as professionals have much to teach amateurs, so too do amateurs have insights worth sharing with those more skilled. Should you search the open-source universe, you will find myriad programs ranging through the sciences and humanities, to mathematics and finance, to games and genealogy and hobbies. Firefox and Linux are among the most familiar names; CyberBrau perhaps less so.For those of us in the Be Phil Orchestra, proximity to the Berlin Philharmonic was thrilling. As was the opportunity to meet colleagues whose nationalities and professions were literally and figuratively all over the map. There was Alexander, a cellist from London, an attorney; Yoram, a tympanist from Israel, an engineer; and among the other hornists, Emma from the Netherlands, active in law enforcement; Tony from Canada, a luthier with guitars his specialty; Kjartan from Iceland, a lecturer at the University of Akureyri; and Cody, an administrator at the University of South Carolina\u2019s law school.Stanley Dodds led our rehearsals for the first two days. A violinist in the Philharmonic and a conductor of formidable gifts, clarity was his keynote: clarity of musical thought, clarity of expression, clarity of technique.Mr. Rattle rehearsed us for the next two days, and the Brahms First was much on his mind. Within a week of our performance, he would conduct the same piece with his Berlin Philharmonic. Yet to our rehearsals, he brought the same energy and insights he would bring to any orchestra.Most notably, he kept urging, exhorting with words and gestures, that solo lines sing with vocal intensity, and moreover, that they be animated and infused with an operatic urgency. Brahms never composed an opera, but had he written one, its melodies might have soared like these. The performance was a kaleidoscope of pleasures: Mr. Rattle on the podium, Brahms on the music stand, 100 fellow musicians, many now friends, sharing the stage at the Philharmonie.Performing on that stage reveals a secret in the design of architect Hans Scharoun. Flanking the ensemble on either side are walls of a sort that gently taper down from the rear of the orchestra toward the front of the stage, from about 16 feet in height to eight. These structural features look like nothing architecturally and do everything acoustically. They enclose and embrace the orchestra, creating uncommon community among the musicians. You know there are 2,200 people in the audience before you, but your energies are contained in this privileged space onstage.The Be Phil performance was the capstone of a daylong open house to which the Philharmonic invited any and all. Thousands attended and sampled a fascinating smorgasbord. On the plaza in front of the hall, guests could whack away al fresco on a jumble of percussion \u2014 xylophone, gongs, chimes, and drums large and small. Inside, there were informal performances by members of the Berlin Philharmonic and friends: chamber music, ethnic music, jazz and soul.George Gelles has written on music and dance, served at the National Endowment for the Arts and at the Ford Foundation, and for 15 years was executive director of Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s New Populist and Anti-Establishment Government Is Sworn In", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Luigi Di Maio, the political leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, looked giddy as he led the rest of Italy\u2019s new populist government into a frescoed room in Rome\u2019s Quirinal Palace on Friday to be sworn in by a president whose impeachment Mr. Di Maio had demanded only days earlier.\u201cI swear to be faithful to the republic,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said under the crystal chandeliers and vaulted ceilings before shaking the hand of President Sergio Mattarella. And, he added, he pledged \u201cto loyally serve the Constitution and the laws and to carry out my functions in the exclusive interests of the nation.\u201dAfter a long electoral campaign in which Five Star and their governing partners, the anti-immigrant League, riled up anger and electoral support with vitriolic attacks on the European Union, illegal migrants and their rivals in the Democratic Party, the question turned to how they would actually govern.Despite the doubts demonstrated by Italy\u2019s president and the global markets over their anti-euro tendencies and worries among European Union leaders about an erosion of liberal values and the bloc itself, the leaders of the alliance seemed intent on renegotiating Italy\u2019s relationship with Brussels and cracking down on migration. Their early statements in power do not indicate a sudden change of heart.That tone contrasted with the gleeful smiles on faces of the 18 ministers as they entered the Quirinal Palace on Friday. The swearing-in ceremony marked the end of an opera that was by turns comic and tragic, and that for 88 days after inconclusive March elections enthralled, bored, frustrated and ultimately either delighted or horrified Italians.In a later ceremony, the departing prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, handed a little bell to his replacement, Giuseppe Conte, to signal the passage of power from a center-left government that ran Italy for five years to the populists.Mr. Gentiloni and his under secretary, Maria Elena Boschi, a target of some of the most venomous attacks of the campaign, shook the hands of the populists and then left the building.After Mr. Conte received the bell, Mr. Di Maio and Mr. Salvini, both vice premiers, flanked him for a photograph. Many political analysts in Italy consider Mr. Conte, a little-known lawyer, to be a pawn of the two powerful ministers.They then had their first cabinet meeting before a confidence vote next week, which is a mere formality because the two parties control a majority of the Italian Parliament.Many political analysts have wondered how long the government will last, given that the coalition members\u2019 bases, in northern Italy for the League and southern Italy for the Five Star Movement, have contrasting needs. But it was clear that both parties wanted to deliver on their chief campaign promises and priorities quickly.On Thursday night, after the government was officially announced, Mr. Salvini traveled to Sondrio, in his northern Italian base, and told an adoring crowd at a rally that he had already talked with the new finance minister about cutting from the budget the 5 billion euros allotted for caring for migrants in Italy.Mr. Salvini, who will maintain his leadership position in the League, is expected to speed up expulsions, break up Roma camps and seal Italy\u2019s borders. On Friday he said, \u201cThe migrants who camp out here for lunch and dinner are evidently too many.\u201dMr. Di Maio is now in charge of a newly created ministry of vast power, combining economic development and labor. He plans to immediately work on job creation and punish businesses that move out of Italy at the expense of Italian jobs.Any company that receives a government subsidy and reduces its work force by 50 percent must return the incentives if it moves out of European Union within three years.Mr. Di Maio also wants to force companies that leave Italy for other countries in the European Union to return their government incentives. It is a delicate proposal because it could run afoul of the bloc\u2019s free trade rules.Mr. Mattarella paved the way for the formation of the alliance between the two populist parties when he threatened to break a long stalemate by appointing a technocratic government. After weeks of working on a governing program, the alliance chose Mr. Conte to present the cabinet to Mr. Mattarella.But the president, who has vast powers to protect Italy\u2019s Constitution during transition periods, objected to the alliance\u2019s choice of Paolo Savona, 81, for finance minister, citing Mr. Savona\u2019s involvement in a guide to leave the euro.The president\u2019s opposition prompted call for mass mobilization by Mr. Di Maio that nearly led to early elections. But at the last minute, the alliance came back together and, appeasing Mr. Mattarella, shuffled Mr. Savona to the Ministry of European Affairs.After he left the palace, Mr. Salvini said, \u201cSavona is in the right place to renegotiate the E.U. rules, and we have a finance minister in perfect synchrony with Savona, thus there is no step back, but he\u2019s been doubled.\u201dThe new finance minister, Giovanni Tria, told reporters inside the palace that \u201cno political party wants Italy out of the euro.\u201dEnzo Moavero Milanesi, a former European Union official will be the foreign minister, and Lorenzo Fontana, a staunch opponent to same-sex unions and adoptions and an admirer of Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orban in Hungary, will be the minister for families and the disabled.The country\u2019s new health minister, Giulia Grillo, is a doctor who has engaged in Italy\u2019s debate over vaccines, which many in the Five Star movement are skeptical of. While she believes vaccines are necessary, she has expressed doubt about requiring children to be vaccinated, preferring to persuade skeptical parents.Speaking at a rally on Friday afternoon, Maurizio Martina, a leader of the Democratic Party, characterized the new government of 18 ministers as bearing the imprint of the far right. Referring to the new coalition government\u2019s agenda, he said: \u201cThis is a contract of fear. A contract of nightmares. Of the few against the many.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Fed Tweaked an Obscure Interest Rate This Week", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve has formidable powers to help steer the United States\u2019 $20 trillion economy. So when it makes even the smallest of tweaks to one of its tools, take note.But for those who want to know more, let\u2019s look at how the Fed is steering the economy.In fact, the Fed targets a range for the federal funds rate. It on Wednesday raised that range to 1.75 percent to 2 percent, from 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.Now for a more subtle point. The interest rate on excess reservesplays a supporting role to the fed funds rate in monetary policy. Previously, the Fed set the interest rate on excess reserves at the same level as the top of the- fed funds rate. But on Wednesday the Fed said the interest rate on excess reserves would now be set 0.05 percentage point below the top of the range.As a result, the interest rate on excess reserves is now 1.95 percent.So, why would the Fed pay interest on these excess reserves? The rate was introduced to give the Fed control over the reserves. Banks can turn reserves into real money by making loans. If banks make too many loans, the economy could overheat. To guard against that, the Fed introduced the excess reserve rate. If the economy is growing too quickly, the Fed can raise the interest rate on excess reserves to persuade banks to keep money at the Fed, rather than deploying it in the economy.Right now, the Fed doesn\u2019t need to use the rate on excess reserves as an emergency brake. But the rate does play a role in the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.But recent developments in the fed funds market prompted the Fed to make its change.The government has recently been issuing a lot more debt to finance its deficit, much of it in the form of Treasury bills that are sold to investors. But to find sufficient buyers, the Treasury has had to pay higher rates on Treasury bills. This helped attract money out of the federal funds market into Treasury bills, and in turn that caused the fed funds rate to move higher and closer to the top of its range.This caught the Fed\u2019s eye. The central bank, according to analysts, wants to avoid a situation in which the fed funds rate moves above the Fed\u2019s target range. \u201cThe Fed doesn\u2019t want anyone in the market to think it\u2019s not in control of overnight rates,\u201d Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, said. \u201cIt might worry some people if it went above the upper band.\u201dImagine that the Fed still set interest rate on excess reserves at the top of the range of the fed funds rate. Banks could go and borrow overnight funds at, say, 1.95 percent and deposit them at the Fed and earn 2 percent, netting the 0.05 percentage point profit. But such trades might continue to lift the federal funds rate, set in the market, too close to the upper band for the Fed\u2019s comfort. That\u2019s because the excess funds rate would be set at the upper band of the federal funds rate.But now, with the rate on excess reserves set at 0.05 percentage point below the upper band, the banks doing that kind of arbitrage trade would have to borrow in the fed funds market at 1.9 percent to earn the same profit margin. As a result, the market may set the federal funds rate further below the upper band \u2014 which is what the Fed wants.Big challenges still lie ahead. As the Fed reduces the stockpile of bonds it acquired through its bond buying program, it takes money out of the economy, and banks\u2019 excess reserves fall. This could make it harder to keep interest rates at levels appropriate for the wider economy. While the tweak to the rate on excess reserves shows that the Fed is prepared to be flexible, it will need to remain so. \u201cThis may be step one,\u201d Jim Vogel, a fixed income strategist at FTN Financial, said.Advertisement"}

She was 90.The cause was complications from several falls, her son, Christopher, said.Ms. King, whose uncle was dyslexic, taught, tutored, founded camps and trained teachers in education programs that were replicated around the world.\u201cThe time to diagnose dyslexia is before the child has a chance to fail at reading,\u201d she said.She was instrumental in transforming the popular perception of people with dyslexia from being backward or unteachable to being often highly intelligent despite their learning difficulties. Often they were endowed with keen powers of observation and original thinking, innate charm, a sense of balance and high energy.\u201cWe continue to see the tragedy of a bright child coming home from school in the second or third grade in tears \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m the dumbest kid in all of the second grade\u2019 \u2014 and getting stomach aches before they go to school, and all of this totally unnecessary and totally preventable, \u201d Ms. King said in a videotaped interview with the International Dyslexia Association in 2013. \u201cIt drives me crazy.\u201dShe said that dyslexia affects as many as one in five people and can be detected by age 4. (A child\u2019s saying \u201cwasherdisher,\u201d for example, or \u201cflutteryby\u201d can be symptomatic.) But through intensive tutoring, she maintained \u2014 learning a few letters at a time, and integrating spelling and handwriting into their curriculum \u2014 students can pass standardized tests or even surpass their peers by the fourth grade.\u201cI am aghast at the lack of training teachers get,\u201d she said.Her own formal scientific training was limited to a botany course, but she developed an expertise in learning disabilities as a teacher at the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, where she had a number of mentors, including Anna Gillingham, a pathologist who pioneered methods of remediating difficulties in reading and processing language in collaboration with Dr. Samuel T. Orton, a neuropsychiatrist.Diana Hanbury was born on Sept. 2, 1927, in London to Anthony Hanbury, who worked in finance, and Una (Rawnsley) Hanbury, a sculptor.In a 2014 interview with the founders of Camp Spring Creek in North Carolina, she recalled \u201cthose few moments when someone expressed confidence in me and my ability to learn.\u201d She was nine when a neighbor, a Royal Air Force pilot, taught her long division.She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of London and a master\u2019s from George Washington University. Her marriage to James Cecil King ended in divorce, but they remained lifelong friends. In addition to their son, she is survived by three grandchildren and her sisters, Jillian Poole, Anna Larkin and Josephine Coatsworth. A daughter, Sheila King, died earlier.Ms. King spent time in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) on her uncle\u2019s farm, realizing only later that he and his daughters were dyslexic. By chance, she was hired as a teacher at Ruzawi, a boys\u2019 boarding school, and immediately developed a passion for teaching.After emigrating to the United States in 1950 and teaching at Sidwell, she became a naturalized citizen. In 1955, she opened Camp Dunnabeck in western Pennsylvania, offering a six-week program for dyslexic children. She was soon stunned by how much they could progress in a matter of weeks.\u201cThey never had to experience failure or feel they were stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cThat one summer changed my life.\u201dMs. King also established a program for learning-disabled prison inmates.She retired from teaching at 85. In 2016, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Teachers Hall of Fame.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Dump Killed My Son\u2019: Mountains of Garbage Engulf India\u2019s Capital", "Date": "2018-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGHAZIPUR, India \u2014 Huddled in a stinky, airless room near the center of India\u2019s capital, Rammurti fumed over the 17-story-high mountain of trash half a mile from her home.The 43-year-old mother, who goes by one name, had watched the garbage in her village of Ghazipur pile higher and higher over the years. It wafted a sickening cocktail of airborne particles that infected her neighbors with tuberculosis and dengue fever, singed trees and turned the ground water a filmy yellow.But nothing had prepared her for one afternoon last September when a tower of trash broke away from the mass during monsoon rains. It crashed into a nearby canal, which created a surge of sewage that flung motorcyclists into another canal also filled with dirty water.\u201cThe dump killed my son,\u201d she said.\u201cIf this continues to happen, the city will drown in its waste,\u201d said Swati Singh Sambyal, a program manager at the Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi.\u201cI reiterate our commitment to sustainable development,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a recent conference for World Environment Day.But the government has been slow to take action to protect the environment. Politicians don\u2019t want to risk losing votes by making tough decisions that could be unpopular.Power in Delhi is shared by the local and national governments, which are controlled by different political parties, leading to bureaucratic gridlock. Even when rules are introduced, enforcement is weak and offenders can often pay a bribe to avoid punishment.Something as simple as installing trash cans around Delhi has not been done, partly because garbage collection is not guaranteed and many residents are used to simply flinging trash onto the ground.\u201cYou don\u2019t know whether the public will even use them,\u201d said Mr. Annepu.Driving into Delhi, virtually no trash cans are visible. Refuse piles up in slums, next to government offices and outside luxury condominiums. Shantytowns without sewage systems have mushroomed all over \u2014 next to railroad tracks and public parks and behind high-end shopping centers.In the last two decades, Delhi\u2019s population has quickly risen to about 19 million from about 12 million and infrastructure and governments services have not kept pace.During roughly the same period, the amount of waste ferried to the dumps has accumulated rapidly, growing from eight million pounds to at least 20 million daily. About half of the daily haul is converted to energy or composted. The rest sits and festers, according to P.K. Khandelwal, the chief engineer of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, a local government body.There are some signs of hope.One of the four dumps in Delhi, which is operated by the government and a private company, has reduced its garbage heap by turning some trash into mulch.But Mr. Khandelwal said the government had difficulty finding land for new dumps and dealing with local protesters who oppose waste sites in their backyards.A few hundred thousand people earn money from being ragpickers in Delhi.Politicians often prefer to maintain the status quo, said Ashutosh Dikshit, the chief executive of United Residents Joint Action, a Delhi group which advocates for access to better public services.\u201cThere is absolutely no painless way to fix this waste problem,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians are not willing to make even one resident unhappy because then that resident will vote for the other party.\u201dMr. Dikshit noted that the short-term strain of revamping waste management in Delhi outweighed long-term benefits for many residents. Poverty is widespread, and many are concerned primarily with providing food and basic shelter for their families from day to day.Three of the dumps exceeded their capacity years ago, rising to triple the legal height limit of 65 feet. But they remain open, shrouding neighborhoods in acrid plumes and bulging with flattened handbags, car windshields, needles and rotting food.Mr. Annepu said India still could get a grip on its overflowing garbage as other countries with large dumping sites such as South Korea and the United States have done.Collecting 100 percent of the waste in Delhi, closing the dumps and converting them into sanitary landfills would cost about $75 million, he estimated.But \u201cpolitical will has not materialized into financing,\u201d he said, adding that waste management is not an issue voters hold politicians accountable for.At the Ghazipur dump in Rammurti\u2019s village, which opened in 1984, paid employees rattled off horrific health conditions. The translucent, sea-foam-colored masks that workers wear provide little protection. Pus-filled skin infections, suffocating asthma attacks and heart arrhythmias are common.\u201cThe dirty air gets inside my body and my blood,\u201d said Ankit Yadav, 17, who lives next to the dump.Some in the area questioned why the dump continued to grow despite government promises to finally shut it down after last year\u2019s fatalities.\u201cWe are fourth-class citizens,\u201d said Mohammed Ismail, 66, a small-business owner. \u201cNobody listens to us. We die like insects. If this colony had been a V.I.P. colony, the dump would have been removed.\u201dRatan Kumar Barua, a resident who cannot afford to relocate, said he and his neighbors were at loggerheads with the government. He said he had made written complaints to the local police and government, a court body, a pollution control committee and Mr. Modi. They have all gone unanswered.\u201cNobody will come to our rescue,\u201d Mr. Barua said.On a recent day, trucks rumbled up a steep dirt road to the top of the garbage pile, where crows blotted out the sun and wind kicked up fumes from moldy vegetables and feces discarded in saggy plastic bags.Down below, Faiyaz Khan, the owner of a dairy plot, said this patch of land was once dense forest, perfect for his buffalo. He wondered what his future would hold.\u201cThe height of the dump keeps increasing and my health keeps decreasing,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cWe are uneducated people. We do not understand the law, but we do know that this dump is illegal. What do I do? Shall I smash my head into a wall? How long can I live here?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Austria Closes 7 Mosques and Seeks to Expel Imams Paid by Turkey", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria on Friday ordered the closing of seven mosques and the scrutiny of the right of dozens of Turkish imams to remain in the country, citing suspected violations of an Austrian law that bans \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d or foreign financing of Muslim institutions.\u201cParallel societies, politicized Islam or radical tendencies have no place in our country,\u201d Mr. Kurz said at a news conference announcing the measures in Vienna on Friday.Roughly 600,000 Muslims, most of them Turks or of Turkish descent, live in Austria, a country of 8.8 million.\u201cAustria\u2019s decision to close seven mosques and expel imams is a reflection of the Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory wave in this country,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is an attempt to target Muslim communities for the sake of scoring cheap political points.\u201dAnnouncing the first legal consequences of the inquiry on Friday, Mr. Kurz said that a group known as the Arab Cultural and Religious Community would be shut down on suspicion of promoting radical Islam, and that six of the mosques it operates were ordered to cease operations. Three of the mosques are in Vienna, two in the northwest of the country and one in the south.A seventh mosque, also in Vienna, that is run by a far-right group known as the Gray Wolves was considered illegal even by the country\u2019s main Islamic organization.Under the Islam law, Muslim religious organizations are banned from receiving the bulk of their financing from sources outside Austria. But many imams working in those organizations do so through the Turkish-Islamic Union for Cultural and Social Cooperation, known by the initials A.T.I.B., and are civil servants of the Turkish government.Speaking at the news conference, the Austrian interior minister, Herbert Kickl, said the authorities were reviewing the residence permits of about 40 imams employed by A.T.I.B., and their family members, over concerns they were being paid from abroad. He added that the permits of two others had already been revoked and that Austria had decided not to grant initial visas to five more.Yasar Ersoy, a spokesman for the organization, told the public broadcaster ORF that the religious leaders were paid by Diyanet, the Directorate of Religious Affairs, which is based in the Turkish capital, Ankara.The mosques and the imams have the right to challenge the order, the government said.Turkey has criticized Austria for what it sees as anti-Islam stances, but its foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, tried to mend ties in a visit to Vienna in March. Austria has opposed Turkey\u2019s accession to the European Union, and has angered the Turkish government by barring Turkish politicians from campaigning in the country.German news outlets found pictures indicating that similar re-enactments were being carried out in Germany, adding fuel to complaints against the sister branch of the organization based in Germany. Last year, several imams in mosques run by the organization were investigated over accusations that they were spying on critics of the Turkish government living in Germany.Carlotta Gall contributed reporting from Istanbul.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.O.P. to Americans With Health Problems: Drop Dead", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAnd even if the lawsuit fails, the administration\u2019s support for an incredibly flimsy legal challenge \u2014 one so indefensible that three career Justice Department lawyers withdrew from the case \u2014 is a clear signal of Republican priorities: G.O.P. to Americans with health problems: Drop dead.First there were lies about what was actually in the act. Remember \u201cdeath panels\u201d?But the most enduring lie from A.C.A. opponents \u2014 not just Trump, but all of them \u2014 is their claim that they want to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. They don\u2019t, and they never did.But the falseness of the pretense has always been obvious.This falsity was obvious on sheer logical grounds even before Republicans began proposing supposed replacements for Obamacare. If you\u2019re going to guarantee coverage regardless of medical history, you have to induce people to sign up for insurance while they\u2019re still healthy, so that insurers have a manageable risk pool. That means some combination of subsidies to make insurance affordable and penalties for going uninsured \u2014 in other words, it requires a system that looks a lot like the Affordable Care Act.So demands that the A.C.A. be scrapped always meant taking away coverage from the people who need it most; Obamacare opponents just hoped people wouldn\u2019t notice that fact. And the truth is that they mostly got away with it until last year, when Republicans had to offer specific health care legislation.At that point the game was up. It immediately became clear that every Republican alternative to Obamacare would, in fact, hang Americans with pre-existing conditions out to dry. And the public backlash against that revelation is basically the reason the G.O.P.\u2019s repeal effort failed. But it only failed narrowly. And if Republicans still hold Congress next year, anyone who has a history of medical problems and doesn\u2019t get health insurance from his or her employer will lose coverage.What may seem puzzling about all this is the cruelty. O.K., Donald Trump is obviously a man utterly lacking in empathy. But don\u2019t other Republicans feel a bit bad about the prospect of taking health care away from millions of Americans who have done nothing wrong besides having past medical problems?So, as I said, voters need to understand the stakes in these midterms. They will determine whether people with medical problems get the health care they need.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anger Flares as G-7 Heads to Quebec", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will skip most of the second day of a summit meeting with allies this weekend, the White House said late Thursday, as he engaged in a contentious war of words over trade on the eve of a gathering that will underscore his isolation from the leaders of the world\u2019s largest economies.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced that Mr. Trump will leave Canada at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, well before scheduled sessions on climate change, clean energy and oceans. He will attend an early-morning session on \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment,\u201d but he will be gone before any joint statement is issued by the other leaders.Earlier Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada lashed out at Mr. Trump for imposing tariffs on their steel and aluminum industries. They called it an illegal economic assault on their countries that is unanimously opposed by the other leaders of the Group of 7 who will gather Friday in a sleepy village in Quebec for their annual summit meeting.Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference with Mr. Macron that \u201cwe are going to defend our industries and our workers\u201d and \u201cshow the U.S. president that his unacceptable actions are hurting his own citizens.\u201dMr. Trump responded with his trademark Twitter bluntness a few hours later, signaling that he has no intention of relenting on his aggressive trade demands and cares little about the diplomatic niceties that usually constrain public disagreements between the leaders of friendly nations.He added, with a hint of sarcasm: \u201cLook forward to seeing them tomorrow.\u201dMr. Trump was scheduled to arrive Friday morning at the meeting for a gathering that traditionally includes a moment of global camaraderie \u2014 the \u201cfamily photo\u201d that captures presidents and prime ministers smiling for the camera.This year, there will not be many grins.Mr. Trump is the black sheep of this family, the estranged sibling who decided to pick fights with his relatives just before arriving to dinner. The dispute, Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, acknowledges, is \u201cmuch like a family quarrel,\u201d but with the potential for vast diplomatic and economic consequences for the world.\u201cPatently absurd\u201d is what Liam Fox, the British trade minister, called them. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said they were \u201cillegal,\u201d while Mr. Trudeau said they were \u201cinsulting and totally unacceptable\u201d \u2014 and that was in the carefully worded public statement. In a phone call with Mr. Trump, he was said to be even more blunt.Before the summit meeting, finance ministers from the other six countries that form the Group of 7, or G-7, condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s trade decisions in an extraordinary rebuke of a member nation\u2019s president. And some of the leaders themselves have threatened to boycott the usual end-of-meeting communiqu\u00e9. A senior Canadian official said a statement by only Mr. Trudeau, the gathering\u2019s host, is possible.Asked about the upcoming discussions in Canada, Ms. Merkel, the famously taciturn leader of Germany, said they would be \u201cdifficult.\u201dThere have been disagreements within the G-7 in the past, including a long chill between the Europeans and President George W. Bush over the Iraq war. When President Ronald Reagan put missiles in Europe, his counterparts branded him a cowboy who would start World War III.But rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 has there been the kind of visceral and unanimous outrage at an American president among the United States\u2019 most important allies, who for decades have seen the closest of relationships with the leader of the free world as a paramount foreign policy priority.So when Mr. Trump disembarks Friday morning from Air Force One for a day and a half of closed-door meetings in the resort town of La Malbaie, the president can expect a subzero reception for what some observers have begun calling the \u201cG6+1,\u201d a reference to the political and diplomatic isolation that Mr. Trump has created for himself with his unilateral trade and security actions against his friends.Cliff Kupchan, a veteran foreign policy analyst, said he expected a \u201cvery frosty dynamic\u201d and predicted that Mr. Trump is \u201cgoing to get an earful from all of them.\u201d Dan Price, who guided Mr. Bush through many economic summit meetings, said the other six leaders should express their concerns to Mr. Trump, \u201ceven at the risk of offending a notoriously thin-skinned president.\u201dAnd Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that because of \u201creal indignation and real frustration\u201d on the part of European leaders who are extremely angry at Mr. Trump, the \u201cventing process is likely to continue\u201d throughout the meeting.The ill will among the United States\u2019 allies is a striking contrast to the praise Mr. Trump has heaped on North Korea, one of the country\u2019s most enduring adversaries, before his historic meeting next week with Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s normally reclusive leader.Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the allies is also risking a go-it-alone approach to China\u2019s trade practices, even as many trade experts have called for a unified front by Western economies to confront China. The disputes with the United States have frustrated European leaders, who are eager for a joint effort that might pressure Beijing for change. Leaders had hoped to use the meeting to help formulate a strategy to combat China\u2019s surplus steel, but they now appear more likely to focus on their own trade divisions instead.\u201cThe isolation from our G-7 allies undermines the United States\u2019 ability to work with them to confront real challenges in Russia or China or the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cI certainly hope the president and his team will take the opportunity presented by the G-7 summit to find a path forward.\u201dOthers are less sanguine about that possibility.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the Iran deal was particularly infuriating to leaders in Europe, where businesses and banks had been eager to begin commercial activities in Iran with the lifting of sanctions. But because the president decided to withdraw the United States from the agreement, European businesses are likely to avoid doing business in Iran for fear of risking sanctions that could keep them out of the much more lucrative American markets.\u201cThere\u2019s no underestimating the level of anger and frustration,\u201d Mr. Dubowitz said. \u201cFor the Europeans, this is really a question of sovereignty. It\u2019s a direct challenge, in the case of Iran, to their national security.\u201dMr. Trump has sent no signals that he is willing to back off. In remarks to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Kudlow insisted that the president does not intend to be constrained by the global trading rules set up by his predecessors.\u201cThat system has been broken in the last 20 years-plus. The World Trade Organization, for example, has become completely ineffectual,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cInternational multilateral organizations are not going to determine American policy. I think the president has made that very clear.\u201dThe allies at the G-7 are unlikely to give in, either. The Canadians and the European Union have filed cases against the United States at the World Trade Organization, and they have announced retaliatory tariffs in a tit-for-tat series of economic moves that could set off an all-out trade war.French officials say Mr. Macron is likely to urge Mr. Trump to relent, arguing that Mr. Trump will damage the United States economy if he persists. Other allies are hoping that American businesses will pressure Mr. Trump to back off once the tariffs begin affecting their supply chains and profits.Clues to how the meetings in Canada have gone may be found in the body language of Mr. Trump and his counterparts as they pose for pictures before and after their sessions.Mr. Kupchan said he will be looking for the expressions on the faces of the allies: \u201cMerkel sitting next to Trump, having just talked about Iran, with a massive frown, looking the other way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my best bet.\u201dReporting was contributed by Ana Swanson from Washington, Steven Erlanger from Brussels, Peter S.

{"Headline": "New York Attorney General Sues Trump Foundation After 2-Year Investigation", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York State attorney general\u2019s office filed a scathingly worded lawsuit on Thursday taking aim at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, accusing the charity and the Trump family of sweeping violations of campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegal coordination with the presidential campaign.The lawsuit, which seeks to dissolve the foundation and bar President Trump and three of his children from serving on nonprofit organizations, was an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting president. The attorney general also sent referral letters to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action, adding to Mr. Trump\u2019s extensive legal challenges.The foundation was also used to curry political favor, the lawsuit asserts. During the 2016 race, the foundation became a virtual arm of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, email traffic showed, with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, directing its expenditures, even though such foundations are explicitly prohibited from political activities.Mr. Trump immediately attacked the lawsuit, characterizing it in a Twitter post as an attempt by the \u201csleazy New York Democrats\u201d to damage him by suing the foundation, and vowing not to settle the case \u2014 much as he did when the same office filed a lawsuit accusing Trump University. (Mr. Trump in 2016 paid a $25 million settlement to resolve the inquiry.)The $10,000 portrait of Mr. Trump was one of \u201cat least five self-dealing transactions\u201d facilitated by the foundation, according to the attorney general\u2019s office, violating tax regulations that prohibit using nonprofit charities for private interests.In 2007, to settle a dispute between the City of Palm Beach and Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, the foundation paid $100,000 to the Fisher House Foundation, another charity.In 2012, a man named Martin B. Greenberg sued the Trump National Golf Club after he made a hole in one at a fund-raising golf tournament that had promised to pay $1 million to golfers who aced the 13th hole, as he did. As part of a settlement, the charitable foundation paid $158,000 to a foundation run by Mr. Greenberg.The foundation also paid $5,000 to one organization for \u201cpromotional space featuring Trump International Hotels,\u201d and another $32,000 to satisfy a pledge made by a privately held entity controlled by Mr. Trump to a charitable land trust.The foundation lawsuit, and the referrals to the federal agencies, are the latest of Mr. Trump\u2019s voluminous legal challenges, starting with the ongoing investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.\u201cAs our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,\u201d said Barbara D. Underwood, New York\u2019s attorney general, who has been on the job a little over a month. \u201cThis is not how private foundations should function and my office intends to hold the foundation accountable for its misuse of charitable assets.\u201dNumerous state and federal laws preclude nonprofit organizations and charities like the Trump Foundation from lobbying, aiding a political campaign, or giving undue benefits that further a person\u2019s self-interests, rather than those of the organization. The restrictions are in place to ensure that donations are used for the expressed purpose of the nonprofits; violations can result in penalties, including revocation of the organization\u2019s nonprofit status.The petition notes that Mr. Trump himself signed annual I.R.S. filings, under penalty of perjury, in which he attested that the foundation did not engage in political activity. \u201cThis statutory prohibition is absolute.\u201dYet after the Iowa fund-raiser, Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation \u201cceded control over the charitable funds it raised to senior Trump campaign staff, who dictated the manner in which the foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants,\u201d according to the petition.That same month, an official at the foundation emailed Mr. Lewandowski, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time, telling him \u201cwe should start thinking about how you want to distribute the funds collected.\u201dMr. Lewandowski, in a reply, wrote that \u201cI think we should get the total collected and then put out a press release that we distributed the $$ to each of the groups.\u201d He later sent a list of veterans\u2019 groups \u201cpurportedly approved by Mr. Trump to receive grants from the Foundation.\u201dThe full text of the petition the New York Attorney General filed against the Donald J. Trump Foundation.The list was created by another campaign staffer, Lisa Maciejowski Gambuzza, and edited by a third, Stuart Jolly, a political director. And Mr. Lewandowski asked that some of the disbursements be made in Iowa in the days before that state\u2019s presidential nominating caucuses, which mark the kickoff of the primary calendar.Allowing the campaign to control the spending of the foundation\u2019s charitable funds represented coordination between the two entities, as well as \u201can improper in-kind contribution of no less than $2.823 million (the amount donated to the foundation) to the campaign,\u201d according to the lawsuit.Beyond the restitution, the foundation and its directors could face several million dollars in additional penalties, depending on how the court rules. The attorney general\u2019s office is also seeking to bar the president from serving as a director, officer or trustee of another nonprofit for 10 years.Likewise, the petition seeks to bar Mr. Trump\u2019s three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, from the boards of nonprofits based in New York or that operate in New York for one year, which would have the effect of barring them from a wide range of groups based in other states.While the three eldest children ostensibly served on the foundation board from 2006 to 2017, the board never even met after 1999, according to the petition, which called the foundation \u201can empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors.\u201dThe letters the New York Attorney General sent to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission detailing accusations against the Donald J. Trump Foundation.Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, released a statement from the Trump Foundation on Thursday that characterized the lawsuit as \u201cpolitics at its very worst.\u201d The statement accused Mr. Schneiderman of using the foundation investigation \u201cto not only advance his own political goals, but also for his own political fund-raising,\u201d and suggested that Ms. Underwood has shown that \u201csuch political attacks will continue unabated.\u201dThe attorney general\u2019s referrals to the I.R.S. and the F.E.C. could add another wrinkle that might slow the foundation\u2019s dissolution. The agencies are not known for their expeditious handling of enforcement actions, and the lawsuit notes that the foundation cannot legally complete its wind down \u201cuntil the complaints to the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Election Commission have been resolved and it is determined if any penalties or fines will be imposed on the foundation.\u201dJesse Drucker and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And Kate Spade\u2019s Bag Was It.", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a nylon sack, with a little black tag, and if you were a teenage girl in New York City in the late \u201990s, you simply Had. To. Have. It.The apparent suicide of Kate Spade, the designer whose eponymous pocketbooks swung from the shoulders of Manhattan\u2019s coolest teenagers, reverberated painfully on Tuesday through a rarefied set of young New York women. Among those who grew up taking yellow cabs across the Upper East Side to high school and playing hooky on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, there was a sense of having lost a girlhood friend: the woman who created the glossy handbags that became a talisman of almost-adulthood and the sine qua non of belonging to the city\u2019s inner circle.Kate Spade\u2019s brand \u201cwas New York bred, and we were New York bred, and it was important for us to be part of that culture,\u201d said Gillian Greaves Saines, 34, who grew up on the Upper East Side and carried her books in a black Kate Spade tote to school at Convent of the Sacred Heart off Fifth Avenue. \u201cShe had started this company with New York in mind, and we were all born and bred New Yorkers, and it embodied who we wanted to be when we grew up.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter that the bag\u2019s creator was born Katherine Brosnahan in Kansas City, Mo.; her simple and unfussy carryalls, adorned with little more than a black tab with the name she used professionally in white lettering. At the turn of the last century her bag came to encapsulate a decidedly Manhattan moment in time.The good girls got them for their bat mitzvahs; the bad girls swiped them from Barneys, swishing through the revolving doors with the illicit merchandise tucked inside their own Kate Spade bags. Girls who did not have them pined for them; not wanting one was a statement in itself \u2014 carrying, say, a Manhattan Portage bag instead, declared you were \u201calternative.\u201dPriced between $150 and $450 in the 1990s, they were aspirational, but attainable for some city kids \u2014 if you hoarded your babysitting pennies, said Carey Shuffman, 27, who attended the private Brearley School. \u201cYou could have something that a grown-up had, and look sophisticated. But it wasn\u2019t inappropriate or too adult, the way that walking down the street with a Burberry tote would be,\u201d she said.Ms. Shuffman, who works in finance, recalled browsing the bags at Bloomingdale\u2019s on Lexington Avenue with her mother at the height of the craze. \u201cThere could be a ton of other girls like you, who would have saved their allowance and their babysitting money, or their bat mitzvah money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there was also a woman you could look up to, in a suit and heels, buying one for themselves for work.\u201dAccording to the New York Police Department, Ms. Spade, 55, was discovered unresponsive at her apartment on Tuesday; she had hanged herself in her bedroom.

{"Headline": "German Hard-Liners Want to Close Borders, Threatening Merkel Coalition", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The populist surge that has left Hungary, Austria and Italy threatening to close their borders to migrants has now spread to Germany, where it could even bring down Chancellor Angela Merkel and further unhinge Europe Union\u2019s cohesion and stability.In recent days, Ms. Merkel has faced an increasingly virulent mutiny over the issue, which threatens to fracture her governing coalition as early as next week.The mutiny is led by her own interior minister, Horst Seehofer, a former Bavarian premier with a towering stature and plenty of beer-tent charisma, who sounds more in line with the nativist forces shaping politics in neighboring countries than with his own boss.His region found itself on the front line of the refugee crisis in 2015, when Ms. Merkel opened the borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants who poured into Bavaria. He has long been an outspoken critic of her decision, and in recent days the two leaders have been locked in a standoff.Like Europe\u2019s more hard-line politicians on the right, Mr. Seehofer wants Germany to turn back at the border migrants who have no papers or who are already registered in another European country.Ms. Merkel has blocked the proposal because it would defy Europe\u2019s open-border agreement; place an even greater burden on southern European countries, often the first ones to register migrants; and risk widening the already gaping divisions in the European Union.Because of its troubled history and Ms. Merkel\u2019s welcoming stance in 2015, Germany seemed somewhat more immune than other countries to the populist wave washing over Europe.The Bavarian revolt, coming as the region is preparing for state elections in October, has now provided a powerful glimpse of the groundswell of nativist anger that is building even in the richest parts of Europe\u2019s richest country.\u201cThe Bavarian conservatives are closing ranks with Europe\u2019s populists,\u201d said Andrea R\u00f6mmele, a professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. \u201cThis is serious. It\u2019s pure populism.\u201dPart of the price for the support of the conservative, Bavaria-based Christian Social Union was having Mr. Seehofer in the powerful position he now holds.Tension between the two leaders have steadily built. In March, Mr. Seehofer stirred controversy when he declared that \u201cIslam does not belong to Germany,\u201d only to be contradicted by Ms. Merkel.Ms. Merkel wants to find a European solution to the migration issue at a summit meeting of the 28-country bloc in two weeks. \u201cIt is an issue that we must resolve at a European level,\u201d Ms. Merkel said this week. \u201cThat is very important to me.\u201dBut Mr. Seehofer is not budging.The far-right Alternative for Germany (known by its German initials AfD) has been expanding its support in Bavaria, threatening the stronghold of Mr. Seehofer\u2019s Christian Social Union, which now risks losing its absolute majority for only the second time in half a century.He and his party have responded by veering sharply to the right: The proposal to turn back migrants at the border is reminiscent of one AfD made late last year.In a spectacular gesture of defiance, Mr. Seehofer has given Ms. Merkel an ultimatum: If she does not agree to the measure, he will carry it out against her will.The implication is that the border police in Bavaria, the main gateway into Germany for migrants, could start turning them back at the border as early as next week.It is the most direct challenge to Ms. Merkel\u2019s authority yet \u2014 and to the values her chancellorship has embodied.For Mr. Seehofer, turning migrants back at the border has become a symbol of re-establishing control. For Ms. Merkel, keeping the border open is the last remaining symbol of her liberal migration policy.\u201cAsylum tourism must end,\u201d said Markus S\u00f6der, the Bavarian premier, using language frequently used by populists to describe the influx of refugees. His government has recently passed a hard-line police reform measure that restricts civil liberties, and has floated the idea of a Bavarian border force \u2014 although Bavaria borders only fellow European Union member states.\u201cWe have to consider our own people, not always focus on the whole of Europe,\u201d Mr. S\u00f6der said.Mr. Seehofer, who reportedly does not vacation abroad, could not agree more. As interior minister, he is also \u201cheimat minister,\u201d a position he created in Bavaria five years ago and now wants to export to the whole country. Heimat is a fuzzy but evocative German term roughly meaning home, identity and belonging.And he has been busy seeking like-minded allies elsewhere in Europe, where they are more and more of them.On Wednesday, he skipped a meeting with Ms. Merkel to meet an outspoken critic of hers instead: Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria, who was elected last year on a pledge to clamp down on illegal immigration and leads a coalition with the far-right.During a joint news conference, Mr. Kurz spoke of the need for \u201can axis of the willing\u201d in the fight against illegal migration, a turn of phrase, some commentators pointed out, that was once used by Benito Mussolini to describe the alliance between Italy and Germany.As if on cue, Mr. Seehofer let slip that he had spoken to his Italian counterpart, Mr. Salvini, to forge an alliance on border security among Berlin, Vienna and Rome.Just a few days earlier, Mr. Salvini had turned away two migrant ships: \u201cThe nice life is over for illegal migrants,\u201d he said recently. \u201cThey can pack their bags.\u201dMr. Seehofer is also a personal friend of Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s anti-immigrant prime minister, whom he has hosted several times in Bavaria. When Mr. Orban won re-election in April, Mr. Seehofer warmly congratulated him.\u201cNothing is more powerful a validation than success at the ballot,\u201d he had commented, despite election observers\u2019 talk about a \u201cclimate of intimidation,\u201d and warned the European Union not to be \u201carrogant and patronizing.\u201dThe son of a builder, who rose through the party ranks in Bavaria, Mr. Seehofer has unapologetically embraced populism: \u201cI will not apologize for doing politics for the people,\u201d he once remarked.Always on opposite ends of the conservative spectrum, Mr. Seehofer, 68, and Ms. Merkel, 63, nevertheless share a long and checkered history.In 2007, when Mr. Seehofer was a junior minister in her first government, it emerged that he had fathered a child out of marriage. The news media turned a harsh glare on Mr. Seehofer, a proud Catholic who has always had a cross on the wall of his ministerial office, but Ms. Merkel stood by him.That has not stopped him from challenging the chancellor repeatedly. In October 2015, weeks after Ms. Merkel opened the border, Mr. Seehofer threatened to take her before the constitutional court if she did not limit the number of migrants.Last fall, he was lobbying for an upper limit of 200,000 asylum seekers per year. Ms. Merkel pointed out that a hard limit was unconstitutional.There is no obvious way out of their current showdown, which made for a tense and turbulent week in Berlin.On Tuesday, Mr. Seehofer was scheduled to announce his 63-point \u201cmaster plan\u201d but canceled at the last minute because he and Ms. Merkel could not agree.On Wednesday, they met until late into the night but parted with no agreement.On Thursday, a raucous parliamentary session had to be adjourned to give the two conservative groups time to talk between themselves.By the end of the week, Ms. Merkel had received the support of most, though not all, senior members in her own party. The former Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble was hastily appointed as a mediator.On Monday, Bavaria\u2019s conservatives are expected to confirm whether Mr. Seehofer will, indeed, defy Ms. Merkel.The survival of Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition is at stake. \u201cIt is possible that we won\u2019t have a government next week,\u201d Ms. R\u00f6mmele said. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s 50-50.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Taps the Brakes on Its Global Push for Influence", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has spent nearly five years steering an ever-growing stream of hundreds of billions of dollars to a bold plan to gain greater global influence by funding big projects across Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.Now, Beijing is starting to tap the brakes.The value of the deals that Chinese companies are striking under the country\u2019s big global plan \u2014 called the Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 is smaller than a year ago, according to new data. Chinese officials themselves are sounding a cautious note, voicing worries that Chinese institutions need to be careful how much they lend under the program \u2014 and make sure their international borrowers can pay it back.\u201cCurrent international conditions are very uncertain, with lots of economic risks and large fluctuations for interest rates in newly emerged markets,\u201d said Hu Xiaolian, the chairwoman of the Export-Import Bank of China, a state-controlled lender that plays a big role in financing the projects, at a forum this month in Shanghai. \u201cOur enterprises and Belt and Road Initiative countries will face financing difficulties.\u201dChina has begun a broad, interagency review of how many deals have already been done, on what financial terms and with which countries, say people close to Chinese economic policymaking, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity because the effort has not been made public.American and European officials have long worried that Belt and Road represents a diplomatic and economic power grab by Beijing, fueled by its vast government wealth and helped by the Communist Party\u2019s laserlike focus on achieving long-term goals.Under the initiative, Chinese government-controlled lenders offer big chunks of money \u2014 usually through loans or financial guarantees \u2014 to other countries to build big infrastructure projects like highways, rail lines and power plants. That money often comes with the requirement that Chinese companies be heavily involved in the planning and construction, throwing them a lot of business.This year, some Chinese officials have expressed some concerns about lending under the program.\u201cEnsuring debt sustainability \u2014 that is very important,\u201d Yi Gang, the new governor of China\u2019s central bank, said at a conference in Beijing in late April.While Belt and Road activity remains huge, it has certainly become more restrained, according to official data. In the first five months of 2018, Chinese companies signed contracts worth $36.2 billion in business, down nearly 6 percent from the same period a year ago.\u201cI sensed that the level of enthusiasm about B.R.I. had certainly shifted down a few notches relative to last year,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell economist and former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division who recently visited Beijing and had extensive conversations with Chinese financial policymakers.Project activity could pick up later this year, of course. But an uncertain global economic outlook has given Beijing even more reasons to be cautious.But part of the problem now is that no one \u2014 not even the Chinese government \u2014 has a comprehensive picture of the lending so far. The Finance Ministry and the state-controlled banking system have poured money into projects from the Czech Republic to Laos, and from South Africa to Kazakhstan. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission estimated this spring that Chinese banks had lent $200 billion for 2,600 projects.Various government agencies have also issued extensive export guarantees, loan guarantees and other financial arrangements as part of the initiative, although some of these overlap with the bank loans.A Belt and Road slowdown may also be natural. Official data show Chinese companies are completing projects at nearly the same pace as they are signing deals for new ones, suggesting the initiative may simply be settling into a sustainable rhythm.\u201cThey are still very actively promoting Belt and Road,\u201d said Andrew Mackenzie, the chief executive of BHP Billiton, an Australian mining giant that is among the biggest exporters of iron ore to Chinese steel mills, which are among the intended beneficiaries of Belt and Road.Still, some Chinese officials are looking more closely at where the money is ending up.For example, they have been reassessing the country\u2019s financial exposure in Africa, a continent with immense natural resources that has lured a wide range of Chinese energy and construction companies, people close to Chinese policymaking said.Belt and Road has been viewed with increasing skepticism by multilateral institutions as well. They have warned that developing countries should not incur excessive debts.\u201cThe first priority,\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at the Beijing conference in April, \u201cis that Belt and Road only travels to where it is really needed.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Biggest Banks Pass Fed\u2019s Stress Tests", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s biggest banks are strong enough to continue lending if the economy plunges into a severe downturn, an assessment by the Federal Reserve on Thursday that could fuel Wall Street\u2019s calls to further relax financial regulations.The results of the first phase of the Fed\u2019s annual \u201cstress tests\u201d showed that the country\u2019s banks have more than enough capital to survive the combination of a recession, cratering of housing prices and double-digit unemployment.The banks are riding high thanks to tax cuts and recent moves to soften regulations. They are eager to return more of their profits to shareholders, and the test results suggest regulators will give many the green light to pay dividends or buy their own shares next week.Still, two Wall Street giants \u2014 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 came close to falling short on one of the Fed\u2019s financial-health gauges. That could complicate their plans to pay dividends and repurchase their shares.The ability of most banks to ace the tests is an indication of how far Wall Street has come since the financial crisis. A decade ago, bad bets on the housing market crippled the industry and led the government to bail out hundreds of banks.To prevent a repeat of those taxpayer-financed rescues, the Fed now requires banks to maintain capital cushions that would allow them not only to stay afloat but also to keep lending during periods of intense financial stress. Since 2009, the 35 banks that underwent the tests have added about $800 billion in the highest quality type of capital, the Fed said.The Fed\u2019s annual simulation tested 35 of the largest banks, including the United States units of several foreign firms. Under the Fed\u2019s \u201cseverely adverse scenario,\u201d which envisions the economy rapidly sinking into a recession, banks would suffer losses totaling $578 billion, but they would still have enough capital to stay above the minimum levels required by the central bank.\u201cDespite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year\u2019s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,\u201d Randal K. Quarles, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, said in a statement.This is the second straight year that all the big United States banks were found to have enough capital to withstand a hypothetical recession. In 2017, the banks sailed through the first round of the stress tests, and, a week later, the Fed approved all 34 banks\u2019 plans to return money to their shareholders.This time around, though, Goldman and Morgan Stanley might need to adjust those plans. Both Wall Street firms came perilously close to falling below the Fed\u2019s minimum level on a key metric, the so-called supplementary leverage ratio. It is intended to measure the ability of banks to withstand severe economic distress, and the test punishes companies for a heavy reliance on borrowed money and for exposure to assets that are not on their balance sheets.The Fed requires large banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 3 percent of their assets and certain other positions. Goldman\u2019s ratio was as low as 3.1 percent under the stress tests, while Morgan Stanley\u2019s lowest was 3.3 percent. (Under a separate measurement in the tests, Goldman had a 5.6 percent capital ratio, and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 7.3 percent, safely above the Fed\u2019s 4.5 percent minimum.)Those low ratios mean the two banks might have to reconsider how much money they want to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Next week, the Fed will run a more consequential round of stress tests, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, in which the regulator will decide whether banks are sufficiently strong and well-managed to warrant their dividend and buyback plans.In a statement on Thursday, Goldman said its own of forecasts of how its capital levels would fare during downturns came up with different results than the Fed. The bank said it planned to discuss the divergence with the Fed ahead of next week\u2019s test.In a statement on Thursday, Goldman said it did not agree with the results of the Fed\u2019s tests and that it planned to discuss the \u201cdivergence\u201d between the bank\u2019s measurements and the Fed\u2019s ahead of next week\u2019s test.Morgan Stanley said in a statement that Thursday\u2019s results \u201cmay not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make.\u201dWells Fargo, which has faced a series of regulatory penalties stemming from its sales practices, was among the banks to easily clear the Fed\u2019s hurdles. Its key capital ratio was 8.6 percent, above the Fed\u2019s 4.5 percent minimum. That was the highest among the country\u2019s five largest banks, as measured by assets.Other large banks weren\u2019t far behind, with Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase showing that their capital ratios would have held above 7 percent under the Fed\u2019s worst-case economic scenario.While the results are likely to cheer bank executives and shareholders, skeptics cautioned against regulators responding to the strong performances by watering down safeguards against future crises.\u201cThis just shows that regulators\u2019 models are saying that you have O.K. capital. But guess what, regulators\u2019 models said before the financial crisis that you had O.K. capital, too,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group that pushes for tougher financial regulation. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is telling us that everything is O.K. and we don\u2019t need to be vigilant.\u201dRepublicans in Congress and regulators in the Trump administration appear open to more changes. Fed officials have stressed that they want to keep the architecture of the post-crisis regulatory regime, while improving it in particular for smaller financial institutions.Banks are in the midst of an era of extraordinary profits, fueled by the strong American economy, record low unemployment and rising interest rates, which are a key source of bank profits.The biggest banks have said the tax cuts, which slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, will lower their effective tax rates considerably. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have both said the new law should reduce their tax rates next year to 19 percent, down nearly one-third from what they paid in 2016.\u201cThe banking system usually looks at its greatest health at the top of an expansion,\u201d said Kim Schoenholtz, a professor of the history of financial institutions and markets at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Educators Turn to Programs for Top Students to Narrow the \u2018Excellence Gap\u2019", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConsider two fifth graders. One struggles with math, reads below grade level and has trouble turning thoughts into paragraphs. The other is a high achiever who aces tests and thinks the homework her teacher assigns is too easy.Education reformers have focused their efforts for years on the first student, and many have been wary of creating separate, more advanced classrooms for the second. Given the United States\u2019 ugly history of denying certain groups access to a rigorous education, why devote resources to students who presumably already do well in school, when there are so many others who are behind?Indeed, closing the \u201cachievement gap,\u201d a phrase popularized by researchers in the 1960s, has been the focus of much education policy for decades. The goal has been to bring the academic performance of struggling students from low-income backgrounds, many of them black or Hispanic, up to the average level of their middle-class or more privileged peers.\u201cSomething started to change culturally in this country,\u201d said Jonathan Plucker, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Education and one of the researchers who coined the term excellence gap. \u201cJust to even talk about bright students was suddenly much more palatable to people,\u201d he said.Under that law, \u201cthe whole system was really designed to focus on minimum competency,\u201d Professor Plucker said. About four years ago, \u201cwe started to see a subtle shift\u201d toward focusing on high-ability students.The change occurred, in part, because No Child Left Behind\u2019s mandate to make all children \u201cproficient,\u201d as measured by standardized tests, resulted in more time spent on test preparation in American schools. Teachers and parents widely disliked that push.The solution, according to Professor Plucker and other advocates, is to put high-achieving and high-ability students in advanced classrooms for their strongest subjects, but not for every subject. The groupings should be more flexible than the rigid \u201ctracking\u201d of students in decades past, the advocates say, with many chances provided for students to gain access along the way. They say that children should be identified based on their abilities relative to their in-school peers, not on a national or state standardized test, to ensure that students from every neighborhood, race and class background have an opportunity.Others don\u2019t mind the label \u201cgifted,\u201d but would like to see it applied to groups who have long been denied it.\u201cPeople are starting to understand the social justice issue, that children living in poverty, and from racial and ethnic and language minorities, are not getting a fair shake at getting access to gifted services,\u201d said M. Ren\u00e9 Islas, executive director of the National Association for Gifted Children and a former Department of Education official during the Bush administration.It\u2019s not enough to simply reserve a small number of elite seats for disadvantaged students, said Jeannie Oakes, an emeritus professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles. Instead, the goal should be to \u201cprovide rich, wonderful opportunities to all kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThis whole stratifying system doesn\u2019t pay off for us.\u201dThe negative effects of tracking, the O.E.C.D. report noted, can be mitigated by allowing students to change tracks frequently, or to attend higher-track classes in one subject and lower-track classes in another.All students should be screened for advanced opportunities, not just those whose parents know to request it, said Lillian Lowery, a vice president at the Education Trust, an advocacy group focused on low-income and nonwhite students.In New York City, children do not take the admission test for the city\u2019s specialized high schools unless their families sign them up, and they are not considered for selective programs unless they apply. Many are unaware of the procedures and deadlines and miss the chance.\u201cMany families send their students to school just assuming that all the right things will happen, that every consideration about their best interest and access to opportunities will be tended to,\u201d Dr. Lowery said. \u201cAnd that does not happen.\u201dWinnie Hu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But they have remained mostly flat on the luxury side, thanks to the government\u2019s decision to raise stamp duties on the purchase of second homes in recent years, Mr. Clifford said. (The higher taxes were put in place to help first-time home buyers.)Still, \u201cthe market in Devon appears to be recovering from this,\u201d he said, \u201cand the best-in-class properties are selling well.\u201dWHO BUYS IN SOUTH WEST ENGLANDSouth West England is a popular destination for tourists and second-home buyers, known for its historic cities and stunning rural countryside, with its rolling hills and rugged coastline.Most buyers in the area come from other parts of England, real estate professionals said, and are often retirees or those close to retirement who can work remotely and commute to London once a week.The international buyers in South West England tend to be drawn to the high end of the market, above 3 million pounds ($4 million), Ms. Clifton said. \u201cMany come from the Middle East and Asia, looking for classic British architecture next to top schools,\u201d she said, adding that she has also seen interest from Americans and Europeans.BUYING BASICSForeigners face no restrictions on buying property in Britain, though obtaining local financing can be challenging.Real estate agents also suggested having a surveyor inspect the property and advise on its value.Buyers do not need to be present at the closing, and \u201cgenerally they aren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cEssentially the documentation gets signed by the relevant parties but not dated.

But I\u2019m going to be out there like I was with Jordan, proactively approaching people who are available or coming available.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re homing in on a strategy,\u201d she said of the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d adaptation. \u201cThe estate has actually been super helpful. Offering insight. Giving permission to make some big moves. They\u2019re not being precious.\u201dFor a company that spent an estimated $4.5 billion on programming last year, however, the programing slate is thin.\u201cWe\u2019re not going for something small and niche,\u201d said Ms. Salke, describing her strategy. \u201cYou can still have something that feels specific. But it needs to invite people in.\u201dThat\u2019s certainly how her bosses in Seattle feel. Because Amazon\u2019s hefty investment in content has yielded only mixed results in Hollywood, it is up to Ms. Salke to change that as quickly as possible.\u201cThe pressure on Amazon is their Prime membership growth has been slowing,\u201d said Greg Melich, a retail analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cAs a result, they need the members they have to get that much more engaged. And people that stream content also shop more frequently, spend more and are more likely to renew their Prime membership.\u201dMs. Salke comes to Amazon with a proven track record. She helped orchestrate a turnaround for NBC, taking it from a nadir when it briefly abandoned 10 p.m. dramas to first place for each of the last two seasons. During her tenure, NBC found the smash hit \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d Ms. Salke previously worked at Fox\u2019s television production studio, where she guided notable shows like \u201cGlee\u201d for Fox and \u201cModern Family\u201d for ABC.Dan Fogelman, the creator of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d credited Ms. Salke with taking an interest in his drama even before it became a runaway hit.\u201cWhen she is impassioned about a project, she is more intimately involved with the material than a quote-unquote entertainment president normally would be,\u201d he said.Ms. Salke may luck out with another film from the Price era, however \u2014 one from Mr. Fogelman. He directed \u201cLife Itself,\u201d a romantic drama about intersecting lives over multiple generations that is scheduled for release by Amazon in September. Amazon has high box office hopes for the film, which could also figure in the Academy Awards race.Ms. Salke will probably add a senior executive to Amazon\u2019s film team. With movies, \u201cwe want to maintain the level of excellence,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we do want to widen the aperture a little bit.\u201dBrooks Barnes reported from Culver City, and John Koblin from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Reaches $50 Billion Financing Deal With I.M.F.", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina reached a three-year deal with the International Monetary Fund on Thursday for a $50 billion credit line, an amount that was larger than expected, which the government promoted as a vote of confidence on its market-friendly reforms.The deal, known as a standby agreement, places requirements for cuts in the country\u2019s fiscal deficit that were sharper than initially planned. It also requires decreases in the inflation rate, which has long been one of the key challenges for the government. It is subject to approval by the I.M.F. board.The agreement \u201creflects support from the international community to Argentina and is very good news,\u201d the country\u2019s treasury minister, Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne, said. \u201cWe are very, very happy because it will allow us to go down the path of fiscal balance.\u201dMr. Dujovne specified that 30 percent of the total, or around $15 billion, would be available to Argentina shortly after approval by the I.M.F. board, expected on June 20. \u201cWe will try to maintain the rest of the funds as precautionary,\u201d he said.Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, took office in December 2015 with a goal of opening the country to international markets and wooing foreign investors after more than a decade of economic isolation.As part of the agreement with the I.M.F., Argentina committed to reducing its primary budget deficit at a faster clip than initially planned.The agreement also increases the independence of the central bank and establishes a clear path to reduce inflation to 9 percent in 2021 from 17 percent in 2019. Analysts expect inflation this year to be around 25 percent.\u201cThis is a pretty credible goal,\u201d said Gabriel Zelpo, the chief economist at Elypsis, a research and consulting company. \u201cIt isn\u2019t far from what the market was expecting and marks a change for a government that had fallen into a pattern of ambitious targets that it couldn\u2019t fulfill.\u201dIn what was likely a nod to the negative opinion that the Argentine public has of the fund, Mr. Dujovne took pains to emphasize that the agreement included \u201cinnovative\u201d measures to protect the most vulnerable members of society. That includes a provision to increase welfare spending if economic indicators worsen.Economic analysts say that the agreement is likely to lead to short-term economic pain, but that it could lay the groundwork for positive numbers.\u201cFiscal austerity will lead to lower growth, particularly next year,\u201d said Mat\u00edas Carugati, chief economist at Management & Fit, a consulting firm in Buenos Aires. \u201cBut it could be positive in the medium term. If, as a result of this deal, Argentina becomes more stable and predictable, it will provide a framework that is usually associated with higher growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs Made Millions in Malaysia. Now Malaysia Wants Some Money Back.", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Goldman Sachs once made a lot of money in Malaysia. Now Malaysia wants some of it back.The Malaysian government intends to seek restitution from Goldman Sachs, its new finance minister said this week, as it moves to resolve a huge scandal that led to the disappearance of billions of dollars and helped put the country deeply in debt.That could add significantly to the venerable Wall Street bank\u2019s problems in Malaysia, where it has become ensnared in the scandal. It already faces investigations in the United States and elsewhere related to its activity in the country, where it was once a dominant financial force.\u201cWe intend to seek some claims from them,\u201d Lim Guan Eng, Malaysia\u2019s new finance minister, said in an interview this week in Kuala Lumpur.The finance minister did not give any details about what kind of claims his government would seek, but he said that the authorities were likely to move cautiously and that the process \u201cwill take time.\u201d But he added that Malaysia\u2019s new leaders had reopened communication lines with American authorities that the country\u2019s previous leaders had shut off.\u201cThe Department of Justice has been superb,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cI think they have been really helpful.\u201dThose investigators have called it a \u201cmassive, brazen and blatant\u201d scheme. Mr. Najib has denied any wrongdoing.Goldman Sachs helped the investment fund \u2014 called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB \u2014 raise $6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013 through bond sales. Investigators say $2.5 billion of that money was then diverted to senior officials for their personal gain.The bank, which pocketed $600 million in fees for its work selling the bonds, said it was unaware of any wrongdoing.\u201cWe helped raise money for a sovereign wealth fund that was designed to invest in Malaysia,\u201d said Edward Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs.\u201cWe had no visibility into whether some of those funds may have been subsequently diverted to other purposes,\u201d he said.Goldman Sachs was a major player in Malaysia only a few years ago. At its peak in 2016, Goldman had two-thirds of the market in Malaysia for foreign bond offerings, according to data from Dealogic.Now, Goldman Sachs is largely staying away from any business that requires being in the public eye there. The 1MDB scandal made the difference. Mr. Najib created the sovereign wealth fund in 2009 and billed it as an economic development plan to benefit ordinary Malaysians.But Mr. Najib personally received $731 million stolen from the fund, prosecutors in the United States have alleged. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, received $30 million worth of jewelry bought with money that came from 1MDB, including a 22-carat pink diamond necklace that was worth $27.3 million, according to the prosecutors.Government filings say that some $200 million of the stolen funds was spent on paintings by artists like Picasso, Monet, van Gogh and Warhol. Another $250 million was used to buy a yacht with a private movie theater, a helicopter pad and enough space for dozens of crew members.Tens of millions of dollars went to finance Hollywood films like \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d through a production studio owned by Riza Aziz, Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson.In his acceptance speech after winning a Golden Globe for his leading role in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d Leonardo DiCaprio personally thanked Mr. Aziz and Jho Low, a high-flying financier whom the Malaysian authorities are now seeking to arrest and who helped Mr. Najib set up 1MDB.The scandal over the fund gripped Malaysia and ultimately led to the election victory of an opposition bloc led by the 92-year-old Mr. Mahathir on May 9, an earthshaking event in a country that had been governed by a single coalition for decades.Days after the election, Mr. Najib and his wife were barred from leaving Malaysia and their residences were raided. In scenes that played out on television sets across the country, the authorities hauled out hundreds of boxes that included luxury handbags, watches and jewelry. They also found $28.6 million in cash.In the United States, prosecutors are seeking to collect evidence that could be used to build a criminal case, according to two people with direct knowledge of the case who were not authorized to speak publicly.Malaysian officials may decide to share information that they uncover as they pursue new leads in their investigation.As part of the civil case in the United States, prosecutors have seized assets they allege are connected to the scheme. If they gather enough information to pursue a criminal case, the government could charge individuals and institutions.A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice declined to comment.Speaking about Goldman Sachs and the broader American financial system, Mr. Lim said that \u201cjust because of one Goldman Sachs does not mean that the entire financial system of the United States is compromised.\u201dHe added: \u201cOne bad egg does not mean the whole basket is rotten.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong, and Hannah Beech from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

{"Headline": "In California, Democrats Go After G.O.P.-Held Seats", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The votes in a big election day in California have been cast, and the country is eagerly awaiting the results. Key battles include seven Republican-held congressional seats Democrats hope to flip in the fall and a race to succeed Jerry Brown as governor.All of this has been complicated by California\u2019s unconventional election system: The top two finishers in Tuesday\u2019s nonpartisan, open primary will face each other in November. And that is causing headaches for both parties.Here\u2019s how to get up to speed:\u2022 In a potentially unnerving sign for Democrats in one contested congressional district, the Los Angeles County clerk revealed on Tuesday that a printing error had improperly left about 119,000 names off voting rosters in the area. As a result, some voters might have to cast provisional ballots and prolong the process of verifying and counting election results.\u2022 But if Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat and former mayor of Los Angeles, wins that second spot, look out for a competitive, classic North-South battle.A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.Liam StackHere are some nominees: Adam NagourneySome voters in Los Angeles might have to cast provisional ballots and prolong the process of verifying and counting election results after a printing error improperly left 119,000 names off voting rosters.The county clerk\u2019s office said 1,530 voting precincts were affected, though it did not specify which congressional districts those precincts are located in. The 39th Congressional District, one of the three seats where Democrats fear getting locked out of the general election, includes a piece of Los Angeles County. Strategists in both parties already expected a close result there with a slow process of tabulating votes.The voting problems posed a particular challenge to Antonio Villaraigosa, who is counting on a high turnout in Los Angeles \u2013 and among Latino voters \u2013 in order to win one of the two top spots in the governor\u2019s race. After the polls closed, he called on Los Angeles officials to keep voting centers open through Friday.\u201cAnyone who is turned away should be allowed to return to a vote center and make sure their vote is counted,\u201d Pat Dennis, Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cThis election is too important and every voice should be heard.\u201dIt is unclear whether the county\u2019s error might actually affect election results: voters who are properly registered but left off the roster by mistake are still entitled to vote, and can record their preferences with provisional ballots. Dean C. Logan, the county clerk and recorder of deeds, apologized in a statement for the \u201cinconvenience and concern this has caused\u201d but stressed that no one would be excluded from voting as a result.\u201cVoters should be assured their vote will be counted,\u201d Mr. Logan said.Still, in theory, a significant procedural mistake could deter some people from voting if it leads to longer lines at the polls or some voters simply choose not to cast provisional ballots upon finding their names are not in the roster. And some of the races touching Los Angeles County were already likely to be decided by small margins.Alex Burns and Adam NagourneyIn the state\u2019s nonpartisan top-two system, voters can cast a ballot for any candidate, regardless of party. Historically, that means these top-two primaries look a lot like the general election.Since 1990, the major party vote share in top-two congressional primaries in Washington State and California has differed from the general election result by an average of three percentage points, an Upshot analysis shows.That means the California results will be about as good as any data we are going to get before November. The average House poll over the final three weeks of an election is off by an average margin of 6.2 points, according to FiveThirtyEight. The primary results are a bit like getting a free round of 52 final House polls in early June.The results are good enough that you can put stock in a surprise. In 2016, Representative Darrell Issa\u2019s seat was rated \u201cSafely Republican\u201d by the Cook Political Report heading into the primary. But he ended up with just 50.8 percent of the vote, the closest House election of the cycle. Nate CohnLike many voters in Orange County, Tim Cain, 52, has been inundated with political messaging in recent weeks. He was bombarded with mail. His phone did not stop ringing.\u201cI literally could not go through my work day without getting flooded with calls,\u201d said Mr. Cain, a video game developer. \u201cI basically said, my phone is no longer available.\u201dBut some combination of that barrage and his desire to support a Democrat drew him to a polling station at a Buick car dealership in Tustin on Tuesday morning in the 45th Congressional District.About 20 miles south, at Laguna Beach City Hall, Aggie Dougherty had to thumb through the sample ballot packet she carried with her to remember which Democrat she had chosen after more than a dozen candidates inundated the 48th Congressional District with campaign material.Ms. Dougherty, a 67-year-old bookkeeper, read the fliers that landed in her mailbox, talked to friends, and listened to the news and advertisements. Then, she selected Harley Rouda, the candidate endorsed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in an unusual move aimed at preventing Democrats from losing a spot on the November ballot by splitting the vote in the primary. This morning, she just needed to double-check.\u201cOh, right,\u201d she said. \u201cHarley.\u201dJennifer Medina and Ivan PennThree hours before the polls close here in the CA-21, Shally Gill, a tax auditor, pulled into his family\u2019s peach farm in Kingsburg to check how the morning\u2019s packing went before heading out to vote. He is hoping David Valadao, a Republican, will win in November.But there is a catch: Mr. Gill lives in Clovis, outside the district, where his family\u2019s farms are, so Mr. Valadao isn\u2019t even on his ballot. It\u2019s a common dynamic in this part of the Central Valley, where farm owners often do not live on the ranch but in more affluent areas nearby, and remain invested in the politics of the district where their businesses are. T.J. Cox, the Democrat challenging Mr. Valadao, also does not live in the district he is seeking to represent.Mr. Gill, a Republican whose father moved to California from Punjab, India 40 years ago, is especially concerned about immigration reform. \u201cYou have families that aren\u2019t working out in the fields anymore because they are afraid there may be possible raids,\u201d he said, clarifying that he supports legal immigration.Luis Martinez, his farm manager, said it has been hard to get people to work. \u201cImmigration takes a lot of people out,\u201d he said.In the 48th District, Scott Baugh, a Republican candidate and former Orange County party chairman, talked with voters about attack ads targeting him, including mailers and television advertisements.\u201cThose came from Nancy Pelosi, you know,\u201d he said, referring to the ads. (The ads were paid for by the House Majority PAC, a heavily financed Democratic group.) \u201cShe is so afraid of me making the next round that she is trying to shut me out.\u201dHans Keirstead, a Democrat running in the 48th, said he had \u201creal fear that a party could be locked out this year.\u201dRocky Chavez, a Republican candidate in the 49th District race who has had to face down the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in addition to his own party rival, also criticized the system. In a race that features 16 candidates, the campaign committee had attacked Mr. Chavez for fear that right-leaning Democrats might support him, further diluting the party\u2019s chances.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a personality test,\u201d said Mr. Chavez, who wore a Rocky Balboa T-shirt on Tuesday.At least one Republican in the race enjoyed a bit of schadenfreude.\u201cThese guys are going to split the race so wide,\u201d said Ted Howze, a Republican candidate competing against five Democrats and the Republican incumbent in the 10th District. \u201cThe Democrats have shot themselves in the foot.\u201dBut for Mark Kramer, 64, a retired maintenance worker in the hotly contested 39th District, none of the choices had appealed enough to induce him to cast a ballot. \u201cNot crazy about the political climate,\u201d he said at the post office on Birch Street in Brea, Calif. \u201cOr any of the candidates.\u201dJennifer Medina, Jose A. Del Real, Thomas Fuller and Miriam JordanRepublican incumbent Dana Rohrabacher has represented coastal Orange County for so long, he is something of an institution in the 48th Congressional district, where many voters tend to refer to him by his first name. He has cultivated an image as a kind of iconoclast - a surfer and libertarian who supports legal marijuana. Even his less popular views haven\u2019t hurt him and played well in this area along the coast for three decades.But there were many signs Tuesday that the support is wearing thin. Voters in both parties complained of him not spending enough time in the district, not answering questions from constituents he disagrees with and being too cozy with Russia. (A few signs declaring \u201cNyet Rohrabacher\u201d were scattered through the district.)\u201cDana has been in office way too long and done absolutely nothing for the district,\u201d said Derek Demun, a college student who voted for Republican challenger Scott Baugh. \u201cHe didn\u2019t support tax cuts, which was the most obvious thing to do. This is not an inexpensive place to live and every dollar in back in my parents\u2019 pocket makes a difference.\u201dDerek\u2019s mother, Gidget, said she had voted for Mr. Rohrabacher in every other election, but could not bring herself to do so Tuesday.\u201cHe\u2019s out of touch, and he needs to go,\u201d she said. But, she quickly added, if Mr. Baugh did not make the November ballot, she would support Mr. Rohrabacher in the fall. \u201cNo question.\u201dEric Bauman, chairman of the California Democratic Party, joined a small crowd gathered in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Dave Min at PeopleSpace in Irvine Tuesday afternoon.The California\u2019s Democratic Party endorsed Mr. Min for for the 45th District Congressional seat held by Mimi Walters, a Republican. Democrats are optimistic about their chances because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory in Orange County in the 2016 presidential election.\u201cHow do we take districts in Orange County, which have traditionally been Republican?\u201d Mr. Bauman asked the crowd.\u201cAbout 20 years ago, they said, \u2018When you come behind the Orange Curtain, come quietly,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNot anymore. Today we can come out here and be proud and blue.\u201dThis year has broken records for the number of women running for office. Like many of them, Katie Hill is a first-time candidate. She is one of three female Democratic candidates running in the 25th Congressional District.Vice News is filming a documentary about her campaign \u2014 a camera crew was present on Tuesday \u2014 making it feel a bit like the subject of a reality television show.In a brief interview, she said she felt \u201creally good about today.\u201d Up next on her agenda was writing her primary night speech. Was she writing two drafts, one for either possible outcome?\u201cI\u2019m probably going to write one version,\u201d she said \u201cwith a twist.\u201dBut she voted for Bryan Caforio, another Democrat, instead.\u201cI knew that she didn\u2019t have a lot of backing or support,\u201d Ms. Gelberg said, and she wanted a Democrat she thought had a better chance of beating the Republican incumbent, Steve Knight.Others took a different tack.\u201cIf it was a tie between a man and a woman, I would vote for a woman,\u201d said Suzanne Breaw, 53, a self-described \u201cliberal Republican\u201d from Valencia.\u201cWe need to try new things,\u201d said Diane Gregson, 62, of Lancaster. \u201cThe old boys\u2019 school just doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d Ms. Gregson said she planned to vote for Ms. Hill.Mike Levin, a Democratic candidate in the 49th Congressional District, chose to run, he said, in part because he heard so few politicians talking about the environment in 2016.\u201cWhy do you blindly support Donald Trump\u2019s agenda to gut the E.P.A., to gut basic science?\u201d he asked Mr. Issa at the time, as activists cheered him on. The dynamics of the race changed after Mr. Issa announced he would not seek re-election; now Mr. Levin, facing other Democrats, hopes to consolidate support to make it onto the general election ballot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Pacific Nation Shrugs Off Worries on China\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTO ISLAND, Vanuatu \u2014 Australian officials have become increasingly concerned about China\u2019s influence in the small island countries of the South Pacific, especially around infrastructure like a gleaming new wharf in Vanuatu that was built by a Chinese construction company and financed by the Chinese government.But in a sign of the growing divide over China\u2019s role, Vanuatu\u2019s leaders are pushing back \u2014 sharing for the first time the contract this country signed with China for the wharf, and arguing they are perfectly capable of paying back the loans and making decisions on their own about when to work with China.\u201cThe loan was considered economically viable for such infrastructure as the main gateway for international trade between the northern part of the country and the rest of the world,\u201d said Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu of Vanuatu.His decision to share the contract was just the latest example of how Vanuatu, a nation of roughly 80 islands and 270,000 people, is trying to alleviate the concerns of Australia, New Zealand and the United States about whether China sees the archipelago as a vulnerable mark, and a potential military outpost.The wharf was built by the Shanghai Construction Group Co. Ltd. and opened last August. In recent weeks it has become a source of concern in Australia, where defense officials worry that Vanuatu and China have discussed a possible Chinese military base, which could make the wharf available for military and commercial use.Australian officials and experts have also questioned the terms of the financing deal, suggesting that in the case of default, China could seize the wharf directly through a \u201cdebt equity swap\u201d like what was used to take over Sri Lanka\u2019s main port when that nation fell behind on Chinese loans.But Mr. Regenvanu, sharing a copy of the contract signed in 2014, confirmed it did not include a debt equity swap clause. He said Vanuatu sees the wharf as valuable and necessary for hosting the fast-growing cruise ship and agricultural exports industries.In the wake of Australian news reports about a potential Chinese military facility, Prime Minister Charlot Salwai of Vanuatu personally assured Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia that Vanuatu was not in discussions with China about a base.Vanuatu, Mr. Regenvanu said, prefers neutrality. The country is a longtime member of the Nonaligned Movement \u2014 a group of countries not formally aligned with any superpower \u2014 and he cited that membership as a reason Vanuatu would never allow a Chinese military installation.Vanuatu, however, was the first Pacific nation to support China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea and its ties to China have been increasing. For several years now, China has been on a construction spree in Vanuatu, erecting government buildings, stadiums, convention centers, roads and extensions to Port Vila\u2019s runway to allow for larger planes.Direct weekly flights from Beijing and Shanghai are expected to start at the end of the year.The wharf on Santo Island has long been strategic. First built by Seabees during World War II, Vanuatu (then called the New Hebrides) was the second-largest American military base in the Pacific after Hawaii. More than half a million troops passed through the port on their way to fighting crucial battles at Guadalcanal in the neighboring Solomon Islands.Despite the government of Vanuatu\u2019s assurances, experts said the terms in the contract between Vanuatu and China\u2019s EXIM Bank, with Shanghai Construction Group Co. Ltd. as supplier or builder, are heavily weighted in China\u2019s favor in the event of a default.The terms are more restrictive than the loan provided by Japan for a similar wharf.Japan\u2019s loan provides a 10-year grace period, a loan with interest of .55 percent and a repayment schedule of 40 years.The Chinese EXIM Bank loan has a five-year grace period, interest of 2.5 percent and a 15-year repayment schedule.In the case of nonpayment, China can also call in the entire debt at once.

Past Republican politicians exploited the gulf between Hollywood and Middle America in order to pursue specific policy agendas, or fought with celebrities over specific issues \u2014 Vietnam with Jane Fonda, out-of-wedlock births with \u201cMurphy Brown.\u201d But for Trump, fighting with late-night hosts and pro athletes is an end unto itself; people in his administration have substantive goals, but to the president ratings and faves and cancellations and boycotts are the real way that you keep score.But it\u2019s too simple to blame Trump when so many of his supporters clearly love this style. Having lost so many cultural battles, the right has developed a desperate attraction to celebrity ephemera, confusing an epiphenomenon of progressivism\u2019s cultural advantage \u2014 the fact that most famous artists and actors are left-wing \u2014 with the institutional advantage itself.So conservatives stupidly place hopes in a right-wing Kanye or a Trump-friendly Roseanne Barr. They convince themselves that celebrity provocateurs will make America\u2019s campuses more conservative. They make a cynical, race-baiting, adulterous campaign-finance fraudster like Dinesh D\u2019Souza a rich man after he abandons an intellectual career for a Michael Moore-imitating grift \u2014 and then cheer when Trump pardons D\u2019Souza because it owns the libs.All of this reflects a deep confusion about how liberal cultural power actually works. It\u2019s the steady circulation of ideas and money and people through cultural institutions that really matter, not the famous faces popping off on Oscar telecasts.But the same confusion is on display among liberal culture makers themselves, who have reacted to Trump\u2019s defeat by leaning into their most self-defeating instincts. Cultural liberalism wins battles when its omnipresence just seems like the natural air we breathe. But direct political hectoring plays against that strength; instead of the subtle nudge of a sitcom\u2019s implicit values it\u2019s just a rich and famous person yelling at you, in a way designed to maximize ratings among progressives looking for catharsis.Which, for ratings purposes, is fine. (Although the economics work less well when you start insisting that lousy-but-woke movies are actually good because online right-wingers hate them \u2026 sorry, I digress.) But all the entertainers \u201cowning\u201d Trump are playing the same game that carried him to power, and that might keep him there despite all the reasons he deserves to fall.Interestingly the only celebrity in this week\u2019s \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d verse who wasn\u2019t obviously playing into this dynamic was La Kardashian herself. Her trip to the White House to pitch Trump on sentencing reform was widely mocked, but as stunts go it had a plausible logic. If you want this president to do something for the common good, why not try to convince him that it might help him notch a win on his celebrity scorecard? Quid pro quo: He gets to break the internet with a photo-op, you get his signature on a pardon or a piece of convict-friendly legislation.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.In precise and damning detail, the suit catalogs Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated violation of both state and federal laws by tapping the foundation\u2019s funds for his own personal purposes, including paying out legal settlements, making political contributions and purchasing a portrait of himself to hang in one of his golf clubs.The Trump Foundation is \u201can empty shell,\u201d the suit says, with no employees and no oversight by its board of directors, which has not met for nearly 20 years. This has allowed Mr. Trump to run it \u201caccording to his whim, rather than the law.\u201dA couple of examples: In 2013, the foundation gave $25,000 to \u201cAnd Justice for All,\u201d a political organization supporting the re-election of Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi. But on its federal tax form, the foundation claimed that it did not contribute money to any political campaign, and that it had donated $25,000 to a Kansas-based nonprofit, Justice for All, even though it had not. The foundation later attributed the false report to an accounting error.Days before the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Mr. Trump held a fund-raiser on behalf of military veterans, raising about $5.6 million, half of which went directly to his foundation. The money was then managed not by philanthropists but by top Trump campaign staff members, who handed it out to veterans\u2019 organizations across Iowa just before the caucus \u2014 converting the donations into illegal campaign contributions.\u201cThis is not how private foundations should function,\u201d said Ms. Underwood in her statement about the suit.

{"Headline": "What Led to the Ouster of Spain\u2019s Prime Minister?", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe vote was led by the Socialists, the main opposition party, but ultimately the cause of his downfall was a long-running corruption scandal that had tainted his right-wing Popular Party.He is now the first prime minister in modern Spanish history to be unseated by a no-confidence motion. How did it all unfold?Spain\u2019s Popular Party held power from 1996 to 2004, and again from 2011 onward. But a complex corruption scandal has long plagued the public perception of the party.In 2009, a judge started an investigation into possible kickbacks received by conservative politicians in return for public contracts. Francisco Correa, a businessman with close ties to the Popular Party, was identified as the ringleader of the scheme, so the inquiry was code-named G\u00fcrtel, the German translation of Correa (which means belt in English).The investigation turned into several separate court cases, involving fraudulent contracts and more than $170 million of public funds misspent by politicians in return for kickbacks.The Popular Party was then accused of using a slush fund in the 1990s and early 2000s to illegally finance campaigns after its former treasurer, Luis B\u00e1rcenas, was found in 2013 to have hidden millions in secret Swiss bank accounts.Last year, Mr. Rajoy gave evidence in the case, becoming the first Spanish prime minister to testify in court. But he was not accused of wrongdoing and has denied any involvement.Just last week, 29 people with links to the Popular Party were convicted by Spain\u2019s National Court on a number of charges related to fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.Among them were the party\u2019s former treasurer, Mr. B\u00e1rcenas, who was sentenced to 33 years in prison and fined about $51.3 million. Mr. Correa received a 51-year sentence.Judges also ordered Mr. Rajoy\u2019s party to pay a fine of more than $285,000 for operating the slush fund.And the court questioned the credibility of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s court testimony.In elections in 2015 and 2016, no party received a majority of the vote. Mr. Rajoy was left heading a minority government \u2014 with the support of the Ciudadanos Party \u2014 and in a precarious position.Last year, he survived a motion of no confidence led by Podemos, a far-left party. He also came under pressure because of his failure to resolve a territorial conflict in Catalonia.A week ago, after the corruption convictions, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, a Socialist and the main opposition leader, filed a motion for Parliament to vote on the government, citing the scandal.Once he negotiated the support of several smaller parties, including Basque and Catalan nationalist groups, he had momentum for the no-confidence vote. In the end, 180 members of Parliament backed the motion, 169 voted against it and one abstained.Many members of Parliament have called for new general elections immediately, but Mr. S\u00e1nchez will take the helm as the new prime minister as soon as this weekend without any firm commitment to hold another national vote soon.His tenure could still be short. His Socialist party holds only 84 of 350 seats in Parliament, and he must maintain the alliances struck with other parties that allowed him to replace Mr. Rajoy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California, of All Places, Has Banned Soda Taxes. How a New Industry Strategy Is Succeeding.", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bill to pre-empt taxes is part of a wider industry effort to skip cities and go straight to the states.For years, the soda industry had an ironclad strategy when a city wanted to enact a soda tax: Spend a lot of money, rally local businesses, and shoot it down.Now the beverage industry has a new approach. Instead of fighting the ordinances city by city, it is turning to states, trying to pass laws preventing any local governments from taxing their products.The beverage industry says the statewide measures are an appropriate way to protect local businesses and consumers from higher taxes. \u201cPeople across the country are taxed enough, and they can\u2019t afford new taxes on what they eat and drink,\u201d said William Dermody, the vice president for media and public affairs at the American Beverage Association, an industry trade group. Bill Monning, the Senate majority leader, was one of a handful of Democrats who voted against the bill. He called its passage \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said it would stop cities and counties \u201cfrom being able to take steps to protect the health of their residents.\u201d But he also said that state lawmakers would redouble their efforts to curb consumption of sugary drinks. He pointed out that the Senate health committee had just voted in favor of a bill that would require warning labels on sugary drinks indicating that they contribute to various health problems.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for democracy in California,\u201d he said. \u201cBut ever the optimist I think that the outrage of Big Soda blackmailing the state legislature and the people of California is going to boomerang.\u201dAccording to several state senators, the industry then went to lawmakers in Sacramento with a proposal: Pass a bill banning soda and food taxes, and the industry would drop its November ballot initiative.Nancy Skinner, a state senator who represents Richmond, Calif., as well as three cities that passed soda taxes in 2016, voted against the measure but said she recognized that her colleagues who supported it were in a bind. The law will not overturn soda taxes enacted before 2018, but it will prevent any new ones, including a soda tax on the ballot later this year in Richmond. \u201cIt is totally wrong to deny the residents of Richmond a vote,\u201d she said. The beverage association, which supported the California legislation, said its turn to pre-emption simply reflected its view that taxes on drinks represented an unfair burden \u2014 not just on them, but on retailers, bottlers, shipping companies and consumers.Mr. Dermody noted that, in several states, the pre-emption bills are backed by a coalition of business interests, including grocery stores, and, in some cases, labor unions.The experience of the places that adopted soda taxes has been mixed. Research in Berkeley, Philadelphia and Mexico, which has a similar tax, shows that the measures appear to increase beverage prices and reduce sugary drink sales. \u201cThe irony is that the soda companies screamed very loudly about government overreach when soda taxes began to get passed,\u201d said Kelly Brownell, the dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University. \u201cBut now they are looking for the ultimate government overreach when it works in their favor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain Abetted U.S. Torture of Terrorism Suspects, Parliament Finds", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s intelligence services tolerated and abetted \u201cinexcusable\u201d abuse of terrorism suspects by their American counterparts, according to a report released by Parliament on Thursday that offers a wide-ranging official condemnation of British intelligence conduct in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.The committee documented dozens of cases in which Britain participated in sending suspects to other countries that were known to use torture or aided others in doing so \u2014 a practice known as rendition. But it said that in four years of investigation, reviewing some 40,000 documents, it found only two instances of British agents directly taking part in abuse.But the release of the report also exposed a serious rift between Mrs. May and the committee, led by Dominic Grieve, a lawmaker from her Conservative Party who is also a former attorney general.The committee said that the prime minister had prohibited it from conducting most of the interviews it had requested with current and former intelligence agents, raising objections about security and about exposing agents to possible legal action. As a result, the committee said, its work was incomplete.\u201cWe were adamant that we must hear from officers who were involved at the time,\u201d the committee wrote, \u201cas this was essential if the inquiry was to be thorough and comprehensive and be in a position to reach properly considered, balanced and fair views about the facts.\u201dRights groups seized on that point, demanding a further, fully independent investigation led by a judge. Kate Allen, Amnesty International\u2019s director in Britain, said the committee \u201cwas prevented by the government from producing a thorough report about what really happened.\u201d\u201cWhile the committee\u2019s report represents a helpful step forwards, it is not the definitive account of what really happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was always the wrong tool for the job.\u201dMrs. May prevented the panel from questioning agents who were low-ranking at the time \u2014 in other words, most of those working in the field \u2014 and from asking any officials about specifics of the operations they worked on, the committee said. It added that it had asked her to reconsider her orders in early 2017, but that, more than a year later, \u201cno response has been received.\u201dIn her statement, the prime minister did not directly address that criticism, but said the government would \u201cgive further consideration\u201d to the committee\u2019s findings, \u201cin the spirit of continuous improvement.\u201dThe committee wrote that it did not find evidence that British intelligence services willfully overlooked American abuses as a matter of policy. Rather, it concluded, the British \u201cwere the junior partner with limited access or influence, and distinctly uncomfortable at the prospect of complaining to their host.\u201dThe abuses occurred primarily from 2002 to 2004, the report says, after which guidelines for British conduct were strengthened, though not always followed.Although British policy prohibited rendition, the committee found, British agents repeatedly aided other countries in sending suspects to places where there was a high probability they would be mistreated. In three cases, it reported, the British paid, or offered to pay, for renditions; in 28, they \u201csuggested, planned or agreed to rendition operations\u201d conducted by others; and in 22, they provided intelligence to enable a rendition to take place. Finally, in 23 cases, they knew of a rendition operation \u2014 in some of those cases involving British citizens or residents \u2014 and did nothing to stop it.The committee took particular issue with the financing, which it called \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d accusing the intelligence agencies of \u201coutsourcing of action they knew they were not allowed to undertake themselves.\u201dBritish officers supplied questions or information for interrogations being carried out by allied services in 232 cases when they knew or suspected that detainees were being mistreated, the committee said. It found 198 cases in which the British received intelligence from such interrogations.Foreign agents told British officers of 128 instances of detainee abuse; in 25 cases, detainees told British agents that they had been abused, and in 13, the agents witnessed the abuse themselves. In two cases, the report said, evidence indicated that British officers had themselves mistreated suspects.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Endgame, of Sorts, Is Looming for the U.K. in the Brexit Debate", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Each week Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain seems to face a new crisis over the country\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, only to escape, her authority diminished but her determination to carry on apparently undimmed.But finally an endgame of sorts is looming in the debate over what is known as Brexit as lawmakers prepare for important votes, starting Tuesday, and Mrs. May faces mounting pressure ahead of a meeting of European Union leaders at the end of the month.Mrs. May will try to overturn 14 of 15 amendments added by the House of Lords to her main Brexit bill, which transfers the entirety of European Union law to British law. It would take only a small number of Conservative Party lawmakers to rebel, if combined with opposition votes, to defeat the government.Among the more important issues is whether to give more control to Parliament in the withdrawal process, preventing Mrs. May from presenting lawmakers with a take-it-or-leave-it choice between the Brexit plan she supports and no deal at all.Another item, on membership in a European customs union, is so weakly worded that it would not actually require the government to sign up to one (though, if approved, it would be a significant defeat for Mrs. May). Lawmakers have been promised a vote in July on another, more definitive, customs union amendment in separate legislation, and pro-European Conservatives might wait for that opportunity.Meanwhile, the issue that most threatens Mrs. May\u2019s government, the status of the Irish border, remains highly divisive and in urgent need of settling.\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous series of tests,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIt\u2019s a test of her authority in front of Parliament, it\u2019s a test of cabinet unity and it\u2019s a test of her ability to be all things to all men.\u201dFor months Mrs. May has been adjudicating between warring factions in a cabinet bitterly divided between those who want to keep close ties to the European Union to protect the British economy, and hard-line Brexit supporters who want to break free.Rumors of a plot to topple Mrs. May have swirled within her Conservative Party since last year when she called a general election and lost her parliamentary majority, and they have not gone away. She has survived, as Professor Menon put it, because, \u201cher strength is not her popularity; it is the lack of an alternative candidate who can unite her party.\u201dA promised white paper on Britain\u2019s overall negotiating objectives is now not expected before July, and not before a special meeting of senior ministers at Mrs. May\u2019s country residence.Mrs. May favors a \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d under which Britain would collect tariffs for the European Union on many goods but would be able to strike some separate trade agreements.Brexit supporters prefer another scheme called \u201cmax fac\u201d \u2014 short for maximum facilitation \u2014 that accepts the need for customs controls but uses technology to keep checks light. But that is entirely unacceptable to the European Union (as is Mrs. May\u2019s plan, though to a lesser extent).But the immediate question is what to do until one of the plans can be made to work, and how to keep open the border between Ireland, which is in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.If she can get agreement on Ireland, Mrs. May can postpone the troublesome detail of future trade talks until after March next year, when a transition period is to begin. By then, she hopes, the political climate may have cooled.The Irish border question is urgent because Brussels has made solving it a precondition of discussing a deal on future trade, and an accord on Ireland will require great political agility.Mrs. May has promised that there will be no hard border (which might stoke sectarian tensions), but she has also insisted that Northern Ireland will have the same economic rules as the rest of the United Kingdom. She relies on the support of 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland, so she has little room for maneuver.Mrs. May\u2019s idea is to keep the whole of the United Kingdom in a type of European customs union for goods until the technology is ready to eliminate the need for most frontier checks.When the hard-line Brexiteers got wind of that, they erupted. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, threatened resignation, until he won a pledge that the British government \u201cexpects\u201d that situation to end no later than December 2021.The British plan runs afoul of the European Union, whose chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, rejected the scheme last week, suggesting that it amounted to cherry-picking. British officials hope, however, that the bloc\u2019s leaders might be more sympathetic, particularly if Britain offers financial contributions.Whether the plan \u2014 even as a temporary backstop \u2014 can convince Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives remains unclear. However, her one advantage is that Brexit has caused such rancor in British politics that it has even divided its supporters.Some, like Mr. Davis, want more detail about future ties to the bloc as soon as possible, fearing that if Britain quits without firm pledges from Brussels, it will surrender all of its leverage, including a hefty $53 billion exit fee it has promised.It could then find itself obeying a set of trade rules over which it has no say at all.But others want Brexit to happen so much that they will put up with almost any compromise to secure formal exit from the European Union in March, confident that Britain will never rejoin the club they hate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "M.T.A. Plan to Upgrade Subways Is Ambitious. But Is It Even Possible?", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a plan to save New York City\u2019s subway was announced last month, most of the attention was focused on its eye-popping price tag and whether Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would support it.But perhaps the biggest question is whether subway officials can actually pull off the plan.The subway\u2019s new leader, Andy Byford, has promised to upgrade the system\u2019s dilapidated signals at a much faster pace \u2014 five lines in five years. It is an ambitious timeline considering that it took New York nearly a decade to upgrade the only line that has been modernized.Mr. Byford, a cheerful Brit who won accolades for revitalizing Toronto\u2019s transit system, seems to relish the challenge.\u201cThere are people who say it can\u2019t be done,\u201d Mr. Byford said during a recent speech to promote the plan. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see about that.\u201dEven if Mr. Byford can secure financing for his plan \u2014 no easy feat in a notoriously dysfunctional State Capitol \u2014 it will be a herculean task to deliver such a massive overhaul of the subway.\u201cAny plan worth its salt has to be based upon specific, defined projects with a timetable, a budget and the benefits,\u201d Mr. Gunn said.Signal experts, meanwhile, were surprised by the aggressive modernization schedule.\u201cThe challenge is not doing it in five years \u2014 the challenge is can you do five lines in parallel in five years?\u201d said Alan Rumsey, a consultant who has worked on signal upgrades in New York and Toronto.Mr. Byford said he could upgrade most of the signal system in the next ten years, which would improve reliability and allow more trains to run closer together. Transit advocates quickly praised Mr. Byford as the right person to shake up a transit agency that is resistant to change.Mr. Byford has offered an overview about how he would accelerate the signal work. Instead of upgrading one line at a time, he proposed tackling several lines at the same time, including the heavily traveled Lexington Avenue line. He warned that construction work would be disruptive in a way that New Yorkers had never seen before.On a line that is being converted, stations would be closed during most nights and weekends for two and a half years, Mr. Byford said in an interview. Exceptions could be made for major events like the Fourth of July.\u201cWe\u2019d be sensible about it,\u201d Mr. Byford said. \u201cBut this does require New Yorkers\u2019 patience.\u201dMr. Byford said he wants to use simple, \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products that could be installed quickly, instead of being custom-made, following the example of other cities like Shanghai. In New York, only two companies \u2014 Thales and Siemens \u2014 are allowed to install the new signal system, which is known as communications-based train control. Mr. Byford wants to open the market to more competition.\u201cI\u2019d like to make it easier for suppliers to qualify,\u201d Mr. Byford said, adding that he could think of at least four other companies that could do the work.Most of the signal work would not begin until 2020 under the authority\u2019s next five-year capital plan, but Mr. Byford said he was anxious to start soon on upgrading subway cars to be compatible with the new signal system and on design work for the projects.Mr. Byford said he was inspired by London\u2019s subway, which is even older than New York\u2019s, but whose leaders have modernized it more quickly. Mark Wild, the managing director of the London Underground, said the city had made a \u201csteady and sustained investment\u201d in its network.\u201cA series of digital upgrades to the signaling on three of our busiest lines \u2014 the Jubilee, Northern and Victoria \u2014 means a train every 100 seconds or so at the busiest times of day,\u201d Mr. Wild said in a statement.The \u201celephant in the room,\u201d Mr. Byford said, is the enormous cost of the work. Charles Komanoff, a transportation expert, said congestion pricing could pay for the subway plan, depending on how the vehicle fees were structured. A proposal by a task force assembled by Mr. Cuomo, called \u201cFix NYC,\u201d could allow the authority to bond between $12 billion and $25 billion, he said.Mr. Komanoff said he was pleased by Mr. Cuomo\u2019s recent comments in support of congestion pricing, though he was disappointed that Mr. Cuomo had not pressed harder for the \u201cFix NYC\u201d proposal during the recent legislative session.\u201cWe are incredibly wary because we have been left at the altar by Governor Cuomo before,\u201d Mr. Komanoff said.Subway officials decided not to reveal their cost estimates when announcing the subway plan. But in a briefing with transit board members, officials said it could cost $19 billion for the first five years and an additional $18 billion during the second five years.Mr. Byford said he hoped to release a cost estimate for the plan this summer, with guidance from the authority\u2019s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, on the appropriate timing.\u201cThe sooner we get the figure out,\u201d Mr. Byford said, \u201cthe sooner we can start lobbying for it and justifying it and saying why we need it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Inside, a Calm Sea of Conservative Cash.", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 To anyone with even a cursory relationship to television or social media, a charged and emotional battle over the Trump administration\u2019s approach to immigration seems to have seeped into every dimension of American life.Just not quite the dimension containing the Trump International Hotel.President Trump zipped around the capital all day Tuesday, motorcade sirens blaring, as he forcefully defended a policy that includes separating families at the border. \u201cThese are laws that have been broken for many years,\u201d he said as he departed Capitol Hill.At the hotel, he spoke for an hour to 150 supporters \u2014 about half of whom were donors who paid $100,000 to $250,000 to attend a two-day summit meeting organized by America First Action, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d formed to support Mr. Trump and allied candidates.But inside, all was well.\u201cDoes anybody here look stressed out?\u201d the conservative commentator Candace Owens asked as she surveyed the lobby.Attendees shook hands and greeted each other as fellow \u201cgreat American patriots.\u201d Others posted photographs to social media, with hashtags like #BlackLivesMAGA.Upstairs, in a restaurant, a boy blew out the candles on his birthday cake, pausing to bite the head off a miniature President Trump made of frosting. TVs at the bar tuned to Fox News analysts who rehashed the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general report.The event was part of a heightened fund-raising push by America First Action.That group and an affiliated nonprofit, America First Policies, want to raise $100 million to advance Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda and help congressional candidates allied with him before a midterm election season expected to be difficult for Republicans.Sensitive to campaign finance rules barring federal officials from soliciting donations greater than $5,400, the White House has been careful to call these events gatherings with supporters, not fund-raisers, although they have a similar effect. The event this week felt like a conference, with several panels geared toward foreign policy, \u201cAmerica First\u201d messaging and a healthy disdain for the news media.\u201cYou guys are genuinely out of touch,\u201d said Ms. Owens, who also serves as a communications director for the conservative group Turning Point USA, after speaking on the media panel.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m talking to someone who actually thinks everyone else is an idiot,\u201d she said to this reporter.Panelists, including Ms. Owens, did not pay to attend.Beyond media criticism, what lessons could donors expect to glean?\u201cYou want it to be intimate,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cNot a cattle call.\u201dAnd besides, Mr. Spicer reasoned: They paid a \u201cton of money,\u201d he said, using a phrase that contained an expletive.Donors in attendance included the Oklahoma oilman Harold Hamm; the investor and former ambassador Ronald N. Weiser of Michigan; and the investors Roy W. Bailey and Tom Hicks Jr. of Texas.Mr. Hamm has donated $1 million to America First Action through personal and corporate accounts. Mr. Weiser, who has donated $200,000, said he suspected the event raised \u201ca lot\u201d of money.Yechezkel Moskowitz, 31, who attended on behalf of his grandmother, a donor, said that he felt as if he had gained a better understanding of the policies he should be supporting, including the administration\u2019s approach to rolling back environmental regulations and its hard-line stance on immigration.\u201cWe have to give the impression that our laws matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI think conservatism is the new counterculture.\u201dIn recent weeks, fund-raisers for the groups began aggressively courting donors ahead of the summit meeting. Donors were told that, in addition to Mr. Trump, speakers would include the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, and a host of Republican lawmakers, including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Steve Daines of Montana, as well as Representatives Kevin Brady of Texas, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Greg Walden of Oregon.Mr. Brady spoke Tuesday on a panel about \u201cthe great things already happening in the economy as a direct result\u201d of the tax overhaul passed last year, said his spokeswoman, Allyson Manley.\u201cPart of it is,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, \u201cyou buy into the philosophy.\u201dBill White, a donor based in New York City also at the event, said that during his speech to the group, Mr. Trump had focused on drumming up support for his immigration policy and approach to foreign relations \u2014 at one point, he again complained about being slighted by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \u2014 among other issues.\u201cI\u2019m confident that Donald Trump is going to solve that problem\u201d of immigration, Mr. White said, \u201cwith the help of the American people. He hates the fact that children are being taken away from their loved ones.\u201dMr. White said that he and his husband have been so persuaded by the president\u2019s policies that they have pledged $100,000 to America First and are organizing a fund-raiser this year.America First Action has made hefty payments to consultants with close ties to Mr. Trump, including $184,000 to the firm owned by Brad Parscale, who will have to distance himself from the group because he was tapped to run Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. America First Action also paid $75,000 to the firm of Mr. Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and $60,000 to the company of Katrina Pierson, a former campaign spokeswoman, according to Federal Election Commission filings.America First Action also paid more than $69,000 to a firm owned by David A. Clarke Jr., the former sheriff of Milwaukee County. On Tuesday, he roamed the hotel lobby, dressed in a white cowboy hat.The filings also show that the group has spent more than $160,000 at Trump Organization properties, the vast majority of which \u2014 $154,000 \u2014 went to the Trump International Hotel for facility rentals and catering. Nearly $2,000 was spent at the hotel\u2019s steakhouse, BLT Prime by David Burke, with another $864 going to the hotel\u2019s bar, Benjamin Bar and Lounge.Mr. White said he was comfortable with a large amount of money going toward the president\u2019s hotel. He called it one of the greatest hotel properties in the world.Advertisement"}

Conservative positions will continue to win a lot of 5-4 decisions, as they did in the court term that ended this week.But Kennedy was moderate to liberal on other issues, including several that particularly affect the rights of women and minorities. On these issues, his departure could quickly lead to big changes in American life.In the simplest terms, the Supreme Court is likely to begin siding more often with those who already have power \u2014 and against those who don\u2019t have much. After decades of rising economic inequality and consolidation, it is a profoundly worrisome development.You\u2019ve probably already read a lot of discussion of Kennedy\u2019s retirement. So I want to use today\u2019s newsletter to cut through the noise and attempt to provide clarity on a few major questions: Can the Democrats prevent Kennedy\u2019s replacement from being seated before the midterm election? Almost certainly not.Democratic senators were right to call on the Republicans to wait to confirm a justice until after this year\u2019s elections, given the Republicans\u2019 unprecedented refusal to let President Barack Obama fill a court opening in 2016. But Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has already made clear that he will ignore the Democrats. And a majority of senators can do just about anything it wants in the chamber. The Republicans currently have 51 of the 100 seats, as well as a tiebreaking vote, when needed, from the vice president.Which issues are most likely to be affected in the near future?All signs suggest that President Trump will choose a nominee significantly more conservative than Kennedy. In that case, the new justice could provide the deciding vote in rulings that:What can you do if you\u2019re alarmed about all of this?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico, Hitting Back, Imposes Tariffs on $3 Billion Worth of U.S. Goods", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mexico hit back at the United States on Tuesday, imposing tariffs on around $3 billion worth of American pork, steel, cheese and other goods in response to the Trump administration\u2019s steel and aluminum levies, further straining relations between the two countries as they struggle to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement.The tariffs, which were announced last week, came into effect as the Trump administration threw yet another complication into the fractious Nafta talks. Officials are now saying they want to splinter discussions with Canada and Mexico and work on separate agreements rather than continue three-country discussions to rewrite the 1994 trade deal.Larry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpreference now, and he asked me to convey this, is to actually negotiate with Mexico and Canada separately.\u201dMr. Kudlow, speaking on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d said pursuing separate deals might allow an agreement to be reached \u201cmore rapidly,\u201d adding: \u201cI think that\u2019s the key point. You know, Nafta has kind of dragged on.\u201dThe Trump administration hit Mexico and Canada with 25 percent steel tariffs and 10 percent aluminum tariffs on June 1 as part of a campaign to pressure the countries to agree to America\u2019s demands on a revised Nafta. The United States also imposed metals tariffs on the European Union, Japan and other countries as part of an effort to stop the flow of imported metals, which the administration has said threatens national security by degrading the American industrial base.The trade approach has only inflamed allies, including Canada and Mexico, which have threatened to strike back with their own targeted tariffs aimed at Republican states and areas that supported Mr. Trump.Mexico\u2019s list was designed to hit at parts of the United States represented by high-profile Republicans, Mexican officials have said, including steel from Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s home state of Indiana, motorboats from Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s Florida, and agricultural products from the California district of Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader.Farmers, who are among those most vulnerable to the Mexican tariffs, said the tariffs would devastate American agriculture.\u201cThese tariffs will exact immediate and painful consequences on many American farmers,\u201d Angela Hofmann, deputy director of Farmers for Free Trade, said in a statement. \u201cHog, apple, potato and dairy farmers are among those suddenly facing a 10 or 20 percent tax hike on the exports they depend of for their livelihoods. Farmers need certainty and open markets to make ends meet. Right now they are getting chaos and protectionism.\u201dIt is unclear which country will blink first, leaving the future of the trade deal, and the millions of jobs across the continent that are linked to it, so uncertain that many companies are withholding investments they might make to take advantage of the pact.Mr. Kudlow insisted that the president was not planning to withdraw from Nafta \u2014 which he has frequently threatened to do. However, splitting the current trilateral deal into two separate bilateral agreements would likely require nullifying the 25-year-old agreement.On Friday, Mr. Trump said he would be interested in pursuing separate deals. \u201cThese are two very different countries,\u201d he said.\u201cI like free trade, but I want fair trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThey cannot believe they\u2019ve gotten away with this for so many decades.\u201dPeople familiar with the deliberations say the idea of separate talks is aimed at pressuring Canada, which American negotiators see as obstructionist and an impediment to the progress of the Nafta negotiations. The preference for bilateral negotiations has also emerged as one of the sole areas of agreement among Mr. Trump\u2019s warring trade advisers, who agree on little else but the ability to extract bigger concessions through one-on-one talks. Bilateral deals are also a longtime focus of the president.American officials say that splitting the negotiations could help the United States take advantage of what could be a short and crucial window to negotiate with the current government of Mexico, which could be ousted in national elections in July, and replaced by a government that is less inclined to cut a deal with the Trump administration.However, both Mexico and Canada insist that the idea is a non-starter.Mexican negotiators say they would not be willing to consider splitting the negotiations, a move they view as potentially damaging to North American supply chains and an unnecessary complication of a pact that many businesses rely on, according to people familiar with their thinking.They add that they do not view Canada as their biggest problem in the talks. The three countries have remained at an impasse over significant provisions, including manufacturing rules for autos and an American proposal for a five-year sunset clause that would cause the deal to automatically expire unless the countries voted to renew it.The clock has essentially run out for the administration to secure a Nafta deal this year. The Trump administration had been trying to conclude Nafta talks by the end of May in order to submit the deal for a vote in the current Republican-controlled Congress.Given the statutory deadlines the administration must meet to get a trade deal approved, it now appears likely that any vote would drag into next year, after midterm elections that could shift the political makeup of Congress.Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy in the negotiations with Canada and Mexico has drawn criticism from the business community as well as Democrats and Republicans.A spokeswoman for Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday that Mr. Brady opposed splitting the negotiations in two.\u201cA Nafta without both Canada and Mexico included is no longer a North American Free Trade Agreement,\u201d the spokeswoman, Julia Slingsby, said. \u201cChairman Brady believes one free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico is best for America. It provides the most certainty for American companies and is the best way we can sell \u2018Made in America\u2019 products.\u201dAnd a survey of chief executive officers released Tuesday morning by Business Roundtable showed that while executives have a positive view of the economy, they see the administration\u2019s trade policy and the prospect of retaliation from other countries as an escalating risk to their businesses.Joshua Bolten, the president of Business Roundtable, said that uncertainties about trade policy were \u201ca growing weight on economic progress \u2014 especially amid escalating trade tensions. America\u2019s current and future economic vitality depends on productive talks with China and a successful modernization of Nafta.\u201dPrivately, some congressional Republicans expressed an openness to the administration negotiating some trade issues bilaterally with Mexico and with China. But they expressed little support for scrapping Nafta entirely and replacing it with separate deals.Advertisement"}

I didn\u2019t know he stood for all those horrible things.

Before that, he gained some local attention for his efforts to keep the city\u2019s Confederate monuments in place and to oust Wes Bellamy, the only black person on the Charlottesville City Council, who had posted sexist, homophobic and anti-white tweets from 2009 to 2014.Asked about Mr. Kaine\u2019s statement, Mr. Stewart said: \u201cHe\u2019s trying to deflect from the fact that he\u2019s got nothing accomplished over the past six years, and he\u2019s trying to deflect from the fact that President Trump has been successful at improving the economy, bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula, opening up foreign markets to American-made goods. All that Tim Kaine has is to try to convince people that conservatives are racist \u2014 and you know what, people are smarter than that.\u201dHe denounced other Republicans for apologizing and condemning the violence, saying they were playing into liberals\u2019 hands.This year, he said that if elected to the Senate, he would pursue a similar requirement for police officers nationally, and he argued that any city that did not check the immigration status of everyone it arrested should be federally prosecuted.Shortly after the inauguration of Mr. Trump, with whom he is both ideologically and stylistically aligned, Mr. Stewart called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to work with the police in Prince William County to track down undocumented immigrants who have been arrested and released.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Woodrow Wilson Achieved a Lot. So Why Is He So Scorned?", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Historical memory has not been kind to Woodrow Wilson. No other president who accomplished so much has so few latter-day admirers. He established the Federal Reserve, signed a major antitrust law, initiated the modern income tax and led the nation to victory in World War I. Wilson was also the first Democrat to win two consecutive terms in the White House since Andrew Jackson.O\u2019Toole, who has written biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Adams, mostly avoids using Wilson\u2019s career to teach a contemporary political lesson or to judge whether his personality got in the way of his statesmanship. \u201cThe Moralist\u201d is primarily a tale about the public deeds of a public man, sprinkled with perceptive observations about his two marriages and chronic infirmities. O\u2019Toole moves briskly through the 56 years of his prepresidential life in a mere 61 pages, then gives scant attention to his domestic accomplishments. She devotes the bulk of her text to Wilson\u2019s actions during the war and its immediate aftermath.O\u2019Toole is a gifted narrator with a knack for illuminating the significance of well-known people and events. She captures what each Allied leader wanted to achieve at the Paris peace conference without losing sight of the future they were arguing about. The French prime minister Georges Clemenceau, a veteran of partisan combat who was then in his late 70s, was, she writes, \u201ca firm believer in the supremacy of military force\u201d who nevertheless cleverly advocated for the League of Nations that his American counterpart ardently desired: \u201cThe boss of the global ward meeting had merely struck a pose in order to do the very thing he claimed not to be doing: impose the will of the Great Powers on the rest of the world.\u201dHowever, O\u2019Toole deploys her literary skills in the service of a history both familiar and rather old-fashioned. There is nothing of significance in her book that the small army of Wilson biographers and scholars of the Progressive era have not been narrating and chewing over since his death in 1924. And, aside from insightful portraits of Wilson\u2019s two beloved wives, O\u2019Toole\u2019s gaze is fixed throughout on the president and other famous and powerful politicians. Absent are the opinions and deeds of the voters and political activists who compelled Wilson to grapple with the issues of corporate power and the decision to go to war that defined his presidency.In particular, she neglects the large and influential peace coalition that opposed expanding the Army to prepare for combat and then, despite state repression, mobilized against the intervention in Europe once it occurred. A mass of previously \u201cisolationist\u201d Americans did not, as O\u2019Toole implies, suddenly line up behind the president once he changed his mind about neutrality and asked Congress to take the nation into what was then the bloodiest war in history. As Wilson was well aware, the early 20th century was a period of intense social and political conflicts in every region and in all types of communities. But O\u2019Toole is concerned only with the men at the top.Neither does her narrative really support the title she chose. Wilson was indeed a man of profound convictions \u2014 about the functions of government, the responsibilities of citizens, the supremacy of white people. He was certain that he was doing the work of the Lord. Yet, as O\u2019Toole herself describes him, Wilson was also a shrewd politician, deft at shifting his views and reshaping his policies in order to gain power and be able to do important things with it. A rigorous \u201cmoralist\u201d would not have persuaded William Jennings Bryan, whose unyielding populist creed he privately ridiculed, to take the job of secretary of state and then shut him out of key diplomatic decisions. Neither does O\u2019Toole give more than cursory attention to Wilson\u2019s religious views, which always framed his sense of the ethical. The theology of a man who considered his Calvinist father \u201cthe finest of all his teachers\u201d deserves more scrutiny.At the end of her biography, O\u2019Toole makes a brief attempt to rescue Wilson from what the great British historian E. P. Thompson once called the \u201cenormous condescension of posterity.\u201d We still live, she claims, in \u201cthe Wilsonian century.\u201d Despite the recoil from international cooperation practiced by the current resident of the White House and his fellow right-wing nationalists abroad, Wilson \u201cturned out to be right about the central fact of life in a world of global markets, global finance, instant communication and the possibility of instant annihilation: Withdrawal is impossible.\u201dBut his crushing failure to get the peace treaty through the Senate a century ago suggests a less sanguine view. Most Americans soured on Wilson\u2019s world-saving mission soon after the Great War ended and have only briefly embraced updated versions of it since \u2014 during the early Cold War and after the attacks of Sept. 11. Perhaps that helps explain why Wilson ranks so low on the current roster of favored presidents. His great ideal was not just defeated; it was never all that popular to begin with.Michael Kazin\u2019s latest book is \u201cWar Against War: The American Fight for Peace, 1914-1918.\u201d He teaches history at Georgetown University and is the editor of Dissent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Russia\u2019s Car Capital, a Production Line for Players", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerTOLYATTI, Russia \u2014 They have always made things in Tolyatti.In the days of Communist rule, this city was the home of the Soviet auto industry, Russia\u2019s answer to Detroit. It rose up around the vast car factory that sits at its heart, designed specifically to feed the 200 miles of production lines with the parts, the materials and the bodies they needed to operate.The factory is still there \u2014 run by AvtoVaz, owned by Renault-Nissan \u2014 its buildings stretching for dozens of blocks, its chimneys belching smoke into the sky, the fruit of its labors glinting in the gray light of mile-wide parking lots. The plant is still the city\u2019s prime focus, but it is not what it once was.Still, though, they make things here. In the factory, they make cars, just fewer than before: Ladas and Renaults and Nissans, some of them sold at the countless dealerships that line the road to Samara, the regional capital, but most of them shipped north, to Moscow and St. Petersburg, or west to Europe, or east to China.In the quiet suburb of Primorsky, meanwhile, in a much smaller complex of buildings, there is another factory, another production line. Over the last 15 years, Tolyatti has become a city that makes soccer players.At first, when Primorsky\u2019s residents heard that a local logistics tycoon, Yury Konoplev, had bought a large plot of land, they assumed he was doing what tycoons normally do: building a lavish dacha for his family in one of the city\u2019s more upscale neighborhoods, overlooking the Zhiguli Sea, one of the widest parts of the Volga River. When he told them he was building a soccer academy, neither his neighbors nor the city\u2019s authorities believed him.\u201cNobody thought it would come true,\u201d said Konoplev\u2019s son, Andrey. \u201cHis dream was to create a leading academy in Russia. He wanted to create players who could play for the national team, who could help win the Olympics, the European Championships, the World Cup.\u201dThat last target is, of course, unlikely to be met any time soon. As Russia makes its final preparations to host the World Cup, few, either inside or outside the country, believe it can win the competition. Simply making the knockout round would be something of a triumph; no World Cup host has ever started a tournament lower in the FIFA rankings.That does not mean Konoplev\u2019s vision has not been realized, though. When Russia opens the tournament against Saudi Arabia at Moscow\u2019s Luzhniki Stadium on June 14, three of his academy\u2019s alumni could well be on the field. The defender Ilya Kutepov and the midfielder Roman Zobnin both took their first steps to stardom in this concrete stain of a city.So, too, most importantly, did Alan Dzagoev, the CSKA Moscow playmaker who is his country\u2019s most gifted, most inspirational player, the likely difference between saving face and national disappointment. If it was not for Konoplev, and not for Tolyatti, perhaps none of them would be at the tournament. The engine of the country\u2019s national team was built here, in Russia\u2019s Detroit.Konoplev started work on his project around the turn of the century, when he was in his mid-30s. He had been born in Rostov-on-Don, not far from the Ukrainian border, but arrived in Tolyatti after completing his military service. In Russia\u2019s deregulated, uncontrolled 1990s, he made his fortune in the auto industry \u201cferrying goods around,\u201d as Andrey put it.His passion, though, had always been soccer. \u201cHe lived for it,\u201d Andrey said. A former defender, he took up a position as a vice president of Krylya Sovetov, the region\u2019s team, based in Samara, but that was not enough. So he bought some land in Primorsky and transformed it into the first truly modern academy in Russia. He is thought to have spent around $30 million on the project. \u201cHe did not cut corners,\u201d Andrey said. \u201cHe invested all he had. He invested his soul in the academy.\u201dBehind a screen of trees that had led locals to believe he was building a gaudy vacation home, he instead constructed a facility with 10 fields, both artificial and natural grass, a private gymnasium, swimming pools, Jacuzzis, Turkish and Russian saunas and a medical suite. The prospects who came here would not just be coached in soccer, but in martial arts, gymnastics and dancing, too, to improve their flexibility, their movement. \u201cThey are suspicious at first,\u201d said Igor Kechaev, the academy\u2019s deputy director, \u201cbut it is something different. Kids like diversity.\u201d\u201cHe wanted players who were not just good at soccer, but clever as well,\u201d Andrey Konoplev said. There would be a school on site, and housing. The academy, opened in 2003, was designed to cater to the players\u2019 every need, allowing them to devote themselves exclusively to the pursuit of excellence.What really set it apart, however, was the scope and the scale of its recruitment. Initially, the academy trained only local players, drawn from the Samara region. Konoplev\u2019s plan was much grander, though. He was convinced Russia\u2019s sheer size and its disparateness held it back; the best players needed to be gathered together to push each other on. He wanted Tolyatti to be the place they met.His first move was to appoint a phalanx of highly-regarded youth coaches from all over Russia; they brought with them not only their expertise, but their recommendations. That is how Dzagoev, born in Beslan \u2014 in North Ossetia-Alania, 1,000 miles south of Tolyatti \u2014 came to train here. His coach joined the academy, and so he followed.Konoplev also paid for the academy\u2019s teams to play in tournaments across the country and told his coaches to invite the best talents they discovered to come and train in Tolyatti.Or the academy would stage its own invitational competitions. That is how it discovered Zobnin, born and raised in Irkutsk, on the shore of Lake Baikal, in the middle of Siberia. \u201cWe noticed him during a tournament here,\u201d said Sergei Belousov, the academy\u2019s head coach. \u201cHis mother was a soccer fan. She knew more than the coaches. She persuaded him. The reputation of the academy attracted him, too: We had the best coaches from all over Russia.\u201dEventually, the academy\u2019s fame reached a kind of critical mass. Its teams tended not just to enter tournaments, but to win them. \u201cWhen fame started spreading, people had heard of us,\u201d Andrey Konoplev said. \u201cKids themselves would call us and ask to be enlisted.\u201dProspects were invited to open tryout days. The best were asked to stay and given their own room in the living quarters, where each floor was occupied by players of the same age. \u201cWe have had players here from 30 different regions of Russia,\u201d Kechaev said.It did not take long for the approach to bear fruit. In 2006, Russia won the European under-17 championship. Its team contained six players from Konoplev\u2019s academy. A few weeks later, Konoplev died of a heart attack at age 39.Andrey Konoplev, now a coach at the academy, still finds it difficult to talk about. \u201cHe was kind, and strict,\u201d he said of his father. \u201cFootball was central to our relationship. He wanted me to be a player.\u201dThat might have been the end of his father\u2019s dream, too, had his success not attracted attention elsewhere. A week or so before his death, Konoplev received a phone call from Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea F.C. \u201cHe wanted to take part in the development of the academy,\u201d Andrey Konoplev said. \u201cHe wanted to help him.\u201dAfter Yury Konoplev\u2019s sudden death, Abramovich and a group of investors assumed responsibility for the running of the facility. \u201cHe invested money and had what I would call quiet control,\u201d Andrey said of his father. \u201cNot full control, because there were other investors, but it was still run according to my father\u2019s vision.\u201dAbramovich envisioned Tolyatti as the centerpiece of his National Football Academy, a project designed to improve the standard of youth soccer across the country. Tolyatti would be its highest level, the ultimate hothouse of Russian talent.He recruited coaches from Holland, built more fields, bankrolled trips to play the best youth teams in Europe \u2014 Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid \u2014 and invited Tolyatti\u2019s most promising graduates to train at Chelsea.\u201cWe went abroad and talked to foreign clubs, sent players for internships at Chelsea,\u201d Belousov said. \u201cWe now have 20 former players who are in the Russian Premier League. They went through the process of playing against strong foreign teams. Even now they have a certain experience which helps them play the strongest clubs.\u201dIn 2012, however, Abramovich decreed the National Football Academy had achieved its aim and pulled the plug. \u201cWe stopped receiving funding,\u201d Andrey Konoplev said. \u201cWe do not know why.\u201dThe state stepped in to save the facility \u2014 the academy is now financed by Samara\u2019s regional government, and is officially a satellite of Krylya Sovetov\u2019s youth system \u2014 but, like the car factory, it has had to downsize. There are only four fields in use now. Most of the players, once again, are local. Alumni regularly donate money to help keep it afloat. There are no more foreign trips.\u201cWe are doing the best we can, and we are very grateful to the state,\u201d Belousov said. \u201cBut the players do not develop as they should because we do not play foreign clubs, do not interact with them. Our country is separate from everything else in its mentality, and that is true in football, too. Politics is first, and that prevents us establishing relationships with the rest of Europe. That has an impact on the soccer education system.\u201dSo, too, though, did Tolyatti. Belousov has no doubt that it was what happened in Tolyatti that prompted the likes of Spartak Moscow, Zenit St. Petersburg and F.K. Krasnodar to revamp their own youth facilities. \u201cWe beat them all,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they started to think about opening their own academies.\u201d\u201cThe academy,\u201d he added, \u201cchanged the way Russia makes soccer players.\u201dThat debt is acknowledged: Tolyatti\u2019s teams are still regularly invited to tournaments by the youth arms of the country\u2019s professional clubs. They still do well, too: In 2016, Belousov recounted proudly, three Tolyatti teams made the finals of various Russian youth tournaments. Nobody, he said, had a better record. \u201cKrasnodar has the best facilities in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we can still compete with them.\u201dAnd they have high hopes for several of their current students. As Belousov watches the under-15 team train, he points out one player with bright blond hair and a perfect first touch. Even with money in short supply, in the middle of a downturn, they still do everything they can to try to find the next Dzagoev, to keep Konoplev\u2019s dream alive, to maintain the production line that took three players from this gray city all the way to the World Cup. They have always made things in Tolyatti. They still do.Advertisement"}

It reached its journalistic high point in 2007 when The National Enquirer broke the story that former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina had fathered a child with a woman who had worked for his campaign, and then concocted an elaborate ruse in which his top political aide publicly claimed to be the baby\u2019s father.But it has also gone out of its way to protect business partners and those known as \u201cFriends of Pecker,\u201d even when their behavior was textbook fodder for scandal sheet cover stories.(The company has acknowledged it had helped gather information for Mr. Weinstein, citing their shared business interests, but said it did so when \u201cMr. Weinstein was denying any harassment.\u201d)A.M.I.\u2019s purchase of the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story about Mr. Trump \u2014 part of a $150,000 deal that also included rights to fitness-related commentaries that would run under her name \u2014 was what is known as a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d deal, known for the tabloid world practice of buying stories that are damaging to allies only to bury them.A.M.I., which also owns lifestyle brands including Men\u2019s Journal, Muscle & Fitness, Hers and Flex, has repeatedly restructured in the past decade.

{"Headline": "As Uncertainty Clouds Economy, Europe Pulls Back on Easy Money", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIGA, Latvia \u2014 A trade war with the United States looms. Populists have taken power in Italy, posing a new threat to the euro. Growth is sluggish, and there is even talk of another banking crisis.It would not seem the ideal time to put the brakes on Europe\u2019s economy. But that is what the European Central Bank is preparing to do.What will happen next is uncertain, because the European Central Bank has pumped unprecedented amounts of money into the economy. There may be unpleasant surprises: think real estate bubbles, more wobbling banks or a surge in bankruptcies.\u201cIt\u2019s not the right time,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a monetary policy expert at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. \u201cIf you look at what happened in the last few quarters, everything became more disappointing.\u201dIn countries like Italy, there lurk an unknown number of so-called zombie companies \u2014 businesses that have avoided bankruptcy only because of low interest rates and tolerant banks. A rise in interest rates could prompt a mass collapse of those weak companies.Some economists are even resurrecting the word \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014 a dreaded condition in which inflation rises at the same time that growth stagnates. The region\u2019s residents would face the prospect of paying more for everyday goods even as their wages stayed the same.The central bank will cut stimulus in half after September, and end it altogether after December. In a concession to those who think it is being too hasty, the council said it would not raise its benchmark interest rates until after the summer of 2019. By historical standards, money will remain cheap.Still, those decisions mark a clear change of direction.Since 2015, the European Central Bank has been handing money around in a way possible only for an organization that has a license to print it.It bought almost 2.5 trillion euros, or $3 trillion, in debt that had been issued by not just governments, but all manner of public utilities, breweries, grocery chains, consumer goods conglomerates and automakers. In effect, the bank became the world\u2019s biggest bond fund.The point was to flood financial markets with so much cash that companies and governments would have to pay little or no interest to raise money. And the strategy worked.Interest rates fell so low that, for a time, blue-chip companies could borrow money essentially for free. Real estate prices recovered. In countries like Germany and the Netherlands, shops and restaurants are desperately trying to find workers because the labor market has bounced back so strongly. Growth in the eurozone in 2017 was the best since 2007, before the financial crisis.But early this year, warning signs started to appear. Factories reported fewer orders, and Mr. Trump issued a threat \u2014 since carried out \u2014 to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Europe. On Thursday, the European Union\u2019s member states unanimously backed a plan to impose import duties on \u20ac2.8 billion worth of American products.The new disruptions to trade have unsettled businesses. Companies like ABB, a supplier of power equipment based in Zurich, or Voestalpine, an Austrian maker of steel components for the auto industry, have had to pay more to deliver special steel alloys to their American subsidiaries. The specialized steel is not available from United States suppliers, they say.Now, the 19 countries that share the euro must face these challenges with substantially less central bank support.Economists at the Swiss bank UBS estimated that the bond-buying program has added 0.75 percentage points per year to economic growth since 2015. Put another way, that means the central bank was responsible for about a third of the growth rate last year.The central bank\u2019s own estimates are more modest, but not by much. That means vulnerable countries could be in for a shock when the bank takes the money away.One of the biggest risks is Italy. Its national debt is among the highest in the world. Italy\u2019s new government includes leaders who have talked of leaving the euro. Growth is meager, and unemployment is 11.2 percent, more than three times the rate in Germany.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is no stranger to Italy\u2019s issues \u2014 earlier in his career, he was the highest-ranking civil servant in the Italian Finance Ministry. He indicated on Thursday that the bank would take action only if there were signs that problems in Italy were spreading to other countries.Mr. Draghi also acknowledged that trade tensions with the United States had worsened considerably. Disruption of the world trade order could \u201ccreate very serious damage,\u201d he said.As insurance against such risks, the central bank kept its options open. The end of quantitative easing depends on \u201cincoming data,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. Mr. Draghi suggested that bond purchases could be ramped up again if needed.But his clear message was that the European Central Bank will not be thrown off course by the machinations of populist politicians, a few months of unsettling economic data or threats by Mr. Trump to impose duties on German cars.\u201cWe have taken these decisions knowing that the economy is in a better situation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.In the same breath, though, he betrayed a trace of doubt. There is also, he added, \u201cincreasing uncertainty.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Saudis Go to War, the Crown Prince Attends a Soccer Match", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe crown prince cheered on the Saudi team from a luxury box with his host, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.In a cutaway shot, the TV broadcast showed the two leaders after the third Russian goal. The crown prince turned to Mr. Putin and threw his hands in the air in a gesture of futility. Mr. Putin gave him a sympathetic look.On the field in Moscow, the Saudi national squad was trounced by the Russians, 5-0.On the battlefield in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition has been fighting Houthi rebels backed by Iran for more than three years, the day was not as conclusive. It was not clear what advances, if any, the ground troops backed by the coalition had made in Al Hudaydah, or what the scope of casualties were.The United States rejected a request from the Emirati government this week to provide intelligence, reconnaissance aircraft and Navy minesweepers because of growing congressional opposition to the offensive, an Emirati official said Thursday.The Emiratis turned to France, which agreed to provide the minesweepers to clear explosives that Houthi fighters had been placing in Al Hudaydah harbor, the official said, effectively thwarting for now an amphibious assault of the port.Maj. Adrian J. Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington, declined to comment on any Emirati request for assistance in the Al Hudaydah operation, citing confidential discussions between the two countries and their militaries.French authorities have not confirmed that they have agreed to fill the gap.It was unclear how long it would take for French minesweepers to arrive and to clear a watery path safe enough for Emirati ships loaded with troops to carry out their part of the multipronged operation.Four Emirati soldiers were killed in the opening hours of the operation when their troop vessel was struck by an anti-ship missile about 20 miles outside the harbor, said the Emirati official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the operation.Emirati officials have said the goal of the military offensive is to press the Houthi fighters into submission by denying them a port that by one Emirati estimate yields the rebels between $30 million to $40 million a month in port fees and other revenues. The goal, they said, was to force the Houthis to accept a political solution.Fighting on Thursday appeared to be concentrated around the city\u2019s airport, the first strategic target the Arab coalition is trying to seize before battling for control of the vital port facilities. Approximately 80 percent of the country\u2019s humanitarian aid enters though the port.Local forces trained and financed by the Emirati military clashed on the southern outskirts of the city with fighters loyal to the Yemeni rebel movement, the Houthis, that has controlled Al Hudaydah for the last three years.Aid groups say there have been no reports of shelling or bombing inside the city. A Saudi military spokesman, Col. Turki al-Maliki, said the coalition plan was to take control of the airport, seaport and the route leading to the capital, Sana, but not to engage in urban warfare.But in Yemen\u2019s protracted civil war, which has killed approximately 10,000 people and led to tens of thousands more deaths from sickness and starvation, international aid agencies are wary of predictions by the Saudis and the Emiratis that they could snatch a quick victory in Al Hudaydah\u2019s complex urban environment.Al Hudaydah is a city of 600,000 people. About a quarter of a million people are in danger of injury or death in an urban assault, the United Nations said.The Yemeni president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has been living in exile in Saudi Arabia, arrived in the southern city of Aden on Thursday, his first return to Yemen since 2015, according to the Yemeni Embassy in Washington.Mr. Hadi fled the country that year after the Houthis tried to oust him from power, in part because he had neither a natural constituency in the deeply divided country nor loyalist fighters to protect him. A Houthi-run court sentenced Mr. Hadi to death in 2017 on the charge of treason for his alliance with the Saudis and their military invasion of Yemen.The Saudi-led coalition said this week that they began their assault on Al Hudaydah on behalf of Mr. Hadi\u2019s government.In New York, the United Nations Security Council met privately for two hours to discuss Yemen but took no action to ensure the safety of civilians in Al Hudaydah. Ambassador Vasily A. Nebenzia of Russia, the 15-member council\u2019s president for June, told reporters that it \u201curged all sides to uphold their obligations under international law.\u201dSaudi and Emirati officials carried out a public-relations campaign to explain their rationale for the assault. As part of that, Emirati diplomats around the globe repeated similar points in hastily organized meetings with journalists. They criticized the Houthi rebels for much of Yemen\u2019s humanitarian plight, and insisted that the Arab coalition could more effectively manage the flow of aid and alleviate Yemeni suffering.\u201cWe believe that this operation is a critical step toward achieving a political solution to this conflict,\u201d the Emirati ambassador to the United Nations, Lana Nusseibeh, told reporters in a briefing.She described the assault as a \u201cdeliberate, carefully prepared and executed operation\u201d and said the coalition\u2019s advancing forces would move in a \u201ccalibrated, gradual way, and that every step along the way the Houthis will be given opportunities to retreat, to disarm and to come back to the negotiation process.\u201dMs. Nusseibeh would not speculate on the duration of the operation against the Houthis in Al Hudaydah. \u201cWe hope for a rapid conclusion,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we are facing a small, fanatical group of fighters armed by Iran.\u201dThe Saudis and Emiratis intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015 to fight the Houthis, whom they see as an Iranian proxy.Prince Mohammed has been sharply criticized for the decision to embark on the war, which has killed thousands of Yemeni civilians, devastated the country\u2019s infrastructure and led to one of the world\u2019s worst cholera outbreaks in 50 years.Yemen has devolved into competing zones of control between Houthis, who control the capital as well as their ancestral territory in the north; Emirati- and Saudi-backed Yemeni forces in the south and Red Sea coast; and inland tribal areas where Al Qaeda followers hold sway.The Houthi leadership has lashed out at both the Arab intervention and Western governments, which the group sees as complicit in the offensive.The Houthi-run news agency Saba quoted an unnamed Houthi defense official on Thursday saying that the group had rebuffed all coalition attacks thus far.\u201cAll the offensive operations planned by the U.S.-backed Saudi-led aggression coalition to control parts of the western coast and carry out a military landing have failed,\u201d the official said, according to Saba.Margaret Coker reported from Dubai, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.

{"Headline": "How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBANTOTA, Sri Lanka \u2014 Every time Sri Lanka\u2019s president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, turned to his Chinese allies for loans and assistance with an ambitious port project, the answer was yes.Yes, though feasibility studies said the port wouldn\u2019t work. Yes, though other frequent lenders like India had refused. Yes, though Sri Lanka\u2019s debt was ballooning rapidly under Mr. Rajapaksa.Over years of construction and renegotiation with China Harbor Engineering Company, one of Beijing\u2019s largest state-owned enterprises, the Hambantota Port Development Project distinguished itself mostly by failing, as predicted. With tens of thousands of ships passing by along one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, the port drew only 34 ships in 2012.And then the port became China\u2019s.The transfer gave China control of territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of a rival, India, and a strategic foothold along a critical commercial and military waterway.The case is one of the most vivid examples of China\u2019s ambitious use of loans and aid to gain influence around the world \u2014 and of its willingness to play hardball to collect.The debt deal also intensified some of the harshest accusations about President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative: that the global investment and lending program amounts to a debt trap for vulnerable countries around the world, fueling corruption and autocratic behavior in struggling democracies.Months of interviews with Sri Lankan, Indian, Chinese and Western officials and analysis of documents and agreements stemming from the port project present a stark illustration of how China and the companies under its control ensured their interests in a small country hungry for financing.Mr. Rajapaksa and his aides did not respond to multiple requests for comment, made over several months, for this article. Officials for China Harbor also would not comment.Estimates by the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry paint a bleak picture: This year, the government is expected to generate $14.8 billion in revenue, but its scheduled debt repayments, to an array of lenders around the world, come to $12.3 billion.\u201cJohn Adams said infamously that a way to subjugate a country is through either the sword or debt. China has chosen the latter,\u201d said Brahma Chellaney, an analyst who often advises the Indian government and is affiliated with the Center for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi.Indian officials, in particular, fear that Sri Lanka is struggling so much that the Chinese government may be able to dangle debt relief in exchange for its military\u2019s use of assets like the Hambantota port \u2014 though the final lease agreement forbids military activity there without Sri Lanka\u2019s invitation.\u201cThe only way to justify the investment in Hambantota is from a national security standpoint \u2014 that they will bring the People\u2019s Liberation Army in,\u201d said Shivshankar Menon, who served as India\u2019s foreign secretary and then its national security adviser as the Hambantota port was being built.The relationship between China and Sri Lanka had long been amicable, with Sri Lanka an early recognizer of Mao\u2019s Communist government after the Chinese Revolution. But it was during a more recent conflict \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s brutal 26-year civil war with ethnic Tamil separatists \u2014 that China became indispensable.Mr. Rajapaksa, who was elected in 2005, presided over the last years of the war, when Sri Lanka became increasingly isolated by accusations of human rights abuses. Under him, Sri Lanka relied heavily on China for economic support, military equipment and political cover at the United Nations to block potential sanctions.So when the president began calling for a vast new port development project at Hambantota, his sleepy home district, the few roadblocks in its way proved ineffective.From the start, officials questioned the wisdom of a second major port, in a country a quarter the size of Britain and with a population of 22 million, when the main port in the capital was thriving and had room to expand. Feasibility studies commissioned by the government had starkly concluded that a port at Hambantota was not economically viable.\u201cThey approached us for the port at the beginning, and Indian companies said no,\u201d said Mr. Menon, the former Indian foreign secretary. \u201cIt was an economic dud then, and it\u2019s an economic dud now.\u201dThe Sri Lanka Ports Authority began devising what officials believed was a careful, economically sound plan in 2007, according to an official involved in the project. It called for a limited opening for business in 2010, and for revenue to be coming in before any major expansion.The first major loan it took on the project came from the Chinese government\u2019s Export-Import Bank, or Exim, for $307 million. But to obtain the loan, Sri Lanka was required to accept Beijing\u2019s preferred company, China Harbor, as the port\u2019s builder, according to a United States Embassy cable from the time, leaked to WikiLeaks.That is a typical demand of China for its projects around the world, rather than allowing an open bidding process. Across the region, Beijing\u2019s government is lending out billions of dollars, being repaid at a premium to hire Chinese companies and thousands of Chinese workers, according to officials across the region.There were other strings attached to the loan, as well, in a sign that China saw strategic value in the Hambantota port from the beginning.Nihal Rodrigo, a former Sri Lankan foreign secretary and ambassador to China, said that discussions with Chinese officials at the time made it clear that intelligence sharing was an integral, if not public, part of the deal. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Rodrigo characterized the Chinese line as, \u201cWe expect you to let us know who is coming and stopping here.\u201dIn later years, Chinese officials and the China Harbor company went to great lengths to keep relations strong with Mr. Rajapaksa, who for years had faithfully acquiesced to such terms.In the final months of Sri Lanka\u2019s 2015 election, China\u2019s ambassador broke with diplomatic norms and lobbied voters, even caddies at Colombo\u2019s premier golf course, to support Mr. Rajapaksa over the opposition, which was threatening to tear up economic agreements with the Chinese government.As the January election inched closer, large payments started to flow toward the president\u2019s circle.At least $7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbor\u2019s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation. The document details China Harbor\u2019s bank account number \u2014 ownership of which was verified \u2014 and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out.With 10 days to go before polls opened, around $3.7 million was distributed in checks: $678,000 to print campaign T-shirts and other promotional material and $297,000 to buy supporters gifts, including women\u2019s saris. Another $38,000 was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s electoral bid, while two checks totaling $1.7 million were delivered by volunteers to Temple Trees, his official residence.Most of the payments were from a subaccount controlled by China Harbor, named \u201cHPDP Phase 2,\u201d shorthand for Hambantota Port Development Project.Some Chinese officials have become concerned that the nearly institutional graft surrounding such projects represents a liability for China, and raises the bar needed for profitability. President Xi acknowledged the worry in a speech last year, saying, \u201cWe will also strengthen international cooperation on anticorruption in order to build the Belt and Road Initiative with integrity.\u201dIn Bangladesh, for example, officials said in January that China Harbor would be banned from future contracts over accusations that the company attempted to bribe an official at the ministry of roads, stuffing $100,000 into a box of tea, government officials said in interviews. And China Harbor\u2019s parent company, China Communications Construction Company, was banned for eight years in 2009 from bidding on World Bank projects because of corrupt practices in the Philippines.Since the port seizure in Sri Lanka, Chinese officials have started suggesting that Belt and Road is not an open-ended government commitment to finance development across three continents.\u201cIf we cannot manage the risk well, the Belt and Road projects cannot go far or well,\u201d said Jin Qi, the chairwoman of the Silk Road Fund, a large state-owned investment fund, during the China Development Forum in late March.In Sri Lanka\u2019s case, port officials and Chinese analysts have also not given up the view that the Hambantota port could become profitable, or at least strengthen China\u2019s trade capacity in the region.Ray Ren, China Merchant Port\u2019s representative in Sri Lanka and the head of the Hambantota port\u2019s operations, insisted that \u201cthe location of Sri Lanka is ideal for international trade.\u201d And he dismissed the negative feasibility studies, saying they were done many years ago when Hambantota was \u201ca small fishing hamlet.\u201dHu Shisheng, the director of South Asia studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that China clearly recognized the strategic value of the Hambantota port. But he added: \u201cOnce China wants to exert its geostrategic value, the strategic value of the port will be gone. Big countries cannot fight in Sri Lanka \u2014 it would be wiped out.\u201dAlthough the Hambantota port first opened in a limited way in 2010, before the Belt and Road Initiative was announced, the Chinese government quickly folded the project into the global program.The seaport is not the only grand project built with Chinese loans in Hambantota, a sparsely populated area on Sri Lanka\u2019s southeastern coast that is still largely overrun by jungle.Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s advisers had laid out a methodical approach to how the port might expand after opening, ensuring that some revenue would be coming in before taking on much more debt.But in 2009, the president had grown impatient. His 65th birthday was approaching the following year, and to mark the occasion he wanted a grand opening at the Hambantota port \u2014 including the beginning of an ambitious expansion 10 years ahead of the Port Authority\u2019s original timeline.Chinese laborers began working day and night to get the port ready, officials said. But when workers dredged the land and then flooded it to create the basin of the port, they had not taken into account a large boulder that partly blocked the entrance, preventing the entry of large ships, like oil tankers, that the port\u2019s business model relied on.Ports Authority officials, unwilling to cross the president, quickly moved ahead anyway. The Hambantota port opened in an elaborate celebration on Nov. 18, 2010, Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s birthday. Then it sat waiting for business while the rock blocked it.China Harbor blasted the boulder a year later, at a cost of $40 million, an exorbitant price that raised concerns among diplomats and government officials. Some openly speculated about whether the company was simply overcharging or the price tag included kickbacks to Mr. Rajapaksa.By 2012, the port was struggling to attract ships \u2014 which preferred to berth nearby at the Colombo port \u2014 and construction costs were rising as the port began expanding ahead of schedule. The government decreed later that year that ships carrying car imports bound for Colombo port would instead offload their cargo at Hambantota to kick-start business there. Still, only 34 ships berthed at Hambantota in 2012, compared with 3,667 ships at the Colombo port, according to a Finance Ministry annual report.\u201cWhen I came to the government, I called the minister of national planning and asked for the justification of Hambantota Port,\u201d Harsha de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, said in an interview. \u201cShe said, \u2018We were asked to do it, so we did it.\u2019 \u201dDetermined to keep expanding the port, Mr. Rajapaksa went back to the Chinese government in 2012, asking for $757 million.The Chinese agreed again. But this time, the terms were much steeper.The first loan, at $307 million, had originally come at a variable rate that usually settled above 1 or 2 percent after the global financial crash in 2008. (For comparison, rates on similar Japanese loans for infrastructure projects run below half a percent.)But to secure fresh funding, that initial loan was renegotiated to a much higher 6.3 percent fixed rate. Mr. Rajapaksa acquiesced.The incoming government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, came to office with a mandate to scrutinize Sri Lanka\u2019s financial deals. It also faced a daunting amount of debt: Under Mr. Rajapaksa, the country\u2019s debt had increased threefold, to $44.8 billion when he left office. And for 2015 alone, a $4.68 billion payment was due at year\u2019s end.The new government was eager to reorient Sri Lanka toward India, Japan and the West. But officials soon realized that no other country could fill the financial or economic space that China held in Sri Lanka.\u201cWe inherited a purposefully run-down economy \u2014 the revenues were insufficient to pay the interest charges, let alone capital repayment,\u201d said Ravi Karunanayake, who was finance minister during the new government\u2019s first year in office.\u201cWe did keep taking loans,\u201d he added. \u201cA new government can\u2019t just stop loans. It\u2019s a relay; you need to take them until economic discipline is introduced.\u201dGovernment officials began meeting in 2016 with their Chinese counterparts to strike a deal, hoping to get the port off Sri Lanka\u2019s balance sheet and avoid outright default. But the Chinese demanded that a Chinese company take a dominant equity share in the port in return, Sri Lankan officials say \u2014 writing down the debt was not an option China would accept.When Sri Lanka was given a choice, it was over which state-owned company would take control: either China Harbor or China Merchants Port, according to the final agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, although it was never released publicly in full.China Merchants got the contract, and it immediately pressed for more: Company officials demanded 15,000 acres of land around the port to build an industrial zone, according to two officials with knowledge of the negotiations. The Chinese company argued that the port itself was not worth the $1.1 billion it would pay for its equity \u2014 money that would close out Sri Lanka\u2019s debt on the port.Some government officials bitterly opposed the terms, but there was no leeway, according to officials involved in the negotiations. The new agreement was signed in July 2017, and took effect in December.The deal left some appearance of Sri Lankan ownership: Among other things, it created a joint company to manage the port\u2019s operations and collect revenue, with 85 percent owned by China Merchants Port and the remaining 15 percent controlled by Sri Lanka\u2019s government.But lawyers specializing in port acquisitions said Sri Lanka\u2019s small stake meant little, given the leverage that China Merchants Port retained over board personnel and operating decisions.When the agreement was initially negotiated, it left open whether the port and surrounding land could be used by the Chinese military, which Indian officials asked the Sri Lankan government to explicitly forbid. The final agreement bars foreign countries from using the port for military purposes unless granted permission by the government in Colombo.China had a stake in Sri Lanka\u2019s main port as well: China Harbor was building a new terminal there, known at the time as Colombo Port City. Along with that deal came roughly 50 acres of land, solely held by the Chinese company, that Sri Lanka had no sovereignty on.When the new Sri Lankan government came to office, it sought assurances that the port would never again welcome Chinese submarines \u2014 of particular concern because they are difficult to detect and often used for intelligence gathering. But Sri Lankan officials had little real control.Sri Lankan officials are quick to point out that the agreement explicitly rules out China\u2019s military use of the site. But others also note that Sri Lanka\u2019s government, still heavily indebted to China, could be pressured to allow it.And, as Mr. de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, put it, \u201cGovernments can change.\u201dNow, he and others are watching carefully as Mr. Rajapaksa, China\u2019s preferred partner in Sri Lanka, has been trying to stage a political comeback. The former president\u2019s new opposition party swept municipal elections in February. Presidential elections are coming up next year, and general elections in 2020.Although Mr. Rajapaksa is barred from running again because of term limits, his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former defense secretary, appears to be readying to take the mantle.\u201cIt will be Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s call. If he says it\u2019s one of the brothers, that person will have a very strong claim,\u201d said Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the central bank governor under Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s government, who still advises the family. \u201cEven if he\u2019s no longer the president, as the Constitution is structured, Mahinda will be the main power base.\u201dReporting was contributed by Keith Bradsher and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing, and Mujib Mashal, Dharisha Bastians and Arthur Wamanan from Sri Lanka.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Your Jeans Become a #MeToo Talking Point", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttonedA new collaboration makes denim as current as possible \u2014 as in, current events.This is one of those second times.Still, it may not have happened if not for the serendipity of a new college graduate with a nascent denim line and a highly developed activist streak meeting a former jeans designer with personal experience of sexual harassment.For her senior thesis, Ms. Meyer experimented with laser-printing news stories on upcycled denim, and immediately after school \u2014 she graduated with a B.F.A. in art and design \u2014 she founded her own line, Denimcratic, a jeans label with a political bent. \u201cI had been struggling with a way to have a dialogue with political and social issues even though I was in the art space,\u201d she said. Though her work in school had been \u201cripped apart by my professors \u2014 they kept saying, \u2018This is fashion, not art\u2019 \u2014 I discovered that a lot of people were sneaking into my studio when I wasn\u2019t there to try things on. So I thought there was something there.\u201dAccording to Ms. Goldschmied, Mr. Brifil, who joined the company after it was founded, propositioned her and hit her on her backside. On June 8, she filed a lawsuit against him in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging sexual harassment and fraud, among other charges.The New York Times tried to contact Mr. Brifil about the allegations, but he did not respond directly. Tallen Todorovich, a lawyer who has represented him in past matters, wrote in an email that he and Mr. Brifil were \u201cunaware of any lawsuit initiated by Marta Goldschmied at this time,\u201d as they had not been legally served. \u201cTherefore,\u201d Mr. Todorovich wrote, \u201cMr. Brifil and I cannot comment on Marta\u2019s allegations.\u201dMs. Goldschmied said, \u201cI left everything behind. I felt so hopeless, like I was living a lie, because on social media I was projecting this image of a strong girl, but I was crying myself to sleep every night.\u201dIn September 2017, the two women met. Ms. Goldschmied, who had come to New York from her home in Los Angeles to distract herself, wandered by Ms. Meyer\u2019s booth at the Denim Days festival, a brand-to-consumer marketplace in Chelsea. Ms. Goldschmied\u2019s eye was caught by a denim wall hanging with newsprint stories about the women\u2019s movement lasered into the fabric.She had been feeling, she said, \u201clost and ashamed.\u201d\u201cI had been trying to write a letter to the fashion industry about my experience, but everything I wrote seemed really angry, and I didn\u2019t want that to be the message. Then I saw what Gabby was doing, and it was like the answer for how to address the things I had been dealing with.\u201d\u201cThe question was: How can we make these issues that mean so much to us into a wearable garment that people want to buy that doesn\u2019t marginalize them in any way, but is respectful and thought provoking at the same time,\u201d Ms. Meyer said.\u201cWe wanted to be clear about this being an institutional issue, not just about individual bad actors,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. The buttons, which were specially made, bear the legend \u201cWe wear the pants.\u201d The T-shirt features a photo taken by Ms. Meyer of a woman buttoning her jeans and the words \u201cWanted: Women who wear the pants.\u201d \u201cConceptually, it made sense for us to utilize laser engraving, as the designs will naturally fade with the indigo dye over time, like a regular pair of jeans,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cOur hope is that as the garment ages and the text fades, so do the issues we face with gender inequality and sexual harassment.\u201dThat same month, Alexander Wang unveiled a men\u2019s wear collaboration with Page Six of The New York Post. In its spring women\u2019s collection, Balenciaga offered shirts printed with fictional good-news stories in a bit of pointed irony, and Balmain riffed on the subject in PVC.Nor is it the first time politics has played an overt role in shaping contemporary dress \u2014 there were the pink protest hats of the Women\u2019s March, the sea of black gowns on the red carpet during the Golden Globes. Arguably the issue of female empowerment is at the base of every fashion line (or should be). Looking at the jeans reminds me of being in Prague after the Velvet Revolution and seeing columns in the city\u2019s main squares plastered with old Western newspaper stories. People could read them to find out what had happened in the past, when the Czech newspapers had reported an alternate version of reality. \u201cI liked the idea of using denim, which has in recent history been the fabric of revolution, but that started out as very much a man\u2019s uniform,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cPlus, the denim industry is still very male dominated.\u201dThe products, which cost $250 (for jeans), $375 (the jacket) and $57 (the T-shirt), with 10 percent of all sales going to the National Women\u2019s Law Center to help women who are victims of sexual harassment, will be offered via a website (wewearthepants.com) and in three pop-up stores. The project is being supported by three companies: Isko, a Turkish denim brand, which is underwriting the shops (\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, given the more repressive attitude toward women in Turkish society,\u201d Ms. Goldschmied said); Tonello, a female-run Italian company, which is doing the lasering; and MetalBottoni, which helped create the custom-made buttons. The initial production run has been sponsored, and the rest will be self-financed.The walls will display reproductions of photo collages made by Anica Presley, an artist and one of Ms. Meyer\u2019s former classmates, that depict naked female torsos and legs emerging from, or enveloped by, cuts of beef. The import is pretty obvious.Of course, not everyone will relish the idea of wearing grim reality on her sleeve (or her back or her legs); of being, effectively, a walking textbook and reminder of a cultural paroxysm with which we are still coming to terms. The high prices of the items may them out of reach for many, including women who have endured the very abuses being documented. Ms. Meyer noted, however, that the goal was not simply sales, but also \u201cto open a dialogue, and have a conversation about a topic that is often deemed taboo. There has been a lot of news regarding hostile work environments and gender inequality, and we want to make sure that people don\u2019t forget it.\u201d Now that would be some news.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frank C. Carlucci, Diplomat and Defense Secretary to Reagan, Dies at 87", "Date": "2018-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrank C. Carlucci, a troubleshooting Republican who worked for four presidents in a wide-ranging government career that reached its zenith when he served as national security adviser and secretary of defense in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term, died on Sunday at his home in McLean, Va. He was 87.His wife, Marcia Myers Carlucci, said the cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease.In posts that carried him into international controversies, occasional dangers and Washington\u2019s highest echelons, Mr. Carlucci was a daredevil diplomat, an expert budget-whacker and, to presidents and cabinet secretaries, the indispensable No. 2 man who ran things: the day-to-day affairs of America\u2019s anti-poverty programs; its health, education and welfare systems; its intelligence services; and its military operations.After years in the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, Mr. Carlucci was named national security adviser by President Reagan in 1986, succeeding Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, who had resigned as the Iran-contra affair, and his role in fostering it, came to light.The appointment aimed at restoring confidence in an administration shaken by the scandal. Mr. Carlucci, the fixer, soon cleaned house at the National Security Council, abolishing Lt. Col. Oliver North\u2019s political-military affairs section, which had hatched the covert plot to sell arms to Iran to finance right-wing guerrillas, known as the contras, fighting Nicaragua\u2019s leftist government.A year later, President Reagan named Mr. Carlucci defense secretary. He succeeded Caspar W. Weinberger, who had resigned for personal reasons but who was also under pressure in the Iran-contra affair.Mr. Carlucci was cool, experienced and knowledgeable \u2014 once more a good fit. He had been deputy defense secretary under Mr. Weinberger in Reagan\u2019s first term, and had ably managed the big Pentagon bureaucracy and overseen budgets, procurement, weapons planning and deployment of the nation\u2019s global military forces.Though he was defense secretary for only 14 months, Mr. Carlucci was not a caretaker. He presided over $33 billion in budget cuts, closing domestic bases while maintaining strength abroad as the Cold War wound down. He shared Reagan\u2019s faith in space-based missile defenses and mobile missiles on rail cars, which were not developed. But he also backed arms control agreements with Moscow.Leaving government when President George H. W. Bush assumed office in January 1989, Mr. Carlucci joined the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment partnership. He retired as its chairman in 2003.Frank Charles Carlucci III was born on Oct. 18, 1930, in Scranton, Pa., to Frank Carlucci Jr., an insurance broker, and Roxanne (Bacon) Carlucci. He graduated in 1948 from Wyoming Seminary, a prep school in Pennsylvania, and in 1952 from Princeton, where he studied with two future cabinet secretaries, Donald H. Rumsfeld (Defense) and James A. Baker 3rd (Treasury, State). He then served two years in the Navy.In 1954, he married Jean Anthony. They had two children, Karen Romano and Frank IV. The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1976 he married Marcia Myers. They had a daughter, Kristin Carlucci Weed. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his children; a sister, Joan Kleinrock; and six grandchildren.Mr. Carlucci studied business at Harvard for a year, but after bailing out of a brief unsatisfying business career, he joined the State Department in 1956. A year later he began a 12-year diplomatic career that took him to South Africa, the Belgian Congo (now Congo), Zanzibar and Brazil.Arriving in the Congo in 1960 amid the chaos of struggles for independence, he was stabbed in the neck, beaten and challenged at bayonet point by soldiers, but he helped rescue 20 Americans from a mob after a traffic accident had left a Congolese dead. In June 1961, the Congolese authorities accused him subversive activities and expelled him from the country.Years later there were allegations that Mr. Carlucci had been a covert C.I.A. agent in the Congo and had conspired with American and Belgian operatives to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, the country\u2019s charismatic leftist independence leader, who was abducted and murdered in 1961. Mr. Carlucci vehemently denied the allegations.Still, Mr. Carlucci was a globe-trotting diplomat who might have stepped out of a John le Carr\u00e9 spy story. He was short and compact, with an athletic build, a high forehead, a preference for cardigan sweaters and an enigmatic smile that looked perilously like a grimace. His voice was a razor\u2019s edge: modulated, decisive, accustomed to getting things done.He was expelled again on his next posting, from Zanzibar in 1965, after the leftist government of Tanzania accused him of plotting to overthrow the government. (Zanzibar and Tanganyika had merged in 1964 to form Tanzania.) American officials called it retaliation for Washington\u2019s support of Moise Tshombe, a right-wing leader in the neighboring Congo. Tanzania had supported a leftist rebellion in the Congo. Later, at the American Embassy in Brazil, Mr. Carlucci incurred the enmity of colleagues by overseeing large staff cuts.Back in Washington in 1969, he jumped from relative obscurity to a series of high-profile jobs in the Nixon administration \u2014 deputy director, then director, of the Office of Economic Opportunity, succeeding Mr. Rumsfeld, in 1971; deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, under Mr. Weinberger, in 1972; and, in 1973, Mr. Weinberger\u2019s deputy in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.From 1975 to 1977, Mr. Carlucci was President Ford\u2019s ambassador to Portugal. He was credited with helping to keep Lisbon\u2019s leftist government allied with the West by persuading the White House to support the regime despite strong opposition from Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.While Mr. Carlucci\u2019s previous appointments had been made by Republicans, it was President Carter, a Democrat, who named him deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Adm. Stansfield Turner in 1978. Mr. Carlucci shut down many covert operations to restore the reputation of an agency tarnished by abuses of power.After Reagan became president in 1981, his defense secretary, Mr. Weinberger, insisted that Mr. Carlucci, his former deputy at the budget office and H.E.W., be his deputy. Mr. Carlucci lacked experience in defense matters, but his nomination sailed through Senate confirmation.In December 1983, after two years at the Pentagon, Mr. Carlucci resigned to become president and chief executive of Sears World Trade Inc., a new export trading subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company. It was not a successful venture.And in 1986, as Iran-contra rattled the White House and President Reagan sent up distress signals, Mr. Carlucci took over the troubled National Security Council \u2014 glad, friends said, to be back in his element.Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Welcomes the World, for Better or Worse", "Date": "2018-06-13", "News": "On SoccerVladimir Putin saw the World Cup as a chance to showcase his country. Not everyone likes what they see.Supported byVladimir V. Putin is not a soccer fan \u2014 ice hockey has always been his passion \u2014 but eight years ago, in the hours after FIFA declared Russia would host the 2018 World Cup, he told a story designed to illustrate that he grasped just what the event, and the sport, could do for his country, and for the world.Mr. Putin had landed in Zurich only a few hours earlier, after Russia had been awarded the tournament. As the country\u2019s prime minister at the time, he wished to bask in the glow of an unexpected victory, not associate himself with even the possibility of defeat.He was rushed immediately to a celebratory news conference. The tone, for the most part, was exultant, almost crowing, as Mr. Putin explained how Russia\u2019s oligarchs and corporations would be leaned on to finance the billion-dollar jamboree. The Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, in the audience, beamed at the idea.As he told the story, though, Mr. Putin grew almost wistful, romantic. He was born in Leningrad just after World War II, he said. As a child, he had been told how the city had suffered during the conflict: The siege of what is now St. Petersburg lasted almost 900 days. There had been \u201cno electricity, no running water, no heat in a Russian winter.\u201d German shells landed every day.But he spoke of how \u2014 at the height of the siege \u2014 \u201cfootball matches were held, even at that tragic time.\u201d They had \u201chelped people stand tall and survive.\u201d\u201cFootball brings a spark into the lives of people, young and old,\u201d he said.That was what Mr. Putin dreamed the World Cup could do for Russia, went the metaphor: to illuminate a nation, to inspire a people, to help a vibrant, rapidly modernizing nation stand tall. He wanted the World Cup to showcase that Russia was not what it used to be, but had become something new, something different. He wanted to prove that \u201cwe are an open and transparent country to the world.\u201dThe hundreds of thousands of fans who would descend on Russia in eight years\u2019 time, he said, would find facilities of \u201cthe highest standard,\u201d delivered \u201con time and to perfection.\u201d They would discover a country that was nothing like the one they remembered from school or had heard about on the news.\u201cA lot of stereotypes from previous times, from the Cold War era, fly all over Europe, and they frighten people,\u201d Mr. Putin said then. \u201cThe more contact we have, the more these stereotypes will be destroyed.\u201d Russia \u2014 his Russia \u2014 was different now. The World Cup would prove it.It has been accused of overseeing a vast state-sponsored doping program that affected results at the Sochi Olympics and of interfering not only in the United States presidential election, but also in the vote on whether Britain should leave the European Union. Britain\u2019s intelligence services believe the Russian state was behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former double agent, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain earlier this year.There are those who suggested for years that the World Cup should be taken away from Russia: a country that won it in what many believe was a tainted bidding process \u2014 Russia refused to cooperate with the investigation into the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, claiming the bid team\u2019s computers had all been unfortunately and accidentally destroyed \u2014 and still struggles with racism in its stadiums and homophobia on its streets.And yet \u2014 extraordinary though it is to say it, given all that has happened between the vote to award the hosting rights and the tournament\u2019s opening game in a few days\u2019 time \u2014 there was a grain of truth in Mr. Putin\u2019s logic in 2010. That story about war-torn Leningrad was more than just empty rhetoric.It is not necessarily admirable, or praiseworthy, or right, but once the tournament starts, once the largest sporting event in the world is in full flight, a transformation will take place. In Brazil four years ago, huge strikes were timed to coincide with the World Cup to highlight social injustice and endemic corruption in the country. The world noted it, and then tuned in to the matches, anyway. The World Cup is a circus, and what is a circus if not illusion, and distraction, and sleight of hand?It will not necessarily be the quality of the soccer: The game in its highest form is now played in the Champions League, not on the international stage. If you want slick, dizzying style, watch Barcelona or Manchester City. If you want breathless, breakneck chaos, go for Liverpool or Borussia Dortmund. If you want star power and soap opera, nothing touches Real Madrid and Paris St.-Germain.For tension, though, for meaning, still nothing quite beats the World Cup. Will this be the year that Lionel Messi finally delivers the trophy to Argentina? Can Brazil, driven on by Neymar, avenge the national humiliation of 2014? Will Germany become the first country in more than half a century to retain the World Cup, or is this the moment for Spain or France to reclaim the crown?For romance, too: Egypt is back, 28 years since it last appeared, inspired by the beaming Mohamed Salah; Panama and Peru declared national holidays simply for qualifying; Iceland, with its thunderclapping fans and its dentist-turned-manager, will be the smallest nation ever to take part in the jamboree.The world will watch, as it always does. It will find heroes to love and villains to loathe. It will rise in joy and sink in despair. The World Cup is a thing all of itself; to many, to most, in the heat of it all, what matters is the field, and the goals \u2014 not where they are.Most important, Russia will watch, too, and that is what always mattered to Mr. Putin: not how the world sees Russia, but how Russia sees itself.Its team \u2014 the lowest-ranked host in history \u2014 seems likely to offer little: Expectations in Russia run no higher than simply not exiting at the earliest available opportunity. Even Mr. Putin has not tried to associate himself with the national side: As the timing of his visit to Zurich in 2010 proved, he is not prepared to countenance even the slightest stain of defeat.What matters more is how Russia responds off the field: Can it prove to itself that it is the nation Mr. Putin preaches that it is? Can it deliver a spectacle \u2014 even in the face of reinforced sanctions, introduced after the Skripal poisonings \u2014 worthy of the superpower of its president\u2019s vision?That is what Mr. Putin wanted from this tournament, why he supported the bid in the first place: a chance to stage a vision of his Russia to Russia. That comes with a considerable risk, however, one that will provide the most fascinating \u2014 and possibly most important \u2014 subplot to the tournament.They still talk, in Russia, about the children of the 1980 Olympics: the generation that had the chance to welcome athletes and fans from around the globe at the height of the Cold War and that was inspired not by how different they were, but how alike. Eager to put on a show, the Soviet authorities stocked shops with Pepsi and Marlboro cigarettes for visitors to the Games. Five years later, the era of glasnost and perestroika began.Nearly four decades on, what impact could the influx of thousands of fans, from Colombia and Tunisia and Iceland and all points in between, have on a country that its president has worked so hard to imbue in the myth of its own difference?This may not be a World Cup that changes how the world sees Russia, not given the political context in which it takes place. But it could be a World Cup that changes how Russia sees not only itself, but the world as a whole.As Mr. Putin himself said, though, soccer can bring a spark into the lives of people, young and old. This is a World Cup designed to show his strength. That does not mean he can control its power.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Governor\u2019s Race Forces Candidates to Face the Past", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democratic candidate for governor of California, was working the hallways of Grand Central Market the other day, stopping people at every turn and food counter to ask for votes in this Tuesday\u2019s primary. That included Bruce Binkow, 61, a boxing promoter, over his lunch at Prawn Coastal.Mr. Binkow smiled at the pitch from Mr. Villaraigosa, a former mayor of Los Angeles. But as he moved on, Mr. Binkow said his thoughts were less on the race and more on what he described as California\u2019s prosperity under the man who has served 16 years as governor over the past 40 years \u2014 Jerry Brown, the Democrat stepping off the stage because of term limits.\u201cHe was an excellent governor,\u201d Mr. Binkow said as Mr. Villaraigosa posed for selfies a few feet away. \u201cCalifornia seems to be healthier, more welcoming, more prosperous. I\u2019m very, very happy with him. Those are big shoes to fill.\u201dA head-spinning field of 27 candidates is competing to fill those shoes. They are facing a stature gap as they are measured, inevitably, against the man they would like to replace. And the leading contenders to win on Tuesday are particularly burdened by political and personal baggage that offer another contrast with Mr. Brown as he prepares to retire to his ranch.Two of the Democrats \u2014 Mr. Villaraigosa and Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor \u2014 were involved in high-profile affairs while they were in public office in the mid-2000s, episodes that have been raised against them during a candidate debate and in a handful of advertisements at a time of heightened awareness of sexual misconduct.\u201cPeople don\u2019t bring it up in the context of the #MeToo movement \u2014 they bring it up as something they remember as part of my record,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said in an interview. \u201cJust like I think they bring it up for Gavin for the same reason.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s support could ultimately be toxic in a state where the president is unpopular. Mr. Newsom has already run advertisements tying Mr. Cox to Mr. Trump \u2014 most likely helping Mr. Cox with conservative voters in the primary while signaling how he would go after him in the fall.And Mr. Cox, a Chicago business executive, is a recent arrival to California who has not been elected to major political office. That lack of government service could be a burden at a time when voters tell pollsters that experience is a key factor in choosing Mr. Brown\u2019s successor.\u201cThe reality is that Brown\u2019s approval rating has been over 50 percent for quite a while,\u201d said Mark Baldassare, the president of the Public Policy Institute of California. \u201cThings are going very well in the state. It\u2019s been a long time since people worried about the state budget, and he has managed his relationships with the Legislature quite well.\u201dThe next governor of California will almost certainly be elevated overnight into a national figure. And the election is taking place as California enters potentially difficult waters: This transition of power, with an old guard stepping aside, is playing out as the state is engaged in an escalating battle with Mr. Trump and Washington, and as Mr. Brown and other leading state officials warn that California is overdue for a recession.But so far, no candidate seems to have excited an electorate that does not appear to be particularly hungry for change. \u201cNo one is paying attention,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen two cameras at six events today.\u201d\u201cThere is a sense of satisfaction,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t looking for anything radically different.\u201dBut Joe Sanberg, an investor and liberal activist based in Los Angeles, said the Democrats had failed to inspire voters or present a compelling economic agenda.\u201cThe proof that no one\u2019s presented a transformational economic message is the fact that a third of voters are still undecided about who to vote for, for governor,\u201d Mr. Sanberg said.Here are the pieces you need to read to understand the state, and what may happen there on Tuesday.Mr. Newsom, who has led the field in almost every poll this year, served two terms as mayor of San Francisco before becoming lieutenant governor in 2011; he grew wealthy with the creation of a small wine and hospitality business empire financed by Gordon P. Getty, the investor. As mayor, he defied the federal government in backing the legalization of same-sex marriage.Mr. Villaraigosa served as speaker of the State Assembly and as mayor of Los Angeles. Another Democrat who polls suggest has an outside chance of advancing to the November election, John Chiang, is the state treasurer.By contrast, Mr. Brown, 80, served as governor in two different eras, attorney general, mayor of Oakland and secretary of state. He grew up in the home of his legendary father, Pat Brown, who served two terms as governor before losing to Ronald Reagan in 1966.\u201cJerry Brown will be a hard act to follow, because of his gravitas, his expertise, his clear priorities and his negotiating skill,\u201d said Miriam Pawel, an author who has just written a history of California told through Mr. Brown\u2019s family. \u201cOne may agree or disagree with his priorities, but he has proved to be an astute politician who effectively corralled competing factions to close deals.\u201dIndeed, to a considerable extent, Mr. Villaraigosa and Mr. Newsom have tried to attach themselves to parts of the legacy of Mr. Brown, who has not endorsed anyone in this contest. But they have been critical as well, particularly on the rise of poverty and the homelessness crisis that unfolded under Mr. Brown.For Mr. Newsom and Mr. Villaraigosa, the challenge of inspiring voters goes beyond being judged against Mr. Brown and trying to turn out an electorate that seems, over all, happy with the direction California is going. They also have the hurdle of troubled impressions and memories that linger from earlier chapters in their careers \u2014 particularly when many relationships between women and powerful men, even consensual ones, are being revisited.As mayor, Mr. Newsom cut a glamorous figure across San Francisco. In 2004, Harper\u2019s Bazaar called him and his wife at the time, the Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, \u201cthe new Kennedys,\u201d photographing the couple in expensive designer clothes at the home of Mr. Getty and his wife, Ann. Mr. Newsom\u2019s marriage to Ms. Guilfoyle ended in 2006; the mayor remained politically popular.\u201cHe rocketed up,\u201d Phil Matier, a political columnist for The San Francisco Chronicle who covered Mr. Newsom. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he had his helmet on when he did it.\u201dMr. Newsom was frequently seen at events with celebrities and gained a reputation as a partyer. Around the same time in 2006, city gossip and political columns said he was dating Brittanie Mountz, who was around 19 at the time; he was roughly 20 years her senior. (Mr. Newsom, in an interview this week, denied they were dating. \u201cShe was a friend,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t go into details. Dating is not a term I would use. But friendship, yes.\u201d Ms. Mountz declined to comment.)Mr. Newsom\u2019s personal life drew attention again in February 2007, after he acknowledged he had had an affair with his campaign manager\u2019s wife, Ruby Rippey-Tourk.The affair had occurred in 2005, when Mr. Newsom was in the middle of divorcing Ms. Guilfoyle and when Ms. Rippey-Tourk was working as his appointments secretary. Alex Tourk, Mr. Newsom\u2019s campaign manager and friend, resigned. Mr. Newsom, 39 at the time, apologized swiftly and said he would seek treatment for alcohol abuse.Mr. Newsom was re-elected easily in the fall of 2007. \u201cThe voters either overlooked it or, while it was important, not important enough,\u201d said Tom Ammiano, a former member of the San Francisco board of supervisors.In an email to The New York Times, Ms. Rippey-Tourk, now Ms. Rippey Gibney, called the affair \u201ca very unpleasant mistake\u201d but said she did not feel Mr. Newsom did anything untoward. \u201cI take responsibility for my decision \u2014 I made a bad choice \u2014 not a coerced one,\u201d she wrote.Mr. Newsom said that he heard about the issue only from the news media and from political opponents, but that it was \u201cfair game\u201d for voters to consider.\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I expected. Voters have a right to consider everything. The people of San Francisco considered that \u2014 and they probably know me better than anybody.\u201dMr. Villaraigosa, as mayor in 2007, acknowledged an affair with a television anchor, Mirthala Salinas, that took place as he was separating from his wife, Corina.The affair was covered relentlessly in the news media and cast a shadow over Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s time as mayor. He became a prominent spokesman for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign and briefly emerged as a serious contender for transportation secretary, along with Anthony Foxx, then the mayor of Charlotte, N.C., according to several people familiar with White House deliberations at the time.But Mr. Villaraigosa was photographed around this time at a party in Mexico with the actor Charlie Sheen, stirring concerns in the White House that his lack of personal discipline could embarrass the administration. He remained in Los Angeles.Mr. Villaraigosa said in an interview this week that he expected voters to take his marital difficulties into account, but argued they were outweighed by the rest of his record: a drop in crime, his program to expand mass transit. He said he did not think the affair hurt him politically. \u201cI don\u2019t think people see the connection,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in my case, it wasn\u2019t somebody working for me and it wasn\u2019t a 19-year-old. It was a woman who I had a consensual relationship with.\u201dVoters seem divided as to whether personal behavior should matter. \u201cIt makes me queasy,\u201d said Jane Davis, 59, a community volunteer from Redlands, in San Bernardino County. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s honorable behavior.\u201dBut Ronald Hattis, 75, a physician from Redlands, described Mr. Newsom\u2019s behavior as \u201chuman.\u201d\u201cI know there are people who that sort of thing bothers them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re only looking for people who have abstained from doing anything, who are not alpha leaders, you\u2019re going to miss a lot of talent.\u201dAt the end of the day, the biggest obstacle for these candidates when it comes to exciting voters may not be their past but the sitting governor in Sacramento.\u201cHanging over this election is \u2018What happens after Jerry?\u2019\u201d said Rick Jacobs, a senior political adviser to Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019m not sure most voters have focused very far beyond that, which presents challenges for all of the candidates.\u201dAdam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles, Sydney Ember from San Francisco and Alexander Burns from New York.

{"Headline": "Macedonia and Greece Sign Historic Deal on Name Change", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Macedonia signed a landmark agreement on Sunday to change its name to North Macedonia, sealing a deal with Greece that would, if ratified, resolve a decades-old dispute and pave the way for the enlargement of the European Union and NATO.Hailing a \u201cpatriotic and mutually beneficial agreement for both peoples,\u201d Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece said it was important to see the accord through.The accord must still pass a referendum in Macedonia and ratification in the parliaments of both countries.\u201cIt is our historic responsibility to ensure that this step we are making is not left up in the air,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said.The Greek and Macedonian foreign ministers signed the agreement on the banks of the Prespa Lake District in northern Greece, which the two countries share along with Albania, in a ceremony attended by Mr. Tsipras and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia.\u201cWe have put an end to the longstanding problems which aggravated our bilateral ties,\u201d Mr. Zaev said. \u201cOur two countries must leave behind the past and look to the future. Good luck to us.\u201dSuccessive Greek governments have used the country\u2019s veto to keep Macedonia out of the European Union and NATO until a resolution of the name dispute. Now, assuming the deal is formally ratified, Mr. Tsipras has pledged that Greece will lift its objections to Macedonia joining those alliances.Among the foreign dignitaries attending the tightly guarded ceremony were the European Union\u2019s top foreign policy official, Federica Mogherini; and Matthew Nimetz, the United Nations special envoy, who has mediated the dispute for a quarter century.Mr. Nimetz, who turned 79 on Sunday, said the deal was a birthday gift. He congratulated Greek and Macedonian officials for their \u201cpolitical courage\u201d and \u201cstrategic vision.\u201dAt the end of the ceremony, Mr. Zaev removed his tie and gave it to Mr. Tsipras in a symbolic gesture; Mr. Tsipras is known for going tieless and has promised to wear one only when Greece secures a lightening of its huge debt burden.A decision on Greece\u2019s debt is expected at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Thursday, ahead of the country\u2019s scheduled exit from its third international bailout and reliance on foreign loans in August.Even his right-wing junior coalition partner opposed the momentous accord, though that party largely backed the government in Saturday\u2019s vote.Protesters also rallied near the site of Sunday\u2019s signing, and the police fired tear gas.An opinion poll published over the weekend by the Proto Thema newspaper suggested that seven out of 10 Greeks objected to the compromise reached with Macedonia. Many Greeks reject any alternative name that includes the word Macedonia.The agreement has also prompted protests and political opposition in Skopje, the Macedonian capital. President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will oppose the agreement, and on Friday, a meeting among Mr. Ivanov, Mr. Zaev and Macedonia\u2019s foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, ended almost immediately after it started.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Nairobi, an Art Scene in Transition", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cPeople will say, \u2018Oh that one is a lawyer, and that guy over there is an architect\u2019 so when it gets to me it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Michael and, well, he\u2019s \u2026\u2019 and they will trail off,\u201d he said, laughing. He said that many Kenyans did not see being an artist as a proper job.\u201cWhen you tell people you are studying \u2018fine arts\u2019 they pause and then ask, \u2018finance?\u2019 \u201d Peteros Ndunde, a video artist, added with a smile.But, joking aside, the art scene in Nairobi is in the midst of intriguing change and growth. Collectives like Brush Tu (whose 12 members include photographers and painters like Elias Mung\u2019ora, who recently had one of his paintings purchased by Kenya\u2019s first lady Margaret Gakuo Kenyatta) are helping lead the way for art to be seen as serious business, and also for bolstering arts education, curation and promotion.\u201cNow artists have decided since no one is doing this for us, we are going to have to be the ones preaching the gospel of art,\u201d said Brush Tu\u2019s Waweru Gichuhi. \u201cThe middle class will find that more Kenyans are buying art, art scene is growing and everything is in transition.\u201dThat word \u2014 transition \u2014 keeps popping up these days in discussions about visual arts in Nairobi. There are a growing number of Kenyan artists who are gaining strong reputations abroad \u2014 Wangechi Mutu, represented by London\u2019s Victoria Miro Gallery (participants in this year\u2019s Art Basel), has a solo show at the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston until the end of the year while Peterson Kamwathi has an exhibition at London\u2019s 50 Golborne Gallery and Jackie Karuti received the Young Artist Award at the Cape Town Art Fair last year \u2014 and that helps feed interest in the local art scene.There is also a lot of change happening on the ground. In May \u201cNairobi Contemporary,\u201d a new quarterly art magazine, was started by the artist and curator Thom Ogonga, and \u201cVisual Voices,\u201d a coffee-table book featuring some of the country\u2019s most important artists, was published last summer.Jimmy Chuchu, a photographer from Kenya who co-founded the Nest Collective, a multidisciplinary group of artists, in 2012 said that the lack of support and infrastructure for artists in Kenya had meant that artists have had to rely on themselves. \u201cSo you do not have any sense of what it would be like to work in an environment that is sustaining,\u201d he said.\u201cThe artists and the cultural producers are literally fed up that nothing is happening and they are making stuff happen for themselves, which is fantastic,\u201d said Lavinia Calza, the founder of ARTLabAfrica. \u201cIt is incredibly exciting.\u201dOne of the most profound shifts happened in September with the closing of Kuona Trust \u2014 an organization founded in 1995 that had become the go-to space for local and visiting artists, curators, collectors and art managers.Kuona (\u201cto see\u201d in Swahili) \u2014 which ran out of funding and also had an alleged misappropriation of funds \u2014 included not only studio spaces, but also offered exhibitions and peer-to-peer workshops with international artists and residencies. One alumnus is Ugochukwu-Smooth C. Nzewi, the curator of African art at the Cleveland Museum of Art.\u201cPretty much for 25 years Kuona was the center of everything that was going on here in the contemporary arts,\u201d said Danda Jaroljmek, a co-founder of Circle Arts Agency who ran Kuona for eight years until 2012. \u201cPrevious to Kuona, the work that was being made here was very decorative and very market driven for things like tourism and hotels.\u201dThe Trust\u2019s scope also gave Kenyan artists a chance to interact with each other, something that many had never done before. \u201cI started engaging in that community, and it was the space I developed a certain language and techniques,\u201d said Mr. Kamwathi, who last year was one of the featured artists in the Kenya Pavilion in Venice. \u201cWe really all are children of that space.\u201dIn December, the Kuona Artists Collective opened on the same grounds where the Trust had been. It is an artist-run space and is controlled by artists offering studio space, art open days and residencies.\u201cIt is experimental on some level because this is not our job, it is just something we found ourselves in by default,\u201d said Dennis Muraguri, one of the collective\u2019s four committee members whose woodcut prints focus on urban life in Nairobi. \u201cWhen I started out there were fewer galleries and they already had their artists, so how do you get in? So this idea of artists-run projects gives people more of a chance.\u201dAs more Kenyan artists study abroad or take part in exhibitions in other countries, it influences the scene at home and also garners international interest.Brush Tu co-founder David Thuku said Kenyan artists had done the pastoral scenes and the portraits, but they were now doing art in different ways. \u201cOur art is changing,\u201d he said.What is also increasing is a sense of community within the area\u2019s art scene, and a recognition that helping each helps everyone; Brush Tu and the Nest, for example, have had discussions around a number of aspects that need improvement.\u201cArtists are seizing more opportunities and stepping up where there are deficiencies,\u201d Mr. Ogonga wrote in an email. \u201cIt is definitely an excellent time to be an artist and to experience these moments without looking for excuses for not being active participants.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Saying #MeToo Changed Their Lives", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "Turns out it was just the beginning. People passed me notes on airplanes thanking me. Men and women. I actually just reread three notes that I kept on my bedside table. The themes are similar: thank you so much, I\u2019ve had my own experiences with harassment and sexual assault, you\u2019ve been so brave, you made it easier for me.One woman was on her way to her sister\u2019s college graduation. The sister was graduating with her rapist. On one flight, I had my Time\u2019s Up T-shirt on, and when I got off the airplane people had lined up to thank me.[On her lawsuit] Sexual harassment in the workplace damages economic opportunity. The power dynamics at play are revealed in a worker\u2019s trajectory and in her paycheck. Being able to have the legal basis for remedy is crucial. The promotion that doesn\u2019t materialize, the shift that\u2019s reassigned, the opportunities for advantageous overtime \u2026 those are all ways that women are punished. Bringing that to light and having economic and legal remedy is an integral part of the strategy of moving the American work force forward.A few months ago, I was driving in rural Tennessee, listening to a report on #MeToo in the Russian Parliament. I had such wonder, knowing that in some way it started with our conversation. I did what I did because it was the right thing to do and I trusted that things would fall into place.Now I want joyfully to shout from the rooftops, everyone come forward, everyone come forward. Everyone has to make their decisions, but I think we can safely say millions of others are here to offer support and hope. Nobody can do it for me, but I don\u2019t have to do it alone.I think my favorite responses have been from men who say hearing my story inspired them to make company changes. That has made it really worth it for me.My phone has been ringing off the hook. I had an invitation to close out the Women\u2019s March in Chicago, which was phenomenal. I take every opportunity that comes my way because I know right now, in this moment, there are women who are still working in the plant and across other industries that are fearful of speaking.The apology from Ford was important because it is a recognition, but now the work has to happen.Ms. Walsh, who had been a guest on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Reilly broke his promise to make her a contributor after she declined an invitation to his hotel suite in 2013. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has vehemently denied the allegations of sexual harassment against him. Ms. Walsh now works as an adjunct professor of psychology at California State University, Channel Islands, and as a radio host for KFI AM 640 with iHeartMedia.I was stunned by positive messages that came at me on social media. The best part is that I received an enormous amount of support from men. They told me awful stories of having to watch lecherous men manipulate women and because of the male code or their rank, they were powerless to complain.Although I worried that this would hurt my business (I work in radio and sponsors are everything), somehow this increased my credibility. Suddenly all kinds of ethical companies wanted me to represent their brands.I didn\u2019t want it to be just about me and my validation and my revenge. I wanted others to have a sense of resolution and relief from the trauma, the harassment, the fear and the blame and the self-shaming. These are vulnerable young women who depend on him for their paycheck.It was really about power and domination of women. There were women who really liked him and were flirty with him. A lot of women did love him back. I think he would call himself a feminist, if you asked him. It doesn\u2019t really shock me any more. It fills me with sadness.Ms. Dixon said she was later sexually harassed repeatedly while working under another record label boss, L.A. Reid, subsequently driving her from the music industry. Mr. Reid did not respond directly to Ms. Dixon\u2019s claims, but apologized generally in a statement for ever saying \u201canything capable of being misinterpreted.\u201dIt was like a bomb going off.These are incredibly powerful men. They\u2019re cultural icons, they\u2019re business icons. So just the idea that I was kicking the hornet\u2019s nest with these two really huge people, I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.It\u2019s very hard as a black woman to call out powerful black men because we have no heroes to spare. We are always, still, fighting this uphill battle, always trying to overcome this myth of the predatory black man. So the last thing you want to do is contribute to that in any way. It\u2019s complicated as a black woman \u2014 do you take it for the team? Which is what I did for 22 years. Or do you insist that you, too, deserve dignity, physical safety and respect? That was very hard for me and it\u2019s literally why I kept the secret for all these years. I didn\u2019t want to tear down a black man, let alone two. But what they did was wrong.On the other hand, I didn\u2019t want black women to be left out of the #MeToo moment. And I did not want to miss this opportunity to be heard and believed.I would say that it certainly has been an impetus for me to make music again. It\u2019s a huge source of joy and personal satisfaction for me. And I think I\u2019m good at it. So it\u2019s been a loss for me not to be able to make records. Because of the article I\u2019ve been contacted by aspiring artists, one of whom I\u2019m signing to a label I am setting up specifically to make her record. That would not have happened if I hadn\u2019t resurfaced and reminded myself \u2014 and have others reminded of \u2014 what I do.A selection of Pulitzer-winning investigationsWeinstein\u2019s Complicity MachineDEC. 5, 2017The producer Harvey Weinstein relied on powerful relationships across industries to provide him with cover as accusations of sexual misconduct piled up for decades.Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of HarassmentJUN. 30, 2017More than two dozen women in the tech start-up industry spoke to The New York Times about being sexually harassed by investors and mentors.Bill O\u2019Reilly Settled New Harassment Claim, Then Fox Renewed His ContractOCT. 21, 2017In January, the Fox News host was said to have agreed to a $32 million settlement with a former network analyst, the largest of his known payouts.Louis C.K. Is Accused by 5 Women of Sexual MisconductNOV. 9, 2017As the powerful comedian found success by talking about his hang-ups, he was also asking female comics and co-workers to watch him masturbate.Although Vornado, the Armory Show\u2019s parent company, acknowledged at the time in a letter to Ms. Harris that Mr. Genocchio had \u201creferred to another female employee as arm candy and previously referred to others as sweetie,\u201d the company said that Mr. Genocchio had apologized and ceased his behavior; it also eliminated Ms. Harris\u2019s job. Mr. Genocchio, who denied acting inappropriately, was ultimately removed from his position and has since become a partner at Galerie Gmurzynska.I couldn\u2019t really say what had happened when I left; I just kind of slipped out. I did not want to say anything because I did not want to jeopardize any negotiation.You do what you have to do just to get out of a situation. I didn\u2019t have anything to lose at this point. I\u2019m really not looking for a big full-time job. But let\u2019s say you\u2019re in your 30s, you\u2019re still in the business and you don\u2019t want to be ostracized, there is that stigma. The worst thing for me was I didn\u2019t get the support from other women in the office, even though they had come and complained to me. They didn\u2019t want to lose their jobs. I get it.After the article, my daughter posted on Facebook: \u2018My mother, social justice warrior.\u2019 I really kind of got elevated in her eyes. I\u2019m proud of myself.This is a system that has existed for thousands of years, and now you cannot behave that way. The psychological implications for those of us who have been exploited by men in power are so much to process, because we\u2019ve built our identities and defense systems and strength out of protecting ourselves against this kind of system. For a mother of a 14-year-old girl, it\u2019s overwhelming to know we\u2019re living in a culture where ramifications exist for this kind of thing.There\u2019s a veil of shame that\u2019s been lifted off this whole thing. There\u2019s this amazing feeling of knit-togetherness in the female community. [Many] women don\u2019t have anything to leverage to protect themselves. That\u2019s why it felt so urgent and upsetting and I felt na\u00efve for not having gone through the mental exercise of postulating what the version was for a single woman trying to make ends meet.I was not prepared for what it would feel like to feel silenced, especially once I saw structurally how that\u2019s actually the problem.I can\u2019t talk about what happened, I can\u2019t tell you if it happened more than once, I can\u2019t tell you who else was there when it happened or if I was alone. I can\u2019t tell you how it made me feel, I can\u2019t tell you about the power dynamic between myself and the person or persons the incident happened with.I can\u2019t tell you who I reported it to at the company, nor what their response was. I can\u2019t even tell you if or how their response changed over time. I can\u2019t tell you who I asked for advice, or what they told me. I can\u2019t tell you what conditions I signed the agreement under, and I can\u2019t tell you what was said to me before or after I signed the agreement.I would love to share with other people out there, men, women, whoever, encourage everyone to view NDAs with care. Because when you sign one, you\u2019re signing away your constitutional right to free speech.The question is maybe less about, Should we expect humans to behave perfectly, and more about, What are those mechanisms in place when things don\u2019t go perfectly, and when someone has their rights infringed on?Some who wrote me said they had been abused at home or elsewhere, the article motivating them to want to share their own experiences. I have gained a lot of satisfaction from the grown men that have come up to me, resonating, because men need so badly to do just that \u2014 resonate together, to express their feelings.Though the article provided a deep sense of relief and brought more closure to the abuse I went through, it has in the meantime opened up other issues that were exacerbated by the abuse, though not directly related. Issues such as my own sense of confidence, and why I was one of the ones chosen.The aftermath has provided a new search, one where I am learning to forgive myself for all that I have not accomplished and instead be thankful for what I have done.It\u2019s been about 10 1/2 months now, and I\u2019m finally for the first time starting to come around and understand the role that I was able to play.Now I walk around being able to look people in the eye and acknowledge a sincere compliment. A few days, weeks, and even months after these stories were written I carried a lot of shamefulness around. I couldn\u2019t have predicted that it would take this long. My voice and my story helped to ignite what became this global cause and movement, and it took on such a life of its own that I really didn\u2019t have time to breathe, or think about it, or come up for air.In my case, there was really overwhelming evidence, and whether I knew it at the time, I would be able to eventually do something with all of the text messages, the emails, the voice messages.I was sure glad that I had that paper trail because it made me realize as I looked back to see that yeah, what I had gone through was not just in my head.One of the most satisfying things was to see my daughter\u2019s reaction, because she was just like, \u2018Wow, Mom, this is so cool, this is so badass, you did the right thing and more power to you.\u2019 She is 23 now and she just started to work. The young women today have a different attitude. They are much less willing to put up with things.Back then you said, \u2018I don\u2019t have anywhere to go with this and that\u2019s just the way guys are,\u2019 but now things are different. Now people will finally listen to these stories instead of dismissing them. Now we talk because now the culture is listening to us.When the article dropped, my anxiety skyrocketed. Strangers recognized me from the internet, and people I hadn\u2019t spoken to in years texted me. But I have fewer friends at Vice than ever. Only one man I worked with at Vice reached out to me in the days following, and it was expected \u2014 a good friend who knows me very well. The rest were women. And even then, far fewer than I\u2019d hoped. It was incredible because all of these people I\u2019d considered family at one point just \u2026 weren\u2019t there.A few other former co-workers reached out in time, but even so, it was like every straight man I\u2019d worked with at Vice was terrified that perhaps they, too, had harassed me at some point, so best to not say anything at all, best not to apologize lest it looks like an admission of guilt, I suppose. I think men are so used to the office-place power dynamic they don\u2019t realize what they\u2019re doing is permanently damaging to women.I choose not to have even moderately close relationships with co-workers now. I go to work, do my job and go home. The last time I made my work my home and my colleagues my family, I lost everything. And I lost myself. That\u2019s not happening again.I just finished directing this new play, called \u2018How to Defend Yourself,\u2019 at a new play festival here [in San Diego], about a college student who has been raped by a fraternity member and one of her sorority sisters starts a self-defense class. It\u2019s been amazing to work on it, and ultimately it\u2019s healing, but there were times when I\u2019d have to take a break and go outside and cry or be mad.It feels like this was a moment where a huge veil came off, and when we have been able to see what we could not see before. I\u2019m really grateful for that. It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s the way we evolve.It feels terrifying to speak on the record. Once you jump off the cliff and you say it, you realize that actually there is no cliff. It turns into a door that\u2019s open and there\u2019s all these people standing on the other side and they\u2019re literally saying, \u2018Me too.\u2019I was absolutely shocked by some of the stories I heard from ballerinas I thought were untouchable. That floored me. These were queens. You\u2019re conditioned to not complain. You\u2019re conditioned to accept a certain style of communication and a certain way of being treated. Now that company is going to turn into something we never thought it could be. We all want to change it; it needs to change.She said it was the final act in a long string of incidents with both men that that included attempts by Mr. Batali to touch her breasts and engage her in lewd conversation. Mr. Batali said at the time of publication in December that he didn\u2019t remember specific incidents, but \u201cthere is no question I have behaved terribly.\u201d In a statement, Mr. Friedman acknowledged behavior that was \u201cabrasive, rude, and frankly wrong\u201d but also said that \u201csome incidents were not as described,\u201d without responding specifically to any woman\u2019s account.Before this happened I\u2019d invested five years in seeing a therapist on a weekly basis and now it\u2019s become clear that what I really needed to do in order to heal myself was end the oppressive silence that I\u2019ve been shaming myself with and speak \u2014 more like, shout \u2014 my truth.I feel like I\u2019ve finally been given permission to hang up an extremely worn-out pair of tap dancing shoes, the shoes I used to dance around the bloated egos and salacious behavior of power-driven men for decades. I finally feel like myself again.Related coverageFord Apologizes for Sexual Harassment at Chicago FactoriesDEC. 12, 2017The company\u2019s chief executive released an apology two days after a New York Times article detailed decades of misconduct.Chuck Close Is Accused of Harassment.

{"Headline": "Clinton Hill Mansion With a Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll History", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExclusive12 PhotosA ghost story led Jessica Warren to the house known as the Pfizer Mansion. A rock musician sold it to her.Now, 11 years after buying the 1887 brownstone in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, Ms. Warren, 53, an interior designer, and her husband, Douglas, 59, who works in finance, are putting it on the market for $13.5 million.\u201cThe kids are gone, and I would love to stay here on some level, but \u2026\u201d Ms. Warren let the sentence drift off into the approximately 10,000 square feet of space around her. The house is listed with Angela Ferrante of Brown Harris Stevens.In 2006, the couple and their two children were living contentedly in Park Slope when Ms. Warren heard about a vacant building on Eighth Avenue in Brooklyn that was said to be haunted. The ghosts, reportedly, were 19th-century Irish servants who had died after being trapped in the elevator while their employers were in Europe.Curious, she typed \u201cBrooklyn mansion elevator\u201d into a search engine. A listing popped up for an entirely different property \u2014 a five-story Queen Anne building at 280 Washington Avenue with a vintage Otis elevator.That house, which sat on a lot stretching back to Waverly Avenue, had its own vivid history.When Ms. Warren came to investigate, she found intact moldings and fireplace mantels, religious stained glass (after the bishop moved out it was used as a Roman Catholic girls\u2019 school) and rooms on the main floor that resembled cages. Mr. Davies used those rooms to store valuable sound equipment while renting other spaces to students at nearby Pratt Institute and had put protective bars in the doorways.The Warrens were charmed despite such oddities, but the owner\u2019s enthusiasm for selling ebbed and flowed. The couple offered $3.2 million; Mr. Davies turned them down. His housemate, the bass player Paul Raven of the bands Killing Joke, Prong and Ministry, explained that Mr. Davies was a numerologist and might be more agreeable if the digits added up to 10.A new offer of $3,200,000.23 was tendered, and this time Mr. Davies accepted it. On the day they closed \u2014 June 1, 2007 \u2014 he insisted that the papers be signed at precisely 3:33 p.m. and that the Warrens bring their best bottle of tequila.Floor by floor, to the tune of $5 million, Ms. Warren returned the building to a more-or-less conventional single-family residence. Learning that the property once had a conservatory in back, she had the home\u2019s renovation architects, Neuhaus Design Architecture of Brooklyn, build a round, copper-roofed addition in its place and relocated the kitchen there. The room, which echoes the conservatory\u2019s shape and connects to the parlor floor, has a quartzite island, basalt floor tiles and a gleaming, 1970s-style arc lamp. The curved window (\u201ca little bit of a budget breaker,\u201d Ms. Warren said) looks out to a recently planted garden with mature crepe myrtle and oak-leaf hydrangea.One could go on and on about her meticulous restoration of the living room\u2019s inlaid floor border. Or the yards of maple woodwork she daringly bleached so that the second-floor master suite didn\u2019t look too stuffy. Or the weird rightness of the home\u2019s many vintage 1970s furnishings \u2014 Ms. Warren is a passionate thrifter. Or the elegance of the new metal staircase that curls down from the parlor to the garden level, where Mr. Davies\u2019s \u201cMoroccan party room\u201d used to be.But it is in the bathrooms where Ms. Warren\u2019s design talents truly shine.Mr. Warren\u2019s bathroom, for instance, a cool square chamber in creamy marble, was styled to look like it belonged in a hotel \u2014 a request he had made after staying at the Savoy in London on business.Their daughter Sophia\u2019s has swoony peacock-blue wallpaper crammed with glamorous faces. (The bathroom was designed 11 years ago, when she was 14 and had declared a mysterious aversion to tile and grout.)For herself, Ms. Warren covered the walls of a second-floor nuns\u2019 chapel with olive-green, peony-studded de Gournay paper and furnished the room with not much more than a Wetstyle soaking tub next to the fireplace.Originally this bathing room, as she calls it, had a stained-glass window decorated with red crosses. She replaced the glass but soon noticed that at a certain time of day, sunlight hit the bathtub spout and horizontal handle at an angle that cast the shadow of a cross on the floor. Ms. Warren, who was raised Roman Catholic, said the implicit message was, \u201cYou are not going to take the cross out of here.\u201dAbhorring vacuums, the Warrens at first used the house to host punk-rock shows programmed by their children. Unfinished rooms posing hazards to the young guests were marked \u201cSTFO\u201d \u2014 an abbreviation for \u201cstay out,\u201d spiked with an expletive.Once they had fixed up the building, they lent it to cultural organizations for benefits, neighbors displaced by Hurricane Sandy, artists doing multimedia presentations, and production companies that used it as a location for films, television shows and catalog spreads.Artworks line the walls and are propped up on landings, including fragments of a mural by the multimedia artist Swoon that are sandwiched between sheets of glass. The Warrens had commissioned the work for their old Park Slope apartment and scraped it off the walls when they moved.This time, they are leaving a few of their acquired treasures, including graffiti hidden in the dining room subfloor. The night before the floor was laid, they handed indelible markers to their friends and invited them to create a written time capsule for future residents.\u201cPeople left all these drunken messages,\u201d Ms. Warren said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Fund Managers Back Bitcoin", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few years ago, I asked a friend at a major Wall Street trading desk if her colleagues ever talked about cryptocurrencies. She responded that one person would occasionally bring up Bitcoin, then the room would clear out.This was during Wall Street\u2019s \u201cBitcoin is stupid\u201d period, which fell between the initial, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it\u201d era and the more recent \u201cit\u2019s a bubble\u201d phase. Since the advent of the first cryptocurrency nine years ago, professional money managers have almost universally dismissed it as a potential investment. Although many have come around on the power of the underlying technology, cryptocurrencies have often been ignored or ridiculed.Last year, as the price gains of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether were generating daily headlines, some fund managers went on the attack, calling the sector a pyramid scheme. Although they probably really felt that way, they might have also been a little jealous. Wall Street money managers are not used to standing on the sidelines while amateurs get rich off something the pros don\u2019t really understand, or worst yet, own.For the crypto faithful on the other hand, it\u2019s always been a question of when, not if, the rest of the world catches on. Their faith (despite the volatility) has put them on the right side of a powerful investment thesis, one best phrased as a question:What happens when institutional money managers, who collectively control most of the world\u2019s investment capital, enter a new asset class for the first time?When the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.The answer lies in basic math. Institutions control so much money that they own half a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of Apple alone, and that\u2019s just one stock within a single asset class. If all the hedge funds and family offices out there decided to commit a fraction of that capital to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies, they may double the size of the sector.I\u2019ve been making that argument to friends who work in institutional finance for years, but they\u2019ve always brushed me off, and for good reason. Contrary to what an outsider might think, people who manage other people\u2019s money don\u2019t base their decisions on how to maximize returns. Their first consideration is whether they could justify their actions should something go wrong.This is a smart way for individual managers to make investment decisions, even if the combined effect is a lot of groupthink and the familiar cycle of booms and busts. Traders who lost money in mortgages in 2007 still have a job today because most of their colleagues also blew up in that trade.That attitude is one reason no career-minded professional has wanted to be the first to dip toes into crypto. Or the second, or the 12th. Not if they wanted to have a long career. But with each passing month, as more people talk about Bitcoin and more conferences are held where more products aimed at institutions are introduced, the barrier to entry gets a little lower.Every chain reaction starts small and needs the help of at least one catalyst. The adoption of the crypto-asset class by institutional investors has recently enjoyed several, the biggest of which is the introduction of infrastructure that solves the crypto-custodian problem.Since blockchain technology gives cryptocurrencies certain physical properties, storage is a significant issue. An institution that invests in stocks doesn\u2019t have to worry about a hacker infiltrating their servers to steal shares, but in crypto, that kind of thing happens all the time. Several solutions to this problem have been introduced by reputable crypto companies in recent months, including hardware products that help institutions secure their own cryptocurrencies and a storage service where a third party does it for them.Then there are the recently introduced Bitcoin futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. These products allow institutions to gain exposure to crypto markets while bypassing the storage issue altogether. As an added bonus, their creation signaled a much-needed nod of approval from financial regulators, as did Goldman Sachs\u2019 decision to help clients trade them.None of this means that the world\u2019s pension funds and endowments are about to dive in. But for the bullish thesis to work, they don\u2019t have to. Just the fact that they will start to consider the option is a major change. Throw in a sputtering stock market and a stalled bull market in bonds, and the argument becomes even more compelling.On Wall Street, the only sin worse than being the first in a bad trade is being the last in a good one, or what crypto enthusiasts colloquially call FOMO \u2014 or fear of missing out. That fear drives a lot of investment booms, and nobody knows that better than the biggest stewards of institutional money: hedge funds.Twenty years ago, most people had never even heard of \u201calternative assets.\u201d Then the dot-com bubble burst, leading the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, and it was no longer possible for pension funds and endowments to hit their annual return targets with only stocks and bonds. Within a few years, everyone was talking about the importance of allocating some capital to so-called absolute-return strategies, and the hedge fund boom was born.We are still years away from when institutional investors will fully embrace crypto as an asset class, but 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the tipping point.Omid Malekan is the author of \u201cThe Story of the Blockchain, a Beginner\u2019s Guide to the Technology Nobody Understands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But we live in a world where saying \u2018black lives matter\u2019 is controversial,\u201d said Jacob William Faber, a sociologist at New York University who studies racial economic disparity. \u201cIt\u2019s a rebuttal to the idea \u2014 the false choice \u2014 that if you want investment you have to accept displacement.\u201dMs. Giwa said the blog offers a way to present a more complete story. \u201cIt\u2019s so often a story of displacement or loss when you\u2019re talking about black Brooklyn,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to downplay that, because it does happen and it is a serious concern, but it\u2019s also not the whole picture.\u201dAfter years of watching business ownership slip away from black residents in Brooklyn, Latisha Daring, owner of Greedi Vegan, a cafe in Crown Heights, decided to take advantage of the borough\u2019s recent economic growth. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s about what you do with it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about asking: Are you prepared for it? To be a part of the change?\u201dA survey of business owners by the Census Bureau reported a substantial jump in the number of black-owned businesses nationwide between 2007 and 2012, to 2.6 million from 1.9 million. That boom was driven by women, who account for 59 percent of black-owned businesses, compared to 36 percent of businesses nationwide. Of the 35 entrepreneurs profiled by Black-Owned Brooklyn, 24 have been women.In New York, though, black entrepreneurs have grappled with municipal invisibility. City officials in the mayor\u2019s office and the Department of Small Business Services were unable to provide comparative data on black-owned businesses in Brooklyn or citywide. \u201cWe don\u2019t keep numbers of black-owned businesses,\u201d said Meredith Daniels, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Raul Contreras, a spokesman for the mayor, offered as a stand-in the registry of certified city contractors from the Mayor\u2019s Office of Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises; there were 319 black-owned contractors in Brooklyn in 2017, up from 295 in 2015. \u201cA lot of people associate contractors with construction and capital work, but we also work with designers and caterers,\u201d Mr. Contreras said.The players in Brooklyn aren\u2019t necessarily local. \u201cI came over here on purpose, because of all the gentrification that\u2019s happening,\u201d said Cindy Morris, who uses the professional name Khane Kutzwell. She owns Camera Ready Kutz, a self-described \u201cL.G.B.T.-safe\u201d barbershop in Bedford-Stuyvesant, though she lives in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens. \u201cWe have businesses opening up that look pristine and nice,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I just truly believe we can do that for ourselves. Why can\u2019t we do that? Why aren\u2019t we doing that? What is the excuse now?\u201dEconomists have a less sunny view of the trend toward more black-owned businesses. Black workers have been harder hit by public-sector cutbacks, said Darrick Hamilton, a professor of economics and urban policy at the New School. \u201cAdd to that the biases against hiring blacks in the private sector, and the question becomes: Is it a choice to start a black-owned business, or is it blacks being pushed into limited labor choices?\u201d Asked to explain the tilt of women in black-owned businesses, Mr. Hamilton was similarly blunt: \u201cBlack men are busy being incarcerated or, even if they get out, marked by it.\u201dFor its part, Black-Owned Brooklyn is not without competition. A March GQ cover story revealed a coming app to help locate local black-owned businesses. The app, yet to be named, is being financed by Shawn Carter and Sean Combs \u2014 better known as the rappers Jay-Z and Diddy. \u201cI want to be an authentic, unapologetic warrior for black culture,\u201d Mr. Combs told the magazine, adding: \u201cThis is not about taking away from any other community.

{"Headline": "A Renewed View of Some of the World\u2019s Oldest Trees", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a three-year restoration project, the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite National Park has reopened, with less asphalt and more concern for the health of the trees.YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. \u2014\u00a0John Muir, the naturalist who was most at home sleeping outdoors on a bed of pine needles in the Sierra Nevada, called giant sequoias the \u201cnoblest of God\u2019s trees.\u201dFor three years, some of the most striking examples of these towering marvels were off limits to visitors in Yosemite National Park. After a $40 million renovation \u2014 the largest restoration project in the park\u2019s history \u2014 the Mariposa Grove, a collection of around 500 mature giant sequoias, reopened last week.What Muir called a \u201cforest masterpiece\u201d is now back on display.The renovation addressed a problem that the park has struggled with for years. On the busiest summer days, more than 7,000 cars may converge on the park, which is about a four-hour drive from San Francisco. The gridlock they create amid the stunning chutes of water running down the steep granite slopes of Yosemite\u2019s glacier-carved valley results in a kind of drive-by naturalism that frustrates many.In the Mariposa grove, which is a 45-minute drive from the Yosemite Valley floor, the traffic brought exhaust fumes and engine noise to the foot of some of the world\u2019s oldest living things. Park rangers feared that the asphalt covering the root systems of the trees could damage them.One of the trees in the grove, the Grizzly Giant, a massive, battered and gangly sequoia, is estimated to be 1,800 years old (\u201cplus or minus a few centuries,\u201d according to the National Park Service). Early last week, just a few days before visitors were welcomed back into the grove, a deer was calmly enjoying the shade of the trunk, which measures nearly 100 feet in circumference, one-third of a football field\u2019s length.Partly financed with a $20 million gift from the Yosemite Conservancy, a private philanthropic organization, the renovation involved ripping up nearly an acre and a half of pavement near the trees where cars and trams would pass and replacing it with walking paths made of packed dirt held together with resin. Visitors are now encouraged to take a free shuttle bus from a new parking lot a 10-minute drive away (there is still some accessible parking for disabled visitors at the grove itself). The clanging, smoke-spewing diesel trams which previously took visitors on a tour of the grove have been removed.\u201cWe are not trying to take away anyone\u2019s freedom,\u201d said Scott Gediman, a spokesman for the park. \u201cTake your car, but then park it. And walk.\u201dWith bark that can be more than one foot thick and high levels of tannins to repel insects, giant sequoias are regarded by experts as some of the world\u2019s most resilient trees. Close to 130 million trees of other species died in California over the past decade after being weakened by a five-year drought, but no mature giant sequoias perished, according to Sue Beatty, a restoration ecologist who helped lead the project. Even so, Ms. Beatty and other experts said they saw some signs of stress in the sequoias.Giant sequoias do not have a central taproot. Instead, they develop a shallow network of roots, around 3 feet deep, that spreads as far as 200 feet from the trunk, Ms. Beatty said. The asphalt and the trampling feet of visitors in the grove were making the trees more vulnerable.\u201cThis project was all about the trees,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to improve their survivability in the time of a changing climate.\u201dIn the main viewing areas, the trees are cordoned by pine fences, although visitors can get up close to the trees in the upper parts of the grove. Culverts were torn up and creeks and wetlands were restored.Frank Dean, a former park ranger who is head of the Yosemite Conservancy, describes the renovation of the grove as part of an evolution in the way Americans approach the West: from conquest and discovery to preservation.Early visitors to the Mariposa Grove bored through at least one giant tree, which today is aptly called the California Tunnel Tree. Visitors can still walk through the trunk.\u201cThere\u2019s a greater understanding of how special \u2014 and how fragile \u2014 it is,\u201d Mr. Dean said of the flora and fauna in the park. \u201cSociety has evolved. It\u2019s a lighter-on-the-land approach.\u201dYosemite receives around 5 million visitors a year.

{"Headline": "In Vancouver, a Housing Frenzy That Even Owners Want to End", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "Facing a crisis of affordability, officials are trying to reduce real estate demand through a package of tax measures, some aimed at foreign buyers.Supported byHere is a new one: Vancouver is so expensive that politicians want to tax its real estate market into submission, and many homeowners \u2014 who will lose money if home prices fall \u2014 think it\u2019s the best idea they\u2019ve heard in years.\u201cI would like to see a correction to sober up this whole place,\u201d said Rob Welsh, a retired airplane mechanic who lives in a Vancouver suburb. Mr. Welsh bought his house in 2000 and has become a paper millionaire based on its appreciation. It makes him more anxious than happy.\u201cIf I got to lose 200 or 300 grand to keep the kids and the future of this place, so be it,\u201d he said.Like many cities around the world, Vancouver is grappling with punishing housing costs that have pushed out large swaths of residents \u2014 and are causing distress among young adults who can\u2019t afford rent today and take it for granted that they will never own a home.Part of the reason is the attraction of Vancouver itself, and not just among Canadians. Between its natural beauty, its temperate climate and Canada\u2019s liberal immigration policies, the city has become a magnet for foreign buyers, especially from China.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that many of the measures we are bringing in are bold, but we felt they were critical if we were really going to address this crisis,\u201d Carole James, British Columbia\u2019s finance minister, said in an interview.No doubt, many voters would think twice about that opinion if home prices actually crashed. Still, respondents \u201cwere clearly reacting from a place of deep anxiety, even desperation, about their own or their loved ones\u2019 ability to access the housing market,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, executive director of Angus Reid.\u201cUnbeknownst to many people in the local population, Vancouver has been sold as a subsidized resort town and retirement community to the world,\u201d said Josh Gordon, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University here. \u201cWe are now seeing the culmination of that dynamic.\u201dHow much of the city\u2019s housing demand is coming from China is hotly debated. Government statistics show that foreign buyers own about 5 percent of the housing stock in the metropolitan area, but the numbers are several times as high for new condominiums, which helps to explain why a surge of building hasn\u2019t done much to reduce prices, according to an analysis by Mr. Yan. And this almost certainly underestimates the influence of foreign capital, since the data exclude Canadian immigrants with money from overseas.The real estate industry contends that the issue is not an influx of Chinese, who have been coming to Vancouver for decades, but zoning restrictions that prioritize low-density living, outside of a few high-rise areas.\u201cI live 15 minutes from the downtown core in a house,\u201d said Keith Roy, a real estate agent. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I should be in a townhouse at this distance, maybe even a low-rise condo building.\u201dThe figures show, however, that unlike other expensive West Coast cities like San Francisco, where the housing supply has long lagged behind population growth, Vancouver has consistently produced new housing. Over the past decade, the housing stock has grown by about 12 percent, while the population has grown by about 9 percent, according to the city.This disparity has persuaded the city to broaden its measures beyond just a push for new buildings to efforts like the empty homes tax.\u201cIt\u2019s getting out of the mind-set that just more is better,\u201d said Gil Kelley, the city\u2019s general manager of planning, urban design and sustainability.Tom Davidoff, an economist at the University of British Columbia, said it was all of the above. Vancouver is popular with foreign buyers, yes. But it also has strict zoning laws that reserve most of the city\u2019s land for single-family homes, as well as high income taxes but low property taxes of about a quarter of a percent of the property value.\u201cThe message we have sent the world is, \u2018Come and buy our real estate, but do not try to make a living here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Davidoff said. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201dWhile the new government\u2019s housing measures are popular with many voters, richer homeowners are fuming. A recent stroll through Vancouver\u2019s wealthier West Side turned up bright red signs protesting the tax on $3 million homes. \u201cAre you angry yet?\u201d read one. \u201cRally against the N.D.P. tax grab now.\u201dHowever it happened, Vancouver\u2019s transformation to an international gateway has given the city something of an identity crisis. For Vancouverites who a generation ago took it for granted that they could buy a home or condo near the urban core, the trade-offs for the steep rise in prices are hard to accept.\u201cPeople who live and work in Vancouver can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d said Nathalie Baker, a lawyer who is in favor of measures to cool the market, even though she owns a home here. \u201cAnd that is a very significant problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Moves to Lift Its Nuclear Enrichment Capacity", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iran announced on Tuesday that it had completed a new centrifuge assembly center at the Natanz nuclear site, in a first step to increasing its enrichment capacity.The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, told state television that the center\u2019s construction had been \u201cin line with our safeguard commitments but not publicly announced.\u201dA spokesman for the Iranian nuclear agency, Behrouz Kamalvandi, said a letter had been sent to the International Atomic Energy Agency explaining the action. He also told the semiofficial Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency that Tehran would increase its capacity to produce uranium hexafluoride, a feedstock for centrifuges.It was unclear whether the assembly center would actually begin to produce new centrifuges.Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran stopped enriching uranium to the 20 percent level that would allow for rapid development of a nuclear weapon and agreed to a limit of under 5 percent. It will adhere to that limit, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech on Monday.It was also uncertain whether the opening of the centrifuge plant would have any significant impact on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which continues to be closely monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency.However, the American sanctions would still be a major problem, particularly for multinational companies, and several European firms have already announced plans to pull out of Iran. On Monday, the French group PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars, which produces 440,000 vehicles a year in Iran, started closing its joint ventures with local auto manufacturers, though PSA said it would seek a waiver from the United States to maintain that production level.In his speech on Monday, Ayatollah Khamenei warned the Europeans that Iran\u2019s patience was limited, but analysts said that Tehran\u2019s demands of guaranteed purchases of Iranian oil and free bank transfers with the European Union might exceed what the bloc could deliver.\u201cThe Europeans expect the Iranian nation to tolerate and grapple with the sanctions, to give up their nuclear activities, which is an absolute requirement for the future of the country, and also to continue with the restrictions that have been imposed on them,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said. \u201cI would tell these governments that this bad dream will not come true.\u201dThe Trump administration has shown no outward willingness to compromise on Iran. If anything, it has hardened its position that any companies that engage with Iran do so at their own peril.\u201cThe Iranian regime will deceive your companies, undermine the integrity of your financial systems, and put your institutions at risk of our powerful sanctions,\u201d Ms. Mandelker said. \u201cYou must harden your financial networks, require your companies to do extra due diligence to keep them from being caught in Iran\u2019s deceptive web, and make clear the very significant risks of doing business with companies and persons in Iran.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mahathir Mohamad, Leading Malaysia Again at 92, Is on a Mission", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "Facing a mountain of national debt accumulated under his predecessor, the prime minister has no time for apologies, mincing words or President Trump.Supported byPUTRAJAYA, Malaysia \u2014 Racing to figure out the depth of the fiscal crisis that awaited him after his inauguration, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his aides first entered the Malaysian government offices last month to find an alarming sight: oversize garbage bags filled with shredded documents, a snowstorm of loose papers on the floor, even half-consumed food left by former occupants in a hurry to get out.Even without piecing together a single shredded document, Mr. Mahathir, who previously served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, has discovered that the country is in far worse financial shape than he and his allies had feared. The national debt, tallied at $170 billion by Mr. Najib\u2019s administration, has been reassessed, along with other government liabilities, at $250 billion. That is 80 percent of Malaysia\u2019s gross domestic product.\u201cThe more we look into the previous administration, the more bad things we find,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said in an interview in the grand, Islamic-style prime minister\u2019s office in Putrajaya, the administrative capital he helped design in the late 1990s. \u201cAny organization that had money, the previous government found the means to take the money.\u201dBut the claims of theft from national coffers extend beyond 1MDB to encompass an astonishing array of government-funded initiatives, from a rural development program and a plan for religious pilgrims to a provident fund and a coal mine in Mongolia.\u201cAll have been raped by the previous government,\u201d said Mr. Mahathir, who defected from the governing alliance two years ago. \u201cThey have taken money. Now they have lost the money.\u201dMr. Lim, an accountant and former banking executive, was equally direct. \u201cThey were just robbing the country blind,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m having nightmares practically every day, wondering what land mines will I tread on the following day.\u201dIf Mr. Mahathir\u2019s Alliance of Hope had not scored its surprise victory in the elections last month, Mr. Lim said, \u201cthe nation would have become a basket case.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe would be at a terminal stage.\u201dCoaxing the nation back to health depends on Mr. Mahathir, whose first tenure as prime minister was marked as much by his authoritarian impulses as his success in shepherding Malaysia\u2019s transformation into a upper-middle-income country. During his 22 years in power, Mr. Mahathir was accused by critics of playing race politics, muzzling the news media and locking up his enemies.Yet even Mr. Mahathir\u2019s former detractors contend that he is a changed man, cognizant of how unchecked power in the wrong hands can devastate a country.\u201cHe has mellowed, and unlike his first time in office, he has now realized that independent institutions are not a bad thing,\u201d said James Chin, the Malaysian-born director of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania. \u201cPreviously, he was all about centralization of power in the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201dThat assessment is shared by those whose political careers he once derailed. Mr. Lim, the current finance minister, was imprisoned twice during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s previous time in office.\u201cI think it\u2019s Mahathir version 2.0,\u201d Mr. Lim said of his new boss. \u201cI think it\u2019s very different from the version 1.0 we saw when he first became prime minister. He\u2019s more reformist.\u201dHe is also a man in a hurry. Mr. Mahathir is unquestionably Malaysia\u2019s most charismatic and popular politician, but he will turn 93 next month. Mr. Mahathir has committed to eventually handing power to Anwar Ibrahim, the longtime leader of the opposition who was in prison during the recent elections.\u201cHe\u2019s a man with a mission, driven by the need to get things done in the shortest possible time,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cHe\u2019s moving at a frenetic pace.\u201dBut Malaysia\u2019s political malaise cannot be traced only to the nine years that Mr. Najib was in power.\u201cThe state in which the country is today is not just the result of Najib Razak\u2019s misgovernance but also decades of populist politics and semi-authoritarian practices,\u201d said Sophie Lemi\u00e8re, a Malaysia specialist at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University.Mr. Mahathir acknowledged that cleansing a political machine riddled with corruption, not to mention aiding at least six national governments that are investigating missing 1MDB funds, has proved taxing. \u201cWe have asked so many people to resign we are left with a skeleton,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said.\u201cIt is obvious that he has stolen money,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said, indicating that his government had already accumulated \u201cenough evidence\u201d to have Mr. Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, put on trial. The two have been barred from leaving the country.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of seeking revenge,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said. \u201cIt is just the application of the rule of law.\u201dMr. Mahathir, long known as a workaholic, has kept to a schedule that would be punishing for a leader half his age. This week, he made his first foreign trip, to Japan, to court investors who could counter China\u2019s hold on the Malaysian economy. After returning late Tuesday, he woke up before dawn to pray. He has been fasting for the holy month of Ramadan.\u201cI have no plans to go and see him,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of Mr. Trump, whom he called \u201cvolatile.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can deal with a person who is so much like a chameleon.\u201dMr. Mahathir has already distanced himself from his vow to hand over power within two years to Mr. Anwar, his onetime deputy who was released last month from prison. After all, Mr. Mahathir joked, he had suggested that time frame only because some thought he might become senile at age 95.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it. It was done in the proper way,\u201d Mr. Mahathir insisted on Wednesday. \u201cIt was up to the judge to decide whether there was a case or not.\u201dMr. Lim, the finance minister, admitted that Mr. Mahathir had never expressed regret for jailing him \u2014 but also said it was vital not to let old grievances fester.\u201cI forgive, but that doesn\u2019t mean I will forget,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cI think the most important thing is to look forward.\u201dAs for Malaysia\u2019s new prime minister, who now has a rare opportunity to reshape his legacy, transform himself into a democratic icon and erase his strongman reputation, Mr. Mahathir refuses to engage in sentimentality.\u201cWhen you die, they rewrite your story,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I am not around, they can say what they like.\u201dDouglas Schorzman and Sharon Tan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Claiming \u2018Parallel State\u2019 Cabal, Romania\u2019s Leaders Target Anti-Corruption Prosecutor", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 The powerful leader of Romania\u2019s governing party \u2014 convicted of voter fraud, suspected of stealing millions of dollars of European Union funds, and soon to face a verdict in a case involving abuse of power \u2014 had a message for the more than 100,000 citizens who gathered in one of the capital\u2019s main squares recently: He is the victim.The pro-government demonstrators in Bucharest on June 9 were protesting what they call a \u201cparallel state\u201d in Romania that they say perverts the rule of law with the aid of the president and the chief anti-corruption prosecutor.If the anti-corruption forces could come for him, Liviu Dragnea, the leader of the governing Social Democratic Party, warned ominously, they could come for anyone.\u201cYou must not be under the illusion that only high-ranking officials or public servants will be the victims of denunciations and fake evidence,\u201d he told supporters. \u201cAbsolutely everyone today in Romania can be targeted by a denunciation which could lead to an arrest or conviction.\u201dThat fight is now in serious jeopardy, however, after a court ordered the dismissal of the country\u2019s top anti-corruption prosecutor and effectively removed safeguards that had been put in place to ensure that prosecutors and judges were protected from political pressure and retribution.The court ruling rests on a strict reading of the Constitution, and critics say the only way to preserve prosecutorial independence now may be to hold a referendum to change the Constitution itself.\u201cAfter the revolution, NATO and the E.U. said they would teach us democracy,\u201d Mr. Dragnea said in a nationally televised interview this month, referring to the 1989 uprising. \u201cThey should all assume this responsibility, because they\u2019ve encouraged and also financed this parallel state, this odious system.\u201dIt is a theme that has echoed across the region, from Budapest to Warsaw, from Bratislava to Prague. Even in Romania, where support for membership in the European Union runs deep, the governing party is using a familiar recipe to fire up supporters: promoting conspiracy theories, attacking the international financier and philanthropist George Soros for a litany of suspected sins, and painting critics of the governing party as puppets of a nefarious cabal.President Klaus Iohannis, a former leader of the opposition National Liberal Party, refused to follow that advice, so the case went to the Constitutional Court. It ruled on May 30 that Mr. Iohannis could not overrule the justice minister\u2019s recommendation. If he refuses to act, he will most likely be impeached.Mr. Iohannis, in a statement released on Tuesday, gave no indication of how he might respond, but he made it clear that he viewed the actions of the governing party as a threat to the country.\u201cWe cannot allow Romania to become a state that moves away from democratic values. We cannot accept magistrates being threatened and intimidated,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no parallel state in Romania.\u201dThe court decision did not just recommend the firing of Ms. Kovesi. It ruled that prosecutors fall under the authority of the Justice Ministry, which is controlled by political appointees. Critics fear that prosecutors who displease the governing party will be dismissed, and that those who remain will be intimidated from going after high-ranking officials.Now, she said, they are following the examples of Poland and Hungary \u2014 using legal means to undermine the rule of law itself.\u201cI am very skeptical that there will now be anything other than a politically controlled justice system,\u201d she said.Part of the problem, according to legal experts, rests in the country\u2019s Constitution, which was written in 1991, when memories were still fresh of a Communist regime that used the secret police and prosecutions to target political enemies. The power of prosecutors was deliberately curbed.\u201cRomania has always been on the outskirts of empires,\u201d Ms. Stefan said. \u201cAnd on the outskirts, you always have lawlessness and villains.\u201dIn the 1990s, many villains thrived. Corruption became so endemic that nearly every daily transaction \u2014 from driving a car to going to the doctor \u2014 was affected. Like death and taxes, bribery was a fact of life.But as Romania made a push for membership in NATO and the European Union in the early 2000s, tackling corruption became a top priority.Each year since Ms. Kovesi became chief prosecutor of the D.N.A. in 2013, about 1,200 people have been indicted on corruption charges, and 1,000 convicted. Among those charged have been 14 government ministers, 39 deputy ministers, 14 senators and one member of the European Parliament. The office has secured 27 convictions in those cases, with most of the rest still pending.Ms. Kovesi, who remains in her job while the president weighs her future, would not comment directly on the Constitutional Court ruling. But in an interview at the directorate, in the same building that served as the Romanian Army\u2019s command center in World War II, she defended her office.\u201cChanging mentalities is hard,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last five years have meant a lot for Romania.\u201dMs. Kovesi\u2019s hard charging, take-no-prisoners style has made her many enemies from across the political spectrum. As the heat on Mr. Dragnea increased, he pushed back more aggressively.\u201cBecause of our investigations, because of our convictions, during the past year and a half the pressure on our institution has certainly increased,\u201d Ms. Kovesi said. \u201cIf the independence of the prosecutor disappears \u2014 as it appears it now does \u2014 the job does not become more difficult,\u201d she said. It becomes, she added, impossible.Mr. Dragnea hoped that the June 9 rally would show that he had popular support for his campaign against the \u201cparallel state.\u201d But it was hardly an ordinary rally. Tens of thousands of people were bused in from across the country \u2014 many reportedly at the request of their bosses and local party leaders.It took Alexandra, 20, who would not give her family name, seven hours to get to Bucharest from Ludus. Asked why she had come, she said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know why we are here.\u201dParticipants were given signs, flags and stickers. Onstage, there were frequent condemnations of the \u201cdeep state.\u201dBut in a country where funds from the European Union are seen as important for economic growth, Mr. Dragnea also made a show of entering the rally to the strains of Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d the official anthem of the bloc.Senator Alina Gorghiu, a member of the opposition National Liberal Party, said that investors could turn their backs on the country if corruption were allowed to go unchecked.\u201cI believe the final battle will be won by the judiciary,\u201d she said in an interview in her party\u2019s office in the hulking Palace of Parliament, originally intended as the palace of the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.But Cristi Danilet, who has spent two decades in the judiciary and is a judge in the northern city of Cluj, was not so confident.\u201cIt is a very dangerous moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI am terrified about my future as an independent judge in the Romanian judiciary.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Arms an Adversary", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIn a word: Trumpian.In an era of American baby prisons and Melania meta-messaging, it can be difficult to pay attention to the things that used to matter. So here\u2019s a quick primer on our former ally Turkey, which on Sunday goes to the polls for presidential and parliamentary elections.Good news? Well, yes, there is some. Precisely because Erdogan has driven the economy off a cliff, there\u2019s a modest chance he\u2019ll have to face a runoff election next month, and a decent chance his A.K.P. party won\u2019t get a majority in Parliament. Opposition candidates are more united against Erdogan than they\u2019ve ever been, and they\u2019ve drawn huge numbers at their rallies.What\u2019s an American administration to do?Turkey poses honest quandaries for U.S. policymakers. Are we better off, to use Lyndon Johnson\u2019s line about J. Edgar Hoover, with Erdogan \u201cinside the tent, pissing out, than outside pissing in\u201d? Turkey dominates NATO\u2019s southern flank, and the air base at Incirlik has served a useful role in the fight against the Islamic State. There have been calls to kick Turkey out of the Alliance \u2014 exactly how isn\u2019t clear \u2014 which might be emotionally satisfying and morally justified. But it would do nothing to improve Ankara\u2019s domestic or international behavior and would probably worsen it.The F-35 was leverage. We just squandered it.Worse, we did it just days before the election, handing Erdogan a political prize that he can wield as evidence that the United States doesn\u2019t dare to oppose him and that he can continue to behave as he pleases. In the meantime, a country now moving into Russia\u2019s orbit will acquire one of the most sophisticated pieces of military hardware ever made.If and when Erdogan goes fully anti-American \u2014 he\u2019s already nine-tenths of the way there \u2014 what\u2019s to keep him from allowing Russian technicians to take a closer look, so they might gain a better idea of how to shoot it down? Or from using it against American allies in the region, including Israel? If Obama were making this delivery today, Republicans would call it treason.It will be a lucky thing for Turks if Erdogan fails to win another mandate for five more years of political, social and ethnic repression. Turkey is a beautiful country of remarkable people that could yet show that a Muslim state can also be prosperous, tolerant and democratic.Should that happen, history will record that the United States did nothing to help, and much to hinder, the forces of freedom. As with so much that the Trump administration does, it\u2019s not a surprise, but it\u2019s still a shock.Gail Collins is on book leave.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coming Tech Battle With China", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sharma is\u00a0the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Arriving in Beijing last month, I knew I would not be able to connect to Google, Facebook or Uber. As strange as it was to go without these staples of online life in the West, it was even stranger to find that local Chinese didn\u2019t seem to feel deprived at all. They search through Baidu, get their social media fix on WeChat, hail rides on Didi, curate news through sites like Toutiao. And while they know Beijing is watching, they accept this surveillance as normal.The Chinese government has carved out an alternative internet universe with its own brands, rules and culture, in which privacy doesn\u2019t exist. But its real ambition is to break out of this parallel universe and dominate not just the internet but the technology industry worldwide. To contain Beijing, the United States and its allies are fighting back with a campaign of technoprotectionism, opening a perilous new front in the global trade battles.President Trump is the unlikely leader of the fight against Chinese tech dominance. Widely seen as a champion of rust belt industries, he recently slapped heavy tariffs on all the leading aluminum and steel exporters, drawing fierce protests not only from China but also from American allies like Germany and Canada. But steel is a side show compared with the emerging tech battle with China.Technology will decide which country emerges as the world\u2019s dominant economic power in the long run. While about 20 percent of per-capita gross domestic product growth is driven by labor and capital, the remaining 80 percent is determined by how rapidly an economy is developing and applying new technology to increase production. China\u2019s ambition to catch up to Western living standards thus depends largely on how rapidly it can match or surpass Western technology.Mr. Trump is both accelerating and expanding trade battles that began before he took office. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries around the world began to restrict cross-border flows of trade, capital and migrants. Globalization\u2019s champions predicted that borders would continue to fall in at least one area \u2014 digital tech and the internet \u2014 but China has shown that a determined government can build walls in the virtual sphere, too.The president\u2019s tough stand on trade with China may be more popular than he is. The overwhelming consensus in the West is that Beijing is catching up illegitimately, by forcing companies that invest in China to share their best technology, or dispatching hackers to steal it. Though borrowing from the leading tech power is a standard development strategy \u2014 think of 19th-century America copying British industrial technology and Japan\u2019s great success replicating American technology \u2014 the scale and organization of China\u2019s campaign makes the threat feel new.Beijing has banned some foreign competitors like Google and Facebook outright, and regulated others so heavily that they have been compelled to sell themselves to Chinese rivals (Uber) or forced to consider pulling out of China (Amazon). In essence, China has created domestic internet monopolies that are generating enough cash in their vast local market to finance aggressive expansion abroad. I have been told, for example, that Toutiao already sells its novel content curating service to one in 10 Japanese.Last year Beijing rebranded the manufacturing centers of the Pearl River delta as the \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d and began urging the main cities there \u2014 Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong \u2014 to cooperate to become China\u2019s rival to Silicon Valley, which the Chinese would like to make the lesser Bay Area.In Beijing, the buzz was about how \u201cCreated in China\u201d is replacing \u201cMade in China,\u201d with some claiming that Shenzhen is now more innovative than Silicon Valley in key industries. Instead of just assembling simple goods from parts built elsewhere, China is now increasingly seen as a cutting-edge designer and developer of artificial intelligence, drones and other advanced technologies.Mr. Trump was willing to lift the ban on ZTE after the company paid a $1 billion fine and fired its top executives, but Congress was not. The Senate voted to reinstate the ban, which is likely to fuel trade battles to come. When I was in Beijing, many Chinese were talking about how the humiliation of ZTE was inspiring an official push to reduce China\u2019s dependence on the United States for semiconductors, software and other critical tech imports.The European Union recently imposed new data protection rules written largely to give consumers more control of information now in the hands of corporate giants like Facebook, but also to guard against the spread of a China-like surveillance state. The European Union is also pondering a new digital single market, in part to give European companies a market in which they have a chance to grow as large as Chinese rivals.This is how a digitally interconnected world could die by a thousand cuts, and technoprotectionism may get a further push during the next global downturn. From the United States to Europe and Japan, public debts are high and deficits are rising, which means these governments are poorly positioned to spend their way out of any slowdown. Central banks can\u2019t help much, either, since interest rates are still very low, with little room or reason to drop further right now. In this environment, governments may see protectionism as the only lever they have left to pull.For most of the postwar era, the consensus in support of free trade was so strong that governments rarely resorted to raising tariffs even when times were tough. The trade wars that broke out after 2008 have involved mainly nontariff or \u201cstealth\u201d trade barriers, including cheap state loans and subsidies for favored industries. But in the last two years, the rise of Mr. Trump and other antiglobal populists has given new currency to protectionism in all its forms, including technoprotectionism.The global financial markets had largely ignored the brewing trade battles, until recently. As the tariff threats grow in scale, and the battleground shifts from rust belt industries to new technologies, the markets are growing more skittish. So far, stocks have been hit harder in China than in the United States, but there will be no winners. The latest surveys of American investors and manufacturers show that their biggest concern is the threat of a trade war.The risks from deglobalization are growing. If the current skirmishes turn into a full-blown trade war, blame will fall heavily on the thousandth cut. But the real fault will lie with the 999 that came before.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Elites Recreate Burning Man Inside Their Living Rooms", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech elites who are looking for more than extra zeros in their bank statements are finding it in an unlikely place: so-called songversations, emotion-heavy gatherings that combine philosophical rap sessions with improvised music, run by a ukulele-strumming songstress who describes herself as a \u201cheartist.\u201d The tech A-list is a curious place to land for Ms. Magic, 37, who speaks in the soothing tones of a massage therapist and divides her time between Cardiff, Calif., and Bali, Indonesia. Until a few years ago, Ms. Magic ran a nonprofit for survivors of sexual trauma.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call this a breakthrough,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I got Peter Thiel to sing along and Elon Musk to smile.\u201d \u201cThe finance and tech scene is still riding the waves of hypermasculine values,\u201d she said. \u201cCoffee to get through the day, alcohol to wind down, then sleeping pills at night to turn off the mind from all that they have going on.\u201d\u201cPeople forget that they are human beings rather than human doings,\u201d she added. Enter the Soul Salon, which Ms. Magic calls \u201ca play date for your inner child\u201d and performs as a \u201cgift,\u201d she said (although guests are invited to \u201ccontribute in accordance with the value they feel they received\u201d). The salons usually start with a theme \u2014 say, the emptiness of consumer culture. As key phrases arise, Ms. Magic will begin strumming and humming, weaving those lines of dialogue into a lilting melody. The effect is vaguely akin to Joni Mitchell performing freestyle rap at Davos.As the extemporaneous song grows, others join in with musings of their own, call-and-response style. Not every captain of industry can carry a tune, of course, but that\u2019s not the point. As Ms. Magic likes to say, \u201cWe don\u2019t sing to be good, we sing to be free.\u201d \u201cFor people who live most of the time in their head,\u201d Mr. Hewitt said, \u201cthis feels like magic.\u201d Ms. Magic is now extending her song beyond Silicon Valley, with a 10-city tour (a mix of private salons and public events, starting at $35) stretching from the summer solstice to the fall equinox. Ms. Magic looked ready to jam with the \u201cExile on Main St.\u201d-era Rolling Stones, wearing skintight bell bottoms and platforms, and admitted to being nervous. \u201cOne of the reasons why I do what I do, and why I am, honestly, on this planet, is to show up with such a level of vulnerability and sincerity and authenticity, that it almost gives people permission to let it go for a little while,\u201d she said.When his monologue wound down, Ms. Magic rose and began a Norah Jones-style ballad, picking up phrases from Mr. Eisenstein\u2019s talk. \u201cIf we believed,\u201d she sang in a soulful jazz scat, \u201cthat me, that me, that me and the river were the same, would it change my ways?\u201d At first, the audience sat silent, seemingly puzzled. But slowly people began to clap their hands and sway to the beat. A man with a floppy hat and wizardlike robe began to gyrate wildly around the dance floor. \u201cIt\u2019s Burning Man in Chelsea,\u201d one observer said. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Head of Brazil\u2019s State Oil Company Resigns Amid Period of Unrest", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The top executive of Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s state oil company, resigned on Friday, fueling uncertainty about the future of the country\u2019s energy sector, a pillar of Brazil\u2019s economy that has drawn enormous interest from foreign investors in recent years.Critics said the government\u2019s move represented a return to the type of heavy-handed state meddling in oil prices that Mr. Parente had advised against when he took the helm of the company two years ago.Petrobras\u2019s fuel price policies have enormous impact in Brazil, a country of about 208 million people, because the company has a near monopoly on the refinery system. As the price of oil rose in recent months, and Brazil\u2019s currency dropped in value against the dollar, consumers began paying considerably more at the pump.Lawmakers across the political spectrum have been critical of Mr. Parente\u2019s market-tethered fuel price policies ahead of October\u2019s national elections.The company named Ivan Monteiro, its current finance director, as its interim chief executive on Friday night.Five days before the strike began, Petrobras hit an eight-year record market valuation of 388.8 billion Brazilian reais, or $103.7 billion. But since the beginning of the strike, it has lost over a third of its value.The company controls 90 percent of the oil and gas sector in Brazil, which in the past decade has represented roughly 2 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Mr. Parente\u2019s departure caused the company\u2019s stock price to plunge and is certain to chill investor interest in Brazil\u2019s oil sector, compounding broader uncertainty about the country\u2019s political future ahead of the presidential election, which is shaping up to be the most splintered and unpredictable in generations.\u201cClearly that freedom ended,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the signals the government has sent through these decisions are negative. They have created a new cloud of uncertainty about the future of Brazil\u2019s oil industry.\u201dThe truckers\u2019 strike and Mr. Parente\u2019s resignation underscored the political weakness of Mr. Temer, who over the past few days has made progressively larger concessions as the strike over oil prices transformed into a broader outcry over corruption and a lack of faith in the political elite.Mr. Parente\u2019s resignation came two days after Senator Vanessa Grazziotin proposed an inquiry into the company\u2019s fuel price policies. Ms. Grazziotin said international oil companies stood to benefit from the subsidies Mr. Temer authorized in recent days, which will divert funds that had been earmarked for health and education programs.\u201cWe\u2019re living a moment of what I would almost call social convulsion,\u201d Ms. Grazziotin said in an interview. \u201cThe government says the only way of reducing the price of fuel is by making the population pick up the tab.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a measure the Brazilian government took in response to a truckers\u2019 strike. The government agreed to subsidize only the cost of diesel, not the cost of diesel and gasoline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have We Lost Our Civic Consciousness?", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:It seems that David Brooks has found, in Steven Brill\u2019s new book on meritocracy, a new angle from which to view the roots of our country\u2019s myriad ills as primarily cultural and moral, instead of economic and political. A boomer myself, I see much gone astray, but I hesitate to ascribe our current state to the disappearance of some mythical sense of community and civic consciousness.These are red herrings, diversions from the realities (and evils) of the frequent wars, increasing economic inequality and political corruption that have marked America\u2019s trajectory, beginning in the early 1960s. The fragmentation that Mr. Brooks laments has little to do with the encouraging recent history of expanded educational opportunity and social freedom. Diversity is hardly the culprit.A pervasive spirit of community can grow only in a society that aims to provide fairly for all, which appears to be a receding goal in the present climate of untethered capitalism and political venality.G.L. LOMAX, SAN FRANCISCOTo the Editor:David Brooks admires our country\u2019s progress to a meritocracy, while clearly explaining its weaknesses. What we need, he claims, is \u201ca new ethos to reconfigure it.\u201d Actually, what we need is quite an old one: \u201cIf I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I? And if not now, when?\u201dAren\u2019t these concise questions from Hillel, the ancient Jewish sage, exactly what Mr. Brooks is recommending we ask ourselves now?To the Editor:Mr. Brooks, I take it you are talking about the baby boomer generation when you say \u201cus\u201d and \u201cwe.\u201d Born in the late 1960s, I am solidly Gen X. I did grow up understanding the importance of community, of working together, of having a life with meaning, not just money. I see the echoes of the boomer belief in independence and meritocracy in the millennials. They are incredibly focused on individual success as opposed to what is better for all.I am very hopeful that the new generation that is coming of age will begin to change what you boomers and your children have created. These young people, like the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students, are looking to make this a better world for all of us. I believe they will. Don\u2019t worry, we and they will clean up your mess.To the Editor:David Brooks asks why has so much talent produced such poor results. One answer is that the explosion of material gains in the second half of the 20th century, following the Great Depression and a world war, led to a misplaced sense of values, in which success was measured by the pursuit of wealth and its ostentatious display.If meritocracy was intended to replace a society based on inherited entitlement, then there had to be a way for the successful to proclaim their superiority. If they couldn\u2019t point to their ancestral tree to prove their worthiness, they had to show off the physical manifestations of their success: mega-mansions and vacation homes, luxury cars and private planes.If one were inclined to support worthy causes, how better than to have your name carved into the facade of a hospital building or an arts center to shout out your generosity? But meaningful investment in the community and its institutions, the sweat labor of day-to-day involvement in their activities, could be left to others.What does it matter if inequality rises, faith in institutions plummets, social trust declines, government becomes dysfunctional and our society is bitterly divided? The position of the educated elite atop the economic pyramid serves as testament to the elite\u2019s worthiness.To the Editor:David Brooks\u2019s excellent column neglects to mention the Vietnam War as a source of disillusion and disaffection on the part of the educated elite coming of age in the 1960s. The civil rights movement, which engaged the best of my generation, segued into the antiwar movement, which undermined trust in the government and the leaders who misled the public and exacted a high and bloody price in the lives of that generation.To the Editor:David Brooks ponders why American meritocracy has failed to deliver good government. How about this: While there may indeed be important exceptions (the sciences, for example), American meritocracy is largely a myth.Yes, opening the doors to women and minorities is great. But that in itself doesn\u2019t guarantee meritocracy any more than providing a choice of 50 flavors guarantees good ice cream.A century ago, artists needed talent to succeed. Now they are largely products of marketing machines. Rich dealers and collectors finance museum exhibitions to make the works of their chosen artists more valuable. Music has followed a similar downward spiral toward the lowest common denominator. University humanities departments have become something of a joke.I could provide many more examples, but one will suffice: Before concluding that America is a meritocracy, just look who\u2019s in the White House, and who\u2019s in the cabinet.WILLIAM COLE, SITGES, SPAINTo the Editor:I disagree with David Brooks on at least one point. The \u201ceducated elite\u201d did not lead to the rise of Donald Trump. Rather, Mr. Trump, his followers and the current dysfunctional government are the result of a last-gasp throwback to the time when, as Mr. Brooks describes, you \u201cclimbed the corporate ladder if you golfed at the right club\u201d \u2014 a time that Mr. Trump would like to return to.ELLYN ROTH, NEW YORKTo the Editor:David Brooks astutely lays out many reasons behind the recent weakening of the social bonds that hold us together as a society and the related loss of faith in our governing institutions. However, I was surprised to see no mention of the contribution to this trend made by the conservative movement, which has represented our guiding cultural and political philosophy over much of the past 40 years.It was, after all, Ronald Reagan who famously said, \u201cThe most terrifying words in the English language are \u2018I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u2019 \u201d While reasonable people can certainly disagree over the proper size and role of government, an ideology that constantly trumpets the importance of individuals working on behalf of their own personal ambition and denigrates the contributions of our civil servants is bound to have a detrimental effect on our view of these institutions over time.Government guided our country through the Great Depression, and with the help of the Greatest Generation won World War II. Surely, conservatives\u2019 more recent drumbeat of attacks on government is part of the story.David Brooks\u2019s explanation for \u201cThe Strange Failure of the Educated Elite\u201d is right about everything except the value of diversity, which he argues is a midpoint, not an endpoint, in establishing a more fair social system. But diversity is the loftiest of goals: Being able to understand someone radically different \u2014 and appreciate what you cannot know for yourself \u2014 is what art, philosophy and literature all help us do, sharpening our sensitivity to what is outside our own narrow experience.Building a government that recognizes this diversity, an economy that rewards it, a politics that honors it and a justice system that guarantees it are equally (and still not impossible) lofty goals.The writer is a professor and chairwoman of the English department at the City College of New York.Advertisement"}

One is in Sri Lanka, just a few hundred miles from India, a Chinese rival, and along a crucial commercial and military waterway.The Sri Lankan government took out ever-greater loans from Beijing to pay for the project, which feasibility studies correctly predicted wouldn\u2019t work.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Faces Its First Big Test: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Verizon names its next C.E.O.\u2022 The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief weighs in on the Fox battle\u2022 Trump will play the G-7 on his termsBut the real test is approaching.Next week, the Trump administration\u2019s fight with China \u2013 which could hit far more businesses than the tariffs on steel and aluminum now in effect \u2013 enters a crucial phase. The administration is scheduled to release on June 15 a final list of Chinese products covered by $50 billion of tariffs. It said that it will impose the tariffs shortly thereafter. China has threatened to retaliate.The Trump administration has two choices. It can settle for relatively unambitious gains and try to spin them as significant. Investors would welcome that outcome. Voters may, too. Alternatively, Mr. Trump can keep demanding big changes in China, and possibly plunge the U.S. into a drawn-out trade war. The imposition of the metals tariffs shows that he is willing to follow through. But it\u2019s still not clear how he will respond when his trade measures do significant harm to businesses or the financial markets.That moment may not be far away.-- Peter EavisReplacing him will be Hans Vestberg, currently the president of the company\u2019s global networks.\u2014 Michael de la MercedDuring his tenure as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam helped reshape the telecom giant \u2014 and part of that was through deal making. Not all of the transactions were particularly flashy, but they tended to follow one of two paths: Overhauling the company\u2019s network operations or building up its digital media division (which is now called Oath).Here are Verizon\u2019s top transactions since Mr. McAdam became C.E.O. in 2011, according to data from Thomson Reuters:\u2022 Verizon had asked Shari Redstone, the media company\u2019s controlling shareholder, if it would ever come up for sale, according to CBS\u2019s lawsuit against Ms. Redstone last month.\u2022 It briefly looked at buying the assets of Fox that Walt Disney ended up agreeing to acquire for $52.4 billion, including the 20th Century Fox movie studio and cable channels like FX.We\u2019ve looked at that over the years, and we made our decision to go digital. That\u2019s why we bought AOL and Yahoo, and we talk now about superchannels of sports and finance and news and some entertainment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn his seven years as Verizon\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. McAdam was known for his relentless focus on his company\u2019s wireless network and his aversion to striking big, splashy deals.As Verizon prepares for the telecom industry\u2019s future \u2014 where the only certain things are the rise of 5G wireless technology and online video streaming \u2014 here\u2019s what two research analysts think about what the company has done and where it\u2019s headed.Craig Moffett, MoffettNathansonMr. McAdam will be defined by the deals that he didn\u2019t do. Unlike AT&T \u2014 which paid nearly $50 billion for the satellite TV service DirecTV and is trying to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion \u2014 Verizon never struck splashy acquisitions, aside from those of Yahoo and AOL (combined purchase price: $9.2 billion).But that conservatism has worked in Verizon\u2019s favor. DirecTV has steadily lost customers in this age of cord-cutting, dragging down AT&T\u2019s financial health.\u201cI think he deserves a lot of credit for avoiding some of the traps that some of his peers have fallen into,\u201d Mr. Moffett said of Mr. McAdam.As for the fear underpinning many telecom companies\u2019 deal-making \u2014 that sticking to basic internet and phone service is boring \u2014 Mr. Moffett said Verizon has shown that worry to be unfounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about being a distribution channel?\u201d he told me. \u201cVerizon fully understood and embraced that there will always be a place for an advantaged network \u2014 and people will pay a premium for it.\u201dAmy Yong, MacquarieMr. McAdam\u2019s relentless focus on making Verizon\u2019s network the best in the U.S. has paid off handsomely, with the company earning a premium from investors based on the strength of its core business.The big question is whether that will be enough going forward, as rivals AT&T and T-Mobile pursue bold moves.Verizon\u2019s cautious strategy may ending up costing the company. Though AT&T\u2019s bet on wireless video streaming hasn\u2019t paid off yet, if it works, it will make that company a formidable creator and distributor of content. And T-Mobile and Sprint could prove to be a strong new rival if their proposed union works out.\u201cThe future is looking very different,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat worked in the past may not be what works in the future.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedA new report suggests that Apple is preparing to sell fewer phones later this year. It may sound worrying. But we\u2019ve seen similar news before, and the fallout is unlikely to be all that bad.But Apple\u2019s phones are getting more expensive, so every sale counts for more. And its services businesses \u2014 things like Music and Pay \u2014 are becoming an increasingly valuable revenue stream, meaning that the company can make more money off existing users even if they don\u2019t upgrade to the latest device.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe job faced by investigators of car collisions is getting more difficult as autonomous car features become more advanced, and the way they do their jobs might need to change to accommodate that.In March, a Tesla Model X collided with a concrete lane divider as it was driven down a highway in Mountain View, Calif. A new report by National Transportation Safety Board investigators suggested that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology played a role in the death of a Tesla owner.The driver was using the advanced driver assistance features traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer lane-keeping assistance, which Tesla refers to as \u201cautopilot.\u201d As the Tesla approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of US-101 from the SH-85 exit ramp, it moved to the left and entered the gore area. The Tesla continued traveling through the gore area and struck a previously damaged crash attenuator at a speed of about 71 mph.Information isn\u2019t recorded in most cars\u2019 event data recorders, the automotive equivalent of airplane black boxes. Instead, the boxes show more basic information such as steering-wheel input and throttle.While automakers commonly provide the information if it is requested by the vehicle owner, accident investigators\u2014typically contractors hired by insurance companies\u2014say they sometimes have to seek a court order to obtain crash data.An update to the rules published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could change that situation, by demanding that automakers log more details about the vehicle\u2019s behavior.The complexity of the mathematical calculations involved means it\u2019s not straightforward to take the network apart to understand how it makes its decisions. This can make unintended behavior hard to predict; and if failure does occur, it can be difficult to explain why. If a system misrecognizes an object in a photo, for instance, it may be hard (though not impossible) to know what feature of the image led to the error.Many artificial intelligence researchers are trying to develop ways to make it easier to understand the inner working of A.I. systems. But for now, that\u2019s likely to involve looking at complex computer code. That suggests that crash investigation teams, as well as the regulations that are applied to automakers, might require an update in the near future, too.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeComcast is threatening to challenge Walt Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox. Behind the scenes, it\u2019s playing down investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 fears of an antitrust response. We may have just gotten a clue about whether it\u2019s right.The head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, appears unruffled about a Disney-Fox deal, at least. From an interview at The Deal\u2019s conference yesterday:\u201cThey had good advice and carved out surgically what a transaction is that might be doable and who knows where that transaction leads.\u201dBut Mr. Delrahim also defended his team\u2019s effort to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, saying it was a merger of a kind that federal regulators had sought to block for decades. (A federal judge is expected to rule on the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against the deal on Tuesday.)Mr. Trump is the black sheep of this family, the estranged sibling who decided to pick fights with his relatives just before arriving to dinner. The dispute, Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, acknowledges, is \u201cmuch like a family quarrel.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 any of that will affect America\u2019s trade policies. But diplomatic tensions look set to rise, and economic uncertainty would rise with them.Elsewhere in trade:The Trump administration removed crippling penalties on the ailing Chinese telecom company in exchange for $1.4 billion in fines and other measures. But did some other big gain drive the deal?Getting Beijing to approve Qualcomm\u2019s takeover of another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors? Maybe. China\u2019s latest trade concessions, which were linked to the Trump administration not imposing certain tariffs?

Tweed, known to most everyone as Boss Tweed, loomed over Democratic politics for generations. Slowly, the grip of party leaders waned elsewhere. But in Queens, the machine rolled on \u2014 until Tuesday.If Representative Joseph Crowley\u2019s loss this week to a young insurgent candidate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, rattled the national Democratic Party, it did a great deal more to upend the political order in New York City, where Mr. Crowley was perhaps the last powerful party boss in a city once defined by them.Under Mr. Crowley, the Queens Democratic machine played local kingmaker, holding sway over judicial races, Surrogate\u2019s Court, even the speakership of the New York City Council. Very little of consequence seemed to occur in Queens politics that Mr. Crowley or his cohorts did not have a hand in.\u201cIt\u2019s the end of an era,\u201d said Councilman Daniel Dromm of Queens, the chairman of the finance committee, an influential position he garnered after aligning himself more closely with Mr. Crowley.The era of the party boss had long been on the wane across the nation. Gone are the days when James Michael Curley loomed over Boston, the Daleys dominated Chicago and E.H. Crump controlled Memphis.\u201cCrowley is a perfect example,\u201d Mr. Sabato added. \u201cHe grew up in another time and another way of doing business.\u201dBut faced with an energetic challenge for the first time in years, he could not help himself.The loss sent reverberations throughout local races.Insurgent candidates running for state offices and those who have bucked the county organization in the past rejoiced. Party officials licked their wounds and privately bemoaned the defeat by an upstart challenger who dared to run a primary campaign.The aftermath could also be seen in more public gestures: On Thursday, the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, announced he would back four upstart challengers to Democratic incumbents in State Senate primary races this September. Mr. Johnson said the endorsements had been planned before Tuesday\u2019s election results were known. But it was a move that Mr. Johnson might not have done in such an overt way out of deference to Mr. Crowley, whose support was critical in landing Mr. Johnson his role as speaker.\u201cClearly the Democratic base is extremely angry, hungering for change and they showed that,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He waxed philosophical when asked about Mr. Crowley\u2019s defeat. \u201cIn the political world, one day you\u2019re up, the next day you\u2019re down,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitics is cyclical; life is cyclical.\u201d\u201cThe Queens machine was part of the coalition that put Ed Koch in office,\u201d said Michael Krasner, a professor of political science at Queens College. \u201cThey were extremely influential in terms of nominations, elections and also in terms of land-use decisions.\u201d\u201cIn Manhattan and Brooklyn there are often primaries for Surrogate\u2019s Court. In Queens, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a primary,\u201d said Jerry Skurnik, a veteran Democratic political consultant. \u201cWhoever the county organization has wanted has been elected, unopposed, as long as I remember, at least since the 1970s.\u201d Much the same goes for civil court judges, he said.\u201cThere is a very significant losing streak here,\u201d said Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Democrat who bucked the party leadership with his own run in 2009 and whose district voted heavily in favor of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.\u201cIf it couldn\u2019t mobilize for the chairman of the Democratic Party,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said of the Queens county machine, \u201cwho is it going to mobilize for?\u201dMr. Crowley\u2019s organization appeared to have been regaining some of its influence last year: It secured its pick for Council speaker and brought a reluctant mayor along with its choice. Mr. de Blasio backed Mr. Crowley for re-election, albeit mostly from the sidelines.Indeed, the party apparatus, built in large measure around the Queens law firm, remains intact. For that to change, elected officials and political consultants said, challengers would need to emerge to defeat local district leaders and then chose their own chairman.Mr. Sweeney, the firm\u2019s partner and party official, declined to discuss the ramifications of Mr. Crowley\u2019s defeat on the party. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost elections before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was a bit of a surprise.\u201dMr. Crowley\u2019s defeat underscored how candidates, angry at the status quo and looking for change, increasingly are not content to wait their turn \u2014 and are less fearful of the party than they might have been a decade ago.\u201cI am running against the machine,\u201d said Jessica Ramos, a former City Hall aide who is challenging an incumbent state senator, Jose Peralta, in Jackson Heights, Queens, in the September primary.\u201cThere is an awakened giant,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Democratic Party is changing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The round is set to be led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and will include other investors such as Accel Partners, the people said.The financing would cap one of the fastest and largest start-up fund-raising frenzies in recent memory. Last month, Bird began raising $150 million at a $1 billion valuation, which quickly rocketed higher because of investor interest, according to one person. Bird, which was founded by Travis VanderZanden, a former executive at Uber and Lyft, in September, had previously raised $15 million in February and $100 million in March.Many investors in Silicon Valley are eager to put their money into another transportation opportunity after the success of ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft. Electric scooters have burst onto the streets of several American cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. Bird is at the head of the pack, with rivals, including Spin and LimeBike, also piquing investors\u2019 interest. Before this latest investment rush, the companies had already raised more than $250 million in venture capital in total.Consumers can use the Bird app to find and, for a per-minute fee, ride the electric scooters, dropping them wherever their trip ends. A small ecosystem of scooter \u201cchargers\u201d rove the streets at night to pick up the scooters and recharge them, collecting a bounty per scooter.The company, which is based in Venice, Calif., has bucked officials in several cities as it rolls out thousands of scooters across the country, scattering them on public sidewalks and wreaking urban havoc, causing both delight and frustration among residents.Bird\u2019s strategy and fund-raising bonanza are reminiscent of the days when Uber and Airbnb clashed ferociously with American cities as they fought to flood the market. The playbook is to become ubiquitous and popular with consumers overnight so that city regulators have a harder time banning the product and instead have to negotiate rules.In an interview in April, Mr. VanderZanden said he saw his electric scooters becoming the dominant in-city transportation solution.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be happy till there are more Birds than cars,\u201d he said.The capsule summary with an earlier version of this article misstated the amount that the electric scooter start-up Bird is said to be raising.

{"Headline": "James H. Tully Jr., Former New York State Tax Chief, Dies at 87", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames H. Tully Jr., a former New York finance commissioner who challenged neighboring states for siphoning off New York revenue, pursued corporations that took tax deductions for bribes they had paid, and helped New York City recover from its fiscal crisis, died on June 10 in Albany. He was 87.The cause was non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, his son, James, said.Mr. Tully was the New York State commissioner of taxation and finance from 1975 to 1982. He presided during New York City\u2019s fiscal crisis, becoming, in effect, the custodian of the city\u2019s sales tax revenue. That money had been pledged to pay the debt of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, an agency created to borrow funds on behalf of New York City after major banks had refused to give it any more loans.Mr. Tully was appointed by Gov. Hugh L. Carey, a Brooklyn neighbor and friend. Mr. Tully had been chairman of Citizens for Carey, a campaign committee that helped elect him governor in 1974.In naming him to the post, Mr. Carey, a Democrat, had demanded more vigorous enforcement of the state\u2019s tax laws, and Mr. Tully faithfully followed his mandate, starting with the governor himself: He billed him $572.33 in back state and city income taxes for the free rides his children had taken on a state-owned aircraft.In a joint investigation with the state attorney general, Mr. Tully\u2019s office also lodged charges against Martin Carey, the governor\u2019s brother, for evading about $122,000 in sales taxes on gasoline sold at a chain of gas stations he once controlled on Long Island. But in 1983, a state court ruled that Mr. Carey could not be prosecuted because he had been granted immunity for testifying about the investigaton before a grand jury in 1980.Earlier, Mr. Tully\u2019s office found that a number of corporations based in New York that been investigated by the federal authorities for paying foreign officials bribes and kickbacks had then deducted those payments from their state taxes.Mr. Tully, in announcing that the state had recouped millions of dollars, estimated that about a fourth of the companies had voluntarily paid the taxes and penalties once the investigation had begun.In 1982, Connecticut tax officials agreed to let New York audit Connecticut companies in a crackdown on businesses that sold goods to out-of-state residents without collecting sales taxes. Connecticut officials were similarly empowered to audit New York companies.In 1983 under Mr. Tully, New York won a lawsuit against a New Jersey tax on New Yorkers who commuted to jobs in New Jersey. That state\u2019s highest court ruled that the tax interfered with New Yorkers\u2019 \u201cconstitutionally protected right to pursue an occupation outside their home state.\u201dNew Jersey imposed the tax to offset the cost of New York riders on its transit system, but the court said that their impact was minimal. Because New York grants residents a credit on taxes paid elsewhere, New Jersey, in effect, was raiding New York\u2019s revenue, the court said.James Henry Tully Jr. was born in Brooklyn on May 19, 1931, to James Sr., a lawyer, and Mary (Dobbins) Tully. He graduated from Georgetown University and New York Law School, practiced law in a Midtown Manhattan firm, where he specialized in estate taxes, and served briefly in the New York State Assembly.He retired last year as a member of the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal, of which he had previously served as president. The tribunal adjudicates grievances by the public. He died at Albany Medical Center.Besides his son, Mr. Tully is survived by his wife, Eileen (Conway) Tully; their daughters, Anne Murphy, Dr. Lauren Tully, Susan Tully Abdo and Kathleen Cronin; a sister, Dr. Marie Louise Johnson; his brothers Martin, William and Dr. Robert Tully; and 10 grandchildren.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Interview Magazine Caper", "Date": "2018-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAndy Warhol\u2019s magazine is dead. No wait, it\u2019s back! Inside Peter Brant\u2019s latest magic trick. With folks clamoring for payment, it wasn\u2019t that surprising when Interview\u2019s employees were summoned to their SoHo offices in May and told the magazine was folding. Its parent company, Brant Publications, was filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, with close to 300 unpaid creditors \u2014 including Mr. Baron, who earlier that month sued the company to recover his money.According to Mr. Brant, who would agree to speak with The New York Times only by email, the magazine \u201ccould not survive the sea change in its industry.\u201dHe said that Interview magazine is a \u201cseparate legal entity\u201d from himself and added that he put $7 million of his own money into the magazine over the last decade alone \u2014 making him its \u201cbiggest creditor.\u201dAnd the Brant family\u2019s involvement with Interview may not be over.This was a strangely confident assertion. To assume ownership of the bankrupt magazine, Crystal Ball Media likely will have to earn the support of a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. In all likelihood, Crystal Ball will have to to outbid other prospective buyers. But Mr. Baron was infuriated that a Brant might again run Interview when Mr. Brant\u2019s company ignored months of prodding to pay him his money.In a statement, Mr. Baron\u2019s spokesman, Zak Rosenfield, said: \u201cPeter Brant has proven to be an exploitive and dishonorable businessman who considers himself above the law, with his stewardship of Interview magazine the most recent example. It is now abundantly clear that Interview was kept afloat for decades because of half-truths, unkept promises and his exploitation of the passions and pocketbooks of contributors and staffers, some with meager means, who were eager to carry on the Warhol vision.\u201d For a magazine whose paid circulation hovered around 230,000 at its peak, Interview had an outsize footprint. Warhol first published it in 1969 and used to stroll down Madison Avenue handing copies to passers-by. He threw parties for it at Studio 54. He carried a tape recorder in his pocket, which he used to supply Interview with content.It was first populated with film reviews by college kids. But Warhol\u2019s pop culture leanings, his ambitions to get fashion advertisers, and his interest in politics quickly seeped into the magazine.From 1975 to 1983, Interview was edited by Bob Colacello. Although Mr. Colacello eventually went on to work for Tina Brown at Vanity Fair, one of his biggest pet peeves is reading that she created \u201cthe mix.\u201d\u201cShe mainstreamed it, but the truth is that we invented it at Interview,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a reflection of Andy\u2019s social life, which in any given week might include encounters with Bianca Jagger, Nelson Rockefeller, Valentino, Roy Lichtenstein and on and on and on.\u201dWarhol said this \u201c10 times every five minutes,\u201d said Ms. Furstenberg. Others found that phony. Ms. Lebowitz said she stayed distant because she was convinced he was \u201cnot a good influence on the young.\u201dWarhol could also be deeply cynical. Ms. Blond owns a May 1986 copy of Interview with Tom Cruise on the cover. Warhol had drawn a penis dangling from his mouth.She\u2019d save it, wisely. Others were not as careful. From 1978 to 1981, Ms. Lebowitz was paid entirely in art. \u201cLet me assure you \u2014 it was worth nothing then,\u201d she said. \u201cI sold all my Warhols two weeks before he died for virtually zero. And I believe that\u2019s why he died.\u201dWhen people gossip about Peter Brant, and they have been doing that for more than 30 years, a few incidents come up repeatedly.In 1986, the United States Polo Association banned him from play after he reportedly challenged an umpire to a fist fight. He filed a $30 million antitrust lawsuit against the organization and lost.In 1990, he paid the government hundreds of thousands of dollars after being convicted of a misdemeanor for failing to keep adequate tax records. This included billing personal expenses such as silk sheets, massages, and scalp treatments to his newsprint companies. He spent 84 days in jail, which was surprising to Ms. Lebowitz only because \u201cmost rich people don\u2019t pay their taxes and manage to avoid going to jail.\u201dWhile Mr. Brant was in college at the University of Colorado, he met his first wife and began using his family\u2019s money to buy art. That led to a meeting with Warhol and an investment in his magazine.For a while, Warhol and the Brants were close. They traveled to Paris and shopped for art deco furniture together. Ms. Brant took a job at Interview as its advertising director.\u201cThey were unique among contemporary collectors in that their interest wasn\u2019t just about art,\u201d Mr. Colacello said. \u201cIt was architecture, landscaping, decorating and fashion. They really had an aesthetic approach across the board. They were a great couple. And they had great taste.\u201dMr. Brant pressed Warhol and his colleagues to keep costs down. \u201cHe would question why we paid our bills so quickly,\u201d Mr. Colacello said. \u201cI said, \u2018We pay everyone within 90 days.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, no, no. You pay when the lawyers call.\u2019\u201d A rift developed. \u201cHe was a tough businessman and Andy wanted control,\u201d said Vincent Fremont, who worked for Warhol and later for Mr. Brant. Warhol refused, so Mr. Hughes stepped in and gambled his savings on the film. It lost a pile of dough and everyone felt burned. Mr. Brant began auctioning off his Warhols. But Mr. Brant is also the \u201ctype of person,\u201d Mr. Allen said, \u201cwho will give you his wallet and then get in a fight with you over a quarter.\u201dAnd ultimately, Mr. Brant didn\u2019t spend $12 million on Interview. The Brants first big move as the magazine\u2019s new owners was to install Ingrid Sischy, previously of Art Forum, as its new editor. Soon after she was hired, Mr. Brant went to jail. His marriage also ended. He started seeing Ms. Seymour, and Ms. Brant took up with Ms. Sischy, whose gifts as a social connector earned her a reputation as a modern-day Gertrude Stein.In 2003, Mr. Brant was accused of tax fraud in a civil suit by James Comey, then the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The art dealer Larry Gagosian and Mr. Brant, the charges said, set up a shell company to buy and sell art. After earning $17 million, the men declared the company bankrupt. Mr. Brant wound up contributing to a $9.1 million settlement with the government. Outwardly, Ms. Brant and Mr. Brant enjoyed a progressive divorce. But there were tensions, according to friends of the couple.As the marriage between Ms. Seymour and Mr. Brant turned into what one friend called a \u201cmansion on fire,\u201d Ms. Sischy and Ms. Brant decided it was time to gain some independence.They approached various publishers about buying Mr. Brant\u2019s stake in Interview. But ultimately, they sold themselves: In 2008, Mr. Brant gave them $15 million for their stake in the magazine and Cond\u00e9 Nast hired them to be roving international editors.With their departure, bills stopped getting paid on time. Mr. Allen said it was more likely inefficiency than malevolent intent. \u201cSandy ran a tight ship,\u201d he said. Mr. Baron had spent the previous decade working with Carine Roitfeld at French Vogue, turning it into a commercial and critical success. He also runs a creative agency, Baron & Baron, which directs ad campaigns for major fashion brands. (There is no other Baron.)Just a year after being hired, Mr. Baron left the magazine (with $527,389 owed to him, according to 2009 emails from his office to Brant Publications.) Mr. Brant\u2019s son Ryan took over as Interview\u2019s president. He had little experience in publishing and was also on probation, having pleaded guilty in 2007 to backdating stock options at a video game company.Meanwhile, Mr. Brant was having problems of his own, including a 2010-11 bankruptcy at his paper and newsprint companies. Being a paper magnate is not what it once was.Over the next few years, high-end photographers came aboard because of Mr. Baron. Celebrities followed for edgy pictures, the kind Cond\u00e9 Nast didn\u2019t generally publish in the United States. Mr. Baron quietly told colleagues to insist on being paid in advance.Sometimes that worked. In 2016, Interview\u2019s president, Dan Ragone, sued for $170,000 in unpaid wages. In 2017, associate publisher Jane Katz followed suit, demanding $230,000 in back pay. Those cases remain unsettled.The payments never came and the bill grew by $100,000. In February of this year, Interview was thrown out of its SoHo offices temporarily over unpaid rent. \u201cI do not have a history of not paying my debts,\u201d said Mr. Brant in an email to the Times, adding that he feels badly \u201cfor anyone that lost money due to Interview Inc.\u2019s bankruptcy.\u201d But those circumstances do provide added opportunity for outrage. \u201cTo announce plans to relaunch the magazine free of that debt in three months, with his daughter at the helm, is not only sinister, but a premeditated sham,\u201d said Mr. Rosenfield, the rep for Mr. Baron. Ms. Lebowitz simply shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t have as much faith in rich people as other people seem to have,\u201d she said. \u201cMorals and aesthetics are not related. Surely you\u2019ve noticed.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E-Commerce Might Help Solve the Mystery of Low Inflation", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is sinking and businesses are churning out more goods and services. Yet even with the economy standing on tippy toes, prices and wages are climbing a lot more slowly than anyone has expected.The studies reinforce the views of Federal Reserve officials who see the internet\u2019s increasing influence as a leading suspect in a continuing mystery: why inflation routinely falls short of their 2 percent target, considered the sweet spot for keeping the economy humming without overheating.But some of the latest findings suggest that those fears could be unfounded \u2014 and that the official statistics are overstating inflation.An analysis of that information by Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago and Peter Klenow of Stanford found that prices for goods sold on the internet rose much more slowly from 2014 to 2017 than indicated by barometers like the Consumer Price Index, or C.P.I.Online prices of personal computers fell by 12.3 percent, for example, but the C.P.I. showed just a 6.9 percent drop. Toy prices online slumped 12 percent, while the C.P.I. put the drop at just 7.8 percent. Online prices for photographic equipment and supplies fell 9.2 percent compared with the 0.6 percent decline registered by the official measure.\u201cPrices are going down a whole lot faster than the C.P.I. shows for the same things,\u201d he said.New online research offers more evidence that \u201cthe more efficient method of selling through e-commerce is holding inflation down compared to what it would have been otherwise,\u201d said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.Figuring out just how much of an impact online shopping has had on inflation, however, remains a challenge.The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which calculate those two measures, look at a typical basket of goods and sample prices, at times adding or eliminating items, like food and energy, that can vary widely from one month to the next.Even with thousands of price inspectors, the government can sample only a tiny portion of goods and services sold across the country. The traditional measures are also not well suited to take account of the constant introduction of new and upgraded products \u2014 like Instapots and athleisure yoga pants.Cellphones, for example, were not included in the C.P.I. until 1996, when about 40 million Americans, or 15 percent of the population at the time, were already using them. In many cases, prices for those new goods \u2014 like computers \u2014 plunge over time, but price indexes fail to capture the change.Putting aside apparel, where designers offer new fashions every season, the research found that 44 percent of the products sold online did not exist in the previous year. And nearly a quarter disappeared from one year to the next.\u201cWhat we have never had before is the quantity of stuff online,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said. Online spending now accounts for 10 percent of all retail spending, and in some categories 50 percent.This isn\u2019t the first time innovations in shopping have upended pricing structures. Over time, the introduction of the Sears catalog similarly held down prices compared with the small, local stores where people had always shopped, said Mr. Gordon, the Northwestern economist.Stephen Reed, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that \u201cwe constantly re-evaluate our methods and consider new research.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen and Jim Tankersley on Twitter: @PatcohenNYT and @jimtankersleyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russians Offered Business Deals to Brexit\u2019s Biggest Backer", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Arron Banks, a British financier who bankrolled the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, has long bragged about his \u201cboozy six-hour lunch\u201d with the Russian ambassador eight months before the vote.Some also wondered about Mr. Banks\u2019s Russian-born wife and their custom license plate, X MI5 SPY, after the British intelligence agency, MI5. But Mr. Banks always laughed off questions about his ties to the Kremlin.Now, a leaked record of some of Mr. Banks\u2019s emails suggest that he and his closest adviser had a more engaged relationship with Russian diplomats than he has disclosed.While Mr. Banks was spending more than eight million British pounds to promote a break with the European Union \u2014 an outcome the Russians eagerly hoped for \u2014 his contacts at the Russian Embassy in London were opening the door to at least three potentially lucrative investment opportunities in Russian-owned gold or diamond mines.In Washington, the investigators for the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III, and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have also obtained records of Mr. Banks\u2019s communications, including some with Russian diplomats and about Russian business deals.And they have taken a special interest in close ties Mr. Banks and other Brexit leaders built to the Trump campaign.On Nov. 12, 2016, Mr. Banks met President-elect Trump in Trump Tower. Upon his return to London, Mr. Banks had another lunch with the Russian ambassador where they discussed the Trump visit.\u201cFrom what we\u2019ve seen, the parallels between the Russian intervention in Brexit and the Russian intervention in the Trump campaign appear to be extraordinary,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.\u201cThe Russians were apparently dangling gold mines and diamond mines and financial incentives behind one of the largest backers of Brexit,\u201d he added.Earlier this month, Mr. Banks testified before a committee of Parliament in part to answer questions about his Russian ties. He acknowledged having had three meetings \u2014 \u201ctwo lunches and a cup of tea,\u201d as he later said in interviews \u2014 with the Russian ambassador, Alexander V. Yakovenko, rather than just the famous boozy lunch.He also acknowledged reports that the ambassador had invited him to invest in the consolidation of six Russian gold mines, an offer he said he ultimately declined.But in his testimony, Mr. Banks did not mention the two other potentially lucrative opportunities detailed in the broader record of his electronic communications.One involved a state-controlled Russian diamond mining giant, Alrosa. The other involved a Russian businessman \u2014 described in an email to Mr. Banks as \u201ca mini oligarch\u201d \u2014 and a gold mine in Conakry, Guinea.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Banks acknowledged that these other business deals were proposed to him, but he said that he never acted on them. He denied any wrongdoing, noting that his opposition to the European Union long predated his meeting with the Russian ambassador.He argued that any business discussions that emerged from those meetings were insignificant because he had never \u201cdone any Russian deals,\u201d so \u201cafter the wholesale theft of my emails, there is still no smoking gun there.\u201dBut Damian Collins, who is chairman of the parliamentary committee investigating the potential Russian use of disinformation to influence the Brexit vote, said he had seen a record of the messages about the potential Russian mining investments and questioned Russian intentions toward Mr. Banks.\u201cThe question is, Why would the Russians do this for Banks?\u201d Mr. Collins asked in an interview. \u201cWhat it looks like is that Russia decided he was someone they wanted to do business with and they wanted to see prosper and succeed \u2014 and Banks, alongside that, wanted to hide the extent of his contacts with the Russians.\u201dWith no college degree, Mr. Banks first became wealthy by starting insurance companies that sold policies to motorcycle riders and van drivers. He now owns a complicated network of insurance and finance enterprises as well as a few diamond mines in South Africa, where his father operated sugar plantations.He first rose in prominence in Britain through his role in the campaign to leave the European Union, and he has published a campaign memoir, \u201cThe Bad Boys of Brexit.\u201dSome of his emails were first leaked earlier this month to the British press. But the broader record of his messages, described this week to The New York Times by several people who had read them, revealed the new disclosures about Mr. Banks\u2019s more extensive Russian business dealings.In the Friday interview, Mr. Banks eventually admitted to a fourth meeting with the Russian ambassador, though he described the earlier account he gave to Parliament of two lunches and a cup of tea as \u201crelatively accurate.\u201dHe said his emails might have created the impression of more extensive contacts because of the many exchanges that his media adviser, Andrew Wigmore, had conducted with Russian diplomats to set up meetings, or about attending embassy events.\u201cI have not denied that we had a friendly relationship\u201d with the ambassador, Mr. Banks said.He added: \u201cIt is completely natural that a diplomat would put you in touch with another businessman. That is how trade works.\u201dThe first contacts between Mr. Banks and the Russian Embassy came in September 2015, during a conference for the pro-Brexit United Kingdom Independent Party, or UKIP.He and Mr. Wigmore met a Russian diplomat, Alexander Udod, who was later among a list of 23 suspected spies expelled from Britain after the recent poisoning of a former Russia spy, Sergei V. Skripal, on British soil.In the interview, Mr. Banks said he and Mr. Wigmore had asked Mr. Udod if they could meet the ambassador, \u201cbecause we thought it would be interesting.\u201dAt the first meeting with the ambassador, over lunch, Mr. Banks recalled in his memoir, the ambassador served him a special bottle of vodka that he claimed was made for Stalin.In the interview, Mr. Banks said that at the lunch, he had volunteered that he owned diamond mines in South Africa. The ambassador then invited him for another meeting later that month to introduce him to a Russian businessman who was offering a chance to invest in a proposed consolidation of six Russian gold mines.\u201cI am very bullish on gold so keen to have a look,\u201d Mr. Banks wrote afterward in an email to the Russian businessman, Siman Povarenkin.Mr. Banks was interested enough that he sought the advice of Nick van den Brul, an investment banker familiar with Russian gold and diamond mines. In January 2016, Mr. Banks wrote Mr. van der Brul an email about \u201cthe gold play.\u201d\u201cI intend to pop in and see the ambassador as well,\u201d Mr. Banks wrote. He sent a copy of the email to Mr. Udod, the diplomat later expelled for spying.Mr. Banks said he never participated in that gold deal.But it appears that Mr. Povarenkin offered him a different Russian opportunity \u2014 with the diamond company Alrosa.The Russian government, the largest shareholder in the company, was preparing to sell off a 10 percent stake. On Jan. 16, 2016, an investment adviser working for Mr. Banks wrote Mr. Povarenkin that Mr. Banks\u2019s team had \u201cnot forgotten about your Alrosa project,\u201d according to people who have reviewed records of the emails.A few days later, Mr. van den Brul, the same investment banker that Mr. Banks had consulted to discuss the gold deal, emailed him separately about the diamond opportunity.In interviews earlier this week, Mr. Banks initially said he knew nothing about the Alrosa project. Then he later said he remembered hearing about it from the investment banker but did not pursue it.An investment fund associated with his friend, business partner and fellow Brexit backer, James Mellon, did participate.Mr. Mellon, a prominent investor based in the Isle of Man, is a partner with Mr. Banks in a financial institution on the island. Mr. Mellon has made hundreds of millions of dollars investing in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, often alongside businessmen close to President Vladimir V. Putin.Mr. Mellon had introduced Mr. Banks to Nigel Farage, a strident crusader against the European Union who became the chief beneficiary of Mr. Banks\u2019s contributions during the Brexit campaign.Three weeks after the 2016 Brexit vote, the Russian government sold the Alrosa stake in a private offering to a restricted group of investors. The shares were sold at a discount to the market price at a time when the value of both the stock and diamonds were rising.Denham Eke, a representative for Mr. Mellon, said that Mr. Mellon had stepped out of day-to-day management of Charlemagne, and that any investment decisions were made by a formal committee.He added that Mr. Mellon\u2019s business investments in Russia were unrelated to his opposition to the European Union or to Mr. Banks.The third Russian investment opportunity surfaced in April 2016, as the Brexit campaign was heating up.Another investment banker with connections in Russia wrote to Mr. Banks about the possible sale of a gold mine in Conakry, Guinea. The owner was a Russian \u201cmini-oligarch\u201d who \u201cshares your passion for the yellow metal,\u201d the banker wrote, according to people who have reviewed a record of the email.In the Friday interview, Mr. Banks initially said that he had no memory of such a discussion but later called back to acknowledge a meeting on May 10, 2016, that appears to have included a discussion of the Guinean mine.Mr. Banks said he did not invest in that mine either.The Brexit vote took place a little more than a month later, on June 23, 2016.In August, Mr. Banks had lunch with the Russian ambassador and discussed the Trump campaign. At their lunch after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November, the two men discussed what role Jeff Sessions, then a senator, might play in the cabinet, according to people who have reviewed the records of his emails.Mr. Banks, though, said he doubted that the Russians had cultivated him for reasons other than routine trade promotion.\u201cThe idea that things were dangled as some sort of carrots for me to be involved with the Russians is very far-fetched,\u201d he said. \u201cI wonder what the Russians wanted from me?\u201dAn article on June 29 about Russian business proposals to a major donor backing a British exit from the European Union referred incompletely to an investment fund\u2019s participation in the Russian diamond giant Alrosa. Since publication of the article, representatives of the British financier Jim Mellon have said that a fund managed by a company he founded, Charlemagne Capital, had invested in an initial public offering of shares in Alrosa by the Russian government in 2013. The article reported only a later investment by a Charlemagne fund in a secondary private placement of shares in Alrosa by the Russian government in 2016, shortly after the referendum to leave the European Union.David D. Kirkpatrick reported from London, and Matthew Rosenberg from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democratic Women Are Running for Governor. Men and Money Stand in Their Way.", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 When Chris Giunchigliani told former Senator Harry Reid about her plans to run for governor of Nevada in 2018, he candidly told her that he thought her opponent, Steve Sisolak, would make a stronger candidate, Ms. Giunchigliani recently recalled.Mr. Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader, was even blunter when he warned the president of Emily\u2019s List, Stephanie Schriock, that the Democratic women\u2019s group would be inviting disaster if they spent heavily for Ms. Giunchigliani, according to two Democrats who described the private conversation on condition of anonymity.Were Ms. Giunchigliani, a veteran officeholder and outspoken liberal, to be nominated, Mr. Reid said, the casino executives who dominate Nevada politics would not only throw their support to Adam Laxalt, the likely Republican candidate for governor \u2014 they would also work to wrest control of the state Legislature away from Democrats.His plea fell on deaf ears. Emily\u2019s List polled the race, found Ms. Giunchigliani could be competitive and has spent about $2 million on her candidacy, lifting her into contention. Ms. Giunchigliani now faces an uphill primary election here on Tuesday against the better-funded Mr. Sisolak \u2014 and while Mr. Reid was focused on ideology, she attributes some of the resistance to her campaign to her gender.\u201cIt takes a lot of work to prove to people that you have that credential,\u201d Ms. Giunchigliani said, recounting her years in the Legislature, on the Clark County Commission and a stint as head of the Nevada Education Association. Riding in an aide\u2019s Ford Escape last week, between an hour of evening canvassing in searing heat and a reception with gay and lesbian supporters, Ms. Giunchigliani argued, \u201cSometimes a man can just say, \u2018I\u2019m a businessman\u2019 whether they are or aren\u2019t. And no one questions that, whereas a woman has to still prove it.\u201dFrom Tuesday through September, female candidates for governor will be on the ballot in Democratic primaries across 17 states, including pivotal battlegrounds such as Florida, Wisconsin and Colorado \u2014 part of the record number of women running for governor this year. In interviews, several said they are facing entrenched resistance to female power at the executive level, and male opponents with deeper campaign coffers and, in some cases, far less political experience.Far from the Nevada desert, Maine\u2019s attorney general, Janet Mills, delivered a more bluntly feminist message on Friday. Ms. Mills began her campaign for governor as a front-runner but has faced difficult competition from both male and female opponents ahead of Maine\u2019s primary on Tuesday. Her strongest challenger appears to be Adam Cote, a military veteran and businessman running as an outsider. So, in the shadow of the state Capitol in Augusta, Ms. Mills sought to rally women to her side.Describing her background as a district attorney and legislator, Ms. Mills cast gender as central to her campaign and portrayed her opponents\u2019 attacks as part of an all-too-familiar trap for women.\u201cNow, men say: \u2018Well, you have a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but you\u2019re kind of an insider,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mills said, to groans from a predominantly female crowd of about four dozen. \u201cReally? For decades, men were telling women: \u2018Just a little more experience and you\u2019ll be qualified.\u2019\u201dShe finished with gusto: \u201cWell, goddamn it, I am qualified!\u201dBut in several of the biggest states on the map, women have strained to break through or appear at risk of falling behind. Some may win despite being outspent by male opponents, but the financial disparity points to the lingering institutional barriers confronting female candidates who try to crack the glass ceiling of the statehouse dome.\u201cYou can\u2019t wait to be asked because a lot of guys won\u2019t ask you,\u201d said Kathleen Sebelius, the former Kansas governor. \u201cYou have to crash the party and, if there\u2019s an opening, go for it because a lot the party organizations are run by the old boys.\u201dState capitols remain dominated by self-perpetuating male political networks that determine who is groomed and promoted \u2014 and the outsiders who do force their way into the nominating process are often rich men wielding fortunes.The summer primaries will test Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm for electing female executives: In Colorado, Cary Kennedy, a former state treasurer who would be the state\u2019s first female governor, is battling Representative Jared Polis, a multimillionaire who has spent $10.5 million. In Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, a former state legislative leader, is battling Shri Thanedar, a businessman with no political experience who is pouring millions into his own campaign, and Abdul El-Sayed, a liberal insurgent.Ms. Whitmer at first struggled to win support from the unions that control much of the state\u2019s Democratic infrastructure. And some officials openly questioned the wisdom of putting forward another woman for governor \u2014 Jennifer Granholm ran the state until 2011 \u2014 which infuriated female strategists.Faced with the onslaught, Ms. Graham has started more directly invoking her gender.In an interview, Ms. Graham said women \u201cbring a different approach\u201d to politics and mused excitedly about the prospect of her and Ms. Abrams being neighboring governors together.At the moment, there are just two Democratic women governors: Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Kate Brown of Oregon. Ms. Raimondo faces a potentially bruising re-election fight, including a primary challenge from a liberal male opponent, Matt Brown.Ms. Raimondo said she was hopeful that 2018 would see breakthroughs for women in governorships, but that the country\u2019s political culture had been slow to embrace female executives. Ms. Raimondo said she had counseled a number of women around the country on their decisions to run, and had raised the paucity of female Democratic governors with party donors \u2014 many of whom, she said, were unaware of that reality and have historically been more focused on Congress.\u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen a lot of high-profile female executives,\u201d Ms. Raimondo said. \u201cWe just need more of them. It has to become more commonplace for people to feel really, deeply comfortable with it.\u201dMs. Giunchigliani got a stark reminder of the challenges women can face when she was rebuffed by Mr. Reid, who in retirement remains the de facto leader of the Nevada Democratic Party.\u201cThey almost always have primaries because they are almost always in situation where aspects of the establishment just can\u2019t get their head around what a governor should be,\u201d said Ms. Schriock of Emily\u2019s List. \u201cWe get the old, \u2018Yeah, she doesn\u2019t feel quite right.\u2019\u201dIn Maine, supporters of Ms. Mills fear what they view as a repeat of the 2016 election, when a thoroughly well-credentialed woman lost to an aggressive male amateur.Nancy Wanderer, a retired law professor who applauded Ms. Mills at her rally on Friday, seethed at what she described as \u201cunfair\u201d nit-picking by fellow Democrats and the news media. \u201cI think it\u2019s just like Hillary,\u201d Ms. Wanderer said.Ms. Mills has presented herself as a tough-minded corrective to the unpopular outgoing governor, Paul R. LePage, a Republican aligned with Mr. Trump. But she has faced criticism for being insufficiently liberal on issues like gun control, where Ms. Mills has stopped short of endorsing a ban on assault-style firearms.Ms. Mills said in an interview she was seeking \u201ccommon ground\u201d on gun issues, and in a debate last week described having been threatened in her youth by an abusive partner with a firearm.Ms. Giunchigliani, too, has invoked her own harrowing personal story in her bid to become Nevada\u2019s first female governor.And thanks to outside allies like Emily\u2019s List and the state chapter of the National Education Association, she has drawn closer to parity on Nevada\u2019s airwaves ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary.As for those casinos Mr. Reid predicted would oppose her in November, she predicted a softer approach.\u201cThis is Nevada,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll cover their bets.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Las Vegas, and Alexander Burns from Augusta, Me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cheer for Italy\u2019s Awful New Government", "Date": "2018-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistNow Bannon and Le Pen are not normally the political company I keep, so before I go on let me make it clear that the victorious parties entering government in Italy \u2014 the xenophobic League and the out-with-the-old-order Five Star Movement \u2014 bring together bigotry and incompetence to an unusual degree. They are a miserable bunch borne aloft on the global anti-liberal tide.Still, they won. The results of democratic elections have to be respected. I have immense respect for the wisdom, however hard to discern, of voters, even if I may profoundly disagree with their choices. That is why, when it seemed earlier in the week that Sergio Mattarella, the Italian president, had blocked the formation of this government over concerns that the proposed finance minister favored Italy\u2019s withdrawal from the euro, I despaired.I am passionate about the European Union, the dullest propagator of peace ever created. I loathe the facile designation of the immigrant or outsider as the source of national woes, a form of scapegoating with a terrible history in Europe and now on vivid display in Donald Trump\u2019s America. I\u2019m all for seriousness of purpose in government, and that cannot include promising handouts for which there are no funds. In short, I see nothing in the League or the internet-propagated Five Star Movement that does not cause me disgust.They are right that almost three decades of globalization since the end of the Cold War has left too many people behind in too many Western democracies, starved them of hope or even a say, and given them the impression that the system was rigged by elites in Brussels or other metropolitan hubs. The 2008 financial meltdown and the subsequent euro crisis came and went with near total impunity for those responsible. Until Western democracies confront their failings, the tide of popular rage won\u2019t abate.The response of Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, to the new Italian government was about as disastrous as may be imagined. It typified the forms of arrogance that have propelled anti-establishment parties to power and laid waste to the mainstream. Stop blaming the European Union, he declared. \u201cItalians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness.\u201dOh, please: Corrupt, unserious, lazy Italians \u2014 how many more stupid stereotypes can be packed into a single sentence? Juncker later apologized, but the damage was done. The slip was indicative of problems.The European Union has failed Italy because promised solidarity in taking in immigrants reaching Europe through Mediterranean routes hardly materialized. In 2017, Italy received over 60 percent of such migrants. It has failed Italy because the rigid fiscal constraints of membership of the euro \u2014 set up to ensure that Italy\u2019s budgetary laxness and administrative inefficiency would not be a problem for Germans \u2014 have proved unsustainable, engendering growing resentment toward Chancellor Angela Merkel.Of course, Italy has also failed itself. Parts of the country are the New York subway writ large, a lesson in what happens when waste becomes endemic and needed investment is deferred.The removal to a lesser job \u2014 European affairs minister \u2014 of Paolo Savona, the euro-skeptic who had been the designated finance minister, was a clever maneuver that not only saved the coalition but also reinforced democracy. With democracies, you get to throw the bums out when they mess up, not block them from assuming the power they won at the ballot.I know, Hitler was appointed chancellor in 1933 after a democratic election. Vigilance is imperative, particularly in these troubling times when independent judiciaries and a free press are under consistent attack. But a core beauty of the European Union is that its interlocking institutions are designed precisely to ensure that no country can go off on what the Germans call a Sonderweg \u2014 the sort of wayward path of nationalism and mysticism and racism that led Germany, and all of Europe, to ruin.Italy has a lousy government that may in the end be good for Europe.I\u2019ll take the long view and raise a cheer for that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Roberts Court Protects the Powerful for a New Gilded Age", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Purdy is a professor of law at Duke.Faith in courts runs deep in the American liberal imagination. Remembering Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade and the recent marriage-equality decisions, we keep hoping that wise and fair-minded judges will protect the vulnerable and lead the country toward justice.When it comes to economic inequality, today\u2019s Supreme Court is not only failing to help but is also aggressively making itself part of the problem in a time when inequality and insecurity are damaging the country and endangering our democracy.Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has consistently issued bold, partisan decisions that have been terrible for working people. Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, decided on Wednesday, was one of them.Just hours after that decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. With this \u201cswing\u201d vote gone, Chief Justice Roberts is now likely to take even more control over the direction of issues related to economic inequality \u2014 a direction that is earning him a legacy as chief justice of bosses, not workers.It\u2019s the kind of knotty technical issue \u2014 one type of fee for nonmembers of one variety of union \u2014 that makes law boring. Unlike the Masterpiece Cakeshop case the court decided in June, Janus isn\u2019t an obvious morality tale: Even many liberals often have mixed feelings about the public-sector unions that represent bureaucrats, subway employees, police officers and teachers.But Janus is big. As Justice Elena Kagan explained in her dissent, allowing employees to opt out of paying union fees while getting the benefits of representation risks starving the unions of resources, leading to ineffectiveness and collapse. Moreover, knifing unions at a time of intense controversy over state austerity budgets and widespread teachers\u2019 strikes suggests, as Justice Kagan wrote, that the court \u201cwanted to pick the winning side\u201d in these fights by \u201cweaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.\u201dThe New Deal shook American law. Its triumph brought new attention to economic power. Antitrust law worked to cut back corporate concentration and control. Labor unions were essential to what the Progressive-Era jurist Louis Brandeis called \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d \u2014 democracy adapted to a complex modern economy.Some people still imagine \u201cworkers\u201d as white men, but the American working classes are increasingly female, immigrant and nonwhite. There\u2019s no separating these hierarchies.The 1970s court also returned to its old habit of dressing economic power in constitutional principle. The dominance of the very rich in American politics is often attributed to the Citizens United decision of 2010, but that case only amplified a 1976 opinion, Buckley v. Valeo, in which the court shredded post-Watergate campaign-finance regulation and announced that private individuals could spend unlimited sums on candidates (including themselves). When the Roberts court used the First Amendment to protect corporate (and union) political spending in Citizens United, it was extending a longer-running trend. This is part of what Justice Kagan means when she observes that the conservative majority is weaponizing the First Amendment.These cases have the potential to make economic and political inequality significantly worse. Take the mandatory arbitration cases. In 1992, as the Supreme Court began to allow arbitration to enter employment relationships, only 2 percent of non-unionized companies imposed arbitration on their workers. Today the figure is 54 percent and sure to grow because it conveniently ties the hands of disgruntled or mistreated workers. These cases have replaced a majority of employees\u2019 legal protections with a system of private agreements that replicates the unequal bargaining power of workers and companies. Arbitration agreements will become only more important as \u201cgig\u201d employers such as Uber devise their contracts to get around labor law.And as the court used to recognize explicitly, there is no keeping economic power separate from political power. The remaining (disproportionately public-sector) unions are bastions of support for Democrats. The partisan overtones of suits seeking to weaken union influence are uncomfortably overt: The court was asked, in effect, to shift the rules in favor of Republican constituencies, and the votes fell out along squarely partisan lines.It is especially damaging for the court to rule with such unmistakable partisan implications when many still hope to see it stand as a forum of principle against the Trump administration\u2019s self-dealing, attacks on immigrants and other vulnerable groups, and general disregard for the procedural regularity that is the day-to-day life of the rule of law.But the challenge is deeper than partisanship. Democracy treats people as equals. An economy that makes them increasingly unequal undermines it.Justice Frankfurter was right. Economic and political matters are inseparable, and the law decides how they are stitched together. The Supreme Court can defend bosses\u2019 bargaining power, the political spending power of the very wealthy and the prerogative of states to deny health care to their low-wage workers \u2014 or it can curb these powers to support a modern safety net. It can tilt organized labor closer to a death spiral, as it did with Janus; but with different justices, it might recognize the importance of unions to postindustrial democracy, as previous courts did.These are choices. A different law of economic power is possible. In a time of significant economic inequality, we need campaign-finance laws that limit the influence of wealth and treat citizens as equals. We need a labor law that helps workers organize in new kinds of workplaces, such as home health care and the gig economy. We need antitrust law that can wrestle with the new quasi-monopoly power of platform-based companies such as Amazon and Facebook. We need forms of social caretaking and security that are even stronger and more universal than Obamacare.These aren\u2019t tasks for the Supreme Court. They are jobs for better legislators and presidents \u2014 and for scholars, unions and mobilized citizens. What is at stake is whether American democracy can overcome the new Gilded Age of inequality and insecurity. The justices, meanwhile, are part of the problem: In Janus and other rulings, they have retrenched on the side of private power and budgetary austerity. A different law of economic power will have to wait for a different court, and that will come only through winning elections. Those victories get more uphill every year, thanks in no small part to the current court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The First 2020 Race Is Underway: Scrambling for New York Donors", "Date": "2018-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Elizabeth Warren has come calling as recently as April. Kamala Harris, the first-term senator of California, has made repeated visits, starting as early as her third month in office. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is also no stranger to the big-money donor world of New York; he was here in April \u2014 his third such visit in three months.It will be months before Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren or most potential presidential aspirants will barnstorm across the farmlands of Iowa, dig into a low-country boil in South Carolina or field questions at a town-hall meeting in New Hampshire.But with American presidential races requiring an ever-dizzying amount of money, an early, behind-the-scenes 2020 contest is already taking place: the New York money primary.Over passed appetizers, intimate dinners and private board room meet-and-greets, a parade of nationally ambitious Democrats have been cycling through the offices and living rooms of the Manhattan money set.Top New York donors and Democratic fund-raisers, in more than two dozen interviews, said that their phones rarely stop buzzing as candidates blitz one of the densest concentrations of Democratic wealth in the country.Others calling and visiting include Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor; Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles; former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts; Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana; and the former Missouri Senate candidate, Jason Kander. Then there are the ambitious locals who already keep their donor lists close at hand: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\u201cWhen a candidate calls me to talk about \u2018strategy and issues,\u2019 you grab hold of your wallet for dear life,\u201d said Robert Zimmerman, a prominent New York donor and a member of the Democratic National Committee who has been in touch with multiple prospective candidates.For now, it is more about making connections than collecting cash, as few donors are committing at this stage. But to run a serious primary campaign, Democrats know they will have to amass tens of millions of dollars in the coming two years. Even if they got started as early as this July (and none of the top tier is expected to get into the race until after the midterms), a candidate would have to raise nearly $55,000 per day to construct a $30 million war chest by the end of 2019.New York will be crucial to that task. More than $500 million came from the New York City area to political campaigns in the last full election \u2014 the most of any single metropolitan region in the country, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. New York State had 15 of the top 50 ZIP codes for giving in the 2016 elections; no other state, even California, had half that many.While similar donor dynamics are playing out in other affluent liberal enclaves, such as Silicon Valley and Hollywood, the donor chase is especially early and intense here because, for the first time since at least 2004, there is no prohibitive front-runner to corner the market on all that New York campaign cash, a role that Hillary Clinton had played in the last two open Democratic nominating contests.In March, Mr. Biden was the special guest at a $10,000 per-person dinner benefiting House Democrats, at the home of the billionaire hedge fund manager James S. Chanos. In April, he attended a private fund-raising lunch at the home of a major Democratic donor, Dennis Mehiel, for his political action committee.The night after Mr. Biden\u2019s April visit, Ms. Warren mingled with donors at the Manhattan home of Mark Green, a former New York City public advocate, the official reason being her 2018 re-election bid (for which she has already stockpiled $15 million). A few months earlier, Meyer S. Frucher, the vice chairman of Nasdaq, hosted another fund-raising reception for Ms. Warren, according to people familiar with the gatherings.Many donors said they gravitated toward politicians focused on the 2018 elections. Laetitia Garriott de Cayeux, who opened her Murray Hill home to Mr. Biden for the February event, said she did so \u201cbecause I see Joe Biden going to every corner of the country to get Democrats elected in 2018.\u201dSarah Kovner, an influential Democratic fund-raiser in the city, said she ignores those too focused on the presidential campaign. \u201cFine \u2014 but not now, not from me. Not with Jon Tester in trouble and Claire McCaskill and Kyrsten Sinema in need,\u201d she said, rattling off the names of Democrats in key Senate races. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m concentrating on.\u201dAlmost every politician visiting New York can claim a purpose other than their own unspoken ambition \u2014 Mr. Biden for his PAC, Ms. Warren for her re-election.Mr. McAuliffe, a prolific and voracious fund-raiser who was once the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has been raising money for a new group focused on redistricting. But when Mr. McAuliffe recently met with donors at an event that the longtime Clinton adviser, Douglas J. Band, helped put together, his spiel included a half-hour on his successes as governor, according to two attendees, despite saying he was focused entirely on the midterms.Mr. Patrick, now at Bain Capital, the private equity firm made famous for launching Mitt Romney\u2019s business career, does not have a political entity he is raising money for, but he has still kept in touch with New York donors, including attending a donor dinner last spring and an event to mingle with contributors more recently at the Manhattan offices of Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the events.The lone Democratic outlier from the money chase is Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who bypassed large contributors in his 2016 presidential bid and still raised about $230 million, almost entirely from a torrent of small online donations \u2014 a model that many Democrats are trying to emulate.But in an era when a single billionaire can, more or less, sustain a presidential candidate through a super PAC, the courtship of the donor class has anything but slowed.There is a distinctive hierarchy to this donor dance: the bigger the contributor, the smaller the gathering. Billionaires and the biggest bundlers get almost limitless one-on-one time. The next tranche of mega-millionaires and political financiers get intimate dinners or office gatherings. Larger receptions are for standard-fare contributors.Ronald Perelman, the billionaire donor, organized a fund-raiser for Ms. Harris\u2019s PAC at the offices of his company, MacAndrews & Forbes, last December. Earlier in the year, Mr. Perelman, who contributes to both Republicans and Democrats, had another ambitious Californian, Mr. Garcetti, for a cocktail hour among donors at his estate in the Hamptons.Mr. Garcetti, who is known to hand out his personal cellphone number to contributors and encourage them to stay in touch, was last in New York in March, a trip that included some private catch-up time with top contributors as he raises money for his federal PAC to help Democrats in the midterms.Another politician whom donors mentioned as solicitous of New York is Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana. He pitches himself as the rare Democrat who can get elected and get along in a deep red state. He, too, has a federal PAC and has been hiring strategists with national experience.Other younger politicians, who are far from national figures, are still seeking exposure to the moneyed class of Manhattan, including Pete Buttigieg, the 36-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., (four visits already in 2018) and Mr. Kander, the 37-year-old former Missouri secretary of state who lost a Senate race in 2016 (two recent visits included donor events).As Stu Loeser, a veteran Democratic strategist in New York, put it, \u201cThe road to the White House runs down 57th Street.\u201dIt is more than a figure of speech. In the 2016 cycle, two of the top five ZIP codes for political giving in America \u2014 10022 and 10019, which span the length of 57th Street across Midtown Manhattan just south of Central Park \u2014 combined for $120 million in donations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.New York contributors say there has not been this much activity since at least 2003, the last open Democratic contest without Mrs. Clinton.While Mrs. Clinton was seen as holding a near-stranglehold on prominent New York donors, none of the current New York-area politicians considered possible 2020 candidates \u2014 Ms. Gillibrand, Mr. Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio or Mr. Booker \u2014 engender a similar sense of near-absolute loyalty.\u201cYou can analogize this to a dating process in which there are still a lot of blind dates and first dates but not yet a lot of second dates or third dates,\u201d said Steven Rattner, a Wall Street executive and veteran Democratic fund-raiser. \u201cLet alone anyone going steady or getting married.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Merkel and Macron Try to Save European Union, and Themselves", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 It was supposed to be the day when President Emmanuel Macron of France received a long-awaited response from Germany on his big ideas on how to rekindle Europe as a force for liberalism in the world.And he did, sort of.But his meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Tuesday was overshadowed by the urgent issue of how to put out the growing number of populist fires over migration on the Continent \u2014 including in Germany itself.Ms. Merkel, faced with a rebellion by Bavarian conservatives that nearly brought down her government on Monday, is staring at a 10-day deadline to reach the kind of European accord on limiting migration that has eluded the European Union for many years.On Tuesday she came one small step closer. When Mr. Macron was asked whether he would take back asylum seekers who were first registered in France if Germany refused them at the border, as demanded by the Bavarians, Mr. Macron obligingly said he would. \u201cI confirm,\u201d he said.France would be obligated to do so under the bloc\u2019s current regulations, but they have proved hollow as Europe has been confronted with millions of migrants and refugees from war-torn Syria, Libya, northern Africa and Afghanistan in recent years.More than 200,000 migrants sought asylum in Germany last year, and it is on pace to receive as many requests this year, according to Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. In 2016, more than 700,000 migrants and refugees asked for asylum in Germany.Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition party in Bavaria would like to send back any asylum seeker who has first registered in another European country. But that would mean creating a border in the border-free Schengen zone, which Ms. Merkel thinks would mean the breakdown of free travel, a jewel in the European crown.In part because Ms. Merkel needs French support in her effort to find a new European consensus on how to address migration, she reached several agreements with Mr. Macron on Tuesday.Ms. Merkel agreed to a joint budget for the countries that share the euro, which would be separate from the larger European Union budget and would be established as soon as 2021. She also assented to a European reinsurance arrangement for unemployment. Both measures were once unthinkable for Ms. Merkel\u2019s fiscally conservative country.Their meeting at the Meseberg palace outside Berlin, which took place in advance of a European summit at the end of June, was intended to address broad European issues, but it was marked as well by each leader\u2019s domestic political challenges.Ms. Merkel, in turn, needed support for fixing Europe\u2019s fractured asylum and migration policies.\u201cThe Europe that we know is too slow, too weak, too ineffective,\u201d Mr. Macron said in September, before reeling off a list of ambitious proposals.On Tuesday, Mr. Macron did not get nearly as much as he hoped for. He had lobbied for a budget of hundreds of millions of euros to be overseen by a European finance minister. German officials, long suspicious of anything that smacks of a transfer union, agreed finally to the idea of a eurozone budget, but in the tens of millions of euros and overseen by the European Commission.But Germany did agree to a proposal to coordinate its corporate tax rate with France and to an overhaul of the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, which would expand its mission and allow it to provide emergency loans to countries in recession.On balance, Mr. Macron probably got a little more than he had expected, given Ms. Merkel\u2019s current political predicament.\u201cThe domestic pressure Chancellor Merkel is currently under makes it easier for the French President to get more money for the new budget,\u201d said Thomas J\u00e4ger, a professor at the University of Cologne.If she is unable to reach agreements with other European countries within about two weeks, her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has threatened to act unilaterally, turning back any migrant to Bavaria whose asylum process is pending in another European Union country.Under these circumstances, analysts said, the leaders\u2019 joint declaration, which also covered support for closer military cooperation and foreign policy, was more substantive than might have been expected.The agreement \u201cis an important step in the right direction,\u201d said Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Institute for Economic Research, though he added that it would not be sufficient to make the eurozone sustainable and to avoid future crises.Timothy Garton Ash of Oxford University concurred. \u201cIn time-honored fashion they will try to cobble something together that looks like a major joint initiative,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is: Is it enough for Europe?\u201d\u201cNot yet,\u201d he added.On migration, the current crisis appears to have focused minds.\u201cThe topic that worries us all at the moment is migration,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, standing beside Mr. Macron at a lengthy joint news conference after their meeting.Both Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron hope to fashion deals with the front-line countries receiving the most migrants, like Italy or Spain, similar to one reached with Turkey.They also want to create a larger and more efficient European border force, adding 10,000 officers, and hope to discuss ways of processing asylum claims in North Africa, notably Libya, before migrants can arrive in Europe. Once migrants are on the Continent, it has proved very difficult to send back those who do not qualify as refugees, especially since many destroy their documents at sea.Following a tumultuous few days, with President Trump joining the fray in Europe by firing off hostile tweets and banding together with nativists from Hungary to Slovenia, Ms. Merkel\u2019s meeting with Mr. Macron felt at times like a defiant counter summit \u2014 an attempt by Europe\u2019s two main centrist leaders to close ranks.Mr. Macron, who has emerged as Europe\u2019s most energetic leader, has made an urgent case for a liberal Europe. On Tuesday his government\u2019s spokesman responded sharply to President Trump\u2019s tweets by criticizing American policies toward migrants.\u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s policy of separating migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico from their children shows that the United States and Europe do not share the same \u2018model of civilization,\u2019\u201d said the spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux.\u201cI don\u2019t want what\u2019s happening in the United States to happen in Europe,\u201d he told France 2 television, adding that \u201cclearly we do not share certain values.\u201dThe main responsibility of this generation, he said, \u201cis to defend European solidarity against populism, against all forms of populism, the far left and the far right.\u201d\u201cIf everyone retreats behind their national borders, we won\u2019t succeed,\u201d he said.The question is how much support Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel command elsewhere in Europe for their proposed reforms of the eurozone and migration. Some nations, including Austria and the Netherlands, do not favor a separate eurozone budget, while Italy, with a new populist government, has vowed to get tough on migration.\u201cIn that sense,\u201d Mr. J\u00e4ger said, \u201cthis compromise will be a litmus test of whether the French-German engine can still pull the European train.\u201dKatrin Bennhold reported from Berlin and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

(And that was a positive appraisal.)In between, we had jolts to the system spurred by the things that always make people here go bonkers: hubris (You know it, Comey); sex (Looking at you, Peter and Lisa), alienation of affection (Hi, Melania and Michael Cohen) and greed (Heads up, Trumps and Kushners).Jonathan Swift said, \u201cA wise man should have money in his head but not in his heart.\u201d The Trumps have green running through their veins.They have succeeded in superseding conflicts of interest with confluences of interest.

In their first year in public service, their total income from investments was between $82 million and $222 million. Ethics watchdogs are daily distraught over who is financing these investments.Ivanka raked in $3.9 million from her stake in the D.C. Trump hotel, which was saved from a shaky start by becoming the inevitable destination for foreign dignitaries and others seeking to flatter and enrich a White House that revolves around flattery and riches.The supposed nonprofit was little more than a Trump piggy bank used to settle legal claims and pay off political backers. The good news for Trump was that the prosecutor proposed that he be banned from charitable activities \u2014 a fine excuse for someone who obviously wants nothing to do with charity.Trump has also proved once again that he can turn Washington upside down and inside out. He has somehow managed to get Republicans in a position where they are cooing over his overtures to North Korea \u2014 overtures for which they would have impeached Barack Obama \u2014 and looking the other way while he upends the free trade policy that has been party dogma for decades.

{"Headline": "Medicare\u2019s Trust Fund Is Set to Run Out in 8 Years. Social Security, 16.", "Date": "2018-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The financial outlook for Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund deteriorated in the last year, and Social Security still faces serious long-term financial problems, the Trump administration said on Tuesday.The Medicare trust fund will be depleted in 2026, the administration said. By contrast, the government said last year that the trust fund would be exhausted in 2029.In a companion report, federal officials said the Social Security Trust Funds for old-age benefits and disability insurance, taken together, could be depleted in 2034, the same year projected in last year\u2019s report. The fund that helps tens of millions of retirees is expected to be depleted a year earlier than projected last year, while the outlook for the disability trust fund is more favorable.Still, tax collections would be sufficient to pay about three-fourths of promised Social Security benefits for 75 years.The report, prepared mostly by nonpolitical actuaries and economists, predicts a 2.4 percent increase in Social Security benefits next year, to keep up with the cost of living. The increase this year was 2 percent.More than 60 million people are on Social Security, Medicare or both. The two programs account for about 40 percent of all federal spending.But Mr. Trump has paid relatively little attention to either program, declining to embrace a major restructuring of Social Security or Medicare, as some previous Republican presidents have. Nor has he endorsed higher taxes to finance the programs, as some Democrats have suggested.Trump administration officials instead are counting on a strong economy to improve the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.\u201cThe administration\u2019s economic agenda \u2014 tax cuts, regulatory reform and improved trade agreements \u2014 will generate the long-term growth needed to help secure these programs,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday.So far that does not appear to have happened, to judge from the annual report of the trustees of Social Security and Medicare, a group that includes three Trump cabinet officers.The report said the less favorable outlook for Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund resulted from \u201cadverse changes\u201d in program income and costs. Income to the Medicare fund is expected to be lower than estimated last year because of \u201clower payroll taxes attributable to lowered wages in 2017 and lower levels of projected gross domestic product,\u201d the Treasury said in a \u201cfact sheet\u201d accompanying the report.At the same time, it said, outlays from Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund \u201care expected to be higher than last year\u2019s estimates due to higher-than-anticipated spending in 2017, legislation that increases hospital spending\u201d and higher payments to private Medicare Advantage plans.\u201cThe current trajectories in health spending are both unsustainable and unmatched by increases in quality,\u201d Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services and a trustee of Medicare and Social Security, said on Tuesday.Democrats have for months asserted that Republicans would use the deficit \u2014 swollen by tax cuts \u2014 as \u201can excuse to cut Social Security and Medicare,\u201d in the words of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. Republicans say the programs must be revamped to ensure they will be solvent for baby boomers and their children.The report said the 2017 tax law would have relatively modest effects on the finances of Medicare and Social Security.About half of Social Security beneficiaries owe some income tax on their benefits. This revenue will be lower than previously expected while the cuts in individual tax rates are in effect through 2025, the actuaries said. But after that, they said, revenue from the taxation of benefits will be somewhat higher than expected because the tax law alters the way in which income tax brackets will be adjusted for inflation.In addition, the tax law repealed the penalty for people who go without health insurance. As a result, the report said, Medicare payments to certain hospitals for \u201cuncompensated care\u201d are expected to increase.Another factor contributing to the increase in Medicare costs is Congress\u2019s decision last year to eliminate the Independent Payment Advisory Board, created by the Affordable Care Act to help slow the growth of Medicare.The trustees said the outlook for Social Security\u2019s disability trust fund had improved because the number of applications had declined steadily since 2010 and the total number of beneficiaries had been falling since 2014. In addition, they said, average benefit levels for disabled workers \u201cwere lower than expected in 2017 and are expected to be lower in the future.\u201dMedicare now spends an average of about $13,600 a year per beneficiary, and in five years the annual cost is expected to average more than $17,000, the report said.The standard Medicare premium paid by most beneficiaries is expected to rise next year by just $1.50 a month, to $135.50. But for the most affluent beneficiaries \u2014 those with annual incomes exceeding about $160,000 \u2014 the premium is expected to be about $460 a month.Federal officials predict that enrollment in private Medicare Advantage plans will continue growing at a rapid clip, to 29 million in 2027, from 20 million last year.A major reason for Social Security\u2019s long-term financial problems is a decline in the number of workers for each beneficiary.In 1960, there were about five workers for every Social Security beneficiary. The ratio of workers to beneficiaries fell to 3.3 in 2005 and then to 2.8 in 2016. It will decline further to about 2.2 by 2035, when most baby boomers will have retired, officials said.The aging of the population is another factor in the growth of the two entitlement programs. The number of Medicare beneficiaries is expected to surge to 87 million in 2040, from 60 million this year, according to Medicare actuaries. And the number of people on Social Security is expected to climb to 90 million, from 62 million, in the same period.Speaker Paul D. Ryan has repeatedly tried to overhaul entitlement programs, converting Medicare into a voucherlike program that could shift more retirees to private insurance and turning Medicaid into a block grant to state governments. He has faced bipartisan opposition to that effort, but many Republicans say they hope to continue the push after he retires next year.For their part, Democrats hope to expand Social Security, to address what they see as a looming crisis in retirement income.\u201cWe will fight every effort to cut, privatize or weaken Social Security, including attempts to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments or reducing earned benefits,\u201d the 2016 Democratic platform said. \u201cDemocrats will expand Social Security.\u201dThe trustees of the two programs \u2014 the secretaries of the Treasury, labor and health and human services and the Social Security commissioner \u2014 normally unveil the annual report at a news conference. But none of the four attended the press briefing this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Analysis Finds Tariffs Will Hurt Growth, as Officials Insist Otherwise", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe findings from the White House Council of Economic Advisers have been circulated only internally and not publicly released, as is often the case with the council\u2019s work, making the exact economic projections unknown. But the determination comes as top White House officials continue to insist publicly that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade approach will be \u201cmassively good for the U.S. economy.\u201d\u201cIf you model a future where everybody else reduces their trade barriers to ours, then that\u2019s massively good for the global economy and massively good for the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Hassett said.But the immediate effect of the administration\u2019s trade agenda has been the opposite, as other nations retaliate against the United States with their own tariffs.The administration has hit Canada, Mexico, Japan and the European Union with steel and aluminum tariffs and threatened tariffs on a range of Chinese goods. In return, many of those countries have either imposed or threatened reciprocal tariffs on everything from steel to pork to orange juice, a move that economists say will depress economic growth.Chris Rogers, research director for Panjiva, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, said Mexico\u2019s recently enacted tariffs would hit the American agricultural sector hardest.\u201cUnsurprisingly, the American suppliers hit most by the restrictions on consumer products shipments are the meat producers Swift Pork (JBS) and Tyson,\u201d Mr. Rogers wrote. \u201cThe largest non-pork category was processed foods, which includes sweeteners and chewing gum, among others. That has left Wrigley and Costco (including its own-brand products) similarly exposed to the new duties.\u201dRepublican lawmakers and many economists have been warning that the administration\u2019s trade approach will undercut economic growth and partially offset any boost from the $1.5 trillion tax cut that Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed last year.On Wednesday, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, criticized the Trump administration for throwing \u201ca huge wet blanket of uncertainty on an economy that otherwise they were responsible for making red hot.\u201dPursuing a trade approach that actually dampens economic growth would be a significant self-inflicted wound for the Trump administration, which has made achieving sustainable 3 percent economic growth a top priority. Mr. Trump has said his tax cut plan, along with his effort to roll back regulations, will provide \u201crocket fuel\u201d to the economy.Wall Street research firms have warned that those tariffs, and the retaliatory tariffs that trading partners have threatened in response, will slow growth in the United States. Researchers at Goldman Sachs said this month that the latest round of tariff escalations could reduce economic growth by as much as 0.15 percentage points this year.Asked about the Council of Economic Advisers analysis, a White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, said in an email on Wednesday that \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on internal, deliberative documents.\u201dIn her email, Ms. Walters pointed to a report issued on Wednesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes an economic model predicting positive outcomes if nations around the world reduce tariff levels. Such reductions, Ms. Walters said, are \u201cwhat the president\u2019s trade reform agenda is focused on: getting the rest of the world to lower their tariffs and get American exports on a level playing field.\u201dSo far, that has not come to pass. At an event unveiling the organization\u2019s report in Washington, its secretary general, Angel Gurr\u00eda, warned against tariff escalation. \u201cWe regret the proliferation of tariffs announced in the last couple of days,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda said. \u201cWe believe they are a threat to the global recovery.\u201dOther Trump administration officials have also expressed confidence that the White House\u2019s trade policies will not undermine the president\u2019s broader economic agenda.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told CNBC on Thursday that the tariffs would probably shave a fraction of a percentage point off the rate of economic growth. He said he expected the rise in gross domestic product to top 3 percent for 2018.In March, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he did not think that tariffs would weaken economic forecasts.\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re going to manage through this so that it is not detrimental to our growth projections,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Trump administration has faced criticism from outside economists for its optimistic projections that show the United States economy growing at an average of 3 percent a year for the next decade. Administration officials have publicly tried to discredit nonpartisan reports from organizations such as the Congressional Budget Office that have forecast slower growth over the course of the decade.The Treasury Department came under fire last year for producing a thin, three-page analysis of the effects of the Republican tax plan on the economy, and Mr. Mnuchin has been criticized for insisting that the Trump tax cuts will be self-financing. Most analyses have concluded that the cuts will add more than $1 trillion to the national debt.On Wednesday, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, told reporters at the White House briefing that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies, along with tax cuts and deregulation, were lifting growth, calling the president \u201cthe strongest trade reformer of the past 20 years.\u201d\u201cThe world trading system is a mess,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cIt is broken down. Insofar as fairness and reciprocity and, ultimately, free trade, I think this is contributing to our economic growth and our confidence.\u201dThe internal findings from the Council of Economic Advisers echo the widely shared view by most economists that tariffs hurt economic growth.This week, the World Bank said in its Global Economic Prospects Report that if tariff threats led to trade wars, the consequences could be \u201cdevastating.\u201d It pointed to intensifying protectionism around the world as a risk to economic growth.And last year, a group of former Council of Economic Advisers chairmen from both political parties wrote a letter to Mr. Trump urging him not to move ahead with steel tariffs, warning that \u201ctariffs would raise costs for manufacturers, reduce employment in manufacturing, and increase prices for consumers.\u201dVeterans of previous councils said that sometimes the office initiates its own analyses, and sometimes other senior White House officials request an analysis for policy development purposes. But much of the research is held closely for internal consumption, and the administration is unlikely to publicly release a report that contradicts the president\u2019s policy approach.\u201cThe West Wing folks alone determined whether the results of C.E.A. research entered into the public domain, and if so, how and when,\u201d said Harvey Rosen, a Princeton economist and former chairman of President George W.

Cohen, President Trump\u2019s longtime personal fixer, will soon be parting from the lawyers who are representing him in a potentially damaging and wide-ranging federal investigation into his business dealings, according to two people familiar with the case.Prosecutors conducting the inquiry have not yet approached Mr. Cohen to seek his cooperation, according to two people briefed on the case. But as the investigation continues, and with Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal team in flux, the pressure on him to cooperate with the government may well intensify.The dispute between Mr. Cohen and his lawyers involves the payment of his legal bills, part of which are being financed by the Trump family. Mr. Cohen has also had more longstanding concerns about the lawyers: As his case moves forward, possibly toward criminal charges, he has been thinking for some time about hiring a new legal team with stronger relationships with the federal prosecutors\u2019 office in New York that is leading the investigation, according to the people briefed on the matter.The Cohen inquiry is separate from the one being run in Washington by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is looking into potential ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. But ever since the raids involving Mr. Cohen took place, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have confronted the specter that the New York-based investigation could persuade Mr. Cohen, who has a wife and two children and faces the prospect of devastating legal fees, to cut a deal and share his intimate knowledge of Mr. Trump with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team. Mr. Cohen, after all, worked for Mr. Trump for years as a lawyer and self-described \u201cfix-it guy,\u201d guarding his boss\u2019s secrets and helping him to navigate some of the most sensitive episodes in his personal and professional life.It is not uncommon for clients \u2014 even those, like Mr. Cohen, who have not yet been charged with a crime \u2014 to change their lawyers in the middle of a case. And while Mr. Cohen\u2019s split from the McDermott team, which was first reported by ABC News, marked a significant moment in the proceedings, there was no certainty that he would strike a deal with the prosecutors and thus place Mr. Trump into further legal jeopardy.One person with knowledge of the legal staffing change said Mr. Trump\u2019s camp was \u201cvery displeased\u201d with the way the Cohen investigation had so far been conducted. Mr. Trump himself has told people he is angry at Mr. Cohen over the messiness of the situation \u2014 especially those aspects involving Ms. Clifford. But the president has also indicated to allies that he is worried that if he pushes Mr. Cohen away too hard, it could increase the likelihood that Mr. Cohen will offer information to the government.From the start, the McDermott team of lawyers \u2014 led by Stephen M. Ryan \u2014 was an awkward fit in a case that began in Washington with a referral by Mr. Mueller, but soon moved to New York. Mr. Ryan, based in Washington, is not as familiar with the Manhattan federal prosecutor\u2019s office as many local lawyers are, and some in Mr. Cohen\u2019s orbit suggested that he needed a lawyer with more experience with the New York courts.One person familiar with Mr. Cohen said that there have been discussions with a number of prominent defense lawyers in New York about representing Mr. Cohen going forward.Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses have not been funding Mr. Cohen\u2019s entire legal defense, but the Trump family has been paying for the time-consuming \u2014 and enormously expensive \u2014 process of reviewing the voluminous materials seized in the raids on Mr. Cohen, according to people familiar with the case. Recently, however, a dispute has erupted over the amount that Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers want to charge the Trump family enterprises for the review, which the lawyers have said they are running with a large team of associates and data specialists. The disagreement could serve to further isolate Mr. Cohen from Mr. Trump \u2014 a risky move for the president.\u201cIf somebody is telling you that people stopped payment, that is not true,\u201d said Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, Mr. Trump\u2019s private company. \u201cThere was a negotiated amount for this project and I believe that both sides have lived up to their obligations.\u201dAnd so for now, Mr. Ryan and his team will continue to review the trove of materials, a process meant to determine which among the nearly four million files taken are protected by the attorney-client privilege that Mr. Trump enjoys in his dealings with Mr. Cohen. That review is crucial because it will ultimately shape the contours of the evidence that the prosecutors will be able to use in their investigation.Benjamin Weiser and Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting from New York, and Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Without Kennedy, the Future of Gay Rights Is Fragile", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Greenfield and Mr. Winkler are law professors.In 30 years on the Supreme Court \u2014 the past 13 as the swing justice \u2014 Justice Anthony Kennedy has been the decisive vote in cases on issues ranging from abortion to affirmative action. Yet his legacy will be defined primarily by his opinions in the area of gay rights, where he wrote the major majority opinions expansively reading the Constitution to protect gay Americans.When Justice Kennedy joined the court in 1988, it was no friend to gays and lesbians. Two years earlier, the court had upheld a Georgia law making it a crime to engage in intimate conduct with a person of the same sex. It dismissed the argument that the Constitution protected gay intimacy as \u201cfacetious at best.\u201dGay and lesbian citizens found a champion in Justice Kennedy. In 1996, he led the court in overturning a Colorado law barring cities from protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination. Justice Kennedy wrote that laws targeting gay people based in \u201canimus\u201d were unconstitutional. In 2003, he wrote for the court in Lawrence v. Texas, invalidating a law criminalizing same-sex sodomy and overturning the dismissive 1986 decision.Justice Kennedy also wrote the court\u2019s two most important decisions on same-sex marriage. The court in 2013 struck down a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal benefits to gay couples married under state law; Mr. Kennedy wrote that same-sex marriages were \u201cworthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages.\u201dIn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Justice Kennedy said these relationships were \u201ccentral to individual dignity and autonomy.\u201d The 5-4 decision made marriage equality the law of the land, but beyond that Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinions were important for giving legitimacy to the love and relationships of people long shamed for those very feelings of intimacy.Justice Kennedy\u2019s gay-rights legacy, however, is at risk and not just because of the slim vote margins that produced it. Unfortunately that margin is almost certainly gone already. When President Trump\u2019s second nominee takes his seat at the court, probably this fall, a majority of the court is likely to disagree with Justice Kennedy\u2019s expansions of L.G.B.T. rights. And even without overturning his signature cases, Justice Kennedy\u2019s decisions can be narrowed and their implications minimized.And those who will want to cabin his legacy will be aided by the justice\u2019s own decision-making style. His opinions often hedged, refusing to establish strong rules to protect gays and lesbians going forward. He spent more time in his key opinions discussing the ephemeral than the doctrinal. Same-sex intimacy could not be criminalized because \u201cat the heart of liberty is the right to define one\u2019s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\u201d Marriage was important to ensure people are not left lonely \u2014 calling out \u201conly to find no one there.\u201dMeanwhile, he left much of the important work of judging undone. He muddled whether the marriage cases were based on the Constitution\u2019s promise of equality, its protection of fundamental rights or both. He never adequately explained why, if dignity is protected by the Constitution, why similar dignity rights could not be claimed by those who want to marry more than one person or to marry a cousin. Justice Kennedy simply ignored those obvious slippery-slope problems.Most important, he balked at declaring that laws discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation should be, like those discriminating on the basis of race or gender, presumed suspect by the courts. Much of constitutional law depends on the \u201clevels of scrutiny.\u201d If a law burdens a fundamental right or discriminates on the basis of race or sex, courts take a hard look to make sure the government has a really good reason for the law. Everyday laws that do not raise such problems are subject to bare \u201crational basis\u201d review, and courts take only a cursory glance before moving on to the next case.In the marriage cases, a fair analysis should have depended less on \u201cthe universal fear\u201d of loneliness and more on whether the bans were subject to rational-basis review or something stricter. If rational, the bans should survive. If strict, they would fail. Both sides petitioned the court to rule on that question, but Justice Kennedy could not bring himself to decide it.These doctrinal points Justice Kennedy neglected are not mere niceties. Lower courts need such guidance to determine whether laws biased against L.G.B.T. people should be upheld. Indeed, lower courts have previously read Justice Kennedy\u2019s opaque language in Lawrence to allow states to ban gay adoption and permit governments to fire employees for engaging in private, consensual sexual behavior. The language in the marriage cases could allow similar mistakes.President Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court appointment, Neil Gorsuch, proved how tenuous Justice Kennedy\u2019s pronouncements can be. Just months after Justice Gorsuch was confirmed, the court held that states cannot refuse to include the names of same-sex parents on children\u2019s birth certificates. Same-sex couples were entitled to the entire \u201cconstellation of benefits\u201d associated with marriage. Justice Gorsuch dissented, saying states should be free to list only biological parents. If Justice Gorsuch\u2019s narrow view of Obergefell prevails, gays and lesbians may one day enjoy a right to marry without marriage equality.Justice Kennedy left unanswered one of the pivotal questions for the future of gay rights: Do businesses have a right to discriminate against gay and lesbian employees or customers if the business owners claim a religious objection? The issue was teed up perfectly this term, but Justice Kennedy ultimately punted, leaving the key questions once again unaddressed. With his resignation he ensured they would be answered by a future, more conservative court more likely to see anti-gay discrimination as perfectly rational.It may be Justice Kennedy \u2014 and those Americans who\u2019ve found protections and respect in his decisions \u2014 with similar regrets in the years to come.Kent Greenfield is a law professor at Boston College and the author of the forthcoming \u201cCorporations Are People Too (And They Should Act Like It).\u201d Adam Winkler is a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \u201cWe the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Conservatives Weaponized the First Amendment", "Date": "2018-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On the final day of the Supreme Court term last week, Justice Elena Kagan sounded an alarm.Conservatives, said Justice Kagan, who is part of the court\u2019s four-member liberal wing, were \u201cweaponizing the First Amendment.\u201dThe two decisions were the latest in a stunning run of victories for a conservative agenda that has increasingly been built on the foundation of free speech. Conservative groups, borrowing and building on arguments developed by liberals, have used the First Amendment to justify unlimited campaign spending, discrimination against gay couples and attacks on the regulation of tobacco, pharmaceuticals and guns.The Citizens United campaign finance case, for instance, was decided on free-speech grounds, with the five-justice conservative majority ruling that the First Amendment protects unlimited campaign spending by corporations. The government, the majority said, has no business regulating political speech.The dissenters responded that the First Amendment did not require allowing corporate money to flood the political marketplace and corrupt democracy.As a result, liberals who once championed expansive First Amendment rights are now uneasy about them.Many on the left have traded an absolutist commitment to free speech for one sensitive to the harms it can inflict.Take pornography and street protests. Liberals were once largely united in fighting to protect sexually explicit materials from government censorship. Now many on the left see pornography as an assault on women\u2019s rights.\u201cBecause so many free-speech claims of the 1950s and 1960s involved anti-obscenity claims, or civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protests, it was easy for the left to sympathize with the speakers or believe that speech in general was harmless,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the claim that speech was harmless or causally inert was never true, even if it has taken recent events to convince the left of that. The question, then, is why the left ever believed otherwise.\u201dSome liberals now say that free speech disproportionately protects the powerful and the status quo.\u201cOnce a defense of the powerless, the First Amendment over the last hundred years has mainly become a weapon of the powerful,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLegally, what was, toward the beginning of the 20th century, a shield for radicals, artists and activists, socialists and pacifists, the excluded and the dispossessed, has become a sword for authoritarians, racists and misogynists, Nazis and Klansmen, pornographers and corporations buying elections.\u201dIn the great First Amendment cases in the middle of the 20th century, few conservatives spoke up for the protection of political dissenters, including communists and civil rights leaders, comedians using vulgar language on the airwaves or artists exploring sexuality in novels and on film.\u201cConstitutional protection should be accorded only to speech that is explicitly political,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no basis for judicial intervention to protect any other form of expression, be it scientific, literary or that variety of expression we call obscene or pornographic.\u201dThe only dissent in the decision came from Justice William H. Rehnquist, the court\u2019s most conservative member.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s last Supreme Court term contained hints of his retirement and foreshadowed a lasting rightward shift.That trend has continued, with businesses mounting First Amendment challenges to gun control laws, securities regulations, country-of-origin labels, graphic cigarette warnings and limits on off-label drug marketing.\u201cI was a bit queasy about it because I had the sense that we were unleashing something, but nowhere near what happened,\u201d Mr. Nader said. \u201cIt was one of the biggest boomerangs in judicial cases ever.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t be Merlin,\u201d he added. \u201cWe never thought the judiciary would be as conservative or corporate. This was an expansion that was not preordained by doctrine. It was preordained by the political philosophies of judges.\u201d\u201cIts most important contributions are in the commercial speech and corporate speech areas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a workmanlike, common sense approach.\u201dOne plaintiff was Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, Democrat of Minnesota, who had challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1968 presidential primaries \u2014 from the left. Another was the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s New York affiliate.Professor Neuborne, a former A.C.L.U. lawyer, said he now regrets the role he played in winning the case. \u201cI signed the brief in Buckley,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to spend long amounts of time in purgatory.\u201dTo Professor Seidman, cases like these were part of what he describes as a right-wing takeover of the First Amendment since the liberal victories in the years Chief Justice Earl Warren led the Supreme Court.The title of the article asked, \u201cCan Free Speech Be Progressive?\u201d\u201cThe answer,\u201d the article said, \u201cis no.\u201dThe right turn has been even more pronounced under Chief Justice Roberts.The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a larger share of First Amendment cases concerning conservative speech than earlier courts had, according to the study prepared for The Times. And it has ruled in favor of conservative speech at a higher rate than liberal speech as compared to earlier courts.The court\u2019s docket reflects something new and distinctive about the Roberts court, according to the study, which was conducted by Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis; Andrew D. Martin, a political scientist at the University of Michigan and the dean of its College of Literature, Science and the Arts; and Kevin Quinn, a political scientist at the University of Michigan.\u201cThe Roberts court \u2014 more than any modern court \u2014 has trained its sights on speech promoting conservative values,\u201d the study found. \u201cOnly the current court has resolved a higher fraction of disputes challenging the suppression of conservative rather than liberal expression.\u201dThe court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren from 1953 to 1969 was almost exclusively concerned with cases concerning liberal speech. Of its 60 free-expression cases, only five, or about 8 percent, challenged the suppression of conservative speech.The proportion of challenges to restrictions on conservative speech has steadily increased. It rose to 22 percent in the court led by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger from 1969 to 1986; to 42 percent in the court led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist from 1986 to 2005; and to 65 percent in the Roberts court.The Roberts court does more than hear a larger proportion of cases concerning conservative expression. It is also far more likely than earlier courts to rule for conservative speech than for liberal speech. The result, the study found, has been \u201ca fundamental transformation of the court\u2019s free-expression agenda.\u201dBut last week\u2019s two First Amendment blockbusters were decided by 5-to-4 votes, with the conservatives in the majority ruling in favor of conservative plaintiffs.\u201cUsing the First Amendment to strike down economic and social laws that legislatures long would have thought themselves free to enact will, for the American public, obscure, not clarify, the true value of protecting freedom of speech,\u201d Justice Breyer wrote.On Wednesday, in announcing the decision on public unions, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the court was applying settled and neutral First Amendment principles to protect workers from being forced to say things at odds with their beliefs. He suggested that the decision on public unions should have been unanimous.\u201cCompelling individuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such effort would be universally condemned,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuppose, for example, that the State of Illinois required all residents to sign a document expressing support for a particular set of positions on controversial public issues \u2014 say, the platform of one of the major political parties. No one, we trust, would seriously argue that the First Amendment permits this.\u201dIn response, Justice Kagan said the court\u2019s conservatives had found a dangerous tool, \u201cturning the First Amendment into a sword.\u201d The United States, she said, should brace itself.\u201cSpeech is everywhere \u2014 a part of every human activity (employment, health care, securities trading, you name it),\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor that reason, almost all economic and regulatory policy affects or touches speech. So the majority\u2019s road runs long. And at every stop are black-robed rulers overriding citizens\u2019 choices.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Brian Krzanich Resigns After Relationship With Employee", "Date": "2018-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For decades, Intel was one of the most predictable players in the technology industry. On Thursday, the semiconductor maker blindsided Silicon Valley with the abrupt resignation of its chief executive over a relationship with a subordinate.Mr. Krzanich\u2019s relationship with the subordinate was not recent, said one person briefed on the situation, who declined to be identified because the company discussions over the matter were confidential. Intel found out about the relationship only a few days ago, this person added.Robert Swan, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, was appointed interim chief executive while the company conducts a search for a permanent new leader. Mr. Krzanich could not be reached for comment.\u201cWe appreciate Brian\u2019s many contributions to Intel,\u201d Andy Bryant, Intel\u2019s chairman, said in a prepared statement. He added that he knew the company would continue to perform.Intel, which recently yielded the title of the world\u2019s largest chip maker to Samsung, is approaching its 50th birthday. The company, known for microprocessor chips that carry out calculations in most personal computers and server systems, has prided itself as a standard-setter in corporate governance.An Intel spokesman said the company\u2019s most recent version of its strict non-fraternization policy, which prohibits managers from sexual or romantic relationships with employees who report directly or indirectly to them, has been in place since 2011.Mr. Krzanich argued that Intel needed an infusion of fresh thinking to achieve his goal of reducing the company\u2019s dependence on the sluggish P.C. market. He also publicly committed the company to increasing the number of employees from groups underrepresented in some technical specialties, including minorities and women.\u201cIntel is a different place, and we\u2019ve done this while growing the business,\u201d Mr. Krzanich said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in May.But five former Intel employees, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said Mr. Krzanich at times exhibited an arrogant personal style and handled staff changes in ways that created enemies. Some of these people said the #MeToo movement most likely influenced how Intel\u2019s board handled the matter.During Mr. Krzanich\u2019s tenure, Intel\u2019s market capitalization rose to above $240 billion, with a share price that is up 50 percent since the beginning of 2017. On Thursday, while the company\u2019s shares declined 2 percent on the announcement of the leadership change, Intel said it expected to report second-quarter results that exceed Wall Street estimates.Pierre Ferragu, an analyst with New Street Research, said the projection points to a \u201cmonster\u201d quarter for the company. \u201cThe resignation itself is in our view a completely idiosyncratic event, with no impact to the company,\u201d he wrote in a research note.Mr. Swan is a relative newcomer to Intel, joining the company as chief financial officer from General Atlantic in 2016. His past experience includes a stint at private equity firm General Atlantic and nine years as chief financial officer at eBay.Mr. Krzanich\u2019s total compensation last year was $21.5 million, according to the executive compensation firm Equilar. That put him at 60th place in an annual ranking of highest-paid chief executives in the United States that Equilar conducted for The New York Times.An earlier version of this article misstated Intel\u2019s position in the semiconductor market.

{"Headline": "Leading Republicans Join Democrats in Pushing Trump to Halt Family Separations", "Date": "2018-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe issue took on special resonance on Father\u2019s Day as Democratic lawmakers visited detention facilities in Texas and New Jersey to protest the separations and the House prepared to take up immigration legislation this week. Pictures of children warehoused without their parents in facilities, including a converted Walmart store, have inflamed passions and put the administration on the defensive.But Melania Trump weighed in, saying she \u201chates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together.\u201d Mrs. Trump \u201cbelieves we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with a heart,\u201d the first lady\u2019s office said in a statement.She attributed the situation entirely to the administration. \u201cThe reason for these separations is a zero tolerance policy for their parents, who are accused of illegally crossing our borders,\u201d she wrote.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, deplored separations on Sunday, except in cases where there is evidence of abuse or another good reason.\u201cWhat the administration has decided to do is to separate children from their parents to try to send a message that, if you cross the border with children, your children are going to be ripped away from you,\u201d she said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cThat is traumatizing to the children, who are innocent victims. And it is contrary to our values in this country.\u201dFormer President Bill Clinton likewise spoke out, suggesting that Mr. Trump was using the widely denounced practice to leverage Democrats into accepting immigration limits in legislation they would otherwise oppose.Contrary to the president\u2019s public statements, no law requires families to necessarily be separated at the border. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d announcement this spring that the government will prosecute all unlawful immigrants as criminals set up a situation in which children are removed when their parents are taken into federal custody.But there have been reports of people arriving at the ports of entry asking for asylum and being taken into custody, and some of the designated ports are not accepting asylum claims. In those cases, migrants sometimes cross wherever they can and, because it is not an official border station, are detained even though they are making a claim of asylum. Many would-be asylum applicants do not know where official ports of entry are.The furor over the separation policy seemed to grow even as the president planned to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday in advance of votes on immigration legislation that has divided his party. Two competing bills are headed to the floor, a hard-line immigration measure that is expected to go down, and a compromise version crafted by the House Republican leadership.Mr. Trump has confused his allies in the House with conflicting signals about his preferences. At one point on Friday, he said he would not sign the \u201cmoderate\u201d bill embraced by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, only to have the White House later contradict that by saying the president had been confused.Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland led a group of Democratic lawmakers to a detention facility in Brownsville, Tex., on Sunday but were not allowed to talk with children held there. Seven House Democrats visited a detention facility in Elizabeth, N.J., and said they were blocked for nearly two hours before being allowed to see parents separated from their children.Some Republican lawmakers in recent days have pushed Mr. Trump to reverse or modify the family separation policy by giving new instructions to the Department of Homeland Security.\u201cPresident Trump could stop this policy with a phone call,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and often an ally and golfing partner of the president\u2019s, said on CNN on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ll go tell him. If you don\u2019t like families\u2019 being separated, you can tell D.H.S. stop doing it.\u201dMr. Trump has said in recent days that Democrats should agree to his panoply of immigration measures, including full financing for a border wall and revamping the system of legal entry to the country, in effect making clear that any legislation addressing family separation must also include his priorities.\u201cAs a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who has got a conscience, and wouldn\u2019t say the junk that somebody said, apparently, allegedly, I will tell you that nobody likes this policy,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC. \u201cYou saw the president on camera that he wants this to end, but everybody has, Congress has to act.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernytAdvertisement"}

The back parking lots were now makeshift soccer fields and volleyball courts. The McDonald\u2019s was now the cafeteria. All this made it difficult to visualize what the sprawling facility used to be \u2014 a former Walmart Supercenter.The converted retail store at the southern tip of Texas has become the largest licensed migrant children\u2019s shelter in the country \u2014 a warehouse for nearly 1,500 boys aged 10 to 17 who were caught illegally crossing the border.The teeming, 250,000-square-foot facility is a model of border life in Trump-era America, part of a growing industry of detention centers and shelters as federal authorities scramble to comply with the president\u2019s order to end \u201ccatch and release\u201d of migrants illegally entering the country. Now that children are often being separated from their parents, this facility has had to obtain a waiver from the state to expand its capacity.Cots are being added to sleeping areas. The staff is expanding. But even that is not enough. Federal authorities are considering establishing tent cities on Army and Air Force bases, and have already transferred hundreds of immigrant detainees to temporary housing at federal prisons.On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that temporary tent housing would be set up near the border station in Tornillo, Tex., to house up to 360 youths. That prompted an angry response from a Democratic state senator, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, who noted that temperatures could be expected to exceed 100 degrees at the site. \u201cThis is what totalitarians in the Middle East and elsewhere do,\u201d he said in a statement.The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement is now overseeing an estimated 100 shelters in 17 states, serving a population that has grown to more than 11,000 youths. One of the biggest concentrations is here near the border in South Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the poorest regions in the nation. There are about 10 shelters in three Valley counties, the majority in the Cameron County cities of Brownsville, Harlingen and San Benito.The shelters in and near Brownsville have become big business, employing hundreds of residents and bringing abandoned stores, schools and other buildings back to life in a county where the median household income is $34,578 and the percentage of those living below the federal poverty line is 29.1, far higher than the national poverty rate of 12.7 percent.But they have also raised questions about federal oversight and management, and the invisibility under which many of them operate.Numerous shelters that care for unaccompanied migrant youth in Texas have been cited by state child care facility regulators for dozens of violations in recent years, according to data from two of the state\u2019s oversight agencies, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Department of Family and Protective Services. The majority of the violations were for minor infractions, including incomplete child records. But some were for more serious problems.The shelters are part of the federal government\u2019s attempt to accommodate a flood of young people who have been surging across the Southwest border over the past several years, often without an accompanying parent. Many of them are seeking asylum from gang violence or other troubles in Central America.The number of children under detention has grown in recent weeks as the Trump administration has begun prosecuting migrants who cross the border illegally. Previously, parents traveling with children were often quickly released with orders to appear later in court \u2014 a practice which members of the current administration say was providing a powerful incentive for migrants to take their children in tow and travel to the United States. The number of families apprehended at the border has gone up nearly 600 percent compared with the spring of last year, the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, told Congress in May.\u201cWord is getting out,\u201d she said.But what happens to children in these federally sponsored shelters has had little public scrutiny.Here in South Texas, the mystery of what the Oregon senator was not allowed to see \u2014 the living conditions for hundreds of migrant boys inside a space originally built to house not people but cheap jeans and housewares \u2014 was seemingly solved on Wednesday. Federal officials and the operator of the shelter, Southwest Key Programs, led several reporters on a roughly 90-minute media tour and question-and-answer session.The shelter, called Casa Padre, is a world all its own, much of it invisible to outsiders. The few windows are covered in black mesh; in the parking lot, yellow-painted wooden barricades read, \u201cKeep Out.\u201dInside, it is clean, massive and brightly lit. Not far from the entrance, there is a large mural of President Trump, an American flag and the White House, with a quote from Mr. Trump: \u201cSometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.\u201dA team of 48 medical staff and three on-call physicians provide medical services. X-rays and laboratory work are done in-house. The children receive classroom instruction for six hours a day Monday through Friday, and outdoor play time for two hours a day.The building no longer resembles a Walmart. The interior has been redesigned, with walls and hallways constructed to create bedrooms, classrooms and other spaces. The mural featuring the president is one of many; one painting depicts former President John F. Kennedy with his words, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you,\u201d in English and in Spanish.Most of the boys are from Central America. Many of them smiled, waved at or shook the hands of the reporters touring the site. They were asked by the reporters and Southwest Key executives, in Spanish, \u201cHow are you?\u201dThe constant reply was \u201cBien, bien,\u201d meaning \u201cOK, OK.\u201d The media was not allowed to interview the children.Some were leaning back, getting a shampoo at the sinks in the shelter\u2019s barbershop, where a striped lit-up barber\u2019s pole spun outside the door. They lined up in the cafeteria for dinner \u2014 chicken, mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables. Some played pool, or joined a tai chi session in the rec room. One teenager sat at a cafeteria table with his head bowed and hands clasped, praying silently. Another told the cafeteria worker who served him dinner, \u201cGracias, Miss.\u201dEverywhere, some of the shelter\u2019s more than 1,000 employees hovered nearby \u2014 they sat at the ends of the cafeteria tables while the boys ate dinner, watched \u201cMoana\u201d with the children in the old loading docks and escorted lines of boys in the hallways.Many of the boys appeared to be 16 or 17, and the few who were much younger, around the age of 10 or 11, seemed almost out of place. They wore gym shorts and sweatshirts, sneakers and rosary necklaces. One had his arm in a sling and another had his leg wrapped in a bandage. All of them are classified as unaccompanied minors by federal officials \u2014 they either crossed the border without a parent or guardian, or were separated from their parents as part of the administration\u2019s new policy of arresting illegal border crossers and separating them from their children.The vast majority, Southwest Key officials said, crossed the border unaccompanied.In Bedroom 53, there were four beds on frames and one bed on a cot. The cot highlighted the housing crunch \u2014 it was one of hundreds of new beds that were recently added to boost the shelter\u2019s capacity. In May, Casa Padre was licensed by the state at a capacity of 1,186. On Wednesday, after a variance approved by the state allowed Southwest Key to boost its population, the new capacity was roughly 1,500.Southwest Key executives said the additional children do not make it too big to properly manage. They defended the services and the care they provide the children, as they will likely do when elected officials take tours of their own in the coming days, including Mr. Merkley. A congressional delegation is scheduled to tour the shelter on Monday.\u201cWe pride ourselves in providing excellent child care,\u201d said Alexia Rodriguez, Southwest Key\u2019s vice president of immigrant children\u2019s services, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re not a political organization. We take care of kids. We take great care of kids.\u201dThe industry for sheltering young migrants had run into trouble here even before the latest boom. Hundreds of shelter workers in the Rio Grande Valley were laid off at the end of March, after several sites run on contract to the federal government by a private organization, International Educational Services, suddenly shut down. The organization, known as I.E.S., lost its federal financing and shuttered its shelters and other facilities, for reasons that federal officials have yet to publicly explain.Last year, a worker at a Brownsville shelter yelled at a child, causing the child to punch a wall. In 2016, children in a shelter in the Cameron County town of Los Fresnos were being told to sit down for four hours as a form of discipline. Shelters were cited in various cases after their employees pushed children, slapped their hands with a ruler or grabbed a wrist. Other violations involved a lack of supervision. One child ate a meal she was allergic to, even though she was wearing a red bracelet that listed her allergies.A shelter in the Rio Grande Valley city of McAllen was cited in January after a child missed several doses of medication, and after children who complained of being in pain had to wait several days before care was provided. In September 2015 in Brownsville, medical staff left rubbing alcohol accessible, and a youth took it and consumed it. In October 2017 in San Benito, a random drug test found a shelter employee had showed up to work over the legal limit for alcohol.On the tour on Wednesday, Southwest Key and federal officials did not discuss such violations. They saw nothing wrong with the children spending most of their day indoors. They highlighted numerous phone booths around the shelter, including some the children use to call relatives and others that have direct lines to child protection agencies so they can lodge complaints. And they said there were some cases of children who tried to run away. The average length of stay in a migrant children\u2019s shelter is about 56 days, after which children generally are released to a sponsor. Some have been placed with foster families.Only 3.5 percent of unaccompanied youths who have arrived from Central America have been returned to their home countries, Ms. Nielsen said in her report to Congress.Asked if there were plans to house even more children at the former Walmart, Ms. Rodriguez said the new state-authorized capacity of roughly 1,500 was the maximum. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \u201cWe cannot put any more kids here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nominee Says He Won\u2019t Weaponize Agency", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Internal Revenue Service, Charles Rettig, said on Thursday that he would make it a priority to run the department without bias, an attempt to ease lawmakers\u2019 concerns that the tax collection agency could be weaponized for political purposes.The I.R.S. has been a political punching bag for several years following allegations during the Obama administration that it was unfairly targeting conservative groups seeking nonprofit status. Now, Democrats are fearful that the agency could interpret the new $1.5 billion tax law in ways that disadvantage blue states and that it could be used by Mr. Trump to target companies that act against his wishes.\u201cIf I am confirmed, I will be in charge of the Internal Revenue Service and will make sure that the Internal Revenue Service moves forward, follows the law in an impartial, non-biased manner,\u201d Mr. Rettig said.Mr. Rettig, whose confirmation appears likely, faces a huge challenge at the helm of the I.R.S. The department has been starved of funding for years and is struggling with aging technology and a depleted work force. The agency\u2019s online filing system crashed on Tax Day this year, a failure that many said stemmed from budget cuts that have resulted in antiquated technology.He will also be tasked with implementing the tax legislation that Congress passed late last year. The law is the biggest tax overhaul in three decades, and the I.R.S. has been scrambling to issue new guidance and interpretations for businesses and taxpayers who are still coming to grips with the changes.Mr. Rettig carefully avoided questions about how the I.R.S. might address states that have developed workarounds to the $10,000 limit on state and local tax deductions that was imposed by the new tax law. He also treaded carefully when pressed by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, about Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that he cannot release his tax returns because he has been continuously audited for a decade.Mr. Rettig acknowledged that he had never encountered a client who had been audited for that length of time.Some Democrats on the committee suggested that Mr. Rettig could have a conflict of interest stemming from an investment in a Trump property and that he had not been forthcoming in his financial disclosure forms. Mr. Rettig disclosed that he had stakes in rental properties in Honolulu that he bought in 2006 but did not mention that the properties were located in the Waikiki Trump International Hotel and Tower.\u201cMr. Rettig also needs to demonstrate that he will maintain independence from the Trump White House,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cThat\u2019s important with any nominee, but it\u2019s especially relevant in Mr. Rettig\u2019s case, since he owns and rents out condos in a Trump-branded and -managed property.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the finance committee, defended Mr. Rettig and said that accusations of impropriety were silly.\u201cAny suggestion that there is a conflict of interest here is the stuff of conspiracy theories,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cMaybe one wants to argue that Mr. Rettig purchased these properties in 2006, during season five of The Apprentice, on the off chance that Mr. Trump would become president and nominate him to be I.R.S. Commissioner.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Perhaps you no longer even hear the beeping, it has become so integrated into the city\u2019s aural tapestry.For me, however, this sound induces an immediate hyperarousal. My heart races and my blood pressure spikes, like when I\u2019m forced to sample a neighbor\u2019s raisin-infused potato salad at a cookout. My fight-or-flight response kicks in because I\u2019m terrified that the beeping belongs to a tow truck that will snatch my car \u2014 a cruel and bloodless sentinel, sent by an auto-financing company to seek, destroy and repossess.I\u2019ve already paid for my car in full, though. The title sits in the same shoe box in my closet as my passport, birth certificate and a pocket-size Bible I displayed in my living room when I was single, to convince women I was sufficiently yoked.The terror of repossession began one day in November 2012 when I thought my car had been stolen, called the police to file a report and then learned it had been taken by Ally Auto.A spate of late paychecks from the publication where I was employed as a full-time freelancer catalyzed a series of events that forced me to prioritize payments on food, rent, electricity and car insurance. My car payments and cable bill went unpaid for three months.I ignored the dozens of calls from the folks at Ally \u2014 perhaps thinking that if I just pretended I didn\u2019t owe them money, they\u2019d forget. They didn\u2019t.It took a week to scrounge together the money needed to get my car back. I joined a local church\u2019s credit union. I borrowed cash from three friends, telling each the same lie: \u201cThe city towed my car because of unpaid parking tickets.\u201d That was less embarrassing than the truth.For four years afterward, my financial circumstances improved, but in moderate increments. And in the fall of 2016, a stretch of professional fortune \u2014 a very generous book deal and the purchase of my blog by a network \u2014 changed things so sharply I still have whiplash.And yet I still feel the same as I did that morning my car was taken. I don\u2019t have impostor syndrome. I believe I deserve my success. I am, however, waiting for the other shoe to drop. I\u2019m so used to mundane financial setbacks \u2014 an overdraft fee here, a cellphone temporarily disconnected there \u2014 that my new status is too surreal for my brain to accept.Even admitting aloud that I\u2019m not struggling, but thriving, feels egregious, like I\u2019m taunting those sentinels of brokeness, daring them to snatch me from my stoop.I will be 40 in December. And for my first 35 or so years, I was either broke or broke-adjacent, which is another way of saying still broke-ish, but temporarily held together with duct tape.But I am well acquainted with payday loans and check-cashing spots; with food stamps and utility bills in my name as a toddler; with Rent-A-Center and \u201criding dirty\u201d for so long you forget how it feels to be clean; with bright red shut-off notices taped to front doors, knowing that when you\u2019re evicted, landlords don\u2019t usually throw your things out on the sidewalk like in the movies. Instead, you\u2019ll just come home and the locks will be changed.I\u2019m so familiar with the myriad signals of brokeness, and the sub-economy that feeds off the desperation it cultivates, that I can detect when someone is lying to conceal the shame of not having as much money as he or she believes is appropriate. I know it because I\u2019ve done it repeatedly.Some people believe they possess gaydar. I have brokedar.Even now, as I\u2019ve evolved from ashy to nasty to classy enough to shop at Whole Foods instead of going there only for the free samples, I\u2019m the sole person in my immediate family to experience such a change. This makes my new status even more surreal, as if I\u2019m getting Punk\u2019d, which is not an uncommon feeling among black people who\u2019ve undergone similar financial changes.Hundreds of years of structural and intentional anti-black bias have left us with a race-based financial dichotomy so stark that the racial wealth gap looks like a typo. For every $100 in white family wealth, for instance, black families hold just $5.04. (Those four cents feel insulting. We couldn\u2019t even get a full nickel?)But these pressures and angsts just keep the feeling of brokeness fresh and unshakable, stuck to your skin and planted in your head.America shames people who have the audacity to struggle, fastening a scarlet letter to those of us forced to stretch and bend and cheat and break resources just to stay afloat. These days, that\u2019s most of us.But then if you happen to experience some moderate financial fortune (and you also happen to be black), you\u2019re marooned on a paradoxical terra firma where you\u2019re doing much better but somehow left feeling a bit worse. Where the \u201cbeep \u2026 beep\u201d still stirs you in a way it shouldn\u2019t.Maybe this is a good thing. It tethers you to reality and forces you to remain cognizant of how delicate success can be.Advertisement"}

The public education system, perhaps. American high school students can recite Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets, derive advanced calculus theorems, and explain the Chinese spheres of influence. Yet these same students know little to nothing about economics and personal finance. They know of income tax only as the fifth square on the Monopoly board.Currently, only five states \u2014 Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia \u2014 require personal finance courses for high school students. The results speak for themselves: four of these states rank in the top 20 of best average credit card debt. This is a logical correlation. Learning about debt will help someone stay out of it. Yet economists continually blame consumerism and tactics of credit card companies rather than addressing the cause: a fundamental void in our education system.When students graduate high school, they are thrust into adulthood, whether they join the work force or pursue higher education. They assume immense financial responsibilities almost immediately. How can the government expect 19-year-olds to complete tax forms if they\u2019ve never learned about them in school? Young adults who lack basic knowledge of economics and personal finance are vulnerable to fraud, debt, commercialism and worse.In the 2012 New York Times article \u201cBack to Classroom for Skills not Taught in High School,\u201d Matthew R. Warren discusses a personal finance course in the Bronx where students learn vital information not taught in their high schools. Warren quotes 22-year-old student Regina Rice, \u201cI can\u2019t manage my money \u2026 Yesterday, I bought two pairs of headphones, and I don\u2019t even know why.\u201dIdeally, parents with lifelong experience would teach their children about personal finance. But, 61 percent of parents only discuss money when prompted by their children. The average American parent lacks the knowledge necessary to teach this information, as many of them live in severe debt themselves, including the 32 percent of U.S. households that carry credit card debt.The solution? A required course \u2014 Personal Finance and the Modern Economy \u2014 taught to second-semester high school seniors. It\u2019s vital that students learn basic information about taxes, insurance, mortgages, credit, loans, personal banking, consumerism and the stock market before they are forced to learn it the hard way.Financial literacy should not be a privilege reserved for children of the Wall Street elite. It is a skill that must be taught, just as vital in today\u2019s economy as reading, writing and arithmetic. So why do we keep treating it like an elective?Works Cited\u201cT.

{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Look to Profit From Personal-Injury Suits", "Date": "2018-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHedge funds and private-equity firms are deepening their involvement in big-ticket personal-injury lawsuits against drug companies and medical device manufacturers.Investment firms are lending money to law firms that bring so-called mass torts and providing cash advances to plaintiffs involved in such litigation. The activity is increasing just as prosecutors and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny of the industry.Earlier this year, EJF Capital, a $6 billion hedge fund, began raising money for its third investment vehicle that will lend money to lawyers bringing mass-tort cases, according to a February email to prospective investors. The new fund aims to raise $300 million on top of the nearly $450 million the Arlington, Va., hedge fund has already lent to personal injury law firms.EJF was an early mover in the business of financing mass tort litigation. Such loans can carry annual interest rates as high as 18 percent.The field is getting crowded. Wall Street firms and other investors have become go-to financiers for many of these cases, which feature large numbers of plaintiffs who have suffered similar injuries from a consumer product.Adam J. Levitt, an attorney in Chicago who has brought mass-tort cases, said there was an \u201cever-increasing influx of hedge funds into the litigation-funding space.\u201d One cause, he said, is their eagerness for investments that won\u2019t perform in lock step with stock markets or the overall economy.Hedge funds such as Fortress Investment Group, Pravati Capital and Virage Capital Management have lent money to mass-tort law firms in recent years, according to lawyers and lending executives.Marketing documents for EJF\u2019s new fund said the firm saw an opportunity to take advantage of the \u201ccurrent banking regulatory environment,\u201d which has led some banks to pull back from lending to mass-tort firms.Meanwhile, a slew of newer firms \u2014 including hedge funds and those affiliated with hedge funds \u2014 that specialize in lending to mass-tort lawyers are cropping up.Deer Finance, a small Manhattan firm with a board member who works for the hedge fund Fir Tree Partners, began focusing on such loans last year. An Arizona investment firm, Stillwell Madison, signed a financing agreement in 2016 with Girardi Keese, the Los Angeles mass-tort firm involved in the case that the movie \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d made famous.Some hedge funds are considering providing law firms with loans to buy large mass-tort cases from rival firms in order to bulk up their caseloads, according to a person involved in negotiating one such deal.Tom Girardi of Girardi Keese, one of the nation\u2019s most successful mass-tort lawyers, said funding from alternative lenders was necessary to battle companies with unlimited budgets. \u201cIf you are going to fight them, you better have the money to properly present these cases,\u201d he said.The litigation-finance business has been around for a long time, but until recently it was mostly focused on the financing of complex, long-term commercial litigation. The emphasis on bankrolling consumer suits is newer and potentially even more profitable for lenders.Analysts estimate that litigation finance is at least a $10 billion industry, and they expect it to keep growing.As the industry booms, state and federal authorities are beginning to look into a specialized corner that provides high-interest cash advances to litigants waiting for settlements or jury awards.Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn recently opened an investigation into a network of lawyers, finance firms and others that may have lured women into getting unnecessary surgery to remove pelvic mesh implants, according to people familiar with the matter. Removing the implants improved the chances that the women would win large legal settlements from medical device manufacturers.The people familiar with the nascent investigation, who were not authorized to speak publicly about it, said prosecutors had recently asked some lawyers involved in the litigation to hand over transcripts of depositions in which plaintiffs discussed how their mesh-removal surgery was paid for.A spokesman for Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for Brooklyn, declined to comment.In New York, state lawmakers are trying to crack down on finance firms that offer cash advances to litigants, introducing legislation that would cap the interest rates. Critics say that the fine print of these deals is often incomprehensible and that the loans can leave plaintiffs with only a small fraction of the settlement money they thought they would receive.\u201cWe have turned our civil justice system into a profit center, and now the Wall Street sharks are circling,\u201d said Tom Stebbins, executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York, which represents a number of industries. \u201cThey see litigation as a low-risk investment. They see this as a sure thing with so many cases settling.\u201dThe firms say they are serving a valuable role and helping litigants in need of short-term cash while their lawsuits spend years making their way through the legal system.Settlement advances help individuals \u201cmeet pressing financial needs and have the financial wherewithal to pursue cases against often-powerful interests,\u201d said Jim Terlizzi, chief executive of DRB Capital, a company that offers such advances and that is owned by Blackstone Group, the private-equity firm.The broader business of lending to mass-tort firms is also facing growing pressure.Last month, three Republican senators introduced a measure that would require attorneys in class actions and mass torts to disclose if a third party is financing their case.A federal judge in Cleveland overseeing hundreds of mass-tort cases against opioid makers last month ordered plaintiffs\u2019 law firms to disclose any financing they were getting from third parties.Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and investment firms argue that the money the firms provide makes it possible to pursue costly litigation against large companies. But some hedge funds impose higher interest rates if a case drags on too long.Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, said she found that problematic because it \u201cencourages quick settlements that, at least in the mass-tort context, are unlikely to be in plaintiffs\u2019 best interests.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banks Are Paying Out Billions to Shareholders. We Put the Numbers in Context.", "Date": "2018-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s largest banks, back to making big profits a decade after the financial crisis, are set to pay out billions of dollars to their shareholders.After passing, the six largest United States institutions are now free to distribute over $125 billion in stock buybacks and dividend payments. One revealing exercise is to compare the size of the banks\u2019 requested payouts with the profits that analysts expect the banks to make in the second half of this year and the first half of next, the period covered by the capital plans. On average, those six banks plan to distribute 102 percent of their profits to shareholders.Wells Fargo asked to pay out 141 percent of the earnings that Barclays\u2019 analysts expect it to generate over the next 12 months, the highest of the bunch. The Fed, as punishment for a string of scandals, has told Wells Fargo that it cannot increase the size of its balance sheet until the Fed is satisfied that the bank has rectified its problems. As a result, Wells Fargo appears to be paying out capital it might otherwise have used to finance a greater amount of loans. Its payout ratio in 2017 was 99 percent, according to Barclays.Citigroup, whose fortunes have picked up in recent years, could pay out 128 percent of its earnings after the latest stress tests, compared with 119 percent in 2017.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have much lower numbers, 80 percent and 69 percent. To get the Fed\u2019s approval for their capital plans, both firms had to reduce their requested payouts. The two banks\u2019 percentages may be lower because the stress tests effectively leave them with less capital to distribute. And that might happen because the tests may be tougher on Wall Street activities than, say, traditional lending.Another reason may be that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs simply have less excess capital, resulting in there being less to distribute in each stress test cycle.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s have a vote. God willing the Istanbul Canal will be another fresh breath for our city.\u201dThe election is shaping up as an up-or-down vote on how Mr. Erdogan has transformed Turkey during 15 years in charge. He has amassed sultanlike powers, jailed political enemies and trimmed civil liberties, even as average annual economic growth of 5 percent has spawned and nurtured a middle class.But the most obvious way Mr. Erdogan has left his mark stands before the eyes of any visitor: grandiose monuments and infrastructure investments in just about every town.There are signs that the public is weary of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s building mania. The canal is the latest dividing line between those who see Mr. Erdogan\u2019s projects as visionary, and those who say the works are guided by an insatiable construction industry that has enriched his ruling circle, raising questions about his management of a faltering economy.He lists his big canal project in first place on his campaign posters. Not one shovel has been put in the ground, but Mr. Erdogan has vowed to begin construction immediately if he is re-elected as president and assumes sweeping new powers.All of his megaprojects have been about creating symbols of his strength as he aims for a place in the pantheon of great Turkish leaders, from the Ottoman sultans to the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.But the 28-mile canal linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara \u2014 estimated to cost $15 billion, though critics say the figure is closer to $65 billion, and displace some 800,000 people \u2014 has been dubbed his \u201ccrazy idea\u201d since Mr. Erdogan first conceived it seven years ago.\u201cIt means crazy, wow, in a good sense,\u201d said Mehmet Akarca, head of Turkey\u2019s general directorate for press and information and an adviser to the president. \u201cIt will make money, and ships will use it, and they will pay tolls to use it.\u201dThat is the hope, at least, though many doubt whether it will ever happen \u2014 or whether it will work if it does.Environmentalists warn that the canal would damage the ecosystem so much that Istanbul could become uninhabitable. Archaeologists caution that it would threaten a top-class Paleolithic site. Economists say the project is not financially viable.\u201cIt\u2019s like playing Moses,\u201d said Serkan Taycan, an artist and opponent of the canal who has mapped the area that would be disturbed.\u201cOne aspect of the big projects is that they are generating growth,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents say his economic model is dubious, even corrupt.Abdullatif Sener, a former deputy prime minister, has alleged that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s way of governing is all about the profit that the president and his close circle can gain in kickbacks.Mr. Sener was a co-founder of the Justice and Development Party, as was Mr. Erdogan, but he resigned from the party in 2008 because of corruption, he says, and is now running for Parliament with the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party.\u201cThey don\u2019t think about the concerns of the citizens,\u201d Mr. Sener said of the government at a campaign rally in Aziziye, in central Turkey. \u201cThey think about \u2018How can I make my friend, my family, my close circle, my buddy richer.\u2019 With this mentality, this country could not escape disaster.\u201dMr. Erdogan has accused his opponents of peddling lies. \u201cWe invested billions in Istanbul, and now they say we robbed the country?\u201d he said last week at a rally in Istanbul. Others criticize Mr. Erdogan for prioritizing construction over industry and trade, which would generate more income.\u201cWe are not using the resources in the best way to earn money,\u201d Durmus Yilmaz, a former chief of the Turkish central bank and a co-founder of a new opposition party, the Good Party, said in an interview at his home in Ankara.\u201cThis is all financed through foreign borrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cAre these investments generating enough income so we can pay back the loans?\u201dTurkish industry has shrunk since 2002, when Mr. Erdogan first came to power \u2014 to 16 percent of gross domestic product from 22 percent \u2014 and the construction sector has grown in its place.The decline has left new ports and tunnels underutilized and Turkey lacking enough exports to finance its ballooning foreign debt, Mr. Yilmaz said.Then there are the extravagant projects \u2014 such as the presidential palace, four times the size of Versailles \u2014 that seem to be more about Mr. Erdogan\u2019s legacy than profitability.On Istanbul\u2019s highest hill above the Bosporus, Mr. Erdogan is building the white marble Camlica mosque, appointing it with six minarets, the insignia of greatness.Many wonder if he plans to build a mausoleum for himself beside his project, as did the sultans of old.\u201cSome are white elephants, that\u2019s very clear,\u201d said Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at Bilkent University in Ankara.The government has said that growth has been more than 7 percent in the last two quarters, but the economy is already stumbling, Mr. Gurkaynak said.\u201cWe are in recession,\u201d he said, and \u201cwe are going to have a painful recession.\u201dHousing construction has reached its limit, and two million apartments are unsold in the country. Construction work is grinding to a halt, and companies are offering real estate on soft loans or barter.In such a climate, Mr. Gurkaynak said, \u201cCanal Istanbul makes no sense whatsoever and will be impossible to finance.\u201d It does not help that the proposed canal route would run parallel to the Bosporus, where transit is free under the 1936 Montreux Convention.Officials insist there will be enough traffic to make the canal profitable. But Mr. Gurkaynak and others argue that shippers would be unlikely to pay when there is a free passage a few miles away.New oil and gas pipelines are already reducing tanker traffic through the straits, according to a report by Istanbul\u2019s Chamber of Environmental Engineers.The looming pitfalls are familiar. Two of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s much vaunted bridges \u2014 the Osman Gazi Bridge over the Gulf of Izmit, and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, which spans the Bosporus \u2014 have little traffic partly because of the high tolls charged. The government is paying the shortfall.Mr. Akarca, the presidential adviser, defended the projects\u2019 financing system, which has been mostly a variety of public-private partnerships.\u201cTurkey actually is not borrowing any money,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the Turkish firms that are borrowing money; it is individual debt.\u201dBut the government has guaranteed the loans and the revenue, so some economists have said that the financing model is enriching private firms while saddling the country with debt.Other resistance to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s building spree is centered on the environment and conservation.To the horror of archaeologists, Mr. Erdogan started the $4 billion Marmaray railway project beneath Istanbul\u2019s historic peninsula, and built a highway along the Byzantine city walls of a World Heritage site, over Unesco protests.The protests, which left eight people dead and hundreds more injured, drew many citizens to oppose Mr. Erdogan\u2019s headlong drive to modernize Turkey\u2019s cities.Yet instead of listening to them, Mr. Erdogan doubled down on his projects. Taksim became a symbol of his determination to impose his will.\u201cHe needed opponents and victories and symbols,\u201d said Mucella Yapici, an activist and a member of Istanbul\u2019s Chamber of Architects. \u201cTaksim is the most important.\u201dLast month, Istanbul\u2019s cultural center, an emblem of Ataturk\u2019s openness to the West, was pulled down at the site, and a vast domed mosque raised opposite it, dwarfing Ataturk\u2019s statue and robbing the square of its republican nature.\u201cThis is an attempt to erase the collective memory of the space,\u201d Ms. Yapici said.Much more stands to be erased in the canal project \u2014 entire towns and villages, as well as the ecology of Istanbul\u2019s main water source.The greatest concern is the potentially huge inflow of nutrient-rich water from the Black Sea, which scientists say would encourage the growth of algae and kill life in Sea of Marmara.The Bosporus is so deep that it allows a countercurrent. The canal would have no such balancing effect.One scientist has warned that Istanbul will come to stink of bad eggs from hydrogen sulfide. Other environmentalists warn that the vital wetlands used by migratory birds will be destroyed.The government held a single meeting in March with landowners to introduce an environmental impact assessment. It claimed the canal would have negligible effect.Istanbul\u2019s Chamber of Environmental Engineers produced its own assessment, warning that the canal project \u2014 which includes plans for a new city for as many as three million people \u2014 would cause irreversible harm.\u201cIn the long run we will lose the Sea of Marmara and do damage to the Black Sea,\u201d said Sedat Durel, an environmental engineer who worked on the report.Mr. Durel estimated that as many as 800,000 people would be displaced.They include several thousand Crimean Tatars, refugees from the Crimean War who settled in the Sazlidere Valley west of Istanbul 150 years ago, after being granted the land by the sultan of the Ottoman Empire.Their descendants, mostly farmers and factory workers, are anticipating with some dread any official orders to be uprooted again.\u201cOf course the canal is important,\u201d said Oktay Teke, the mayor of Sazlibosna, a village amid meadows beside the river. \u201cBut what about all these villages? What will happen?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Seeks Gag Order on Lawyer for Stormy Daniels", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalling for an end to the \u201cmedia circus\u201d that has engulfed his numerous legal cases, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s longtime personal fixer, has asked a judge in California to keep his adversary, the lawyer Michael Avenatti, from speaking about him in the news media.In a motion filed on Thursday night in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, Mr. Cohen requested that a restraining order be placed on Mr. Avenatti, a lawyer for the pornographic actress Stephanie Clifford, barring him from publicly discussing almost anything about a breach-of-contract lawsuit he had filed against Mr. Cohen.For nearly four months, Mr. Avenatti has been waging both a multifront legal effort and a guerrilla-style publicity campaign against Mr. Cohen, saying he had \u201czero credibility\u201d and repeatedly predicting his indictment. The request for the gag order, which legal experts said Mr. Cohen was unlikely to win, came in a suit in which Mr. Avenatti has accused Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump of breaking a $130,000 nondisclosure deal to keep Ms. Clifford, who is better known as Stormy Daniels, quiet about an affair she claims she had with Mr. Trump.\u201cMr. Avenatti\u2019s actions are mainly driven by his seemingly unquenchable thirst for publicity,\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer in California, Brent Blakely, wrote in the motion to Judge S. James Otero. \u201cMr. Avenatti\u2019s publicity tour, wherein he routinely denigrates Mr. Cohen with claims of alleged criminal conduct, is contrary to the California Rules of Professional Conduct, likely to result in Mr. Cohen being deprived of his right to a fair trial, and threatens to turn what should be a solemn federal court proceeding into a media circus.\u201dMr. Avenatti responded to the gag-order request on Twitter on Thursday night, calling Mr. Cohen\u2019s motion \u201ca complete joke and baseless.\u201d On Friday, Judge Otero refused to issue an immediate emergency ruling on Mr. Cohen\u2019s request, asking for additional papers to be filed in the next two weeks by both sides.In a federal court hearing last month in Manhattan stemming from the criminal investigation, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen complained about statements by Mr. Avenatti, who had sought to appear formally in New York in order to protect any records related to Ms. Clifford that the authorities may have seized when they raided Mr. Cohen\u2019s office, apartment and hotel room in April.Mr. Avenatti immediately withdrew his application to appear and continued his attacks on Mr. Cohen, calling him a \u201cmoron\u201d in an interview this week with Stephen Colbert.For the last two months, the criminal case in Manhattan has been bogged down in a review of the nearly four million files seized from Mr. Cohen, as his lawyers and lawyers for Mr. Trump work with a court-appointed special master to determine which among them are protected by the attorney-client privilege. On Friday, prosecutors told Judge Wood that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal teams would finish their review by June 25. That included some new materials they had only just received \u2014 among them about 700 pages of Mr. Cohen\u2019s encrypted messages, and 16 pages that were pieced together from strips of paper found in one of his shredders.Two legal experts said the odds were heavily against Mr. Cohen\u2019s prevailing in his request to silence Mr. Avenatti.\u201cI think what Cohen\u2019s lawyer is trying to do is to get a second shot at the gag order which Judge Wood was unwilling to grant in the criminal case,\u201d Rebecca Roiphe, a professor of legal ethics and criminal law at New York Law School, said.While Mr. Avenatti\u2019s so-called publicity tour may be good for him, she added, \u201cit\u2019s also good for his client.\u201d She noted that part of what Ms. Clifford is seeking is vindication of her reputation.Stephen Gillers, who teaches legal ethics at New York University School of Law, said, \"Cohen\u2019s problem is that he has cited no case in which a court has imposed any kind of gag order on a lawyer in a civil matter.\u201dProfessor Gillers speculated Mr. Cohen might be hoping that even if Judge Otero denies the motion, he will caution Mr. Avenatti with strong language that could encourage California lawyer disciplinary authorities to examine Mr. Avenatti\u2019s conduct.\u201cSo Cohen will lose, but Avenatti might be chastised, and that might be an acceptable second place prize for Cohen,\u201d Professor Gillers said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In an East Boston Shipyard, a Watershed Idea for Art", "Date": "2018-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow the area is brimming with new construction, and Ms. Medvedow, 63, is leading her institution into another less-trammeled area. At the end of the six-minute boat ride, alighting on a dock in East Boston, Ms. Medvedow strode through an active shipyard and marina. Pointing to the facade of a squat structure sheathed in luminous polycarbonate, she pronounced, \u201cHere\u2019s our Watershed!\u201dAs museums grapple with escalating costs of building and operating huge expansions, Ms. Medvedow\u2019s vision of a nimble seasonal space offers an alternative model of growth.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about ownership; it wasn\u2019t about another new building,\u201d said Ms. Medvedow, who investigated the possibility of expanding the South Boston museum with a bridge into an adjacent office building before determining it was too costly. The price tag for ICA Watershed is a relatively modest $10 million for renovation and five years of programming.Inside, the Watershed \u2014 which opens at the far end to the harbor \u2014 retains a raw industrial character, with train tracks still visible across the floor and an original masonry wall. \u201cWe wanted the architects to keep as much of the history as they could,\u201d Ms. Medvedow said.Another lure is the history of the shipyard, built after the founding of the East Boston Trade Company in 1833 brought new industries to the waterfront. It was once the second-largest point of immigration in America, after Ellis Island. A large Italian community remains, joined by an influx of refugees and immigrants from Central America. More than 50 percent of the population speaks Spanish. The waterfront and harbor, scene of the historic Boston Tea Party, provides a rich context for artists exploring issues from migration to trade to rising sea levels. The Watershed will have free admission, with all information provided in English and Spanish.But with the museum poised to bring thousands of new visitors to a once-isolated part of the city, some residents are anxious about the project\u2019s impact on accelerating gentrification. \u201cTwo blocks down from the Watershed, you\u2019ll see a new complex being built, which is not going to go to the middle-class and blue-collar workers,\u201d said Dublas Vasquez, 19, whose aunt has been pushed out by rising rents. But the museum has been working with his school, he said, getting him and his friends excited about teen programs there.Civic leaders, including Mayor Martin J. Walsh, are monitoring its potential impact as well. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more investment in East Boston, which we\u2019re keeping an eye on because we\u2019re concerned about displacement,\u201d said Mayor Walsh, a Democrat. But he sees Watershed as a boon to the community.\u201cArts and culture bring out everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for the people that are well off, it\u2019s for the poorer folks, it\u2019s for the middle class.\u201dMs. Medvedow, who watched the sleek glass towers and condos gobble up parking lots in the Seaport, sees a difference here. Massport has created parkland on the East Boston waterfront to protect public access. State regulations governing the Boston Harbor Shipyard and Marina allow only 25 percent of the property for non-water-dependent use.\u201cIt\u2019s saying, this is yours, too,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is all Jill.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, workers were traversing the interior of the Watershed on scissor lifts. Ms. Thater, visiting from Los Angeles, was installing her 1999 video, \u201cDelphine,\u201d featuring huge underwater images of dolphins swimming with abandon in a four-sided projection angled across walls, floor and ceiling. \u201cIt is essentially a cube that\u2019s been tilted,\u201d Ms. Thater said. The twist in space mimics the torquing movement of the dolphins.\u201cDiana reorients how we typically experience moving images,\u201d said Eva Respini, the museum\u2019s chief curator, who selected Ms. Thater. In this immersive turquoise environment, visitors\u2019 shadows merge with the silhouettes of dolphins as they swim up toward the sun. The artist has installed colored gels on a long thin skylight, to give museumgoers the sensation of walking through a rainbow.\u201cIt makes this super-muscular space quite ethereal,\u201d Ms. Respini said.\u201cLet\u2019s make it girlie,\u201d Ms. Thater said, smiling.\u201cI shot them at a magic hour because I wanted this feeling of eternity,\u201d Ms. Thater said. \u201cTheir time is now so short.\u201dMs. Medvedow said she hoped visitors would draw a poetic connection between the fragility of ocean life and the shipyard.The museum sponsors the private ferry service, a new mode of transportation on the harbor. By the second year of the Watershed, Ms. Medvedow hopes public ferry service will be in place. \u201cThat is one of my civic goals for this project,\u201d she said, \u201cso it\u2019s not the job of a moderate-sized contemporary art museum to run water transportation.\u201dSitting outdoors at a restaurant in the shipyard, Ms. Medvedow was describing the neighborhood when a young man listening from the next picnic table interjected. \u201cMaritime life is going away with everything coming into the shipyard,\u201d he said, somewhat confrontationally.The director quickly introduced herself \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m Jill from the ICA\u201d \u2014 and shook the hand of the man, who said his name was Dan. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to join you over here and hope you will check us out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m literally next door,\u201d he said. \u201cJust thinking about my job, that\u2019s all.\u201dAs he walked away, Ms. Medvedow said, \u201cEveryone\u2019s experiencing this from where they live.\u201d She paused. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re all believing in contemporary art as the great thing,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ve devoted my life to it, but it\u2019s got to resonate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brother-in-Law of Spain\u2019s King Must Go to Prison, Court Rules", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s Supreme Court upheld a prison sentence on Tuesday for I\u00f1aki Urdangarin, the brother-in-law of King Felipe VI, in a fraud case that rocked the monarchy and could send a member of the country\u2019s royal family to prison for the first time in modern history.The lower court had found Princess Cristina, Mr. Urdangarin\u2019s wife and the king\u2019s sister, not guilty of criminal charges, but fined her about $312,000 for her involvement in her husband\u2019s businesses. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court cut that amount in half.The case dates to 2011, when an investigation was begun into Mr. Urdangarin\u2019s business activities, which mostly involved organizing sports events for regional governments. The probe was initially prompted by huge cost overruns for the construction of a cycling track on Majorca.It focused on the financing of his nonprofit foundation, the N\u00f3os Institute, on whose board Princess Cristina sat, and a real estate company, Aizoon, which the royal couple co-owned. Eventually, Mr. Urdangarin and his business partners were accused of embezzling more than $7 million.Mr. Urdangarin was found guilty of several fraud-related charges. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court overturned one of those guilty verdicts, for falsifying documents \u2014 and reduced his sentence accordingly \u2014 but left the others in effect.Mr. Urdangarin and his family have in recent years been living in Geneva, where he has been appearing monthly before Swiss authorities, pending a ruling on his appeal in Spain. Mr. Urdangarin still has a final, slim chance of avoiding or delaying incarceration, if he appeals to Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court and that court agrees to reopen the case.The Supreme Court upheld the imprisonment of Mr. Urdangarin\u2019s main business partner, Diego Torres, but reduced his sentence by almost three years, to five years and eight months. The most prominent politician found guilty in the case, Jaume Matas, the former regional president of the Balearic Islands, will serve three years and eight months in prison.Felipe became king after the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos, in 2014, by which time Mr. Urdangarin had already been cut off from the royal household. King Felipe then also cut the royal family\u2019s public ties with Cristina, as part of his efforts to fight corruption, increase transparency and improve the tainted image of the monarchy.The princess was stripped by royal decree of the title of duchess of Palma, but she has kept her succession rights, which put her sixth in line to the throne. She married Mr. Urdangarin, a former Olympic handball player, in 1997.The trial gripped the nation, and in 2016, it forced Princess Cristina to become the first member of the royal family to appear in court in modern Spanish history. But it is only one of several political corruption scandals involving money embezzled by Spanish politicians and their business partners, most of which surfaced after the bursting of Spain\u2019s construction bubble in 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betting on Crisis, Hedge Funds Short Italian Bonds", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive Star politicians, including the group\u2019s founder and current leader, pondered such radical cures to Italy\u2019s economic woes as restructuring its enormous debt and establishing a currency in addition to the euro.\u201cIt was clear to me then that these guys wanted to renegotiate the status quo in Europe,\u201d said Mr. Ondruch, the founder of Astellon Capital Partners, an investment manager based in London. In the months after the conference, he increased his bet that the prices of Italian bonds would fall sharply. \u201cI am surprised it took the markets so long to wake up to this,\u201d he said.The prices of Italian stocks and bonds plunged, and yields on short-term bonds rocketed to 2.7 percent from 0.24 percent. The euro\u2019s value relative to the dollar fell to an 11-month low.For hedge funds that were wagering on a new Italian debt crisis, the market turmoil was a profit bonanza. And they are betting there is more to come.Hedge funds have been building up their short positions for months, betting that Italian bonds will face another bout of selling pressure once investors recognize that the new government might consider taboo topics such as adopting a currency other than the euro and restructuring Italy\u2019s debt.Call it the return of the bond vigilantes \u2014 a term for investors who sell the bonds of governments when they run big deficits and appear to have unsustainable debt burdens.From 2010 to 2012, a parade of investors, deeply skeptical about the eurozone\u2019s ability to hold together, wagered that the bonds of debt-plagued countries like Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain would keep falling. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy as pension funds, mutual funds and banks sold these suddenly risky securities.The Continentwide fire sale was halted only when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, put in place an aggressive program to buy the bonds, which made their prices soar and their interest rates fall.Now, as the E.C.B.\u2019s bond-purchasing program draws to a close, the same strains that prompted the earlier bout of selling \u2014 weaker countries running up potentially unsustainable debts \u2014 are showing again.In Italy, for example, the new government is promising an aggressive spending program to spur the country\u2019s stagnant economy. The populists are not deterred by the fiscal restraints imposed on eurozone countries by Brussels.\u201cThese people feel very strongly that deficit limits make no sense,\u201d said Jens Nordvig, the founder of Exante Data, a financial research firm that provides trading ideas to hedge funds.Many large investors, he said, now \u201chave a short bias\u201d toward Italy, believing that a clash between Rome and Brussels over eurozone rules and regulations could lead to a sell-off. If Italy flouts European deficit restrictions, for example, investors and large banks are likely to sell the government\u2019s bonds, fearing deep losses.Mr. Nordvig said that a robust market for futures contracts tied to Italian government bonds had made it easy to bet against Italy. Futures contracts oblige an investor to buy or sell an asset at a specified date in the future. The popularity of the futures market in Italian bonds means it is simpler and cheaper than before to place speculative bets about coming price swings.According to Eurex, Europe\u2019s main exchange for trading derivatives, volume in short-term Italian bond futures was up 33 percent through April of this year compared with the same period in 2017.In addition to betting against bonds, many prominent hedge funds are calculating that the share prices of large Italian companies will fall drastically.For example, Bridgewater, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, has a number of short positions on Italian financial institutions, including UniCredit, Italy\u2019s biggest bank, according to data from Consob, Italy\u2019s financial regulator. Other funds betting against Italian companies include Steven Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management, Marshall Wace in London and the quantitative specialist AQR Capital Management. Bridgewater, Point72 and Marshall Wace declined to comment.Mr. Ondruch\u2019s Italian trade has been one of his most profitable positions this year. He has since pared his bet, pocketing the profit, but expects to make a similar wager soon.\u201cWhat we have had so far is a political event, not a credit event,\u201d he said, referring to the point when a country runs out of money. \u201cThe endgame is still 12 to 24 months out.\u201dWhat has spooked investors the most has been the Italian ruling party\u2019s flirtation with a second currency. Since the dire days of the Greek crisis, economists and bankers have floated the idea of another currency for highly indebted eurozone countries. Strapped Greek and Italian citizens could use this alternate currency to pay taxes and for things like gasoline or health care from the state.Such proposals have been opposed by officials in Brussels as a first step to abandoning the euro.The topic was taken up with gusto at the Five Star conference last year.\u201cIt was scary \u2014 it looked to me like a Plan B to get out of the euro,\u201d said Massimo Bonansinga, a portfolio manager for CI Investments, a fund management firm based in Toronto.But unlike many of his peers, Mr. Bonansinga took the view that more moderate minds would prevail and that an Italian government would not take such drastic steps.Accordingly, he has stuck by his investments in Italian stocks.\u201cItaly is a conservative country,\u201d Mr. Bonansinga said. \u201cI am just not sure that people want to leave the euro.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of New York Public Housing: An Oral History", "Date": "2018-06-26", "News": "No heat. Leaking roofs. Mold and pests. New York City public housing has become synonymous with dilapidated living conditions. But it wasn\u2019t always like this.No heat. Leaking roofs. Mold and pests. Interminable waits for basic repairs.Public  housing in New York City has become synonymous with the dilapidated living conditions many of its more than 400,000 residents have endured in recent years. To understand how Nycha arrived at this point, we combed through our photo archives for forgotten images and spoke to longtime residents, former housing officials, historians and others about the housing authority\u2019s often overlooked and surprising eight-decade history.  That story, in their words, is below.Nycha was founded in 1934 as Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia\u2019s antidote to the shoddy tenements of New York City\u2019s housing crisis during the Great Depression. Public housing was trumpeted as the duty of progressive government, and the swift construction of sprawling complexes became a slum-clearing machine that reshaped the city\u2019s urban landscape. But Nycha developments were not poorhouses: Unlike other cities, New York effectively barred lower-income residents from public housing. From 1953 to 1968, it excluded most residents on welfare by screening applicants using a list of  moral  factors, including alcoholism, irregular work history, single motherhood and lack of furniture.[Nycha]  was a creation of liberal politics in New York. In the depth of the Depression there had to be jobs and housing that people could afford. They were relatively low-rise walk-ups built to extraordinarily high-quality standards. Basically, as good or better as middle-class housing. They were built for a very carefully-selected tenancy, mostly working families that even during the Depression had no social service background or history. When my mother came, only white people lived here, until the 1950s.  In my day, the staff was the best. They had their job, they did their job, and they were qualified for their job. You\u2019d call, and it would be fixed right away. The amazing thing about New York is the scale of this. You have 69 projects with over 1,000 units by the 1960s. That\u2019s amazing, and these are enormous developments that are created. Maintaining such a big system was already a challenge, but by then it was too late. The genie had left the bottle.Nycha was housing about 500,000 New Yorkers by the sixties. Minority residents now outnumbered whites, but the percentage of tenants on welfare was just half the national average for public housing.However, the authority\u2019s robust management capabilities, financial resources and tough policing kept it afloat while public housing in the rest of the nation spiraled into disrepair and demolishment.The number of social issues increased significantly. The challenge managerially went up. They had to replace an enormous number of windows, and elevator maintenance became much more difficult because of the vandalism. It was a break-and-repair kind of cycle.There would be mailboxes bashed into and broken. Because back then, everyone was getting paper checks, for their jobs or welfare. So you could cash them in anywhere. It didn\u2019t matter who you were.Obviously the authority had much more staff at that time. We had 17,000 employees, not including the 2,700 police officers. The authority at that time had its own police force. My impression in those days is that there was a lot of capacity. There wasn\u2019t unlimited money. We couldn\u2019t renovate every building out there, but if a problem came along there was enough money to address that particular problem.As New York falls apart in the 1970s, in ways that have been largely forgotten, the housing authority\u2019s projects were anchors of stability and safety. They were places that you wanted to get into as the neighborhoods were deteriorating around you. All of this changes in the late 1980s. The 1980s is the first time when you\u2019re more at risk of criminal violence on Nycha property than you are in the surrounding neighborhood. When the crack epidemic came, it took over. There were fights everyday, shootouts everyday, people playing music outside of your building to get someone out to fight. It was a very small percentage of bad actors having a huge impact on the quality of life for hard-working people. We always felt like we were the underdogs. We were doing the most difficult job in the city while at the same time being looked down upon as second-class for not being N.Y.P.D.Every place you step, you would step on a crack bottle, back in the \u201980s, a long time ago. In Grant, you would be afraid to walk down the steps because they had a bunch of crack bottles and they get stuck in the groove of your shoe.At that time, cameras were not prevalent to the extent that they are now. We also had a fairly active tenant patrol where residents would volunteer and sit in lobbies and check in people coming in and out. The first day on patrol in the Farragut Houses, I got hit with a  padlock. It grazed my face. There were some people that did not want us there because we were interfering with their business. I saw objects as big as a living room couch thrown off the roof of a building onto a police car. Those were the bad old days. You don\u2019t hear those stories anymore.By the turn of the century, the idea of government as landlord went out of fashion. Suddenly, Nycha became a victim of disinvestment as  all levels of  government steered billions of dollars away from the agency. Everything is getting old at once, because everything was kind of built at once. So it\u2019s like a 30-year window where almost all of public housing was built, and now we\u2019re in that 30-year window where it\u2019s going to be totally revamped or redeveloped. A lot of these buildings have had more than your normal wear and tear.They stopped doing preventive maintenance, which led to a lot of boilers not working. You have to service the boilers in the summer so they\u2019re ready for the winter, and that stopped being done because they didn\u2019t have the staff to do it.Now, it\u2019s different. It takes time, because there\u2019s a backlog. I called for a paint job in May and they\u2019re coming in August. It can take months for anything.Recently, we didn\u2019t have hot water for three days. So you couldn\u2019t take a bath or shower. It was built under a model where tenant incomes would increase, and thus rents would increase in proportion. But the thing in New York, as in other cities, is that the income of the residents in public housing, as opposed to the private market, have not kept pace with society or the cost of maintaining these buildings.I did some things that were kind of radical. I raised rents, but I did it in a way that really took people\u2019s fixed incomes into consideration.Sandy\u2019s effect on Nycha put the icing on the cake. Nycha was in decay already. Hurricane Sandy and the developments that it hit really devastated the properties, because the boilers and electricity were located in the basements. Sandy came in and really finished the job \u2014 in the Rockaways, in Coney Island, in the Lower East Side.The authority doesn\u2019t have the reputation it had 30 years ago. It was considered the best large housing authority in the United States. People wanted to work for us. People wanted to live there. It was a better attitude all-around.In the seventies it was great. They would fix up anything that you needed. They used to have two people working in each building. We don\u2019t have that anymore.Still today, with all its problems, Nycha hasn\u2019t folded. Part of that is because of demand for housing in New York, of course. But it\u2019s amazing how they\u2019ve been able to adapt to attrition. It remains a model of how to survive. I\u2019m heartbroken because this is an important resource for poor people in New York City.John Surico and Sandra E.

{"Headline": "How the Koch Brothers Are Killing Public Transit Projects Around the Country", "Date": "2018-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 A team of political activists huddled at a Hardee\u2019s one rainy Saturday, wolfing down a breakfast of biscuits and gravy. Then they descended on Antioch, a quiet Nashville suburb, armed with iPads full of voter data and a fiery script. \u201cDo you agree that raising the sales tax to the highest rate in the nation must be stopped?\u201d Samuel Nienow, one of the organizers, asked a startled man who answered the door at his ranch-style home in March. \u201cCan we count on you to vote \u2018no\u2019 on the transit plan?\u201dIn cities and counties across the country \u2014 including Little Rock, Ark.; Phoenix, Ariz.; southeast Michigan; central Utah; and here in Tennessee \u2014 the Koch brothers are fueling a fight against public transit, an offshoot of their longstanding national crusade for lower taxes and smaller government. Early polling here had suggested that the $5.4 billion transit plan would easily pass. It was backed by the city\u2019s popular mayor and a coalition of businesses. Its supporters had outspent the opposition, and Nashville was choking on cars.But the outcome of the May 1 ballot stunned the city: a landslide victory for the anti-transit camp, which attacked the plan as a colossal waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. The Kochs\u2019 opposition to transit spending stems from their longstanding free-market, libertarian philosophy. It also dovetails with their financial interests, which benefit from automobiles and highways. \u201cStopping higher taxes is their rallying cry,\u201d said Ashley Robbins, a researcher at Virginia Tech who follows transportation funding. \u201cBut at the end of the day, fuel consumption helps them.\u201d\u201cOur decisions are based on what is most likely to help people improve their lives, regardless of the policy and its effect on our bottom line,\u201d he said. Koch Industries has opposed steel tariffs, for example, even though the company owns a steel mill in Arkansas, he said. The group\u2019s Nashville victory followed a roller-coaster political campaign, including a sex-and-spending scandal that led to the mayor\u2019s resignation. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more effective than actually having a human conversation with someone on events that affect them on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Akash Chougule, policy director at Americans for Prosperity, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for us to activate people in their own backyards, and we\u2019re among the first to do it in a sustained, permanent way.\u201dThe vote was set for May 1. The team that gathered at Hardee\u2019s in March, two weeks after Ms. Barry\u2019s resignation, was led by Ms. Venable and Mr. Nienow of Americans for Prosperity. Other canvassers that morning included a local Tea Party leader and a lawyer-turned-fantasy-novelist who writes about a young witch who pushes back against an authoritarian government.\u201cIt\u2019s the concept of opportunity cost,\u201d said Mr. Nienow. Their data zeroed in on people thought to be anti-tax or anti-transit and likely to vote.On a laptop in her S.U.V., Ms. Venable tracked, in real time, the progress of the four pairs working that day. By 4:30 p.m. they had knocked on 230 doors and connected with 66 people, a success rate of 29 percent. \u201cExcellent,\u201d she said.In another line of attack, he also argues that ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are the future of transportation, not buses and trains. \u201cWhy would anybody ride transit when they can get a ride at their door within a minute that will drop them off at the door where they want to go?\u201d he said in an interview. Asked whether low-income people could afford to use Uber instead of a bus, he said that subsidizing their rides would still be more cost-effective.In Nashville, Americans for Prosperity played a major role: organizing door-to-door canvassing teams using iPads running the i360 software. Those in-kind contributions can be difficult to measure. According to A.F.P.\u2019s campaign finance disclosure, the group made only one contribution, of $4,744, to the campaign for \u201ccanvassing expenses.\u201dInstead, a local group, NoTax4Tracks, led the Nashville fund-raising. Nearly three-quarters of the $1.1 million it raised came from a single nonprofit, Nashville Smart Inc., which is not required to disclose donors. The rest of the contributions to NoTax4Tracks came from wealthy local donors, including a local auto dealer.Both NoTax4Tracks and Nashville Smart declined to fully disclose their funding. After Ms. Barry\u2019s resignation, Nashville\u2019s pro-transit movement struggled. Its messaging became muddled, strategists said, with supporters claiming that the plan would do everything: create jobs, benefit the environment and even boost the health and wellness of residents. Ultimately, the pro-transit camp failed to fend off criticism that the plan benefited a gentrifying downtown at the expense of more distant lower-income and minority areas. \u201cIf everyone\u2019s going to pay for it, everyone needs to benefit,\u201d said Rev. Jeff Obafemi Carr, who threw his support behind the opposition campaign and mobilized African-American voters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art Is Becoming a Financial Product, and Blockchain Is Making It Happen", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s not Wall Street,\u201d Alain Servais, a Belgian collector, former investment banker and one of the speakers at the conference, said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think art can be considered as an asset class.\u201d He pointed to the art market\u2019s lack of liquidity and regulation and to the ability of trade insiders to control the prices of certain highly collectible names. \u201cThese are wealthy people\u2019s toys,\u201d he said.But to what extent has the art market been \u201cfinancialized,\u201d in the way that a Wall Street investor would recognize?The lack of liquidity and regulation, together with opacity, volatility, high transaction costs, cyclical trading patterns and a relatively small scale, has long been among the reasons institutional investment houses have shied away from the art market.But wealthy individuals from the world of finance are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about art as a way to increase their capital.\u201cMuch of today\u2019s most dynamic wealth creation comes from hedge funds, private equity and real estate,\u201d said Evan Beard, a national art services executive at U.S. Trust, a wealth management unit of Bank of America. \u201cNone of our clients are buying art for investment. But they\u2019re savvy with credit, and art is a capital asset.\u201dMr. Beard said that Bank of America has about $6.5 billion of art-secured loans on its books and that clients have used much of this liquidity to capitalize their businesses.And then there is the money that savvy financier-collectors can make out of auction guarantees. Mr. Beard said that more than 10 of his wealthy clients routinely guarantee works at Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips. They take the risk of being the only bidder and owning the artwork in return for a fee or a percentage of the \u201coverage\u201d if the bidding exceeds an agreed-upon price.\u201cThey\u2019ll guarantee three paintings in a season they\u2019d like to buy and will be happy to own one of them if the overage on the others gives them a good discount,\u201d Mr. Beard said.\u201cGuarantees used to be a gentlemen\u2019s club, but now they\u2019re greatly extended,\u201d Mr. Danziger said. \u201cAuctions have become a public forum for private transactions,\u201d he added, referring to how it has become routine for at least a third of lots at evening contemporary sales to have been \u201cpresold\u201d to external guarantors.With plentiful liquidity available from the major banks, and millions to be made from auction guarantees, wealthy collectors can make art a lucrative asset without having to go anywhere near the art finance industry.One of several start-ups that have explored the idea of \u201cfractionalizing\u201d art, Maecenas will divide 49 percent of the value of an artwork into shares, which can then be bought and sold on the company\u2019s blockchain trading platform. Shares will initially be priced at $10,000 each, according to Miguel Neumann, one of the company\u2019s founding partners, who comes from an investment banking background.It remains to be seen how many investors will want to speculate in shares derived from works owned by galleries and collectors. The art market, after all, despite its shortcomings, is still democratic enough that people can buy and actually own works for less than $10,000 that turn out to be good investments.But there are also people, such as Duncan MacDonald-Korth, one of the co-authors of the DACS \u201cArt Market 2.0\u201d report, who remain convinced that the technological integrity of blockchain will eventually transform the art market.\u201cThe stakes are getting so high,\u201d Mr. MacDonald-Korth said in a telephone interview, referring to the skyrocketing amounts being paid for trophy works of art. \u201cThe higher the values get, the more incentive there will be for the market to be properly financialized.\u201d He envisages a large-scale trading platform on which investment banks and hedge funds will be able to trade fractions of art in digital currency. \u201cWe\u2019re in a special moment in the economics of the art market.\u201dWhat this moment will mean for art itself is anyone\u2019s guess.Advertisement"}

Cohen has ensnared the publisher of The National Enquirer, further thrusting the media company into a federal inquiry involving a onetime top lieutenant to a sitting president.Prosecutors with the Southern District of New York subpoenaed executives at the publisher, American Media, this spring, according to people who have been briefed about the move but agreed to share the details about it only on the condition of anonymity.The people familiar with the investigation said prosecutors sought similar communications from Mr. Howard and Mr. Pecker.In a statement on Wednesday, the tabloid publisher said, \u201cAmerican Media Inc. has, and will continue to, comply with any and all requests that do not jeopardize or violate its protected sources or materials pursuant to our First Amendment rights.\u201dEven with this administration\u2019s heated invective against the news media, federal subpoenas of media companies remain exceedingly rare. Justice Department officials tend to approve them only after a deliberative process at the agency\u2019s highest levels.Several First Amendment lawyers said in interviews that the situation involving American Media and Mr. Cohen was equally unusual.Mr. Pecker has acknowledged being friends with Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump. American Media\u2019s deal with Ms. McDougal \u2014 including buying the exclusive rights to her story about Mr. Trump, which it did not publish \u2014 was what is known in the tabloid world as a \u201ccatch and kill.\u201dAmerican Media has denied any wrongdoing. And Mr. Pecker has portrayed the deal with Ms. McDougal as a business arrangement, noting that it also included rights to use her on its magazine covers and to publish fitness columns under her name.At the Federal Election Commission, American Media is facing claims that the payment to Ms. McDougal constituted an illegal political contribution to Mr. Trump, meant to stanch negative publicity against him during the campaign.Political donations to candidates are capped at $5,400 per individual during election cycles, and candidates may not receive money directly from corporate treasuries. American Media has denied that the payment constituted a contribution.\u201cAny time that a news organization is being subpoenaed, as a First Amendment lawyer, that raises a red flag,\u201d said Mark Bailen, an attorney at BakerHostetler in Washington. \u201cThe question is, is this related to the editorial enterprise, or is it related to the business enterprise, or even a personal consideration for one of the employees or publishers or owners or executives of the company? That would take it out of the realm of having a direct newsroom impact.\u201dThe main concern, he said, is \u201cprotecting reporters from having to turn over state\u2019s evidence at the whim of the government.\u201dNews of the subpoena was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Issue Rule That Weakens Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2018-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is poised to issue a sweeping rule that makes it easier for small businesses to band together to create health insurance plans that skirt many requirements of the Affordable Care Act, offering lower costs but also fewer benefits.The final rule is to be unveiled Tuesday, administration officials and congressional aides said.President Trump has said millions of people could get cheaper coverage from the new \u201cassociation health plans.\u201d But consumer groups and many state officials are opposed, saying the new plans will siphon healthy people out of the Affordable Care Act marketplace, driving up costs for those who need comprehensive insurance.The new entities would be exempt from many of the consumer protections mandated by the Affordable Care Act. They may, for example, not have to provide certain \u201cessential health benefits\u201d like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.The rule will allow small-business owners, their employees, sole proprietors and other self-employed people to join together to buy or provide insurance in the large-group market through association health plans.Because they will be exempt from many onerous requirements of the 2010 health law, Mr. Trump has said, the association health plans can \u201cprovide more affordable health insurance options to many Americans, including hourly wage earners, farmers, and the employees of small businesses and entrepreneurs that fuel economic growth.\u201dThe new health plans might, for example, appeal to restaurant workers, real estate agents, dry cleaners, florists, plumbers and painters, officials said.The new rule takes a step toward fulfilling Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to make it easier for companies to sell insurance across state lines.\u201cThe new rule will allow national trade associations to offer insurance to their employer members in multiple states,\u201d said Christopher E. Condeluci, an employee benefits lawyer who used to work for Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cSmall employers and independent contractors will be able to get coverage through group health plans, just like the insurance offered by large employers.\u201dRepublicans in Congress have been trying for two decades to promote association health plans through legislation. The House passed a bill that included such plans in 1998, but it died in the Senate. President George W. Bush tried again in 2003 and 2004. The House passed a bill last year to authorize such health plans. And Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has championed a similar bill in the Senate.Now the Trump administration is using its regulatory authority to accomplish what Congress could not.Trade groups like the National Restaurant Association, the National Retail Federation and the National Federation of Independent Business have supported association health plans and could potentially sponsor them.But consumer groups, state officials and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have long opposed such ideas. They say association health plans will tend to attract employers with younger, healthier workers, leaving behind sicker people in more comprehensive, more expensive plans that fully comply with the Affordable Care Act.That could drive up premiums, which have increased as Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have undercut many elements of the law, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.People with serious illnesses like cancer could face \u201cever-increasing premiums for comprehensive coverage,\u201d said Chris Hansen, the president of the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society.The Labor Department says it has identified many \u201cunscrupulous promoters who sell the promise of inexpensive health benefit insurance, but default on their obligations.\u201dThe Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, representing insurers, consumers and law enforcement officials, met last month with Trump administration officials and emphasized the need for states to have a strong role in combating possible fraud by association health plans.In another move this summer, Mr. Trump is expected to issue a final rule expanding access to \u201cshort term, limited duration\u201d insurance, allowing such policies to run for 364 days, instead of the current limit of three months.These short-term plans \u2014 originally intended for people between jobs \u2014 are cheaper than comprehensive insurance, provide fewer benefits and would also be exempt from many requirements of the Affordable Care Act.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bridgewater Plans to Become a Partnership as Ray Dalio Takes a Step Back", "Date": "2018-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, has long been tightly controlled by its founder, Ray Dalio, and his top two lieutenants. That is about to change.In the coming months, the firm will reshape itself, becoming a partnership that will give its top executives significantly more say in how the $150 billion fund is run.The new partnership model, which was announced to employees and clients on Thursday, is the latest step in a plan for Mr. Dalio, 68, to play less of a day-to-day role managing the company over the next decade.But Bridgewater was far from a democracy. Final decisions rested with Mr. Dalio and the two other primary owners of the firm, his fellow co-chief investment officers, Bob Prince and Greg Jensen. By switching to a partnership model, other senior executives throughout the firm will get both an economic stake in the business and a vote in how it is managed. It is the sort of partnership that once dominated finance, akin to the model at the consulting giant McKinsey & Company or at Goldman Sachs before it went public in 1999.\u201cThis will both broaden the ownership across the firm and help us remain employee controlled for generations to come,\u201d Bridgewater\u2019s co-chief executives, David McCormick and Eileen Murray, wrote in a letter to clients that was reviewed by DealBook.What it won\u2019t mean, at least in the near term, is a move to take the company public, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The firm has already brought in some outside investors, including the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, as well as Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and the International Monetary Fund. Bridgewater executives believe those investments provided enough cash to eliminate the need to raise money through an initial public offering, these people said.The partnership model is meant to create what Bridgewater executives have described as a \u201ccontinuously improving perpetual motion machine,\u201d able to keep operating long after Mr. Dalio leaves.That day is far off. Mr. Dalio has said he intends to remain co-chief investment officer for as long as possible, though he has sought to cut back on managing the company\u2019s operations.It is unclear whether putting more power in the hands of the firm\u2019s senior employees would ultimately change its culture, or whether some of Mr. Dalio\u2019s more unusual management methods \u2014 he requires meetings to be recorded, for example, so that all employees can later view them \u2014 might disappear.Last year, Mr. Dalio gave up his title of co-chief executive, handing day-to-day management responsibilities to Mr. McCormick and Ms. Murray.That won\u2019t change. But under the plan announced on Thursday, Bridgewater will begin rolling out the concept of \u201cemployee partners\u201d for those who already own what is known as phantom equity, entitling them to cuts of the firm\u2019s profits without being owners of the firm.Initially, Bridgewater will have two classes of partnerships. A handful of senior employees have been chosen as so-called seed partners, including Mr. McCormick and Ms. Murray, who have begun laying out the contours of what the partnership will ultimately look like. That will include the financial arrangements, which haven\u2019t yet been set.Then there is a bigger group of 50 provisional partners, whose job will be to represent the broader group of phantom equity holders and work with the seed partners on finalizing the terms of the partnership.The final details of how Bridgewater\u2019s partnership works haven\u2019t been set, and it will be up to its prospective members to decide how to govern themselves. But the expectation is that they will start gaining more power over the next six months.\u201cConsistent with our way of operating, we are providing transparency of this progress to our employees and our clients and we look forward to sharing further details as they emerge,\u201d Mr. McCormick and Ms. Murray wrote in the letter to clients.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Biography Charts an Odysseus Sidelined by Mental Illness", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Kevin Hall is something of an American Odysseus: a stalwart sailor of treacherous seas, on a noble mission. A hero of strength and character whose great obsessive quest (an Olympic gold medal in high-speed, high-risk catamaran sailing) is stymied and at last crushed by enigmatic forces unleashed from within his brain and body. A near-embodiment of the proverb sometimes attributed to Sophocles: \u201cThose whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.\u201dHall is the subject of Mary Pilon\u2019s second book, \u201cThe Kevin Show: An Olympic Athlete\u2019s Battle With Mental Illness.\u201d It follows her 2015 best seller, \u201cThe Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the World\u2019s Favorite Board Game.\u201d Before that, Pilon had been a prolific magazine journalist and a producer for NBC Sports.Both the virtues and the defects of her immersion in the world of pop culture are on display here. The virtues offer satisfying recreational reading with moments of deep engagement. The defects tend to anesthetize the reader to the nature, provenance and consequences of chronic mental illness. Thus, while engrossing, thanks to its larger-than-life subject, the book misses an opportunity to consummate the promise of its subtitle.When Pilon writes about Hall\u2019s aspirations as an Olympic athlete, the book is absorbing and empathetic. Hall emerges as a kind of American/Athenian ideal, a man of superb intellectual and physical gifts. He is the son of two medical doctors and is a 1991 graduate of Brown University with honors degrees in mathematics and French literature. His powers of mind and body persist even as each is under attack. In the midst of his competitive sailing career, Hall manages to rebuild his elite athlete\u2019s body after each of two separate and unrelated operations for testicular cancer: the first in 1990, when he was 21; the second in the Christmas season of 1992, after which his weight dropped.Hall competed in the world\u2019s most demanding nautical races, including the 2004 Olympics and three America\u2019s Cup events, over a 29-year stretch. He left competitive sailing in 2013 after surviving the tragic capsizing of the high-speed catamaran Artemis on San Francisco Bay during a test run for the America\u2019s Cup. A crewmate, Andrew Simpson, who was known as Bart, was killed. Hall now lives with his wife, Amanda, in Auckland, New Zealand. He never realized his dream of winning an Olympic gold medal.Pilon is a paragon of dogged research. She\u2019s best in reconstructing (via hundreds of hours of interviews) the intertwined life struggles of Hall, his steadfast sweetheart and eventual wife, his vexed parents and some denizens of the competitive sailing world. Her attempts to reach Hall\u2019s \u201cinner world\u201d display levels of empathy that touch the heart, even though they are not always successful.She offers insights into the engineering, construction and navigation of the fast-evolving catamarans themselves: technological, corporate-financed marvels equipped with winglike foils \u201cthat make the entire vessel fly above the water.\u201dIt is, oddly, in the sections of the book about mental illness \u2014 the book\u2019s core, the passages that set Hall apart from a long line of star-crossed athletes, the Golden Fleece of Pilon\u2019s own quest \u2014 that prove the least satisfying, and, occasionally, the most annoying.Early on, we learn that during his college years, Hall begins to be haunted by a persistent delusion: that his life is an ongoing \u201creality show,\u201d with unseen cameras and microphones picking up his every move and utterance for the delectation of a worldwide television audience. Things are somehow orchestrated by an equally chimerical entity, the Director. \u201cLess of a voice,\u201d Hall would say later, \u201cthan a vapor of energy, a sense of will that came from another place surrounding Planet Earth.\u201d The Director has a plan for him, or rather a series of plans, that he was to carry out to \u201chelp create world peace and harmony.\u201dThis is \u201cThe Kevin Show\u201d of the book\u2019s title (a play on \u201cThe Truman Show,\u201d the 1998 Peter Weir satire that starred Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, the unsuspecting star of a lifetime reality show constructed by a television production company).The Director\u2019s fanciful demands propel Hall, the show\u2019s \u201cstar,\u201d into a series of delusional actions \u2014 leaping from a tree in Boston to land in front of a stranger whom he believed to be his \u201cOphelia,\u201d crossing a busy street in Tokyo with his eyes closed \u201cto manipulate the global economy for altruistic purposes.\u201d He scribbled wildly brilliant thoughts into his journal, and suffered a psychotic break at a California theme park after coming across a Lego construction of Salvador Dal\u00ed, a favorite artist.We accompany Hall on these recurring episodes throughout the book. Yet although the author strives at intervals to take us all the way inside her subject\u2019s disordered brain, we remain mostly on the outside looking in, spectators at \u2014 well, a show. Granted, the mysteries of chronic mental illness do not yield easily to the common language, but certain bedrock truths have been ratified within the past generation and are important to understand. Determined though her research may be, Pilon seems to make a point of protecting the reader from the grind of engaging these truths.\u201cThe conversation around medication and treatment can get wonky, jargon-filled and politically loaded pretty quickly,\u201d she writes. \u201cThinking about mental health in terms of our legal system, prisons, schools, workplaces, homeless shelters and beyond can be dizzying, and the desire for a quick and easy fix is often well intended.\u201dBut she then goes on to perpetuate some fundamentally damaging misperceptions about mental illness. Citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she writes that \u201chalf of all Americans will have a mental health crisis \u2026 and it would be virtually impossible to draw up one single type of treatment path for every one of them.\u201dThe first part of this assertion masks a critical distinction, and the second part is fatuous. \u201cHalf of all Americans\u201d conflates two radically distinct forms of mental illness: the emotionally based eruptions of depression, fear, anger and alienation reported by those whom psychiatrists describe as \u201cthe worried well,\u201d and the incurable, biologically inherited, often catastrophic brain diseases: bipolarity, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders.Hall was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder when he was in college. Pilon reports that the doctors told Hall that his affliction \u201cwasn\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon, if at all.\u201d This is an infuriating elision of a valuable teachable moment. Pilon might have explained that \u201cit wasn\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon, if at all\u201d because bipolar disorder, unlike most complaints lumped together as mental illness, is a pernicious disease of the brain. To the extent that people remain unaware of this distinction (and the extent is great), brain-diseased people suffer greatly.Hall and his fellow sufferers make up less than 4 percent of the population. Yet they affect society, and are affected by it, in ways and numbers disproportionate to their population. One flagrant example: The respected Treatment Advocacy Center has found that some 20 percent of jail inmates and 15 percent of inmates in state prisons have a serious mental illness. In real numbers, that\u2019s about 356,000 inmates (450,000 in some estimates) with serious mental illness in jails and state prisons, or 10 times more than the 35,000-odd sufferers in state hospitals. More than one expert has remarked that America criminalizes the mentally ill and uses jails as de facto mental health institutions. The economic toll is huge: Mentally ill inmates require twice the cost of maintenance as those who aren\u2019t mentally ill. The emotional toll on these inmates\u2019 families is incalculable.Then there is the matter of suicide. More than 90 percent of suicide victims have a diagnosable mental disorder. Pilon reports that Hall has contemplated suicide more than once. At the end of the book, shortly before her upbeat closing assurance that \u201cKevin is needed, and loved, back on the shore,\u201d Pilon informs us that in 2016, during a \u201cdown period,\u201d her subject spent several days on a suicide watch.It is exactly such incongruities \u2014 breezy blandishments in the face of troubling evidence to the contrary \u2014 that hobble \u201cThe Kevin Show.\u201dRon Powers is the author, most recently, of \u201cNo One Cares About Crazy People: The Chaos and Heartbreak of Mental Health in America,\u201d a finalist for the 2018 PEN/E.O.

And they are up 45 percent from the depths of the housing crisis in 2012.The big rebound in home prices and the lure of making a quick buck drew more than 200 people on Tuesday to a MidtownManhattan hotel for a two-hour free class on flipping houses. The lunchtime program I dropped in on was part of a sophisticated come-on for a paid three-day workshop that Nathaniel \u201cThan\u201d Merrill and his FortuneBuilders company plan to hold in the New York metropolitan area. An instructor at the event said the workshop normally costs $1,197, but the company was offering it for $197.Mr. Merrill, a former professional football player, has built something of a national reputation for pitching home flipping as a way to make money for just about anyone with a little cash and a dream to become a big time real estate investor. His FortuneBuilders company bills itself as an educational firm with many satisfied customers and success stories. The company is closely tied to a private lender called Grand Coast Capital that provides short-term financing to real estate investors,many of whom are past attendees of the three-day programs.The free class on Tuesday was something of a cross between a how-to guide to buying and selling homes and an evangelical experience. The instructor at the afternoon session sought to inspire the crowd, saying that if they only had the courage, they could someday quit their day jobs and live the way they always wanted to. Judging by the enthusiastic reaction, many were buying the message.- Matthew GoldsteinThe Chinese market is valuable and distinctive from the rest of the world. Arm believes this joint venture, which will license Arm semiconductor technology to Chinese companies and locally develop Arm technology in China, will expand Arm\u2019s opportunities in the Chinese market.Arm estimates that 95 percent of all advanced chips designed in China last year were based on its technology. With China desperate to make its own chips in volume, and quickly (there\u2019s more on that theme below), the move could prove shrewd.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation is rushing to build semiconductor factories. But reports claiming that the Chinese government is probing chip makers over price-fixing demonstrate that it\u2019s not there yet.Reuters notes that, according to Trendforce, China accounts for 20 percent of all global DRAM memory sales. For now, those purchases must be made almost entirely from Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, at what the Chinese government appears to believe may be inflated prices.China\u2019s own production plants \u2014 and carefully controlled pricing \u2014 clearly can\u2019t come soon enough.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe hire shows Washington is becoming more intertwined with corporate America, as the state intervenes in M.&A. and other business dealings.

{"Headline": "Fed Up With Corruption, Fresh Faces Take On Brazil\u2019s Political Old Guard", "Date": "2018-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Pedro Markun once thought hacking Brazil\u2019s political system was the best way to change it.For the last decade, the 32-year-old computer programmer roiled the political establishment with digital intrusions, like cloning the presidential blog to allow comments.Now, he wants to do more than just shake up the establishment. He wants to defeat it at the ballot box in a bid for a seat in Congress.Mr. Markun, with a scruffy goatee and a penchant for colorful print shirts, is part of an unprecedented wave of new candidates running for office in Brazil at both the local and national level.These political novices \u2014 activists, economists, entrepreneurs, business executives and lawyers \u2014 have been jolted into action by an enormous bribery and corruption scandal that has engulfed all the country\u2019s mainstream parties and taken down powerful politicians.More than half the country\u2019s senators and one-third of the lawmakers in the lower House are being investigated for crimes. But the vast majority intend to run for re-election in October, when Brazil is also choosing its next president.According to polls, corruption is the top concern for voters ahead of the election, while confidence in traditional political parties is at an all-time low.Outsiders are hoping to seize on the discontented national mood to break into a political establishment that has long been closed to disruptive, new voices.\u201cThrough my years of hacking, I realized the problem wasn\u2019t so much the politics, but the politicians,\u201d Mr. Markun said in an interview at LabHacker, a digital laboratory he opened in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cAnd the only way to bring politics closer to the people is to bring common people into politics.\u201dExperts say it is unlikely there will be a big shift in the political landscape in October, but the new candidates could lay the groundwork for greater success in future elections.\u201cIt\u2019s a very steep climb,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a Brazil expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThere is a good possibility that a small group of candidates will make it. If they stay on message, there will be more chance for renewal in the future.\u201dAnother outsider candidate, Michelle Guimaraes, a former executive at Johnson & Johnson, said she was drawn to politics by the poor health services in her native state of Amazonas and the meager representation of women in elected office in Brazil.\u201cI decided it was time for the same politicians who\u2019ve been in power for the last 30 years to retire,\u201d said Ms. Guimaraes, who is running for the lower house of Congress, where women hold less than 10 percent of seats. \u201cAnd that meant people like me would have to get involved.\u201dShe may get a lift from a recent decision from the Supreme Electoral Court that ordered parties to devote at least 30 percent of public campaign funds and federally mandated airtime to female candidates.For Camila Godinho, an environmentalist and social worker from the northeastern state of Bahia, her decision to run for Congress was driven in part by a desire to expand voter choice beyond the traditional political families that have held office for generations.\u201cWe have to show the population that there are options,\u201d Ms. Godinho said.For all their enthusiasm, these fresh faces \u2014 a few hundred are competing for seats in regional legislatures and the national Congress \u2014 are up against daunting obstacles in their run for office.Candidates may not run as independents under Brazil\u2019s electoral rules, and the leaders of the dozens of parties that typically compete in Brazilian elections tend to champion loyalists over promising political novices when they allocate campaign resources.Incumbents have another key advantage. By law, candidates may only start campaigning in August. But those already holding elected positions use their official duties, and budgets, to reach out to voters well in advance.In response to the Carwash scandal, the Supreme Court banned corporate contributions to campaigns, and Congress subsequently approved a public campaign finance fund. But that money, along with highly coveted free television and radio advertising slots, is being allocated to parties proportionally, based on their current representation in Congress. That leaves small and less established parties, which are generally more welcoming of new candidates, at a significant disadvantage.Seeking to even the playing field, a handful of influential Brazilians have established nonpartisan initiatives to train new politicians ahead of the campaign period.RenovaBR, an organization with a $3 million budget funded by entrepreneurs, has provided stipends to 133 Brazilians from across the political spectrum who plan to run for Congress. The money covers living expenses while participants take intensive courses in electoral and Constitutional law, the legislative processes, and campaign finance and marketing.Many new candidates are also being aided by Agora, or Now, a group created in 2016 to get the general public more involved in policy issues like pension reform and crime reduction.The nonpartisan Agora is also encouraging a new generation to run for office, and it has reached an agreement with two small parties, the Popular Socialist Party and Rede, to provide a platform for unaffiliated candidates, but without any promise of financial or logistical support.The October elections are shaping up as the most unpredictable and splintered since the return of democracy in Brazil in the late 1980s.While the challenge in accessing public campaign funding and television time will make it hard on outsider congressional candidates, those making smart use of social media could do well in urban centers, especially among young voters, according to pollsters.Even if many of the new candidates fail to gain office, supporters of the push to infuse new blood into Brazilian politics say the effort in 2018 is only the start.This year\u2019s campaign \u201cis just the beginning of the political renewal, not the end,\u201d said Ilona Szab\u00f3, an academic and co-founder of Agora. \u201cThere will be more than one electoral cycle.\u201dWith nearly 30 percent of Brazilians saying they will cast a blank ballot in October\u2019s election, the time would seem ripe for political newcomers at the presidential level as well. But so far, no one has jumped in. Two potential contenders, Brazil\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Joaquim Barbosa, and a television celebrity, Luciano Huck, both pulled out of the race before campaigning even started.The two factions that have disputed the presidential election for the last three decades, the leftist Workers\u2019 Party and the more conservative Social Democracy Party, have both been crippled by the corruption scandal.According to Ms. Szab\u00f3, one of the biggest deterrents to outsiders competing for the presidency is the deal making traditionally employed by candidates to forge alliances among the big parties. Those arrangements have historically fueled Brazil\u2019s culture of systemic corruption.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be possible to compete for the presidency without being vulnerable to being co-opted,\u201d Ms. Szab\u00f3 said.Ordinary voters are starting to pay attention to those running without any ties to the politics of the past. Filipe Nogueira Consoline, 33, a music producer in S\u00e3o Paulo, says he is gravitating toward the new candidates.\u201cI follow them on the internet, especially to compare what they have to say compared with politicians on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about leaving corruption behind, but also looking for something fresh, not the same old, white men as always.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Flee and Thieves Loot Venezuela\u2019s Reeling Oil Giant", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEL TIGRE, Venezuela \u2014 Thousands of workers are fleeing Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, abandoning once-coveted jobs made worthless by the worst inflation in the world. And now the hemorrhaging is threatening the nation\u2019s chances of overcoming its long economic collapse.Desperate oil workers and criminals are also stripping the oil company of vital equipment, vehicles, pumps and copper wiring, carrying off whatever they can to make money. The double drain \u2014 of people and hardware \u2014 is further crippling a company that has been teetering for years yet remains the country\u2019s most important source of income.If Mr. Maduro is going to find a way out of the mess, the key will be oil: virtually the only source of hard currency for a nation with the world\u2019s largest estimated petroleum reserves.But each month Venezuela produces less of it.Now workers at all levels are walking away in large numbers, sometimes literally taking pieces of the company with them, union leaders, oil executives and workers say.A job with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, used to be a ticket to the Venezuelan Dream.No more.Carlos Navas, 37, worked on a drilling crew outside of this oil city, El Tigre. He had a house here, with air-conditioning, and a car. He never imagined he might not make enough money to buy food for his wife and three children.But he quit his job late last year, he said, because he couldn\u2019t live on what had become starvation wages.\u201cBefore, you worked and you were rich,\u201d Mr. Navas said of his oil company job. \u201cYour salary bought anything you needed. Now you can\u2019t buy anything, not even food.\u201dThe state oil company is not faring much better. Output is at its lowest level in 30 years, and there is no sign that the sustained descent is over.The company and the Venezuelan government are in default on more than $50 billion in bonds after failing to make interest payments since late last year. China has refused to continue lending Venezuela money in return for future payments in oil.Venezuela\u2019s oil exports are being interrupted by legal action as well. In recent weeks, courts have ruled that ConocoPhillips, an American oil company, could seize Venezuelan shipments at refineries and export terminals in several Dutch Caribbean islands. The action stemmed from Venezuela\u2019s decision to nationalize foreign oil assets a decade ago.And at home, Venezuela has had so many troubles with refineries and other oil installations that it has had to import gasoline for the domestic market, spending dollars it can hardly afford.All of that adds up to a company in a free fall.In a speech last month after his re-election, Mr. Maduro said that oil production this year must increase by one million barrels a day, a seemingly impossible task, suggesting that he might seek more investment from friendly governments like Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s.\u201cWe have to increase by a million barrels!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it? Maduro?\u201d \u201d His answer: Pdvsa workers.In the area around El Tigre, many of the operations are run by the state oil company in joint ventures with foreign entities, including Western companies like Chevron and Repsol of Spain, as well as state companies like the China National Petroleum Corporation and Rosneft of Russia.Oil executives cite the difficulty of working in Venezuela as social conditions decline.\u201cPeople are starving,\u201d said Eldar Saetre, chief executive of Equinor, the Norwegian oil giant that works with Pdvsa.Interviews with more than a dozen current and former oil workers revealed deep anger. The workers, many of whom asked not to be named because they feared retaliation, said that while Venezuela\u2019s oil company had been sliding for years, its deterioration had accelerated.\u201cThis was a golden cup,\u201d said one worker. \u201cNot silver, gold. Now, it\u2019s a plastic cup.\u201dWorkers said that lifelong health insurance was now worth little, because the state oil company had largely stopped paying private clinics. Field workers complained that lunches sometimes failed to show up because the company did not pay the provider.Then there is the theft of essential equipment. A tour of oil installations around El Tigre showed a devastating toll.At several pumping stations and tank facilities, thieves had torn apart electrical installations to strip out the copper cable. At one site, nine electrical transformers had been torn from posts, their copper parts gutted, disabling vital control systems.Many pump jacks were idle. At one well, the motor had been stolen, shutting it down.There were gaps in fences and gates left open, leaving facilities unprotected. An employee said that a National Guard unit assigned to patrol the area had been sidelined for months because its vehicle broke down and there were no spare parts to fix it.The facilities showed deep neglect. Many had oil spills caused by damaged tanks, pipes or valves. At one site, two large tanks were surrounded by a large black lake of crude oil that had seeped out.Workers said they did not know who was behind the thefts. They said criminal gangs might be to blame, but some acknowledged that dismantling live electrical systems required a knowledge that workers or former workers would possess.Ali Moshiri, Chevron\u2019s top executive for Latin America until last year, said that theft in Venezuela\u2019s oil fields had been a fact of life for 20 years.\u201cBut the stealing has accelerated,\u201d he said, citing theft as a prime reason that oil production is plummeting. \u201cThey\u2019ll steal your car, they\u2019ll steal your wellhead if they can. They will melt it, take parts out of it and sell it.\u201d\u201cPeople are so desperate,\u201d Mr. Moshiri added. \u201cThey can sell the copper to feed their families.\u201dWorkers and supervisors in El Tigre said that production from existing wells was down and that the drilling of new wells was largely paralyzed by the lack of equipment, chemicals, spare parts and basics, like food for workers.One supervisor listed the many destinations to which his co-workers had fled: the United States, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and Spain.Many leave without giving notice. Often, they are not replaced. When they are, the new workers frequently have little or no experience.Junior Mart\u00ednez, 28, who has worked in the oil industry for eight years, is assembling papers, including his diploma as a chemical engineer. His wife and her daughter left three months ago to earn money in Brazil.\u201cI get 1,400,000 bol\u00edvars a week and it isn\u2019t even enough to buy a carton of eggs or a tube of toothpaste,\u201d Mr. Mart\u00ednez said of his salary in bol\u00edvars, Venezuela\u2019s currency.Mr. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s father, Ovidio Mart\u00ednez, 55, recalled growing up here when the oil boom began, with wells sprouting down the block. He cried as he spoke of his son\u2019s determination to leave the country.\u201cYou watch your children leave and you can\u2019t stop them,\u201d the elder Mr. Mart\u00ednez said, fighting back tears. \u201cIn this country, they don\u2019t have a future.\u201dHere in El Tigre, hundreds of people stood in line one recent morning outside a supermarket, many waiting since the evening before to buy whatever food they could.Carlos Antonio Ortega, 31, walked along the line in his red Pdvsa coveralls, selling loose cigarettes. He said he had been a maintenance worker for the oil company but quit eight months ago.\u201cI couldn\u2019t buy anything with what I was making,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to make the food stretch.\u201dOne Pdvsa worker with more than 30 years experience, who recently retired from her job arranging oil exports and shipments, said that when she started she made the equivalent of about $1,750 a month. The company even paid for her to study abroad and receive graduate degrees.When she retired, she said, her monthly salary couldn\u2019t buy two cartons of eggs.\u201cYou want to go into a corner and cry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a time bomb. I would sit in meetings and think to myself: Ticktock, ticktock.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of a former Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela employee.

Go back to bed.\u2019\u201d (Nats and August have their own homes in Los Angeles but often sleep over.)It\u2019s a little hard to miss.Their mother is more of an enigma.At times, details would pour out of Ms. Getty, as when she told a story about living with Cher in the 1980s. They met through a mutual friend. \u201cShe said, \u2018Mi casa es su casa,\u2019 and I took it literally and moved in,\u201d Ms. Getty said. Every once in a while, a revealing tidbit would slip through.When I asked her why she had become so involved with Glaad \u2014 a member of the board, she will soon host a series of fund-raising dinners around the world \u2014 Ms. Getty spoke about the need to bring down some of her own walls. \u201cI have said \u2018no\u2019 so many times in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt left me isolated. Lonely.\u201dMs. Getty and her brood use a converted warehouse in Culver City, not far from where \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was filmed, for their offices. You will know that you\u2019re in the right place if you see racks of red-carpet gowns and a pink, blue and red neon sign on the wall: AUGUST GETTY ATELIER.After I begged to see Ms. Getty in motion, she invited me to sit in on a Strike Oil meeting in April. Another session, one dedicated to her philanthropic work, would follow.When I arrived, the first meeting was already underway. Nats slouched at one end of a glass table scrutinizing photos of planned merchandise. William Anzevino, the chief brand director, was there, as were four more employees. Instead of attending in person, Ms. Getty appeared over video feed from the Montage. (August was sitting behind his computer across the room, drinking water from a goblet.)My ears perked up when Ms. Getty started grilling the group about expected costs. \u201cJust so you know,\u201d she told Nats, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give any wiggle room.\u201dThen came a long discussion about how to make Strike Oil \u201csynonymous with inclusion and social change,\u201d as Nats put it. (Something of a brand tagline appears on the Strike Oil website: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a lifestyle. It\u2019s a thought process.\u201d) They agreed that a portion of sales would go to charity, but they decided to postpone selecting one. \u201cI feel good about this,\u201d Ms. Getty said at the conclusion.Nats also deemed the meeting a success. \u201cGangster,\u201d she said, grinning and decamping for a smoke.\u201cAnother Bellini for you, Ms. Getty?\u201d a server asked. She declined. The platter of cubed salami could stay, though.\u201cMama protecting her cubs,\u201d Ms. Getty said with a smile.Ms. Getty plans to host the Glaad dinners in seven cities around the world this year, expanding to 14 next year. \u201cOne should be in China,\u201d she said, as Ms. Vales took notes. \u201cAbout 15 people at each. We don\u2019t want the intimacy to be lost.\u201dBut enough of that talk. Ms. Getty wanted to return to the topic of Glaad. The Glaad Media Awards, a major fund-raising moment for the organization, were set to take place in a few days. Would I attend as Ms. Getty\u2019s guest?I politely declined. She kept pushing. \u201cWhat if we make you up as a drag queen?\u201d she said. \u201cMy son is great with wigs. How big do you want it?\u201dI told Mama G that I would think it over.She gave me a bear hug.In the end, I attended the banquet and Ms. Getty did not. She fell ill, her publicist told me after I arrived.But the Gettys still made a splash. Nats and Gigi glided back and forth between their center ballroom table and the smoking patio, accompanied by a bodyguard. August was a fervent participant in the auction, gleefully bidding hundreds of thousands of dollars on items like a trip to Australia and a session with a jewelry designer.\u201cYou know who stepped up?\u201d Ms. Ellis said. \u201cAri Getty.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Mark Getty's role in the founding of Getty Images.

{"Headline": "Extremely Large, Extremely Expensive: The Race for the Next Giant Telescopes", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "Even as astronomers await a verdict on construction of a huge telescope on Mauna Kea, they are still trying to figure out how to pay for the next stargazing Goliaths.Supported byIt is high noon, again, for astronomers who want to erect a gigantic telescope on Mauna Kea, the grand volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii.On June 21, the Supreme Court of Hawaii will hear oral arguments in Honolulu on whether to approve a building permit for the telescope, which would be the biggest and most expensive in the Northern Hemisphere.The Mauna Kea drama has overshadowed other issues about the financing and future use of the next generation of extremely large telescopes, as they are generically called.Most of the groups involved, for example, have not yet raised all the money and partners required.That in itself is hardly surprising.In a statement released by the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory, Edward Stone, a Caltech professor and executive director of the observatory, said the exact price of the telescope would depend on when and where it was built.The light-gathering ability of a telescope is determined by the area of its main, or primary, mirror. Which means that the 30-meter-class telescopes under development will be 10 times as powerful as the largest telescopes now on Earth, which have primary mirrors 10 meters across.But all this virtue costs money and groundbreaking technology.However, the Giant Magellan will start up with only four of the mirrors in place, in 2023, making it temporarily the biggest telescope on Earth.A sore point of both the Thirty Meter and Giant Magellan telescope projects is that neither has received much support from the National Science Foundation, which traditionally finances ground-based astronomy in the United States.There is now a proposal afoot to fix this: According to the plan, which has many bureaucratic, academic and political hoops to leap through, the National Science Foundation would contribute a quarter of the cost of each of the two telescopes in return for access to observation time for outside astronomers. Otherwise, all the telescope time would be reserved for astronomers from the institutional partners in those collaborations.Previous panels have given projects like the Hubble Space Telescope important political and financial momentum.An obvious question about the survey, Dr. Silva recalled, was what to do to boost one or both of the Giant Magellan and Thirty Meter telescopes. The two projects started up a few miles apart in Pasadena \u2014 at the Carnegie Observatories and at the California Institute of Technology, partners with the University of California \u2014 with very different ideas on how to proceed. The efforts have grown into sprawling international consortiums, intense rivals for partners and other resources since birth.\u201cBoth projects finally woke up to the fact they are being creamed by the European 39-meter,\u201d said Matt Mountain, the president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, which manages the national observatory and other astronomical facilities for the government.Dr. Silva and others, most notably Dr. Mountain, concluded that the two projects would have a better chance of success if they joined forces and put forward a unified science case.\u201cA bigger umbrella would work better,\u201d Dr. Silva said in an interview.Without a plan, he pointed out, American astronomers were facing the looming possibility of not having access to the largest telescope on Earth \u2014 after a century of dominance with telescopes like the 200-inch on Palomar Mountain in California.The plan would entail identifying \u201ckey science programs,\u201d involving subjects or exoplanets or dark energy that could be pursued with both United States telescopes in a coordinated \u201cbig data\u201d kind of way. The national observatory would control the observing time.For now, the boards of both collaborations have bought in to the idea. \u201cThis is very much a work in progress,\u201d Dr. Silva said. \u201cWe are in a trust-building phase. Can we work together?\u201dDr. Alcock said that as yet there was no firm number on how much the science foundation would contribute, but they were talking about $350 million apiece to the two telescopes. In the end, he said, they would probably get more.Representative John Culberson, Republican of Texas and chairman of a House panel that oversees financing for the National Science Foundation, recently signaled his possible support for the giant telescopes by tripling the proposed budget for the agency\u2019s construction budget for 2019.\u201cThere should be enough room in the international community for three E.L.T.s,\u201d Dr. Alcock said.But where they will be is still an issue.In 1968, the University of Hawaii leased the top 11,000 acres of the mountain for a dollar a year, and began awarding subleases to various observatories for telescopes.The whole universe will be watching.An earlier version of this article misidentified the large telescope under construction in Chile. It is the Giant Magellan Telescope, not the Grand Magellan Telescope.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing Defeat on Brexit, May Gives Ground to U.K.\u2019s Parliament", "Date": "2018-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, on Tuesday promised greater control for Parliament over withdrawal from the European Union, after a threatened rebellion by lawmakers forced her into a new and potentially significant retreat in the country\u2019s troubled exit from the bloc.The day began on an ominous note with the resignation of one of Mrs. May\u2019s ministers over her plans for withdrawal, known as Brexit, and got steadily worse for the prime minister when some of her rebel lawmakers combined with opposition parties, posing the threat of a damaging defeat.The vote concerned an amendment that had been added by the House of Lords to Mrs. May\u2019s main Brexit legislation. The amendment would have given lawmakers more control over the process by, among other things, avoiding a last-minute, take-it-or-leave-it vote on whatever package the government negotiated with Brussels.Mrs. May had appealed to lawmakers not to support the amendment, arguing that it would weaken her negotiating hand with the European Union. Ultimately, they were placated by promises of a timely vote and adherence to some of the technical guarantees demanded by a Conservative rebel, Dominic Grieve, about what happens if a Brexit deal proves unacceptable to Parliament.The retreat is only the latest setback for Mrs. May who last week averted the resignation of her Brexit secretary, David Davis, then faced criticism in leaked comments from her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who accused her government of lacking \u201cguts.\u201dAll this is before Mrs. May meets other European Union leaders at a summit this month for talks that are likely to be difficult.The way the withdrawal was being pursued was \u201cdetrimental to the people we are elected to serve,\u201d added Mr. Lee, who will remain a lawmaker.Since losing her parliamentary majority last year, Mrs. May has been forced to adjudicate between warring factions within her Conservative Party, something that has led her to postpone a number of important decisions.As a consequence, almost two years after the 2016 referendum that mandated British withdrawal, the British government has been unable to outline what type of economic relationship it wants with the European Union, which is its biggest trading partner.Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet is split between those who want to keep close ties, in order to protect the economy, and hard-line Brexit supporters who want to cut free in the hope of striking trade deals further afield.A fierce dispute has also broken out over a British contingency plan to prevent the imposition of border checks between Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland which will remain in the European Union.This idea would involve keeping many European trade rules until technological tools \u2014 like tracking devices or online customs declarations \u2014 are ready that would eliminate the need for border checks. Some Brexit supporters fear that such a plan could keep Britain tied indefinitely into Europe\u2019s regulatory system.On Tuesday, the pro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker, Edward Leigh, warned that defeating Mrs. May on the Lords amendment \u201cwould be a catastrophe for the government,\u201d whose opponents, he said, want to \u201ccreate a situation in which the whole process is frustrated.\u201dDominic Grieve, one of the Conservative rebels, told lawmakers that \u201cthe irrationality of the debate we are having on the details of Brexit is truly chilling.\u201dElsewhere in Parliament, Arron Banks, a high-profile businessman who helped finance one of the pro-Brexit referendum campaigns in 2016, played down the significance of meetings with Russian diplomats, and said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of collusion with Moscow over the campaign of British withdrawal.Mr. Banks, the combative founder of Leave.EU, appeared before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee two days after it emerged that, in addition to a lunch he had made public with Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador to Britain, there had been two further meetings, and that he had discussed a potential Russian mining venture, which was not pursued.At one encounter, after the American elections, Mr. Banks and his spokesman Andy Wigmore passed along contact details for the Trump transition team, which they had gotten on a visit to Trump Tower in New York, where they met the incoming president.During their occasionally confrontational testimony, Mr. Banks and Mr. Wigmore admitted that they sometimes exaggerated to journalists, particularly during the referendum campaign.Finally, as the hearing ran long, Mr. Banks cut short his appearance saying that he had a lunch appointment, telling the lawmakers that they could join him if they wanted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Could Press Bribery Charges. It Just Hasn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s government has enough evidence to charge officials connected to one of the biggest corruption scandals in Latin American history. But it is refusing to bring charges because they might hurt the governing party ahead of presidential elections, according to three people with direct knowledge of the case.But there have been two notable exceptions: Venezuela, an international pariah with an authoritarian government, and Mexico, where two separate federal investigations have stagnated.The criminal cases sit trapped in a legal limbo common to politically sensitive investigations in Mexico, where corruption remains one of the greatest impediments to the country\u2019s fledgling rule of law.The lack of progress in the Odebrecht case has been a sore point in Mexico since late 2016, when the company admitted to American, Swiss and Brazilian authorities in a multibillion-dollar settlement that it had paid $10.5 million in bribes to Mexican officials.One of the Mexican investigations \u2014 begun by a special prosecutor, and generating documents reviewed by The New York Times \u2014 identified a close aide to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto as a suspect. But the inquiry was still in its infancy when the prosecutor was fired by the government last October.Since then, the case has made few advances, with even basic information requests languishing for months, according to two other people who have reviewed the latest case files.But the stronger investigation in Mexico, begun early last year by the attorney general\u2019s office, amassed enough evidence months ago to charge suspects, according to three individuals who have reviewed the case or been briefed on it. The political pressures are too great, they said, for the case to move forward.The suspects worked for Mexico\u2019s national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, known as Pemex. In its settlement with other countries, Odebrecht acknowledged paying millions in bribes to officials at the Mexican oil company. And Mexico\u2019s former attorney general, Ra\u00fal Cervantes, who personally oversaw the case during his tenure, even traveled to Brazil to discuss the evidence that the authorities had gathered there.Mr. Cervantes\u2019s decision to take such an active role in the case caught the attention of many inside the attorney general\u2019s office \u2014 and far beyond it. Some hoped it was a sign that the scandal would not be ignored. Others feared that because the attorney general is appointed by the president, his independence could be compromised.The attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Nothing has happened in Mexico \u2014 at least not to Mexican officials. The nation has issued an administrative sanction against Odebrecht, prohibiting it from doing business in the country for the next several years.But no Mexican officials have been charged with accepting bribes, and Mr. Cervantes, who stepped down last October, has said publicly that the investigation was complete.Since then, his successor, the acting attorney general, Alberto El\u00edas Beltr\u00e1n, has contradicted him, claiming that the case is continuing, so he cannot share the details of what has been learned.While delaying or halting prosecutions may also hurt the governing party\u2019s reputation, the calculus makes sense, critics say: Ultimately, the outrage over any cover-up may be less damaging to the party than exposing more corruption at a trial.\u201cThis scandal goes beyond affecting the president\u2019s reputation, which is already damaged,\u201d said Eduardo Boh\u00f3rquez, one of the architects of the country\u2019s anti-corruption system, which has been enshrined in the Constitution. \u201cNot charging anyone in this case is about the future of the party.\u201d\u201cWith another scandal like this, the entire political machinery and its funding could fall apart,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s bigger than just the elections \u2014 it is about the survival of the party itself.\u201dThe investigation has largely confirmed what is already known, according to the individuals who have reviewed the files: that million of dollars in bribes were paid to offshore accounts to secure infrastructure contracts. A portion of the contracts, bribery payments and money transfers revealed by the Brazilian government and Mexican news organizations are corroborated in the case files.But the Mexican investigators did not significantly expand their inquiry to search for new contracts or payments that may have been missed by the Brazilian authorities, according to the individuals with knowledge of the case.At first, Mr. Lozoya was not named in documents. In December 2016, as part of the $3.5 billion settlement with the Swiss, Brazilian and American authorities, Odebrecht officials admitted to paying $10.5 million in bribes to Mexican officials from 2010 to 2014, without specifying the names of the officials who received it.The revelation set off a firestorm in Mexico. Responding to public pressure, the government of Mexico began an investigation in January 2017.As Mr. Cervantes, the former attorney general, worked quietly behind the scenes, Mexican news organizations and an anti-corruption group, Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, aggressively pursued the lead.First they obtained a legal document in Brazil in which a top Odebrecht executive claims Mr. Lozoya requested a bribery payment of $5 million in 2014. Then, another outfit obtained court testimony from three top Odebrecht officials claiming that Mr. Lozoya had in fact received more than $10 million in bribes.The officials testified that they had met with Mr. Lozoya on numerous occasions in Mexico to facilitate the arrangement. During those meetings, according to testimony from the head of the Mexico office for Odebrecht, Mr. Lozoya handed him an account name and number where the money could be directed.In 2012, when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was running for office, Odebrecht made payments to British Virgin Islands accounts given to them by Mr. Lozoya totaling more than $3.1 million dollars, according to the testimony of the company officials.At the time, Mr. Lozoya was the international coordinator for the campaign and wielded significant influence with the candidate. Odebrecht officials, in their sworn testimony, said that payment was meant to buy good will with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who was leading in the polls and appeared likely to become the next president.Javier Coello Trejo, Mr. Lozoya\u2019s attorney, vehemently denied any wrongdoing by his client, as Mr. Lozoya himself has done since the scandal first erupted. Mr. Coello, who has had access to the government\u2019s main case file, said there was not a single piece of hard evidence connecting Mr. Lozoya to the money or corroborating the testimony from the Odebrecht officials.\u201cThese accounts have no connection to my client,\u201d he said.Mexican prosecutors could have had an even stronger case, with more evidence from the Brazilian authorities, according to the people with knowledge of the case. But unlike most of the nations affected by the scandal, Mexico refused Brazil\u2019s request not to prosecute Odebrecht or its officials, potentially frightening witnesses and preventing them from testifying in full, the people said.There could also be more bribes than initially acknowledged. Documents and account transfer records revealed in the Mexican media suggest that the bribes to Mexican officials may have been as high as $16 million, far more than stipulated to by the company in testimony to the American Department of Justice.As more revelations about the case emerged in the Mexican media, the nation\u2019s special prosecutor for electoral crimes, Santiago Nieto, decided to open his own federal investigation last August. The focus was to assess whether the funds said to have been solicited by Mr. Lozoya were used to finance Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidential campaign.But the case was quickly gummed up by bureaucracy and fights with Mr. Lozoya\u2019s lawyers. Indeed, the Attorney General\u2019s office sometimes seemed intent on stalling the progress, according to Mr. Nieto and a review of the case file, which was obtained by The Times.In one request, Mr. Nieto\u2019s office asked to retrieve bank account information in Brazil, the Virgin Islands and Switzerland, in an effort to corroborate the money transfers that had been reported in the news media.The request was filed last in October to an internal department of the attorney general\u2019s office, which had to approve it.A few days after, Mr. Nieto was fired. He claims the firing was politically motivated, because he planned to investigate allies of the president and the potential use of illicit funds in his campaign.The government denied that, saying Mr. Nieto crossed an ethical line by discussing an investigation when he gave an interview on the topic days earlier.Since Mr. Nieto\u2019s departure, according to people familiar with the case, the investigation has all but stalled. More than seven months later, his request for information abut international bank accounts is still languishing in the attorney general\u2019s office, according to one of the people familiar with the case.\u201cThe Odebrecht scandal has become a sort of accountability litmus test for the countries that were tainted by it,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who has long criticized Mexico\u2019s justice system. \u201cMexico today is in the midst of a heated presidential campaign. This is the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government\u2019s opportunity to show that no one is above the law.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Russian Oligarch\u2019s $500 Million Yacht Is in the Middle of Britain\u2019s Costliest Divorce", "Date": "2018-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With a spa, a swimming pool, two heliports and room for 18 guests, the Luna is more like a floating luxury villa than a yacht. A crew of 50 keep all nine decks in pristine shape. The lifeboats cost $4 million apiece. Gleaming engines propel the vessel at a maximum speed of 22 knots.But for now, the Luna isn\u2019t moving. It sits in a dry dock in Dubai, the most fought-over prize in what has been called Britain\u2019s most expensive divorce.In December 2016, a High Court judge ordered Farkhad Akhmedov, a Russian billionaire who has owned a home in England since the \u201990s, to pay the equivalent of $646 million to his ex-wife, Tatiana Akhmedova. He refused, arguing that the couple had been divorced in Russia more than a decade ago.For more than a decade, Russian oligarchs have been parking their families and some chunk of their net worth in England. A deal was implied: The oligarchs got a haven from the pitiless realities of Putin-era Russia, and Britain got an influx of very rich people.Now some oligarchs are learning that life here has hazards of its own. That goes even for nonresidents like Mr. Akhmedov, who never became a British citizen. Eager to keep British tax collectors away from his money, he limited the number of days he stayed in England to a maximum of 180 a year. (More recently, the number was reduced to 90 days.)Even the Luna, the ultimate in high-end joy rides, is customized for a man anticipating trouble. It has a missile detection system, an anti-drone system, bulletproof windows and bombproof doors.None of these features, however, have shielded Mr. Akhmedov from the British justice system, despite the exhaustive efforts of his legal and accounting team. Before arriving in the Middle East, the vessel had been on an epic journey, though one not measured in nautical miles.As the nine-figure settlement was gaveled into divorce court history, Mr. Akhmedov began what the judge called a \u201ccampaign\u201d to hide his assets \u201cin a web of offshore companies.\u201d Nothing demonstrates the breadth and ingenuity of that web like the Luna. Starting in November 2016, the yacht went on a whirlwind voyage, all of it on paper, in a feat of asset protection and financial engineering so elaborate that the judge diagramed it in an April ruling.Initially, the seizure of the yacht in Dubai sounded like a setback for Mr. Akhmedov. Then, he and lawyers for the family trust that technically owns the Luna filed a claim \u2014 still pending \u2014 arguing that the fate of the yacht should be decided by a local court in Dubai, using Islamic law, known as Shariah.Legal experts say Mr. Akhmedov has calculated that his odds of prevailing are better in a Shariah court, especially given that his ex-wife is a Christian who has acknowledged infidelity in their marriage. Stories in British tabloids have lately emphasized that Mr. Akhmedov is a practicing Muslim.That is news to Ms. Akhmedova. In her first-ever interview, which took place recently in the office of a public relations firm, she said she had never seen her ex-husband kneeling on a prayer rug or going to a mosque, other than at a tourist site.\u201cApparently because he was born in Azerbaijan, he\u2019s a Muslim,\u201d she said, her eyes widening with disbelief. (A spokesman for Mr. Akhmedov disputed Ms. Akhmedova\u2019s characterization, saying that Mr. Akhmedov \u201chas always been a devout and practicing Muslim.\u201d)A sunny woman with a mild Russian accent, Ms. Akhmedova wore ripped denim jeans, a batch of string bracelets and a T-shirt that read \u201cFree as a Butterfly.\u201d She said she was reluctant to speak publicly about her divorce, because everything about it is painful, including the recent media coverage in Britain, which has made much of allegations of infidelity leveled by both sides.She\u2019s also startled by Mr. Akhmedov\u2019s campaign to keep her from pocketing one cent of his $1.4 billion fortune, most of which he earned selling his stake in a Siberian energy company called Northgas. Contrary to popular assumptions, she said, she needs the money. She is living off a lump sum provided to her by Burford Capital, a litigation finance firm, which is helping to fund the legal efforts and will take a percentage of any results.\u201cI don\u2019t want to play the victim, because it\u2019s not my nature,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have to defend myself.\u201dMs. Akhmedova said she had always wanted to settle out of court, quietly and for far less than she was awarded. She still speaks fondly of the years she spent with her ex-husband, whom she says she met in Moscow in 1989, when she was 17. He was nearly twice her age.\u201cHe was wearing a suit,\u201d she said. \u201cHe struck me as a very proper gentleman.\u201dThe two married in 1993 and moved to London. He started off in the fur business, selling sable skins on the London Commodity Exchange. He later pivoted to the natural gas sector and, in 2012, sold his 49 percent stake in Northgas for a reported $1.4 billion.Over the years, he acquired a summer house in the south of France, two helicopters, vintage cars, fine art \u2014 by Rothko, Warhol and others \u2014 and a $26 million home in an upscale county outside London.\u201cWe went from flying Aeroflot to British Airways to chartered flights,\u201d said Ms. Akhmedova. Later, they flew on their own $50 million private jet.During the years that Mr. Akhmedov amassed his wealth, the couple regularly toggled between hostilities and opulent cease-fires. She said she filed for divorce a second time in 2013 \u2014 she had rescinded the first petition a decade earlier \u2014 when one of her ex-husband\u2019s paramours gave birth to a child.\u201cIt would take four years to build a boat like that,\u201d said Ms. Akhmedova, who helped arrange the sale. \u201cSo we thought, why not ask our friend? He\u2019s got two boats, let\u2019s ask him for one.\u201dUnfortunately, the change in behavior promised by her husband did not occur, she said. And once again, she pushed for divorce.In 2003, Mr. Akhmedov had produced documents that purported to show that the couple had gotten a divorce from a Moscow court three years earlier. In his version of events, as explained by his spokesman, the marriage lasted a mere seven and a half years and was dissolved on the grounds of Ms. Akhmedova\u2019s adultery. The subsequent time together \u2014 from 2000 to 2014 \u2014 the gifts and vacations? That was for the sake of the couple\u2019s sons.\u201cTo give them, as the children of divorced parents, the best possible experience of family life, my client also accompanied his ex-wife and children on occasional \u2018family\u2019 holidays,\u201d said the spokesman, Ian Monk, in an email.This narrative portrays Ms. Akhmedova as an opportunist, who pounced when her ex-husband had his billion-dollar payday, in 2012.\u201cWithin a few days of the wealth being realized by my client\u2019s sale of Northgas, Tatiana made her first approach for an English divorce,\u201d Mr. Monk wrote. \u201cMy client says that is a second divorce.\u201dTo underscore the point, Mr. Akhmedov refused to participate in the British divorce case, neither appearing in court nor sending a lawyer to the proceedings, which began in November 2015. He told the media that tensions between Britain and Russia would prevent him from getting a fair trial and that he regarded the case as political, part of Britain\u2019s efforts to seize assets from well-off Russians.Judge Charles Haddon-Cave came to different conclusions. He ruled that the 2000 Russian divorce documents were \u201cforged.\u201d Persuaded by Ms. Akhmedova\u2019s testimony, he concluded that the couple had \u201cremained married in all senses of the word,\u201d until 2013.Two days before the start of the trial, in November 2016, lawyers and accountants took the helm of the Luna and shuffled it to a handful of companies controlled by Mr. Akhmedov and his allies, in the Isle of Man, Panama and Liechtenstein. It eventually landed in a newly created family trust called Straight, which Judge Haddon-Cave wryly described in a ruling as \u201cthe antithesis of its name.\u201d\u201cIn my judgment, it is clear that Straight is simply another \u2018cipher,\u2019\u201d he wrote, designed by Mr. Akhmedov \u201cto evade enforcement.\u201dA few months after the Luna arrived in Dubai for maintenance, the Dubai International Financial Center Courts \u2014 which conducts business in English and uses English common law \u2014 impounded the vessel.Lawyers for Mr. Akhmedov and Straight have since filed an appeal with a Dubai entity called the Joint Judicial Tribunal, a seven-member committee created in 2016 and granted the power to decide which court has jurisdiction over a legal proceeding. Mr. Akhmedov contends that his dispute is a matrimonial one, which should be decided by a local Shariah court. He is not looking to relitigate the divorce, his spokesman said. He simply wants a judgment that says the British order to transfer ownership of the yacht cannot be enforced in Dubai.Predicting how the tribunal will rule is not easy, in part because it has issued only a dozen or so decisions. What is clear is that if Ms. Akhmedova prevails, she will look for a buyer and sell the yacht. It is equally clear that Mr. Akhmedov will litigate this case until he wins or the vessel melts into decrepitude.\u201cHe would rather see the Luna rot in the Dubai heat,\u201d said Mr. Monk, \u201cthan see it handed over to Tatiana.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of one of the countries where Farkhad Akhmedov and his allies controlled companies. It is Liechtenstein, not LichtensteinAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Risk in a Big Quake: 39 of San Francisco\u2019s Top High Rises", "Date": "2018-06-14", "News": "A report by the U.S. Geological Survey includes a list of buildings that are potentially vulnerable to a large quake. Some of San Francisco\u2019s most prominent high rises are on the list.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Earthquakes are part of the California bargain, a risk that residents accept in exchange for the state\u2019s natural beauty, sunshine and plentiful jobs. This unspoken seismic trade-off came into sharp focus last month when, for the first time, a government earthquake study included a list of potentially vulnerable high-rise buildings in San Francisco. The list includes some of the city\u2019s most prominent hotels and office buildings.Engineers have known about a major defect in certain steel-frame buildings since 1994, when shaking from the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles fractured critical joints in more than 60 buildings, bringing at least one very close to collapse. The building code was rewritten to eliminate the flawed technique.Yet nearly a quarter of a century later, California is still wrestling with what to do with the hundreds of buildings, many of them high rises, that were constructed during the more than three decades when the defective connection system was widely employed. Last year Santa Monica, which has identified more than 70 steel-frame buildings believed to have the problem, became the first city in California to order mandatory retrofits. A similar law in nearby West Hollywood comes into effect in August.\u201cThis is an issue that structural engineers should have been dealing with continuously since the mid-1990s and we just dropped it,\u201d said Keith Porter, an earthquake engineering expert who helped lead the United States Geological Survey study that published the list of San Francisco high rises. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to deal with a problem this big.\u201dExperts consider these buildings vulnerable to collapse only in extreme shaking caused by rare and powerful earthquakes, similar to the one that struck San Francisco in 1906.The list, buried among the seismic calculations of an appendix in the U.S.G.S. report, includes around 40 steel-frame high rises clustered in downtown San Francisco and built between 1960 and 1994, the approximate years when the flawed technique was employed. There are more than 200 high rises in the city.The steel buildings constructed in the years when the technique was used house technology and finance companies, law firms, restaurants, shopping arcades, at least three major hotels, the headquarters of Pacific Gas & Electric, the San Francisco office of Senator Dianne Feinstein, and the former Bank of America building, one of the city\u2019s tallest \u2014 and which is partly owned by President Trump.One cluster of pre-1994 steel-frame buildings known as the Embarcadero Center \u201cwelcomes more than 16,000 people each day,\u201d according to its website. A 43-story building known as Salesforce West is on the list and is directly across from Salesforce Tower, the tallest office building west of the Mississippi River. Salesforce Tower was recently completed and is not a steel-frame building.One address on the list jumped off the page for me: The building that houses the San Francisco bureau of The New York Times.A number of building owners responded to emailed queries about these buildings. The Hilton hotel near Union Square said it did a retrofit in 2012. And a representative for Columbia Property Trust, the owners of the building where The Times bureau is located, sent a statement that said, \u201cWhile no seismic retrofits have been made to the building, we believe that the building\u2019s structure compares quite favorably when compared to many other similar buildings constructed before 1994 due to expert assessments that are ongoing.\u201dMost of us are too busy to think about what lurks behind the walls of our offices or the seemingly far-off possibility that the Big One, generally thought of in California as around an 8-magnitude earthquake, might strike. Researching these buildings took me down a road of uncomfortable questions about risk and probabilities.So how dangerous are these buildings?Known in technical lingo as welded steel moment-frame buildings, the columns and beams that make up the skeleton of the building are welded together, an innovation that was adopted to save time and money and a departure from the bolts and rivets used in previous generations of steel buildings. Those constructed before around 1985 were often very flexible \u2014 allowing them to sway extensively from side to side. The building code was revised in the mid-1980s to require more stiffness, and again a decade later to correct the defective welding technique.To live in California is to be forced to draw lines between acceptable and unacceptable seismic risks. And for policymakers, this class of steel-frame building seems to fall somewhere in between.Steel-frame buildings, by contrast, are not considered vulnerable to moderate earthquakes.A 6.9-magnitude earthquake in Kobe, Japan, a year after Northridge caused the collapse of 90 older steel-frame buildings and cracks in newer ones. A prominent Japanese engineer at the time said the Kobe earthquake was a turning point in public perception \u2014 it \u201crefuted the popular myth that steel buildings are immune to strong earthquakes,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen these fractures occurred it was a very humbling experience \u2014 first shocking and then humbling \u2014 for the structural and earthquake engineering professions,\u201d said Gregory Deierlein, a Stanford University earthquake engineering expert who is a seismic adviser to the city of San Francisco. \u201cIt starkly brought into question one of the fundamental assumptions and building techniques that they had been using.\u201dThe building code today mandates a probability of collapse of no more than 10 percent in extreme shaking similar to what San Francisco experienced in 1906.There are many caveats to all the studies. Computer modeling is far from perfect and each building is unique \u2014 buildings with tall ground floors or irregular shapes can be even more vulnerable.\u201cIt\u2019s not like we are waiting,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cThere are only so many engineers in this city. There\u2019s only so much money.\u201dRetrofitting a single building can cost tens of millions of dollars and few building owners in California have done it, engineers say. There appears to be relatively little pressure to do anything about the problem because for years it remained a somewhat obscure, technical flaw discussed among engineers.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any awareness in the general population,\u201d said David Mar, a structural engineer who has retrofitted around half a dozen steel-frame buildings in the San Francisco Bay Area. \u201cFolks need to know \u2014 and then you can make decisions about retrofitting or not. More knowledge is better for everybody.\u201dThe problem is not confined to high rises; engineers estimate that there are hundreds of defective steel-frame buildings of all sizes in California.Partly because of the cost, Santa Monica is giving owners of steel-frame buildings 20 years to carry out retrofits. Most of the steel buildings identified as vulnerable are office buildings, but the city also has a number of large steel-frame condominium buildings.A number of experts described tension between engineers who wanted to raise greater awareness about the vulnerability of the pre-1994 steel-frame buildings and Ron Hamburger, one of the country\u2019s leading seismic engineers, who helped lead federal investigations after Northridge and has been described as a kind of skeptic in chief about the buildings\u2019 potential for collapse.Mr. Hamburger recently said he had become more convinced of their danger.\u201cIf we have a repeat of 1906 it is probable that some, not all, of the high-rise buildings in downtown San Francisco will experience collapse,\u201d he said.Mr. Hamburger travels extensively, but on this particular day he was in his office in San Francisco. I mentioned that I was calling him from the 12th floor of a steel-frame building, the likes of which we were discussing.He paused for a beat.\u201cI\u2019m sitting in one of them, too.\u201d1.

{"Headline": "Coupe du monde : Ces Bleus des banlieues", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "La banlieue parisienne, souvent stigmatis\u00e9e dans la presse comme foyer de d\u00e9linquance ou de radicalisation, est aussi un bassin de talents o\u00f9 grandissent les meilleurs joueurs de football d\u2019Europe.Supported byBONDY, France \u2014 Demandez \u00e0 celles et ceux qui ont connu Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 enfant, qui ont suivi les premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes de sa carri\u00e8re flamboyante, et tous vous diront la m\u00eame chose : il leur a suffi d\u2019un coup d\u2019\u0153il pour reconna\u00eetre son immense talent. C\u2019\u00e9tait bien s\u00fbr avant que le jeune joueur ne rejoigne Monaco, le PSG et la Coupe du monde.Quand Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Suner, le directeur sportif de l\u2019A.S. Bondy, le premier club de Mbapp\u00e9, le vit jouer pour la premi\u00e8re fois, il murmura simplement, \u00ab Ouah \u00bb. Une impression semblable, selon lui, \u00e0 celle qu\u2019ont d\u00fb ressentir les premiers \u00e0 voir Lionel Messi toucher un ballon, il y a plus de vingt ans et de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019Atlantique.Antonio Riccardi, l\u2019un des premiers entra\u00eeneurs de Mbapp\u00e9, se souvient d\u2019un gar\u00e7on qui faisait tout \u00ab mieux, plus vite et plus souvent \u00bb que ses co\u00e9quipiers. Bien s\u00fbr, Mbapp\u00e9 devait encore perfectionner son talent, mais Riccardi sut tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune raison de le freiner.Le jeune footballeur adorait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dribbler et effacer ses adversaires. \u00ab Je ne lui disais jamais d\u2019arr\u00eater \u00bb, explique Riccardi. \u00ab Il \u00e9tait le meilleur \u00e0 \u00e7a, pourquoi est-ce que je lui aurais dit d\u2019arr\u00eater ? Il est le meilleur gar\u00e7on que j\u2019aie entra\u00een\u00e9. Il restera probablement le meilleur que j\u2019aurai entra\u00een\u00e9 \u00bb.Suner et Riccardi voyaient que Mbapp\u00e9 \u00e9tait exceptionnel, mais ils ne savaient pas \u2014 ils ne pouvaient pas savoir \u2014 jusqu\u2019o\u00f9 son talent l\u2019emm\u00e8nerait. Champion fran\u00e7ais, deuxi\u00e8me joueur le plus cher au monde et incarnation des espoirs de victoire de la France au mondial cet \u00e9t\u00e9. Tout cela avant ses 20 ans.Ils ne pouvaient pas non plus pr\u00e9voir que son portrait ornerait un pan de la R\u00e9sidence des Potagers \u00e0 Bondy, face \u00e0 la voie rapide qui file vers Paris. Derri\u00e8re lui, on lit : \u00ab Bondy \u2014 Ville des Possibles \u00bb.Nul ne pouvait deviner que son nom ornerait les maillots port\u00e9s par la derni\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de jeunes joueurs de l\u2019A.S. Bondy, ou que l\u2019\u00e9cho de son succ\u00e8s r\u00e9verb\u00e9rerait jusque dans les bureaux du club : chaque semaine, quelques journalistes contactent Suner, le directeur du club, pour obtenir le num\u00e9ro de Mbapp\u00e9 ou de son p\u00e8re.Personne n\u2019avait pr\u00e9dit que Mbapp\u00e9 deviendrait un symbole. Pas seulement de Bondy, si proche g\u00e9ographiquement mais si loin socialement de Paris, mais bien de l\u2019ensemble des vastes banlieues dont elle fait partie.Bondy est en \u00cele-de-France. Mais pour beaucoup, Bondy est synonyme de 93, une \u00e9tiquette associ\u00e9e aux quartiers sensibles : des villes o\u00f9 habitent des familles immigr\u00e9es et populaires, des villes qui \u00e9voquent le spectre d\u2019\u00e9meutes et de lutte sociale, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des terreaux de d\u00e9linquance et de radicalisation.C\u2019est l\u2019univers d\u2019o\u00f9 vient Mbapp\u00e9 ; c\u2019est aussi celui qu\u2019il incarne d\u00e9sormais.Mais les banlieues de Paris sont truff\u00e9es d\u2019histoires comme celle de Mbapp\u00e9. Les noms changent, bien s\u00fbr, ainsi que les parcours. Parfois, le talent n\u2019est pas aussi prometteur, pas au d\u00e9but en tout cas, ou alors la trajectoire n\u2019est pas aussi rectiligne. Parfois, la banlieue est un peu plus privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Parfois, la banlieue est un peu plus ais\u00e9e. Parfois les obstacles paraissent un peu plus infranchissables.Le sc\u00e9nario, en revanche, reste le m\u00eame. Enlevez Mbapp\u00e9 et remplacez-le par Paul Pogba \u00e0 Lagny-sur-Marne et Roissy-en-Brie, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 \u00e0 Suresnes, Blaise Matuidi \u00e0 Fontenay-sous-Bois, Benjamin Mendy \u00e0 Longjumeau. Tous ont suivi la m\u00eame trajectoire.Car c\u2019est ici, au pied des immeubles des banlieues parisiennes, que la France trouve ses joueurs de football : des centaines d\u2019entre eux sont envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 Clairefontaine, quelques dizaines deviennent professionnels, ici ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, et cet \u00e9t\u00e9, quelques-uns repr\u00e9senteront la France \u00e0 la Coupe du monde en Russie.Des 23 joueurs que le s\u00e9lectionneur fran\u00e7ais Didier Deschamps s\u2019appr\u00eate \u00e0 emmener en Russie, huit ont commenc\u00e9 leur p\u00e9riple aux pieds des tours HLM de la banlieue parisienne. Mbapp\u00e9 est l\u2019un d\u2019eux, bien s\u00fbr, comme le sont Pogba, Kant\u00e9, Mendy et Matuidi, ainsi qu\u2019Alphonse Areola, Presnel Kimpembe et Steven Nzonzi. Beaucoup d\u2019autres, d\u2019Anthony Martial \u00e0 Kingsley Coman ou Adrien Rabiot, ont manqu\u00e9 la s\u00e9lection de peu.Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la meilleure s\u00e9lection que le pays ait connue ces 20 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, estim\u00e9e assez talentueuse pour gagner la Coupe du monde, cette g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de jeunes joueurs s\u2019est en partie construite ici, \u00e0 Bondy et dans les nombreuses villes qui lui ressemblent.Une \u00e9quipe construite dans l\u2019ombre de la Ville lumi\u00e8re.Il y a quelques mois, Huseyin Ergunes, l\u2019entra\u00eeneur de l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019Argenteuil, a invit\u00e9 un recruteur, Yves Gergaud, \u00e0 venir observer ses joueurs.Le club d\u2019Argenteuil a vu le jour il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, d\u2019abord comme un projet d\u2019int\u00e9gration pour les jeunes, pr\u00e9cise Ergunes. L\u2019objectif ? La \u00ab coh\u00e9sion sociale \u00bb, en donnant aux jeunes des cit\u00e9s un endroit o\u00f9 se retrouver et un projet sportif pour s\u2019exprimer.Le budget municipal a permis de financer un terrain moderne et bien entretenu, comme on en trouve beaucoup dans les banlieues. Un contraste saisissant avec les tours HLM qui rythment le quotidien des joueurs.Ergunes n\u2019est cependant pas un travailleur social. Il est avant tout entra\u00eeneur. D\u00e8s qu\u2019il estime avoir dans ses rangs un joueur susceptible d\u2019int\u00e9resser une \u00e9quipe professionnelle, il entre en contact avec des recruteurs.Gergaud, recruteur de joueurs de 17 \u00e0 20 ans pour F.C. Sochaux. Le coach a l\u2019\u0153il pour le talent. En cinq ann\u00e9es au PSG, il a recrut\u00e9 deux espoirs du football fran\u00e7ais : Kimpembe et Coman.Son meilleur vivier de recrutement reste sans nul doute l\u2019\u00cele-de-France. D\u2019aucuns estiment d\u2019ailleurs que la r\u00e9gion concentre les meilleurs talents de France et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame d\u2019Europe. Mais la concurrence est f\u00e9roce. Tous les footballeurs savent que, apr\u00e8s S\u00e3o Paulo, c\u2019est dans la r\u00e9gion parisienne qu\u2019on trouve le plus grand nombre de recruteurs au monde.Gergaud s\u2019\u00e9vertue \u00e0 maintenir le contact avec des coachs tels qu\u2019Ergunes, des acteurs de terrain qui pourront l\u2019alerter d\u2019embl\u00e9e s\u2019ils ont un joueur prometteur. Ce jour-l\u00e0, le recruteur cherche un d\u00e9fenseur; le coach a quelques joueurs de 16 ans \u00e0 lui pr\u00e9senter.Un coup de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et une visite plus tard, Gergaud arpente le terrain. Malgr\u00e9 le froid hivernal, le recruteur observe l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019Argenteuil affronter Cr\u00e9teil. \u00ab Quand vous travaillez avec des jeunes joueurs ici, vous ne voulez pas manquer le prochain talent \u00bb, dit Gergaud.Ou pire, qu\u2019il vous batte plus tard. Les clubs parisiens, dont le PSG est au premier rang, ne sont pas les seuls \u00e0 chercher les derni\u00e8res p\u00e9pites du football dans les banlieues. Les plus grandes \u00e9quipes fran\u00e7aises \u2014 m\u00eame celles de Lyon et de Marseille, qui ont leurs propres bassins de recrutement \u2014 passent les petits clubs de banlieue au peigne fin.Les recruteurs viennent de plus en plus loin pour d\u00e9nicher les nouveaux espoirs du foot mondial. La Premier League d\u2019Angleterre envoie souvent ses propres d\u00e9nicheurs de talent. Pas facile pour des \u00e9quipes comme Sochaux, aux ressources relativement limit\u00e9es, de suivre.Gergaud et deux autres recruteurs \u2014 Sochaux en emploie neuf au total \u2014 cherchent maintenant des joueurs d\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e2ge de 11 ans. Concurrence oblige.\u00ab On les fait signer \u00e0 un \u00e2ge bien plus jeune d\u00e9sormais \u00bb, affirme Matthieu Bideau, responsable du recrutement au F.C. Nantes. \u00ab Il y a tellement de concurrence que si on ne les fait pas signer, d\u2019autres les prendront. \u00bb\u00ab Les clubs locaux se font la guerre pour obtenir les joueurs les plus jeunes possible. Les clubs anglais sont les requins, les clubs fran\u00e7ais sont les moutons, et les clubs amateurs sont les sardines \u00bb.Ce qui les attire ? La quantit\u00e9 de talents pr\u00e9sents. Comme le fait remarquer Mohamed Coulibaly, entra\u00eeneur \u00e0 l\u2019A.A.S. Sarcelles, Paris et sa banlieue comptent 12 millions d\u2019habitants \u2014 \u00ab presque un pays, une population plus grande que celle de la Belgique \u00bb. Il ajoute : \u00ab \u00c7a fait un plut\u00f4t grand bassin de talents \u00bb.Mais tout aussi important est le type de joueurs qu\u2019on voit \u00e9merger des banlieues. Coulibaly d\u00e9crit leurs profils comme \u00ab athl\u00e9tique, vigoureux, dynamique, technique, agressif \u2014 le genre de joueurs dont l\u2019\u00e9quipe de France est faite \u00bb.Mais pas seulement l\u2019\u00e9quipe de France : \u00e0 la Coupe du monde cet \u00e9t\u00e9, des joueurs des \u00e9quipes du Maroc, du Portugal, de la Tunisie et du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal ont grandi en \u00cele-de-France. Leur style provient du jeu qu\u2019ils ont pratiqu\u00e9 en banlieue : des parties avec des \u00e9quipes restreintes, ou les \u00e2ges se m\u00e9langent sur les terrains en b\u00e9ton install\u00e9s au pied des tours. \u00ab Ces matches favorisent la vitesse dans les jambes et dans la t\u00eate : ils doivent prendre des d\u00e9cisions rapidement \u00bb, dit Bideau.Quand ils rejoignent des clubs, les rencontres deviennent des matches entre diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9quipes de banlieue. \u00ab Nous avons les meilleurs joueurs du pays qui se confrontent les uns aux autres chaque week-end \u00bb, affirme Coulibaly. \u00ab C\u2019est ce qui fait la diff\u00e9rence \u00bb.Et c\u2019est ce qui fait que Gergaud ne laisse jamais passer une occasion de prospecter de nouveaux talents. Ce jour de f\u00e9vrier \u00e0 Argenteuil, il est parti avant le coup de sifflet final. Aucun joueur ne correspondait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il recherchait ; aucun n\u2019est le \u00ab prochain grand \u00bb. Mais il y en aura, il le sait. Il y en a toujours.\u00c0 quelques jours d\u2019un match de coupe d\u00e9cisif, Riccardi, l\u2019ancien entra\u00eeneur de Mbapp\u00e9, a choisi. Au lieu de s\u2019entra\u00eener sur un terrain en pelouse synth\u00e9tique au Stade L\u00e9o Lagrange, o\u00f9 ont lieu la plupart des entra\u00eenements, ses joueurs iront sur une surface en terre battue. Le ballon rebondit de mani\u00e8re impr\u00e9visible sur le terrain fait de bosses et de nuages de poussi\u00e8re.\u00ab C\u2019est l\u00e0 que c\u2019est le plus dur de jouer \u00bb, affirme Riccardi. \u00ab Donc c\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019ils apprennent le plus \u00bb.Riccardi ne laisse rien passer quand un toucher de balle part un peu de travers. Il crie ses instructions, pr\u00e9vient ses joueurs qu\u2019un manque de contr\u00f4le pourrait leur co\u00fbter une place dans l\u2019\u00e9quipe le lendemain. Il a constat\u00e9 que les joueurs de banlieue r\u00e9pondent davantage au b\u00e2ton qu\u2019\u00e0 la carotte. Ils savent tous qu\u2019ils ne sont pas l\u00e0 simplement pour jouer.\u00ab Ils ont tous en t\u00eate ce qu\u2019a fait Kylian \u00bb, raconte Riccardi, dont le p\u00e8re est italien et la m\u00e8re espagnole. \u00ab Kylian est l\u2019exemple le plus direct pour eux, leur propre star : Il a fait ce qu\u2019ils font, il s\u2019est chang\u00e9 dans les m\u00eames vestiaires, il s\u2019est entrain\u00e9 sur les m\u00eames terrains. Il \u00e9tait l\u00e0 il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, \u00e0 faire ce qu\u2019ils font d\u00e9sormais \u00bb.C\u2019est le r\u00eave de tous les joueurs d\u2019ici et de centaines de clubs amateurs qui pars\u00e8ment les banlieues : \u00eatre le prochain Mbapp\u00e9, la prochaine star. Quitter les tours et parvenir au Mondial.Un exemple de r\u00e9ussite si tangible est un puissant moteur d\u2019inspiration. Depuis que Mbapp\u00e9 a perc\u00e9, Bondy est encore plus empli de jeunes qui esp\u00e8rent \u00eatre recrut\u00e9s et pensent qu\u2019ils peuvent suivre ses traces.\u00ab Trop souvent, la mauvaise image qu\u2019on pr\u00eate aux banlieues agit comme un frein pour des jeunes pourtant ambitieux, \u00bb explique Riccardi. \u00ab Kylian a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 casser ce frein \u00bb.Mais le parcours est sem\u00e9 d\u2019emb\u00fbches : parce que tant de joueurs sont originaires de ces quartiers, et parce que l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 de devenir professionnel semble si proche, si r\u00e9elle, le r\u00eave s\u2019est m\u00e9tamorphos\u00e9 en un quasi-objectif. Riccardi tente de mettre ses joueurs en garde, de leur dire qu\u2019ils ne seront pas forc\u00e9ment le prochain, mais le combat est quotidien.\u00c0 l\u2019A.A.S. Sarcelles aussi, on jongle avec les faux espoirs. Les murs du club sont tapiss\u00e9s des maillots de tous les athl\u00e8tes professionnels qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9s : des footballeurs, mais aussi des judokas et des athl\u00e8tes olympiques. La place d\u2019honneur, cependant, est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 celui de Leicester City, floqu\u00e9 du nom de Riyad Mahrez.Mahrez \u2014champion de Premier League en 2016, et star de l\u2019\u00e9quipe nationale d\u2019Alg\u00e9rie \u2014 a grandi \u00e0 Sarcelles, banlieue difficile de Paris. \u00c0 bien des \u00e9gards, son histoire est une parabole plus puissante encore que celle de Mbapp\u00e9.\u00ab Il avait des qualit\u00e9s techniques, mais il y avait plein, plein de joueurs plus dou\u00e9s que lui \u00bb, se rappelle Coulibaly, le directeur sportif du club de Sarcelles. \u00ab Il n\u2019arr\u00eatait pas de dire qu\u2019il deviendrait professionnel, mais m\u00eame ici c\u2019\u00e9tait dur pour lui de jouer \u00bb.Mahrez s\u2019est accroch\u00e9 \u00e0 son r\u00eave \u2014 Coulibaly se souvient qu\u2019il restait sur les terrains bien apr\u00e8s les entra\u00eenements, \u00ab jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il fasse trop nuit pour voir le ballon \u00bb \u2014 et a fini par avoir une opportunit\u00e9, passant par les \u00e9quipes de Quimper puis du Havre avant de rejoindre Leicester. Son message aux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations suivantes, dit Coulibaly, est de \u00ab ne pas renoncer \u00bb.Le revers de la m\u00e9daille, cependant, est que le r\u00eave peut se transformer en autre chose : quasiment un objectif port\u00e9 par toute une famille, analyse Coulibaly. Tout le monde croit pouvoir y arriver, ou pense que son fils peut y arriver, s\u2019offrant \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 toute sa famille un avenir meilleur. Cela n\u2019arrive pourtant qu\u2019\u00e0 une toute petite minorit\u00e9.\u00ab On vous donne la liste de tous ceux qui sont pass\u00e9s professionnels \u00bb, dit Coulibaly, en d\u00e9signant les maillots d\u00e9dicac\u00e9s accroch\u00e9s au mur. \u00ab On ne vous parle pas de tous ceux qui ont essay\u00e9 mais n\u2019y sont pas arriv\u00e9s \u00bb.Assis sur son bureau dans un local pas plus grand qu\u2019un placard, Riccardi attend les joueurs qui arrivent pour l\u2019entra\u00eenement. Sur le chemin du vestiaire, ils passent la t\u00eate par la porte : une douzaine en 12 minutes. Chacun y va d\u2019un \u00ab bonsoir \u00bb \u00e0 voix basse \u00e0 Riccardi, puis serre la main des deux inconnus dans la pi\u00e8ce.\u00c0 ses yeux, le travail de Riccardo n\u2019est pas d\u2019enseigner le talent. C\u2019est, pour partie, de le perfectionner et de le canaliser. Mais c\u2019est aussi d\u2019inculquer aux joueurs des valeurs qui leur serviront, qu\u2019ils r\u00e9ussissent ou non. \u00ab La ponctualit\u00e9, les bonnes mani\u00e8res, le fair-play, l\u2019autorit\u00e9, le respect du maillot \u00bb.Il connait la situation familiale de chacun. Certains, comme Mbapp\u00e9, ont l\u2019appui d\u2019une famille forte et soud\u00e9e. Mais bien d\u2019autres arrivent avec des situations plus difficiles. \u00ab On a tendance \u00e0 oublier le r\u00f4le crucial des entra\u00eeneurs \u00bb, estime Cyril Nazareth, professeur de sociologie au Centre Maurice Halbwachs qui s\u2019int\u00e9resse au r\u00f4le du football dans les banlieues. \u00ab Ils aident \u00e0 fournir une structure aux enfants et sont souvent une figure d\u2019autorit\u00e9-cl\u00e9 \u00bb.Leur port\u00e9e est extraordinaire. Il y a 30 000 coachs en \u00cele-de-France, pour 253 000 joueurs affili\u00e9s, dont plus du tiers ont moins de 18 ans. Cela conf\u00e8re au sport et aux coachs un r\u00f4le social important. \u00ab Ces jeunes peuvent avoir des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, mais par la pratique du football, ils acqui\u00e8rent l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 et respect \u00bb, selon Nazareth, qui a suivi plusieurs \u00e9quipes de jeunes de la Seine-Saint-Denis dans le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate ethnographique.C\u2019est exactement ce que Riccardi esp\u00e8re inculquer \u00e0 ceux dont il a la charge ; c\u2019est l\u2019exemple que donne Mbapp\u00e9. \u00c0 19 ans, avec le monde \u00e0 ses pieds, il est connu pour sa maturit\u00e9, son intelligence, sa politesse. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Elys\u00e9e, pas moins, pour parler de sport avec Emmanuel Macron. \u00ab Il se comporte tr\u00e8s bien sur le terrain et en dehors \u00bb, dit fi\u00e8rement Riccardi.La France entretient depuis longtemps une relation ambig\u00fce avec son \u00e9quipe nationale, en raison de performances parfois m\u00e9diocres en comp\u00e9tition, mais aussi de scandales en s\u00e9rie : une gr\u00e8ve pendant le Mondial de 2010 ; un cas de chantage \u00e0 la sex-tape; du ressentiment contre les joueurs qui refusent de chanter l\u2019hymne national avant les matchs.Les controverses, pourtant, sont aussi teint\u00e9es d\u2019un soup\u00e7on de pr\u00e9judice social. Les leaders de la gr\u00e8ve de Knysna en 2010 avaient grandi en banlieue. Karim Benzema, th\u00e9oriquement le \u00ab m\u00e9chant \u00bb dans l\u2019affaire du chantage, vient d\u2019un milieu lyonnais d\u00e9favoris\u00e9. Hugo Lloris, capitaine de l\u2019\u00e9quipe nationale, issu de la classe moyenne et fils d\u2019un avocat ni\u00e7ois, chante toujours \u00ab la Marseillaise \u00bb. Ni Benzema ni Franck Rib\u00e9ry, des enfants de la banlieue, ne le faisaient.Cette vision n\u2019a fait que s\u2019enraciner : pour Beaud, les \u00e9meutes de 2005 en Seine-Saint-Denis, dont Bondy fait partie, ainsi que la crainte de la criminalit\u00e9, du terrorisme et des politiques identitaires, ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 renforcer l\u2019id\u00e9e que les joueurs des banlieues, et les banlieues elles-m\u00eames, n\u2019apportent que des probl\u00e8mes.\u00ab Pour certains joueurs, \u00e7a peut \u00eatre dur de se dire fran\u00e7ais aujourd\u2019hui : ils ont souffert de tous les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes rattach\u00e9s aux banlieues \u00bb, dit Beaud. \u00abIls sont stigmatis\u00e9s avant m\u00eame de devenir professionnels \u00bb.Symbole de cette stigmatisation, le boulevard p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique qui encercle Paris, et qui fait office de fronti\u00e8re physique, sociale et ethnique. Au-de\u00e7\u00e0, le Paris \u00ab civilis\u00e9 \u00bb et ais\u00e9; au-del\u00e0, les banlieues, comme celles de la Seine-Saint-Denis, o\u00f9 beaucoup souffrent d\u2019un manque d\u2019opportunit\u00e9s, d\u2019un d\u00e9ficit de logements corrects et d\u2019un ch\u00f4mage croissant \u2014 fin 2017, celui-ci s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 11,4 % dans les banlieues. Le ch\u00f4mage des jeunes \u00e9tait de 23 %.Le sport et les infrastructures qu\u2019il requiert ont longtemps servi d\u2019espoirs pour stimuler la croissance dans les banlieues. La construction du Stade de France en Seine-Saint-Denis en pr\u00e9vision des jeux de 1998 \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e transformer la vie ici. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 ce projet eut des r\u00e9sultats limit\u00e9s, la France esp\u00e8re r\u00e9ussir pour les Jeux Olympiques de 2024 : le d\u00e9partement accueillera la piscine olympique, le village olympique et le centre de presse des Jeux.Mais des exemples comme Mbapp\u00e9 peuvent sans doute \u00eatre d\u2019une plus grande efficacit\u00e9. Une grande partie de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de France qui participera au Mondial est originaire des banlieues, et elle est appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e pour sa jeunesse, sa fra\u00eecheur et \u2014 \u00e9l\u00e9ment crucial \u2014 son caract\u00e8re sympathique. On est tent\u00e9 de croire qu\u2019une victoire fran\u00e7aise en Russie aurait le m\u00eame impact que celle des champions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents : la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry et Patrick Vieira, en 1998, qu\u2019on a nomm\u00e9e Black Blanc Beur et dont on disait qu\u2019elle incarnait une vision d\u2019une France nouvelle et multiculturelle.\u00c0 Bondy, on n\u2019y croit pas trop. Pas plus que la France ne s\u2019est mu\u00e9e apr\u00e8s 1998, il faudra plus qu\u2019une bonne Coupe du monde pour effacer des d\u00e9cennies de stigmatisation et de m\u00e9pris. \u00ab Quand les choses vont mal pour les jeunes joueurs, les gens les traitent de racailles et rejettent la faute sur la banlieue \u00bb, dit Suner. \u00ab Mais quand tout se passe bien, on ne dit rien \u00bb.Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il y a des limites \u00e0 ce que le football peut accomplir. Les politiques ont beau brandir l\u2019exemple des joueurs issus des banlieues, les leaders locaux et les responsables d\u2019associations sportives comme Riccardi et Coulibaly ne cessent de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter qu\u2019il faut \u00e0 la jeunesse davantage qu\u2019une seule (et hautement improbable) perspective pour s\u2019en sortir.\u00ab La r\u00e9ussite sportive n\u2019est que la face cach\u00e9e d\u2019un \u00e9chec social g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 \u00bb, d\u00e9plore Beaud. \u00ab Ce bassin de talents en football ne devrait pas occulter le manque d\u2019opportunit\u00e9s pour la jeunesse. \u00bbQue Mbapp\u00e9 et ses pairs n\u2019arrivent pas \u00e0 transformer la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise ne signifie cependant pas qu\u2019ils ne comptent pas. D\u2019o\u00f9 ils viennent, dans les banlieues, des joueurs comme eux sont source de fiert\u00e9 et d\u2019espoir, la preuve que le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9.\u00ab \u00c7a montre qu\u2019il est possible de r\u00e9ussir en venant d\u2019ici \u00bb, dit Riccardi.Dans toute l\u2019\u00cele-de-France, des milliers de joueurs en herbe \u2014 dont chacun r\u00eave qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre le prochain grand \u2014 suivront le Mondial en supporters non seulement de leur pays, mais aussi des gar\u00e7ons exceptionnels qui \u00e9taient comme eux il y a peu, ces stars d\u2019une \u00e9quipe construite dans l\u2019ombre o\u00f9 se cache la plus grande fabrique de talents d\u2019Europe.\u00ab Les joueurs du Mondial pourraient \u00eatre nos voisins, nos petits fr\u00e8res \u00bb, se r\u00e9jouit Coulibaly. \u00ab Ils sont de notre univers, et ils repr\u00e9sentent la France. \u00bbAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Hackers Aren\u2019t Afraid of Us", "Date": "2018-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisMr. Sanger is a national security correspondent for The Times.WASHINGTON \u2014 Ask finance ministers and central bankers around the world about their worst nightmare and the answer is almost always the same: Sometime soon the North Koreans or the Russians will improve on the two huge cyberattacks they pulled off last year. One temporarily crippled the British health care system and the other devastated Ukraine before rippling across the world, disrupting shipping and shutting factories \u2014 a billion-dollar cyberattack the White House called \u201cthe most destructive and costly in history.\u201dThe fact that no intelligence agency saw either attack coming \u2014 and that countries were so fumbling in their responses \u2014 led a group of finance ministers to simulate a similar attack that shut down financial markets and froze global transactions. By several accounts, it quickly spun into farce: No one wanted to admit how much damage could be done or how helpless they would be to deter it.Cyberattacks have been around for two decades, appearing in plotlines from \u201cDie Hard\u201d movies to the new novel by Bill Clinton and James Patterson. But in the real world, something has changed since 2008, when the United States and Israel mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack in history on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, temporarily crippling it in hopes of forcing Iran to the bargaining table. (The two countries never acknowledged responsibility for the attack.)Yet in this arms race, the United States has often been its own worst enemy. Because our government has been so incompetent at protecting its highly sophisticated cyberweapons, those weapons have been stolen out of the electronic vaults of the National Security Agency and the C.I.A. and shot right back at us. That\u2019s what happened with the WannaCry ransomware attack by North Korea last year, which used some of the sophisticated tools the N.S.A. had developed. No wonder the agency has refused to admit that the weapons were made in America: It raised the game of its attackers.That is why cyberweapons have emerged as such effective tools for states of all sizes: a way to disrupt and exercise power or influence without starting a shooting war. Cyberattacks have long been hard to stop because determining where they come from takes time \u2014 and sometimes the mystery is never solved. But even as the United States has gotten better at attributing attacks, its responses have failed to keep pace.So while the United States remains the greatest cyberpower on earth, it is increasingly losing daily cyberconflicts. The range of American targets is so wide and deep that it is almost impossible to understand all of the vulnerabilities. And because most of those targets don\u2019t belong to the government \u2014 banks, power grids, shipping systems, hospitals and internet-linked security cameras, cars and appliances \u2014 confusion reigns over who is responsible for defending them and who will decide when to strike back. We have the most fearsome cyberweaponry on the planet, yet we\u2019re afraid to use it for fear of what will come next.Consider the Russian cyberattacks that preceded the well-known hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers in 2015 and 2016. Just before, Russian hackers had taken up residence in the unclassified servers at the State Department and the White House, and later deep inside the systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.At the State Department, the eviction took weeks, shutting down systems during negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal. The hackers were even bolder at the White House. Instead of disappearing when they were exposed, they fought back, looking to install new malware as soon as the old versions were neutralized. \u201cIt was basically hand-to-hand combat,\u201d recalled Richard Ledgett, the deputy director of the N.S.A. at the time. It appears the attackers just wanted to prove they could go, and stay, anywhere in the American government\u2019s network.Yet out of a reflexive secrecy about cyberoperations \u2014 motivated by an unwillingness to acknowledge both our vulnerabilities and our detection abilities \u2014 the United States never called out the Russians for what they were doing. Nor did we exact any punishment. That proved to be a huge mistake.If Mr. Putin thought there was no price to be paid for invading White House systems, why wouldn\u2019t he attack the Democratic National Committee? And as the Russian attacks continued, no one in the American government detected the larger pattern or Russia\u2019s ambitions to affect the election. Most officials assumed it was plain old espionage.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we had our radar off to these kinds of attacks,\u201d a senior official told me. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t even built the radar.\u201dBy the summer of 2016, some Obama administration officials, waking to the threat, proposed counterstrikes that included exposing Mr. Putin\u2019s hidden bank accounts and his ties to the oligarchs and cutting off Russia\u2019s banking system. But the potential for escalation caused Mr. Obama and his top aides to reject the plan.\u201cIt was an enormously satisfying response,\u201d a senior American official told me later, \u201cuntil we began to think about what it would do to the Europeans.\u201dMr. Obama also understandably feared that anything the United States did might provoke Mr. Putin to tinker with election systems just enough to give credence to Donald Trump\u2019s warning that the system was \u201crigged.\u201dSince the election, the American retaliation has included closing some Russian consulates and recreation centers and expelling spies \u2014 actions one Obama national security official called \u201cthe perfect 19th-century solution to a 21st-century problem.\u201d President Trump has signed off on some additional economic sanctions against individual Russians.But the United States\u2019 problem isn\u2019t toughness \u2014 it\u2019s an absence of strategy. The larger lesson of the past few years is that unless we get smarter a lot faster about deterring these pernicious, hard-to-find forms of cyberaggression, much of what binds our digitally connected society will be eaten away. We have spent so much time worrying about a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor,\u2019\u2019 the attack that takes out the power grid, that we have focused far too little on the subtle manipulation of data that can mean that no election, medical record or self-driving car can be truly trusted. And ultimately that absence of trust will destroy the glue of American society the way the Stuxnet computer worm destroyed those Iranian centrifuges. It will cause them to spin out of control.So what is to be done?First, the United States must significantly improve its cyberdefenses. The wide-open vulnerabilities in America\u2019s networks have essentially deterred the United States from credibly threatening retaliation against the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Iranians. One way to start is to make sure no new equipment goes on the market unless it meets basic security requirements. We won\u2019t let cars on the road without airbags, so why do we do less with the systems that connect them to the internet?Second, we must decide what networks we care most about defending \u2014 and make those priorities clear. Mr. Mattis\u2019s threat to turn to nuclear weapons hardly seems credible \u2014 unless the cyberattack would create an existential threat to America. That requires an intensive public review of what is critical to our nation\u2019s survival. President Trump forfeited the perfect opportunity when he decided against a commission to learn the larger lessons from the 2016 election. Our politics have gotten in the way of our safety.Finally, the United States needs to end the reflexive secrecy surrounding its cyberoperations. We need to explain to the world why we have cyberweapons, what they are capable of and, most important, what we will not use them for. Clearly, it is in the nation\u2019s interests to develop global norms clarifying that some targets are off limits: election systems, hospitals and emergency communications systems, and maybe even electric power grids and other civilian targets.Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, has proposed digital Geneva Conventions that begin to establish those norms, outside the structure of governments and treaties. It\u2019s an imperfect solution, but a start. Intelligence agencies hate this idea: They want the most latitude possible for future operations in an uncertain world. But in any arms control negotiation, to create limits on others, you need to give up something. Otherwise, we will remain trapped in an endlessly escalating war, one we may well lose.David E.

Bush, the aid the United States had provided amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 not \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d More than two dozen countries, including the United States, contributed about $2 billion toward the construction of the reactors and fuel shipments. However, according to the former government analyst Robert L. Carlin, \u201calmost every penny of those billions went to South Korean and Japanese firms building the reactors.\u201d\u201cThis \u2018billions of dollars\u2019 to North Korea is pernicious myth,\u201d said Mr. Carlin, a retired C.I.A. and State Department analyst of North Korea and former adviser to K.E.D.O. \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to the charge that the North took large sums of money from the U.S. and then proceeded to break agreements once the check had cleared.\u201dKelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, said the 1994 agreement froze North Korea\u2019s plutonium production and installed inspectors in nuclear facilities for nearly a decade.

{"Headline": "Who Will Lead Europe Now?", "Date": "2018-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Kauffmann is the editorial director of Le Monde.PARIS \u2014 In a book just published, \u201cThe World As It Is,\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, tells of a tear in Angela Merkel\u2019s eye as she bade farewell to the departing American president for the final time in Berlin on Nov. 17, 2016. Nine days earlier, the election of his successor, Donald J. Trump, had shaken the world. Nowhere had the tremor been felt deeper than in Europe; the German chancellor told Mr. Obama that she saw it as her duty to run for a fourth term because of Mr. Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s all alone,\u201d Mr. Obama noted. Someone had to take on the mantle and defend the liberal international order.Chancellor Merkel ran, barely won and spent the next six months negotiating a governing coalition. In the meantime, in France, Emmanuel Macron won a stunning victory against his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen. Last month, as President Macron was about to fly to St. Petersburg to meet President Vladimir V. Putin, I asked a Russian diplomat how the French head of state would be perceived in Russia. \u201cAs the leader of the Western world,\u201d he replied. Having apparently given up on an American administration they have learned not to trust because of its leader\u2019s unpredictability and the checks, balances and investigations that limit him, the Russians are putting their scorn of Europeans on hold in hopes of finding someone more reliable to talk to.That the \u201cWestern world\u201d still exists in the eyes of the Russians is certainly reassuring, since the very existence of the West is now being questioned within the trans-Atlantic community. When the leaders of the G-7 countries (United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Japan) gather in Quebec on Friday for their annual meeting, it will be no love feast. Already having shrunk from G-8 after Russia was excluded following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the group was described last week as the \u201cG-6+1\u201d by Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, as he and other European ministers were angrily confronting the American Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, over President Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.But don\u2019t bet on the \u201cG-6\u201d to spearhead a united assault to defend the free world. Italy is now also led by populists and Britain is absorbed in deep soul-searching as it severs its links with the European Union. At a security summit on Asia last week, Singapore\u2019s defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, declined to call Britain \u201ca European power.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are now,\u201d he added, perplexed.Welcome to the world of 2018, when we celebrate the centenary of the end of World War I and indulge in nostalgic reminiscence of the popular upheavals of 1968, 50 years ago, while our current international order is in disarray. This may well end up as the year of the awakening of Europe. We will have one man to thank for opening our eyes: Donald J. Trump.Harsh words have been uttered on both sides of the Atlantic, but the word that sticks most in European capitals these days is \u201chumiliation\u201d \u2014 a feeling also shared in Canada. Humiliation, that is, at the hands of your staunchest ally. When President Trump withdraws from the Iranian nuclear deal a few days after the French president and the German chancellor have gone to Washington with a passionate plea to save it, it is humiliating. When he declares tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on grounds of national security, it is insulting. The era when American officials, even at times of disagreement, managed to keep a minimum of civility with their allies is over. President Trump, Mr. Mnuchin and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross are uncannily unpleasant. The ambassadors who represent America are undiplomatic.Rudeness is this administration\u2019s trademark. No wonder the discussion between the G-7 ministers of finance last week was heated. As a senior French official who sought anonymity for reasons of diplomacy, admitted, \u201cG6+1 does describe a reality.\u201dWhat the Europeans are finally starting to understand is that the crisis at hand is not only about bad manners. It is about a fundamental change in the trans-Atlantic relationship. Most likely, it is about the end of the world order as we have known it. The process started well before President Trump\u2019s election, but his predecessor, Mr. Obama, had put such an elegant touch to it that the Europeans were in denial about it, as Ms. Merkel\u2019s tear showed only too well.\u201cDonald Trump is breaking diplomatic rules and he does not even care,\u201d Claudia Major, an expert with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told me. \u201cWe think he is weird and that after him, it will get better. No! This would be our biggest mistake,\u201d she said. Arnaud Danjean, a French member of the European Parliament, says that many European leaders \u201cwould like to go back to the good old days, when the United States was in charge. This is their comfort zone. But it won\u2019t happen.\u201dA somber mood has fallen on the European foreign policy community, now conscious that this Jacksonian moment for their American partner will outlive Donald Trump. An offhand bit of hyperbole I heard from one French security expert hinted at the level of disappointment: \u201cWould the United States react if Russian tanks rolled into Latvia? I am not even sure. NATO is a dead man walking.\u201dAt the annual conference of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris last week, George Soros warned of \u201can existential danger\u201d for Europe and insisted that Europe \u201cmust reinvent itself.\u201d This is what President Macron has been advocating for a year. But as the initial enthusiasm over his election dies down, lengthy pleas for a \u201cstrong multilateralism\u201d seem to fall on deaf ears. The young, energetic French president has a lot of admirers but few supporters. \u201cHe is our last hope,\u201d a Central European government minister told me, making sure that his comment was \u201coff the record.\u201d It took Ms. Merkel a full nine months to formulate a response to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s proposals to strengthen the European Union. When she finally did, last Sunday in a newspaper interview, her positions were so cautious that one wondered why it had taken her so long. \u201cStill a lot of work to do,\u201d sighed the senior French official.Yet there is no choice. Neither China nor Russia offer Europe an alternative to the United States. The continent will still maintain a special relationship with Washington, but it must start building its own version of a rule-based international order. It cannot envisage another way of relating to other powers, because the European Union itself is in essence a rule-based regional order.There are many hurdles along the way. Italy\u2019s new populist leaders will probably be pushing east, toward Mr. Putin. Poland\u2019s populist leaders will be pushing west, toward Mr. Trump. But take notice: none of them wishes to leave the European Union. It is now up to France and Germany to lead together, as they\u2019ve done since shortly after World War II, and up to the northern member states to play a more active role.Ms. Merkel is finally ready. So let\u2019s move on now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governments Explore Using Blockchains to Improve Service", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you buy a house in Chicago and want to register the deed, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds will accept two kinds of submissions: paper records and scanned images of paper records. No matter which option you choose, the clerks will manually type the information into the county database.Roughly once a week, someone \u2014 for example, an addict claiming a home that actually belongs to a grandparent with dementia \u2014 will mail in a fake document, and \u201cif they formatted it correctly, we have to record it,\u201d said John Mirkovic, the deputy recorder. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the main reasons we\u2019re so interested in blockchain.\u201dBlockchain is a data structure popularized by the digital currency Bitcoin. It\u2019s also one of the biggest buzzwords in Silicon Valley, finance and government, where proponents say it can save money and increase trust in public institutions.\u201cWe\u2019re throwing a lot of things at the wall right now and seeing what will stick,\u201d said Andrew Young, knowledge director at New York University\u2019s GovLab.The term blockchain was first used to describe the public record that exists for every transaction on the Bitcoin network, copies of which are kept by thousands of entities around the world. Now it\u2019s used to describe a wide range of systems that incorporate cryptography or decentralized data storage.\u201cI think it\u2019s important to make clear that there is no one \u2018blockchain,\u2019\u201d said Stefaan Verhulst, the co-founder of GovLab. \u201cWhat we see right now is massive experimentation in different versions of blockchain technologies that provide for different results.\u201dIn theory, blockchain can save money and reduce errors by replacing workers, while adding accountability by generating a public record of all activity.This has even greater implications for countries with low trust in government, said Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor who specializes in distributed systems.\u201cIf you look at a government system that is opaque, that\u2019s closed behind doors, versus one where I can inspect what\u2019s going on behind it, it\u2019s an amazing leap forward,\u201d Mr. Sirer said. \u201cIt means sleeping better at night.\u201dBlockchain can also enable seamless transactions with people outside the jurisdiction and give residents greater control over their data, advocates say.\u201cWe want you to buy a house while you\u2019re lying on a couch somewhere,\u201d said Zeina El Kaissi, head of emerging technology at Smart Dubai, which is leading the city\u2019s blockchain initiative. \u201cBlockchain can make that possible.\u201dWhen the original blockchain arrived in 2009, it was a ledger for Bitcoins. Now the databases have spread to many companies and governments.One goal is to ensure that Dubai residents can submit documentation for common tasks, like buying a home or applying to schools, digitally and only once. The current system often requires multiple visits to government offices.\u201cToday we\u2019re using human beings as data transfer tools,\u201d Ms. El Kaissi said. \u201cThat\u2019s just a waste of my human life, to be honest.\u201dGovernment agencies usually aren\u2019t the first to try new technology, but the momentum around the blockchain industry has spurred adoption. It helps that some vendors are offering their services pro bono or at a discount, avoiding what is typically an arduous procurement process.Still, there are significant challenges. The technology is immature, with problems around speed, volume and security, Mr. Sirer said. The industry is also immature, with new vendors popping up and dropping out. Finally, political bureaucracy can be a hindrance.The pilot made it clear that some foundational work is needed before Illinois can move to a blockchain land registry, Mr. Mirkovic said. Records must be digitized. Data formats must be standardized. A law must be passed to require that title transfers be registered with the government. Finally, Illinois voters recently decided to merge the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and the Cook County Clerk\u2019s office, which would delay any decision on blockchains until 2020.The pilot also showed that the agency could solve some problems without blockchain. The pilot inspired the office\u2019s existing software vendor, Conduent, to integrate some blockchain-like concepts into its more conventional design. And in his post-mortem, Mr. Mirkovic pointed to Iowa, where land records were accurate, title insurance was cheap, and citizens could look up information in a statewide online database that did not use blockchain.Mr. Mirkovic hopes that his office can eventually use the technology. \u201cI still believe the idea is too good to ignore,\u201d he said.Proponents in those states praised legislatures for acting quickly to keep up with technology, but Angela Walch, a research fellow at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London, is concerned that they\u2019re making bad law.\u201cA bunch of states are really in a rush to pass some sort of legislation to demonstrate how crypto-friendly or tech savvy they are,\u201d she said.Estimates vary as to when blockchain will have an impact in government. Dubai\u2019s goal is to have its systems running by 2020, but Mr. Sirer said it would take at least 10 years to see an improvement. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a fast process,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article omitted partners in the land registry pilot in Cook County, Ill. They were the New York office of the law firm Hogan Lovells, the Chicago law firm Goldberg Kohn, and Onyx Electronics of Valparaiso, Ind., all of which joined velox.RE in doing the work for free. The article also suggested incorrectly that the pilot involved only creating blockchains for parcels of land; related work also included research and encryption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Veterans Owe Thousands for Survivor Benefits. Why Can\u2019t They Opt Out?", "Date": "2018-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarOn an afternoon in late February, Staff Sgt. John Daniel Shannon, who goes by Dan, got in his truck and drove down the dirt road near his house in Westcliffe, Colo., to meet his son\u2019s school bus at the bottom of the hill. It is one of few tasks Dan, who is 54 and retired, can still manage on his own after being wounded in Iraq in 2004. As he waited, he checked his mailbox, where he found a letter addressed to him from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, an office within the Defense Department. When he opened the letter, his stomach dropped. It said Dan owed the government money for something called the Survivor Benefit Plan and that the department would start deducting the program premiums from his monthly entitlement for combat-related disabilities. The notice also said he owed $23,451 in unpaid premiums, plus interest, that he was expected to pay.Dan and his son drove back to the house, where he found his wife, Torrey, working at her desk. He dropped the letter on her desk in frustration. \u201cThey are going to start garnishing my pay again,\u201d he said. Torrey picked up the letter and read it. There was no explanation of their rights nor any mention of an appeals process. She tried to calm her husband down, but he was visibly shaken. He was stuttering, his balance was off and the corner of his mouth had tightened.It had been a stressful few months in their home. Torrey and her 21-year-old son had both been in car accidents. Dan also had a series of health scares, including a corneal ulcer that almost cost him his eyesight. Torrey had been trying to create a low-stress environment in their home so that her husband could properly heal. She canceled their home phone service, for example, to prevent the telephone ring from disturbing his sleep. But when Dan opened the letter, it seemed to undo all of his progress.\u201cThe timing was the worst possible moment ever,\u201d Torrey says. \u201cIt was like one thing after another.\u201dTorrey told her husband not to worry; she would find a way to take care of it.\u201cI feel like I live underneath a heavy weight that\u2019s waiting to drop down on me at any time,\u201d Dan says. \u201cWhen I read that letter, that weight fell down.\u201d His situation, as well as his struggle to leave the program, is not unusual. Other veterans describe a bureaucratic process that has led them down a path with few answers.Cpl. Travis Greene, who is retired from the Marines and lost his legs after an improvised-explosive-device blast hit his vehicle in Iraq, doesn\u2019t remember being told about the program at retirement. He is confused why he was enrolled, because he wasn\u2019t married at the time. He now owes the government $12,057. When Greene called the number listed on the letter, the Defense Department\u2019s representative had no information about the exception for disabled veterans, for which he would qualify. He asked to speak to a manager, who told him to mail in a form. After he did, a response came in the mail that told him he wasn\u2019t eligible to withdraw. The Defense Department began withholding $95 from his monthly compensation.Sgt. Peter Damon, who lost his right arm and his left forearm in 2003 in Iraq, remembers being told about the Survivor Benefit Plan at retirement, but he didn\u2019t want to enroll. A military representative told him he needed to join the program in order to retire, and that it would be easy to drop the program later. But it wasn\u2019t. Damon tried multiple times to get out of the program without success. He reached out to Senator John Kerry\u2019s office in 2008 for help, but Kerry\u2019s office couldn\u2019t find a solution either. Ultimately, the senator\u2019s staff advised Damon to simply not pay the premium bills when they came in the mail. Now, Damon owes the government $19,547 and has a $115 deduction from his monthly disability pay.The Survivor Benefit Plan was established in 1972 as a way to help replace retirement payments made to the family after a veteran dies. To receive the program\u2019s benefits, the veteran must pay monthly premiums for 30 years and reach the age of 70. If the veteran dies before meeting these terms, the survivors are still eligible. Generally, enrollment in the program is permanent, but there is a one-year window between the second and third year after retirement in which retirees can opt out. There are special exceptions to this rule for disabled veterans like Dan; if veterans leave the program, however, they won\u2019t be reimbursed for the premiums they have already paid and are barred from joining the program in the future.All service members with eligible beneficiaries at retirement are required to enroll in the Survivor Benefit Plan, unless they take action to opt out by filling out a form that they and their spouses have notarized. Without filling out that form, the retiree is automatically enrolled at maximum coverage. For most retirees, the premiums are deducted from their retirement pay each month. But for veterans with disabilities, their retiree pay sometimes isn\u2019t enough to deduct from, because they receive most of their benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs rather than the Defense Department. In these cases, the Defense Department was sending the veterans monthly bills through the mail. For years, some service members were opted in to the Survivor Benefit Plan without realizing it or were being told by Defense Department representatives that if they didn\u2019t want the benefit, they shouldn\u2019t pay the bills. This resulted in thousands of veterans who were enrolled but not paying their premiums. To prevent these debts from growing further, legislation was inserted into last year\u2019s defense bill allowing the Defense Department to automatically deduct Survivor Benefit Plan premiums from a veteran\u2019s Combat Related Special Compensation, a different entitlement for those wounded in action, that was previously untouchable for these premiums.Amid the flurry of information he received about reintegrating into civilian life during retirement, Dan doesn\u2019t remember signing up for the Survivor Benefit Plan, nor does Torrey, despite the Defense Department\u2019s policy that mandates that a service member be told about their program options and assisted with enrollment. A spokesman from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service wouldn\u2019t comment on the Shannon family\u2019s case, but said that the the Defense Finance and Accounting Service receives \u201cliterally thousands of calls\u201d a day, and so it was \u201cnot feasible to comment on conversations recounted in third-party discussions.\u201d He added that the struggles veterans are having about leaving the program and the instructions they\u2019re received not to pay the bills when they come in the mail were \u201cnot in line with the training and guidance provided to our customer-service representatives.\u201dFor wounded veterans, the retirement process can be a confusing time, says John Roberts, national service director for the Wounded Warrior Project. It involves \u201cso much information being thrown at you and people telling you to sign this document and that document.\u201d This is on top of the physical injuries the veteran is managing. \u201cIt causes a great deal of panic when you tell someone that they owe the federal government $20,000,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of our veterans feed their family and survive off their federal benefits because of the severity of their injuries.\u201dWhen Dan was finally allowed to retire and go home, he started to receive bills for Survivor Benefit Plan premiums in the mail. Torrey, who handles his finances because of his brain injury, called the Defense Finance and Accounting Services and asked if they could unenroll. She was told by a government official to simply not pay the bills. If her husband didn\u2019t pay, his dependents just wouldn\u2019t receive the death benefit. But Torrey remained concerned because the bills kept showing up in their mailbox, so she called several more times. She was then told it was too late. Dan had missed the one-year window to leave the program, between the second and third year after retirement. Neither Torrey nor her husband remembers receiving any notice warning them of that. Other families they knew, who were also trying to get out of the program, faced similar problems.\u201cIt was like an endless loop of conversations that went nowhere,\u201d Torrey says. \u201cI had other things to worry about.\u201d The bills kept coming in the mail each month, and then the letter saying Dan owed money arrived this February. It gave no guidance on how to leave the Survivor Benefit Plan but listed a toll-free number. Torrey called and waited on the line for two hours for a representative. Again, a Defense Department representative told her that her husband missed the narrow window of opting out of the program. Torrey learned that because Dan is disabled, there should be a loophole that allows him to unenroll, but she was disconnected from the call before the representative could provide her with information on how to do this. The Shannon family is eligible for an almost-identical benefit through the Department of Veteran Affairs because of Dan\u2019s disability rating, for which he doesn\u2019t have to pay monthly premiums, but the government does not allow families to receive both entitlements, so the V.A. benefit is deducted from the Survivor Benefit Plan total. What Torrey would have received from the Survivor Benefit Plan will be either eliminated, or nearly eliminated, by this offset, which is commonly referred to by military family advocates as the \u201cwidow\u2019s tax.\u201d While Congress has tried to remedy this with a special payment, called the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance, it falls $948 short per month. For the Shannon family, this means they are now receiving an automatic deduction for a benefit that won\u2019t fully benefit them.In May, the first deductions of $173 started hitting Dan\u2019s monthly check. Torrey wrote a letter to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service asking, again, that he be removed from the program. \u201cPlease be aware that this benefit was never elected to our knowledge, and if it was, it was not explained clearly and in writing to both of us to make a choice in the matter,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMr. Shannon has a traumatic brain injury and has no memory or paperwork of this process of election.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have the benefit of arguing this in a court anywhere,\u201d Torrey says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the benefit of speaking to someone knowledgeable. We don\u2019t have the benefit of truly appealing this process.\u201d For the Shannon family, a monthly cut to Dan\u2019s compensation means that they will have to tighten their budget. There will be less money for groceries and gas. \u201cWhen a couple hundred dollars comes out of your pay every month, that hurts,\u201d Torrey says. \u201cThat affects your quality of life.\u201dIn June 2016, Dan received a letter from the V.A. saying he owed the department $11,119 in disability compensation that he was supposedly overpaid. The letter said the V.A. had not been able to verify in 2016 that his wife and sons were still his dependents, even though the department had confirmed it in 2014. The V.A. was planning to withhold most of his monthly disability compensation check until the overpayment claim was repaid to the government. Torrey spent months fighting with the V.A. until it agreed not to withhold the money.The Shannons were also blindsided in 2016 when the V.A. reduced Torrey\u2019s pay as Dan\u2019s full-time caregiver by about $830 per month, citing a \u201cclinical eligibility assessment re-evaluation.\u201d In her appeal of the decision, she included multiple letters from health professionals that outlined his continued dependency on her care, including one from one of his V.A. nurses noting that \u201cif he is not able to have this constant supervision in the home, he would need to be placed in an institution for a higher level of care.\u201d She appealed the decision twice but was denied. In all of these cases, the family had to hire an attorney to help them.\u201cJesus, can we catch a break?\u201d Torrey asks. \u201cCan we come up for air for once?\u201dThe uncertainty about what they could expect from the government pushed the couple to refinance their home twice so they would have a lower monthly mortgage payment and extra money on hand. Torrey also started a small business out of their home, creating online courses and group coaching sessions targeting women who are overwhelmed, to help them create more stability in their lives.\u201cWe cannot trust what our income is going to be, so we literally manage our budget in a way of worst possible scenario,\u201d Torrey says.These struggles also rub at Dan\u2019s deeper anxieties over whether he will be able to provide for his family given his disabilities. He hasn\u2019t had suicidal thoughts since his days at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, but he fears that a large withholding of his benefits could send him spiraling down that path again. \u201cIt\u2019s my biggest fear,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I lost my benefits, because of someone just pushing a button, I would be a suicide risk again. It\u2019s because I can\u2019t care for my family.\u201dWith each passing month, Dan\u2019s debt grows. The government is adding a 6 percent compound interest rate on the unpaid premiums, meaning the total has grown by more $570 since February. \u201cI live under their power,\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnother garnishment that I have no control over.\u201dSara Jerving is a reporter living in Nairobi.

{"Headline": "Tropical Forests Suffered Near-Record Tree Losses in 2017", "Date": "2018-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Brazil, forest fires set by farmers and ranchers to clear land for agriculture raged out of control last year, wiping out more than 3 million acres of trees as a severe drought gripped the region. Those losses undermined Brazil\u2019s recent efforts to protect its rain forests.In Colombia, a landmark peace deal between the government and the country\u2019s largest rebel group paved the way for a rush of mining, logging and farming that caused deforestation in the nation\u2019s Amazon region to spike last year.That made 2017 the second-worst year for tropical tree cover loss in the satellite record, just below the losses in 2016. \u201cThese new numbers show an alarming situation for the world\u2019s rain forests,\u201d said Andreas Dahl-Jorgensen, deputy director of the Norwegian government\u2019s International Climate and Forest Initiative. \u201cWe simply won\u2019t meet the climate targets that we agreed to in Paris without a drastic reduction in tropical deforestation and restoration of forests around the world.\u201dBut figuring out precisely where forests are vanishing has long been a challenge. For decades, the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization has relied on ground-level assessments from individual countries to track deforestation. Yet not all tropical countries have adequate capacity to monitor their forests, and the measurements can be plagued by inconsistencies.\u201cAs FARC has demobilized, large areas are opening up once again, and you\u2019re seeing this rush of people grabbing land for different reasons, like planting cocoa or cattle ranching,\u201d said Mikaela Weisse, a research analyst with Global Forest Watch. The satellite data also provided a clearer picture of Brazil\u2019s vast Amazon rain forests, long vulnerable to widespread deforestation. Over the past decade, the Brazilian government has moved to reduce illegal logging, and Western agriculture companies like Cargill have pledged to farm more sustainably.But the Global Forest Watch analysis showed that Brazil lost a record amount of tree cover in 2016 and 2017, in part because of large fire outbreaks in the Amazon. These fires are typically started by farmers and ranchers to clear land, but a severe drought last year caused them to spread rapidly, particularly in the parched southeast. The satellites also picked up evidence of large-scale land-clearing that may be occurring in areas where enforcement is weak.Elsewhere in the world, the satellite data showed that the Democratic Republic of Congo last year saw more forest loss than any other country outside of Brazil \u2014\u00a0some 3.6 million acres, up 6 percent from the previous year \u2014 with small-scale logging, charcoal production and farming all likely playing key roles.The researchers did find a tentative bright spot in Indonesia, where a government crackdown on deforestation may be showing early signs of success.But such positive stories tend to be a relative rarity and experts say much more is needed to slow the pace of deforestation. To date, just 2 percent of international financing for activities to fight climate change goes toward forest conservation, said Frances Seymour, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put out a house fire with a teaspoon,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

He invited Ms. Kardashian West to the White House last week to make the case for Ms. Johnson and Mr. Trump then invited his guest to come to the Oval Office to talk to him about her.The Justice Department declined to comment on the president\u2019s decision on Wednesday. According to its website, Ms. Johnson did not have a pending application for clemency registered with the department; a previous application was denied.Ms. Johnson had no fame or fortune, but her situation became a symbol for activists pushing for sentencing overhaul, an example of a system that in their view has taken punishment too far and disproportionately affected African-Americans like her. She was singled out by the A.C.L.U. as well as by Mic, a news website that seeks to \u201cgive voice to the underrepresented\u201d and interviewed Ms. Johnson about her plight.\u201cThey said that they could see the place where my body lay but they can never take me home again,\u201d she said.A single mother of five in Memphis, she struggled with gambling, unemployment, bankruptcy and foreclosure before becoming involved in a drug ring. She was arrested in 1993 as part of an operation that transported cocaine from Houston to Memphis, relaying coded messages between conspirators. She also purchased a house with a down payment that she structured with three separate money orders under the $10,000 reporting limit.Ms. Johnson was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and deliver, money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering and structuring a monetary transaction, according to the A.C.L.U. Under mandatory sentencing rules, she was given a life term without parole. Several co-defendants who testified against her were sentenced to probation or terms up to 10 years.While in prison, where she became a grandmother and great-grandmother, Ms. Johnson took educational and vocational programs, volunteered to help sick and dying prisoners, and helped coordinate the prison\u2019s Special Olympics.Katie Rogers and Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Champion of Responsible Investing Takes On the Gun Industry", "Date": "2018-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Streur, the chief executive of the investment firm Calvert Research & Management, remembers exactly where he was when he learned of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.Mr. Streur recalled standing in New York\u2019s Pennsylvania Station on the afternoon of Feb. 14, squinting at his iPhone in disbelief as he read that 17 teenagers and teachers had been shot dead, he said recently. As chief of one of the world\u2019s biggest responsible investing mutual funds, Mr. Streur was an activist on issues including climate change and equality, yet he said he felt powerless when it came to gun violence. Now, he wanted to see if he could use Calvert\u2019s financial clout to change the way guns \u2014 most notably the AR-15 military-style assault rifle used in the massacre and weapons like it \u2014 were sold in the United States.Two weeks after the shooting, on Feb. 28, he told his assistant: \u201cGet Kroger on the phone.\u201d But the management at Kroger, one of the nation\u2019s largest grocery-store chains, was gearing up for an earnings release and wasn\u2019t taking investor calls.\u201cI told her to call them back and tell them I don\u2019t want to talk about earnings. I want to talk about gun sales,\u201d Mr. Streur recalled. (Kroger sold guns in 43 of its 133 Fred Meyer stores in Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska, with the latter state selling the military-style assault rifle.)Calvert, which was acquired by Eaton Vance in 2016, currently has roughly $14 billion in assets and owns $2.6 million worth of Kroger shares. Mr. Streur wanted management to know \u201cif they weren\u2019t going to stop selling guns to kids,\u201d he would file a resolution to take it to a shareholder vote.\u201cWhen it comes to mass shootings, I think American society feels helpless about what can possibly be done to try and change the equation,\u201d Mr. Streur said in a recent phone interview from Washington, where he lives. \u201cTo have the capital markets be part of a solution is meaningful. It is responsible investing at its best,\u201d he said. (Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokeswoman, said that while the company welcomed dialogue from stakeholders, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be accurate to credit this policy shift\u201d solely to Mr. Streur\u2019s phone call.)But Mr. Streur is not a newcomer to this cause. \u201cI was a lone wolf for a long time,\u201d Mr. Streur said. \u201cA lot of mainstream investors thought this was too radical, too political, too crazy.\u201dJim Prescott, a compliance officer at Ariel Investments who has known Mr. Streur for more than 20 years, said he had a theory about where his friend\u2019s passion comes from. \u201cJohn\u2019s sense of morality, his drive to excel \u2014 that comes from somewhere out there in Wisconsin,\u201d Mr. Prescott said.Mr. Streur grew up in Milwaukee in a family that he said \u201caspired to be middle class,\u201d but always fell short. He excelled in high school sports and was offered football scholarships by several top colleges, but turned them down to try his hand at rowing instead. He wound up winning a national championship in his freshman year at the University of Wisconsin, and by age 20 had made the United States national rowing team. He said it was there he learned that \u201cbackground, pedigree and privilege matter not\u201d when compared to hard work and determination.After graduation, Mr. Streur joined the Wall Street investment giant Lehman Brothers. But the fiercely competitive, profit-hungry finance world was an uncomfortable fit, and he said he was quickly disillusioned by what he called \u201cgreedy\u201d banking culture.In August 1990, Mr. Streur left Wall Street to become a partner in a small money management firm, the Burridge Group, in Chicago. It was here that Mr. Streur was first exposed to the idea of responsible investing when his clients asked if he could divest their money from \u201cunsavory\u201d companies, like those involved in tobacco, gambling or guns. Mr. Streur rose to become the president of Burridge, where he worked on divestment drives for 17 years.During this time, Mr. Streur became increasingly frustrated by the limited impact of socially responsible investing. He went door-to-door on Wall Street trying to convince some of the titans of investment banking that responsible investing matters and should be woven into their business strategies, but faced repeated rejection, he said. In 2007, he said, his own research showed that fewer than 15 responsible investing companies with more than $1 billion in assets were operating in the United States at the time.A year later, Lehman Brothers, a goliath of investment banking in America, went bankrupt, triggering the global financial crisis of 2008. This proved to Mr. Streur that \u201cthe financial system itself didn\u2019t know what it was doing.\u201d He resigned from Burridge Group, now known as AMG Funds, to devote himself completely to socially responsible investing.Mr. Streur landed at the helm of a small responsible investment firm called Portfolio 21 in Portland, Ore. He bought and moved to a 2,000-acre sustainably-run cattle ranch along the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountain Range and plunged back into competitive rowing \u2014 winning gold in the 2013 FISA World Masters Rowing Championships in Varese, Italy.In 2014, Calvert came courting.Mr. Streur decided if he were to take the job at Calvert, responsible investing couldn\u2019t just be about avoiding controversial companies; investors had to try and force them to behave better. \u201cI don\u2019t want to avoid problems and leave them for someone else to clean up. I want to be part of the solution,\u201d Mr. Streur said. He helped Calvert create new principles that focused on research, impact and engaging with companies in order to create change from within, as well as producing competitive profits that would earn the respect of Wall Street. \u201cWe needed them to see that these issues would mean something to their stock price,\u201d Mr. Streur said. \u201cThat this matters from a business sense, not a social justice sense.\u201dUntil recently, corporate America was still questioning whether responsible investing could work: Did it hurt profits? Did anyone really care?\u201cThose questions were valid six years ago,\u201d Mr. Streur said. \u201cBut no one asks them anymore.\u201d He has watched responsible investing move from the margins to the mainstream.Mr. Streur says he is determined to maintain pressure on assault weapon manufacturers, wanting to provoke a sea change on guns before eventually returning to his ranch. \u201cI believe we are going to reduce the distribution of assault weapons and I believe we are going to make it more difficult for those companies to get capital,\u201d Mr. Streur said. The fight, he added, \u201cis by no means over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moscow Theater Rebels, Husband and Wife, Are Dead", "Date": "2018-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 In the early 2000s, Mikhail Ugarov and Elena Gremina, playwrights who were husband and wife, were lamenting that Russian theater had grown ossified and distant from society\u2019s problems a decade after the fall of the Soviet empire.Then, sparked by an encounter with the Royal Court Theater of London, they set about trying to change that.As part of a cultural exchange with the Londoners, they learned about documentary theater \u2014 the use of interviews, oral history and journalistic sources to create works for the stage. Ms. Gremina and Mr. Ugarov embraced the technique, brought it to Moscow and in 2002 established Teatr.doc, a theater company that presented shockingly raw accounts of life in post-Soviet Russia.\u201cIf you go to a regular theater, you won\u2019t even guess that there are rich and poor in the country, that people are in some kind of crisis, that the birthrate is falling, that we are at war,\u201d Ms. Gremina told Radio Liberty in 2005.The theater became an outsize force on the Russian dramatic scene, and Mr. Ugarov and Ms. Gremina, who were known for their warmth, became the center of a new wave of playwrights and actors committed to protest theater.The works they wrote, nurtured, directed and presented increasingly became powerful critiques of Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government, attracting official harassment, suppression and repeated closings.Young playwrights cultivated by the couple created \u201ctales of homeless people, criminals, unwed mothers in prison, factory workers and the like,\u201d he wrote, conveyed in authentic, often verbatim language that jarred conservative theatergoers.Mr. Ugarov and Ms. Gremina, who had lived and worked together since the tail end of the Soviet era, died within weeks of each other in Moscow this spring.Mr. Ugarov died of heart disease on April 1 at 62, and Ms. Gremina died of kidney failure on May 16 at 61. Mr. Ugarov\u2019s son Ivan confirmed the deaths.Mr. Ugarov served as the artistic director of Teatr.doc and Ms. Gremina as managing director. The theater, which had no more than 100 seats, was housed in a basement on a lane in central Moscow, where audiences crammed in to experience raw performances and often engaged in discussion sessions afterward.Some of the plays traveled abroad, building an international audience. Productions were mounted at festivals in Poland, France and Germany.The city evicted the theater shortly after, despite a campaign supported by international figures, including the playwright Tom Stoppard. Ms. Gremina and Mr. Ugarov soldiered on; they reopened in a small run-down wing of an old mansion in another neighborhood several months later, only to be evicted again in 2015.As part of the harassment campaign, prosecutors called Ms. Gremina in for questioning, and undercover investigators from the F.S.B., the successor agency to the K.G.B., were audience regulars.\u201cOur authorities are creating a situation in which we are compelled to engage in protest art, thereby giving new life to the theater, endowing it with new meaning,\u201d Mr. Ugarov told Business Online, a news site in Kazan, in southwest Russia.Ms. Gremina scoffed at the harassment. \u201cI really don\u2019t give a damn,\u201d she said in a Facebook post in 2015.Mr. Ugarov and Ms. Gremina died as Teatr.doc was about to be evicted once again.Teatr.doc made speaking out its mission. It \u201cstarted filling in the information gaps in society, talking about those things that no one else was talking about,\u201d said Mikhail Durnenkov, a playwright who is closely associated with the theater.Mr. Browder, who was once the largest foreign investor in the Russian stock market, ran afoul of Mr. Putin in 2005 and was kicked out of Russia. He was convicted of tax fraud by a Russian court in absentia and sentenced to nine years in prison.Teatr.doc has continually lacked for adequate funding.\u201cGremina said poverty is also censorship,\u201d Zarema Zaudinova, a former student of Mr. Ugarov\u2019s who is now running the theater, said. \u201cWe want to have workshops, to bring authors from the regions, to send ours out on residencies in order to develop. But this is impossible because all of us have to have other jobs in order to earn money to live on.\u201dMs. Gremina\u2019s sideline was writing scripts for mass-market television series, including \u201cAdjutants of Love,\u201d a historical drama about czarist Russia. Her income helped finance the theater.The City of Moscow did offer financial help, but the theater refused to accept state money.Mikhail Yurievich Ugarov was born on Jan. 23, 1956, in Arkhangelsk, in northern Russia, where his father, Yuri, was a well-known teacher of theater studies. In the 1970s, Mr. Ugarov worked as an actor and playwright in the western city of Kirov. He moved to Moscow after meeting Ms. Gremina.She asserted her independence and created her own last name, Gremina, by combining her father\u2019s last name with that of her mother, Galina Mindadze, a literary translator. Ms. Gremina\u2019s brother, Alexander Mindadze, became a successful screenwriter and survives her.Besides Ivan, Mr. Ugarov\u2019s son from a previous marriage, the couple are also survived by a son, Alexander Rodionov, from a previous marriage of Ms. Gremina\u2019s, and three grandchildren. Mr. Ugarov is also survived by a brother, Aleksei.As time went on, the couple despaired of events in Russia. In a Facebook post in September 2017, Mr. Ugarov expressed frustration at the production of \u201cnice and pretty plays\u201d despite the grim reality that theater directors \u201care in prison for nothing, that the country is at war, that torture has become the norm, and Orthodox extremism is at hand.\u201dWith the couple\u2019s death, Teatr.doc\u2019s supporters are grappling with the future, said Mr. Durnenkov, the playwright. The theater, he said, \u201cis a space of freedom that we can\u2019t lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then, after financial disappointments and decades of shifting ownership, Samsonite took its shares public in the Chinese city of Hong Kong, seeking to capitalize on Asia\u2019s growing legions of well-heeled travelers.Its troubles are not over. The company\u2019s top executive stepped down this week after being accused by a short seller of falsely claiming to have a doctoral degree.Blue Orca also wrote that Mr. Tainwala was referred to as \u201cDr. Ramesh Tainwala\u201d in a few American and Indian regulatory documents. But when Blue Orca contacted the institution from which Mr. Tainwala, according to some biographical sources, received a doctorate, the institution said that he had not obtained a degree.The moves capped a troubled week for a storied name. The company started out in Denver in 1910 as a maker of wooden trunks for Americans traveling out West. The Samsonite brand \u2014 which honors Samson, the biblical strongman \u2014 was first used in 1941. It stuck, and the company\u2019s name was changed to Samsonite in 1965.By then, travel was becoming an affordable mass pursuit, and Samsonite\u2019s products evolved with the times. It introduced sleeker suitcases, then ones made from modern materials, then ones with wheels.But in 1973, after the death of its founder, the company was bought by a conglomerate, Beatrice Foods. Crushed by debt, Beatrice was later sold off in a huge leveraged buyout.Blue Orca, which does not hide the fact that it stands to profit if Samsonite\u2019s stock price falls, says in its report that investors trade Samsonite shares at a high premium relative to its earnings, as if it were a luxury name comparable to Burberry. This is \u201cridiculous,\u201d the firm\u2019s report argues.\u201cTumi is Samsonite\u2019s high-end brand.

Murphy of New Jersey and Democratic legislative leaders brokered an agreement on the budget to keep the government open and avoid a state shutdown for the second time in two years.The deal arrives just in time for the coming Fourth of July holiday and saves Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, from closing the government during his first year in office, a move that would prove unpopular to many, including bathers looking to cool off on a sweltering weekend at state parks and beaches.\u201cLet me be clear: There will be no shutdown,\u201d Mr. Murphy said at a news conference in Trenton on Saturday night. \u201cThe parks and beaches are open.\u201dThe nearly four-month budget showdown centered largely on an impasse regarding a tax increase for the wealthiest in New Jersey. But with the two sides staking out seemingly intractable positions for months, Mr. Murphy; Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president; and Craig Coughlin, the Assembly speaker, all made concessions to reach a deal.The budget agreement will raise the income tax to 10.75 percent from 8.97 percent on those making more than $5 million a year.The deal also includes an annual surcharge of 2 percent on companies that earn over $1 million annually that will be in place for four years. Mr. Murphy\u2019s proposal to raise the sales tax to 7 percent from 6.625 percent was left out of the final deal.The $37.4 billion budget includes financing for nearly all of Mr. Murphy\u2019s proposed investments, including a $242 million increase in funding for New Jersey Transit, an additional $83 million for prekindergarten, an extra $25 million for community colleges and a $3.2 billion payment into the state\u2019s struggling pension system.But many of the revenue sources Mr. Murphy sought in his budget proposal in March \u2014 roughly $1.5 billion in new taxes \u2014 differed in the final deal, including the decision to leave the sales tax at its current rate.The agreement on the so-called millionaire\u2019s tax was very similar to an earlier proposal from the Legislature \u2014 to raise the income tax on those making $5 million or more to 9.95 percent \u2014 that just a day before Mr. Murphy had dismissed as merely \u201csymbolic.\u201d The governor had been seeking to tax those making more than $1 million, offering only a slight adjustment early Saturday morning.Still, legislative leaders had initially been resistant to the idea of any income tax increase in a state where residents already face some of the most onerous tax burdens in the country.After the deal was announced, Mr. Murphy said the final tax was now a \u201cmultimillionaire\u2019s tax.\u201dBut the prospect of a second shutdown in two years, which would have been an unwelcome stain on Mr. Murphy\u2019s first year in office, proved motivation enough for both sides to broker a last-minute deal, despite weeks of bitter negotiations characterized by personal attacks.\u201cIt was a hell of a journey, Governor,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said during the news conference. \u201cThis is my ninth budget; it was probably just as hard as the other ones. But you know something, changing course, changing course in New Jersey is never easy.\u201dMr. Murphy and legislative leaders were adamant that their differences were not as severe as it appeared during the monthslong standoff.\u201cWe had honest, blunt, sometimes heated yet always civil discussions,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, adding, \u201cThere was never a disagreement about our values and our principles. Just as how best to get there.\u201dThe Senate and the Assembly were scheduled to vote on the budget on Sunday morning and Mr. Murphy pledged to sign it \u201cas soon as humanly possible.\u201dThe mere threat of a shutdown infuriated many residents of the state, who were decamping to state parks and beaches for extended holiday vacations. When the state shut down in 2017, Island Beach State Park and the rest of the state park system closed, forcing campers to pack up early and leaving a 10-mile stretch of beach vacant, except for the now infamous gathering of former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and his family.At Bass River State Park, Jose Pitre and his wife, Maria Arce, have had their family reunion at the same campsite every year over the Fourth of July, with relatives driving as far as eight hours from Buffalo to get together.But last year they were asked to leave their campsite when the state government shut down. Believing it would not happen again, they made reservations in January 2018 for their same family reunion camping trip. When they found out that they could get evicted again, the family decided their patience was exhausted.\u201cIf that happens, that\u2019s it for us, this would be the last year,\u201d said Mr. Pitre, 51, who works in chemical production and lives in Penns Grove, N.J. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably look for someplace in Pennsylvania where this doesn\u2019t happen all the time.\u201dBut Mr. Murphy, who had campaigned extensively on raising taxes on the well-off, included the millionaire\u2019s tax in his inaugural budget, leading to a stalemate.By Saturday, neither blinked until the final hours.The last time the state shut down under a Democratic governor was 12 years ago, when former Gov. Jon S. Corzine battled the Legislature over raising the sales tax during his first year in office. That shutdown, the first in state history, lasted eight days.Despite a resolution, some residents remained frustrated by the behavior of the state\u2019s leaders. Jason Long, a facilities manager from Audubon, Penn., was relaxing on Island Beach State Park with his father-in-law on Saturday morning, angry that for the second year in a row, their weekend was still in doubt.\u201cWhy don\u2019t they work this out in the winter months?\u201d asked Mr. Long.Nate Schweber contributed reporting from Island Beach State Park, N.J.Advertisement"}
