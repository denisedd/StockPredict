{"Headline": "Congress May Have Fallen for Facebook\u2019s Trap, but You Don\u2019t Have To", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has always sold data to advertisers, and it probably always will. Mr. Kosinski is an assistant professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.As a data scientist, I am shocked that anyone continues to believe this claim. Each time you click on a Facebook ad, Facebook sells data on you to that advertiser. This is such a basic property of online targeted advertising that it would be impossible to avoid, even if Facebook somehow wanted to.Or even better, let Mr. Zuckerberg explain, as he did to the Senate in April: \u201cWhat we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach, and then we do the placement. So, if an advertiser comes to us and says, \u2018All right, I am a ski shop and I want to sell skis to women\u2019 \u2026 we can show the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.\u201d Let\u2019s take a closer look at Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ski shop example. The ski shop pays Facebook to show a targeted ad to women and sends the women to the ski shop\u2019s website if the women click on the ad. Mr. Zuckerberg describes this process as showing \u201cthe ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.\u201d But this isn\u2019t true: If a ski shop pays Facebook to show an ad only to women, then Facebook automatically reveals to the ski shop that all people who clicked on the link must be women. And in practice, the advertisers make requests that are much more nuanced. They may ask Facebook to show their ad to \u201cliberal Latina women without college education who live in San Antonio and recently got married.\u201d And then they might place a separate ad that is shown only to \u201cconservative African-American women with college educations who live in Austin and are single.\u201d When you click on an ad and are sent to an advertiser\u2019s website, the advertiser knows which ad you saw and thus which bucket you fall in.Facebook has a lot of data on their users and is eager to monetize it. The advertisers are encouraged to selectively target people according to a mind-boggling range of personal characteristics. Some, such as age, gender or location, are not overly intimate. Others, such as your political views, family size, education, occupation, marital status or interest in a gay dating app, are highly personal. But Facebook is extremely clever at dodging this issue. When the company argues that it is not selling data, but rather selling targeted advertising, it\u2019s luring you into a semantic trap, encouraging you to imagine that the only way of selling data is to send advertisers a file filled with user information. Congress may have fallen for this trap set up by Mr. Zuckerberg, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. The fact that your data is not disclosed in an Excel spreadsheet but through a click on a targeted ad is irrelevant. Data still changes hands and goes to the advertiser. Facebook's claiming that it is not selling user data is like a bar\u2019s giving away a free martini with every $12 bag of peanuts and then claiming that it\u2019s not selling drinks. Rich user data is Facebook\u2019s most prized possession, and the company sure isn\u2019t throwing it in for free.Importantly, this problem is not limited to Facebook. Other Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon, have similar ad platforms. If a platform can be used to target specific users, then it reveals those users\u2019 data. The advertiser could easily create its own data file based on this information, or merge the information with any other data it has on a customer.To address this problem, we need to offer users both transparency and control. Before being directed to an advertiser\u2019s site, users should be told which of their traits were used in targeting them. They should also be warned that, if they continue, these traits will be revealed to the advertiser.Facebook cannot be trusted to fix this problem itself. Would you trust Big Tobacco\u2019s claims about lung cancer? What about Big Sugar\u2019s claims about obesity? Then why would you believe what Big Tech has to say about data privacy? Markets, including the market for consumer data, do not work efficiently when a company like Facebook is allowed to abuse its market position to ignore its users\u2019 rights, needs and wishes. Policymakers have no choice but to step in, restore the balance of power and protect citizens\u2019 privacy.Michal Kosinski is an assistant professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.

Versions of the Notables list date back to the early 1900s.The Notables \u2014 and then the Best, published a week later \u2014 are \u201cthe cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me,\u201d as Pamela Paul, editor of the Book Review, who oversees all books coverage at The Times, put it: \u201cBooks that have a combination of storytelling power and strong narrative and voice and quality of the prose and extent of the reporting \u2014 the package as a whole.\u201d The critics look for similar qualities in their lists, but in a way that reflects their own tastes rather than that of a consensus. \u201cThe Book Review is editor-driven\u201d \u2014 editors assign the reviews to outside reviewers \u2014 \u201cand the critics\u2019 lists are critic-driven,\u201d Ms. Paul said.On paper ballots, editors vote from a long list of contenders, looking to offer readers both range and quality in \u201ca broad cross section of everything that\u2019s out there,\u201d Ms. Paul said. And emotions can end up running high. \u201cEditors here feel passionately about certain books,\u201d Ms. Paul said. For ballot votes, people have a few days to vote in the first round, but follow-up rounds are within 24 hours. By the end of the votes, ideally, every editor leaves the room feeling a mix of happiness and pride that some of their favorites made it \u2014 \u201cand then very unhappy and bitter about something that was eliminated in one of the final rounds.\u201dThe three staff critics \u2014 Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai \u2014 on the other hand, get to have a little bit more fun. They, unlike the Book Review, are not trying to represent the entire publishing industry, but rather to offer a glimpse into their tastes, something their readers like to follow and predict.It\u2019s much more personal than institutional: \u201cThey\u2019re not looking to tell you the 10 most necessary books published this year,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt really is about their favorite books.\u201d The critics have complete autonomy in making their picks (as they do in choosing which books they review in a year), and their 10 best come from the 50 or so books each critic has already reviewed that year.\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot harder for books to break out this year than in other years,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of attention is being absorbed by news, by other things that are happening.\u201d It\u2019s why critics and editors look forward to the opportunity \u201cto give the books you love, sometimes books you think have been undervalued elsewhere, a bump,\u201d as Mr. Garner put it. If, for some reason, you do not have time to read all of the more than 120 books, they are broken down by category to help you choose. But if you do read them all, you will have attended \u201ca sort of crash grad school,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. as Talent Scout: Unorthodox Hires, and Maybe Lower Pay", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that piqued his interest.It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 featured the term \u201cdata science\u201d nowhere.Instead, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold\u2019s software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model.The idea is not to focus on job titles, but \u201cwhat skills they have,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou\u2019re really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it.\u201dThe power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market \u2014 not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract.Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers \u2014 even for hard-to-fill roles \u2014 whom they might not otherwise have come across.And while that could also help some candidates, there\u2019s a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring.\u201cYou get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,\u201d Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have to compete for them as much.\u201dFor years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions.While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates.But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don\u2019t explicitly appear on a candidate\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9.To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn\u2019t list the skill on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.By performing a similar exercise across an entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the company\u2019s software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales).Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn.Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance \u2014 say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft.Intuit did not respond to a request for comment.The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner.\u201cThe tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,\u201d Ms. Villanueva said. \u201cWe keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit.\u201dIn the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold\u2019s software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master\u2019s degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in data science.\u201cWe have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou can predict what they\u2019re likely to do next very easily.\u201d He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data.Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster.Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence.\u201cWe surface people we think would be good draft picks,\u201d rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. \u201cThis person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you.\u201dMr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates.In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly.Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master\u2019s degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages.\u201cThat could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don\u2019t need anything special here,\u201d Mr. Horton said.Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point \u2014 call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren\u2019t compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism.If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height.The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players \u2014 the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs \u2014 not the general population.Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee.But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting.Google says it uses machines to take a second look at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles.The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can\u2019t claim. \u201cWe now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,\u201d he said.Cade Metz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mapping the Brain\u2019s Genetic Landscape", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past two decades, scientists have been exploring the genetics of schizophrenia, autism and other brain disorders, looking for a path toward causation. If the biological roots of such ailments could be identified, treatments might follow, or at least tests that could reveal a person\u2019s risk level. Now, using more advanced tools, brain scientists have begun to fill out the picture. In a series of 11 papers, published in Science and related journals, a consortium of researchers has produced the most richly detailed model of the brain\u2019s genetic landscape to date, one that incorporates not only genes but also gene regulators, cellular data and developmental information across the human life span.The work is a testament to how far brain biology has come, and how much further it has to go, toward producing anything of practical value to doctors or patients, experts said.\u201cThe effort that has gone into the collection and analysis of these data is truly impressive,\u201d said Kevin Mitchell, an associate professor of genetics and neurology at Trinity College, Dublin, who was not involved in the project. The data, he added, \u201crepresent a hugely valuable resource.\u201d Whether that resource will help scientists determine any biological cause, Dr. Mitchell cautioned, remains an open question. The new model was based in part on analyses of nearly 2,000 human brains, from people with and without diagnoses, collected over decades. In one of the papers, a research team led by Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University School of Medicine, began by combining all those genes, as a group, and calculating the combined added risk they impart into a single coefficient. That calculation on its own barely beats a random guess in assessing added risk.In another report, investigators delivered a clearer picture of brain development over the human lifetime. The brain is continually adapting, or \u201crewiring,\u201d itself through life, particularly in utero and through adolescence, generating an ever-transforming genetic, cellular and genetic landscape that had defied the tools of modern science.\u201cHaving this insight will help us establish some potential causes and what they mean for neuropsychiatric disorders, and create new, testable hypotheses,\u201d Dr. Sestan said.The result from all this work is a computer model for brain genomics that scientists can search \u2014 a database akin to Google Earth that charts specific genetic addresses in the brain and reveals which genetic and biological processes are active there, and at what point during maturation.Dr. Matthew State, chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author on two of the papers, said: \u201cEssentially what these papers do is lay out cellular and molecular landscape at a resolution that\u2019s never existed before. I see it as foundational work, and an investment that will pay off in giving us a far richer context to develop new hypotheses and study these disorders.\u201dFor the time being, those hypotheses are unformed. And, for all the coordination and dazzling science on display, there is a long way to go before any practical payoff arrives, some experts said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people whose cells were analyzed in a study. It was dozens of people of all ages, not exactly 1,866 people. Additionally it misstated the source of single cells examined for patters of gene expression. The people the cells came from did not have a particular disorder.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Markets Tumble, Tech Stocks Hit a Rare and Ominous Milestone", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Facebook, Apple or Google looked shaky this year \u2014 as investors worried about growth, regulation or mismanagement \u2014 the rest of the market felt it. In recent weeks, as these companies have succumbed to concerns about the global economy, slowing profits or privacy concerns, they have led the decline in stocks.Now, technology companies are dragging stocks into an ominous territory that investors have not seen in nearly a decade: a severe decline known as a bear market.The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed on Friday at 6332.99, down almost 22 percent from its August peak, meaning it has officially entered a bear market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both of which also include the biggest tech companies, are not far behind after falling 17.5 percent and 16.3 percent from their respective highs. After a month of heavy losses, stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008.Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy. In the last 20 years, there have been only two \u2014 one that began with the financial crisis in 2007, and the other that started with the dot-com bust in 2000. Market downturns can gather steam even without strong evidence that economic and corporate fundamentals are weakening.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a feedback loop,\u201d said Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now, we\u2019ve seen some declines, and that emboldens some pundit to say, \u2018This is it.\u2019 They get attention, it puts thoughts in people\u2019s minds and they start thinking, \u2018Maybe I should exit.\u2019\u201dThe Nasdaq is not the only group of stocks in such distress. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks shares of smaller companies, entered a bear market earlier this week. Seven of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 industrial sectors are also at the level, led by energy stocks, which are down 28 percent from their highs earlier this year. That\u2019s in large part because oil has been in a bear market since November.If the broader stock market declines by more than 20 percent this year, it would end what was, by some measures, the longest bull run in history. From March 2009 until its peak in September, the S&P 500 surged 333 percent, a rally that provided a silver lining to the lackluster years that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Investors enjoyed trillions of dollars of gains from the stock market.Those profits are not close to being wiped out. The stock market is still well above where it was even at the start of 2017. But the longer bear markets last, the more pessimism they spread.The mood in the markets can change. The most recent bear markets have not lasted as long as some others in the past. During the two previous bear markets, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to stimulate the economy by slashing interest rates. Investors came to believe that corporate profits would recover and dived back into stocks.The current stock plunge is taking place at a time when the central bank is signaling that it will keep raising interest rates because the economy remains strong, with unemployment near 50-year lows. But on Friday, an influential Fed policymaker said the central bank would keep a close eye on financial markets as it set interest rates.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go into the new year with eyes wide open, willing to read the data, listen to what people are saying, and to reassess the economic outlook,\u201d John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with CNBC.The sudden downturn in technology stocks has many of the attributes of the sell-offs that periodically smash hot sectors in the stock market. But it also signifies how investors have taken a dimmer view of corporate America and the broader economy.They are far below those levels now. Apple is now worth around $715 billion. Amazon has lost nearly a third of its value since hitting its high, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is down 23 percent.Trade tensions and a possible slowdown in the global economy are prompting investors to wonder whether technology companies will grow as fast as expected. Expectations that iPhone sales in China could slow eroded Apple\u2019s value, while Facebook\u2019s slip-ups over data privacy and misinformation have drawn scrutiny from angry governments and made investors nervous.\u201cYou can\u2019t grow at huge percentages forever,\u201d Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said of the tech sell-off. \u201cPlus, I think that whether it\u2019s regulation, whether it\u2019s fear of the global slowdown, those kinds of things have played into it.\u201dAnd there is also the simple fact that they had risen so far so fast. When fear descends on the market, investors often sell the shares that have gone up the most, and at its August high, the Nasdaq was up more than 50 percent from the date on which President Trump was elected.\u201cToo many people had piled on the same side of the boat,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York. \u201cTypically when that happens, the boat tips over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women\u2019s March Roiled by Accusations of Anti-Semitism", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithin days of Donald J. Trump\u2019s election, a diverse group of women united by their concern about the incoming administration gathered at a restaurant in New York to plan a protest march in Washington. They had seen the idea floating on Facebook and wanted to turn it into a reality.The unity did not last long. Vanessa Wruble, a Brooklyn-based activist, said she told the group that her Jewish heritage inspired her to try to help repair the world. But she said the conversation took a turn when Tamika Mallory, a black gun control activist, and Carmen Perez, a Latina criminal justice reform activist, replied that Jews needed to confront their own role in racism.The women who gathered that night would go on to organize one of the biggest protests in American history, remarkable not just for its size, but for its inclusive nature. The event on Jan. 21, 2017, inspired thousands of women who had never been involved in politics before to pour their energy into helping Democrats win elections this fall.Ms. Mallory, meanwhile, who is now co-president of the Women\u2019s March group, has been criticized for attending an event by Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam who has been widely reviled for making anti-Semitic remarks. Ms. Mallory has called Mr. Farrakhan \u201cthe GOAT,\u201d or \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d on social media.Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, chief operating officer of the Women\u2019s March group, cast the controversy as the growing pains of a new organization that is struggling to build a diverse coalition. She said steps were being taken to ensure that Jewish women felt welcome, including giving Women\u2019s March leaders education about anti-Semitism and adding Jewish women to the organization\u2019s \u201cunity principles,\u201d which highlight groups that are considered especially vulnerable.Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez say they categorically condemn anti-Semitism, and that when they asked Ms. Wruble to leave the group, it had nothing to do with her being Jewish. But they acknowledged that the role of Jewish women was discussed in that first meeting.\u201cSince that conversation, we\u2019ve all learned a lot about how while white Jews, as white people, uphold white supremacy, ALL Jews are targeted by it,\u201d Ms. Mallory said in a statement to The New York Times.The allegations of anti-Semitism are particularly painful because Women\u2019s March organizers made a commitment from the beginning to work across racial and religious lines, and to be led by what they considered the most \u201cmarginalized\u201d women.Now Women\u2019s March activists are grappling with how they treat Jews \u2014 and whether they should be counted as privileged white Americans or \u201cmarginalized\u201d minorities, especially in the aftermath of the October mass shooting in Pittsburgh, when 11 people were gunned down at their synagogue.Ms. Wruble, a central organizer of the march, says she agrees that white women, including Jews, should grapple with their racial privilege. She put out a call for women of color to join the planning team and was connected with Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez. At that first meeting, Ms. Wruble said, they seemed to want to educate her about a dark side of Jewish history, and told her that Jewish people played a large role in the slave trade and the prison industry.\u201cI was taken aback,\u201d said Ms. Wruble in her first extensive interview about her experience organizing the Women\u2019s March. \u201cI thought, \u2018Maybe there are things I don\u2019t know about my own people.\u2019\u201dShe said she went home that night and searched Google to read about the Jewish role in the slave trade. Up popped a review of \u201cThe Secret Relationship Between Blacks and the Jews,\u201d a 1991 book by Mr. Farrakhan, which asserts that Jews were especially culpable. Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard professor, has called the book the \u201cbible of the new anti-Semitism.\u201dMs. Wruble said she did not dwell on the issue because she wanted to work together on the march, which was only two months away. Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez brought a friend on board, Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian-American activist. The three women \u2014 and another woman named Bob Bland, a white fashion designer who created one of the first Facebook pages about the march \u2014 became the event\u2019s official leaders. They were widely featured in the press as the public face of the movement.Behind the scenes, Ms. Wruble said she felt cast aside.At one point, Ms. Wruble said she asked about security for the march and was told by the leaders that the Nation of Islam would be providing it.\u201cI said, \u2018You are going to open up the march to intense criticism,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wruble said, warning that it would be a red flag for Jews. She said they dismissed her concerns in a heated email exchange and accused her of unfairly maligning the Nation of Islam.As the march grew closer, Ms. Perez gathered a diverse group of activists who created a set of \u201cunity principles\u201d that would tie all marchers together and highlight those viewed as the most vulnerable at the time.\u201cWe must create a society in which all women \u2014 including Black women, Indigenous women, poor women, immigrant women, disabled women, Muslim women, lesbian, queer and trans women \u2014 are free,\u201d it read.Ms. Wruble noticed that Jewish women were not included, but said she was too busy with logistics for the march to focus on it.In an interview, Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez said that they work in communities where Mr. Farrakhan is respected for his role in rehabilitating incarcerated men. They attended the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March in 2015, which Mr. Farrakhan planned.But they said they did not subscribe to his views about Jewish people and never mentioned the slave trade in that first meeting with Ms. Wruble.\u201cIt never happened,\u201d Ms. Perez said.They also denied telling Ms. Wruble that she could not be an official leader of the march because she is Jewish.In fact, they said, they urged her to be more assertive if she wanted public recognition. \u201cA closed mouth does not get fed,\u201d Ms. Mallory told Ms. Wruble in an email viewed by The Times.Ms. Mallory said the Nation of Islam was not hired for security. An internal document obtained by The Times said that the Women\u2019s March group does not ask the religious affiliation of contractors, but said that because private security firms employ a large number of Nation of Islam members, \u201cit is likely\u201d that some members of the sect have provided security for Women\u2019s March events.Even though the march was a success, Ms. Wruble said that she felt angry and that the event\u2019s official leaders were more focused on celebrity than building the movement. She also felt they were unwilling to confront their own bias against Jews. At a meeting days after the march, an argument broke out between Ms. Wruble and the other leaders.Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez began berating Ms. Wruble, according to Evvie Harmon, a white woman who helped organize the march, and who attended the meeting at Ms. Mallory\u2019s apartment complex.Ms. Mallory denied that she disparaged Ms. Wruble\u2019s Jewish heritage in that meeting, but acknowledged telling white women there that she did not trust them.\u201cThey are not trustworthy,\u201d she said, adding that Ms. Wruble gossiped behind the backs of the other march leaders instead of confronting them when she had an issue. \u201cEvery single one of us has heard things that offended us. We still do the work.\u201dShortly after that meeting, Ms. Mallory, Ms. Perez and Ms. Sarsour decided they did not want to work with Ms. Wruble anymore.On her way out, Ms. Wruble texted a senior adviser to the organization with a warning: \u201cThe one thing I would suggest you discuss with them is the anti-Semitic piece of this,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTheir rhetoric around this stuff will hurt the movement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tech That Was Fixed in 2018 and the Tech That Still Needs Fixing", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixFrom Facebook to creepy online ads, the worst tech of the year made the internet feel like an unsafe place to hang out. Yet there were some products that were fixed, our personal tech critic writes.Personal technology was so awful this year that nobody would think you were paranoid if you dug a hole and buried your computer, phone and smart speaker under six feet of earth.Facebook made headlines week after week for failing to protect our privacy and for spreading misinformation. Juul, the e-cigarette company under investigation for marketing products to teenagers, emerged as the Joe Camel of the digital era. And don\u2019t get me started on just how intrusive online advertising has become.On the other hand, there was good technology this year that improved how we live, like parental controls to curb smartphone addiction and a web browser with built-in privacy protections.For the last two years, I\u2019ve reviewed the tech that needed the most fixing and the tech that was fixed for the first time. This year, I\u2019m repeating the tradition in hopes that the list of lows gets shorter and the list of highs gets longer over time. The bottom line: Social media companies demonstrated they could barely be trusted with our data and were still trying to get a handle on all of their issues. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for problems like hate speech and misinformation. And keeping our information private is not really in the interest of many of these companies, which use our data to target us with digital advertising. Speaking of which: Online ads became so intrusive in 2018 that they increasingly ruined people\u2019s web-browsing experiences and raised more hackles about privacy.The online ads industry became so good at tracking our web browsing activities that it increasingly knew precisely what we were thinking about buying. If you did a web search for a blender, for example, you could be certain that a digital ad for that blender would follow you around. In addition, the autoplay videos embedded on many news sites were ruthless about shouting for our attention while draining our batteries and burning through data plans.These fixes are not ideal because they take a long time to put in place, and blocking ads hurts media businesses. That means there\u2019s work to do on this yet.The Food and Drug Administration this year announced restrictions that allowed stores to sell most flavored e-cigarettes only in areas where minors were not permitted. The agency also said it was investigating whether Juul, which accounts for more than 70 percent of e-cigarette sales, intentionally marketed its products to youths. Juul has since suspended its social media promotions. E-cigarettes notwithstanding, at least parents can worry less about their children\u2019s addiction to smartphones. This year, Apple released Screen Time, a feature for people to set restrictions on the amount of time they spend on their iPhones. The software includes the ability for parents to remotely monitor and limit their children\u2019s iPhone use.Firefox could still be better. Chrome, for instance, is still faster at loading some web pages. But after a harsh year when consumers lost faith in how companies like Facebook managed their data, it feels heartening to know that someone in the tech industry is making a browser for the people.So did we get to a shorter list of personal tech lows and a longer list of highs? Not quite. I guess there\u2019s always next year. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End the Innovation Obsession", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of our best ideas are in the rearview mirror. Mr. Sax is an author. TORONTO \u2014 A year ago I stepped into the Samcheong Park Library in Seoul, South Korea, and saw the future. The simple building in a forested park had a nice selection of books, a cafe at its center and a small patio. Classical music played while patrons read, reclining on extra-deep window benches that had cushions to sit on and tables that slid over their laps so that they could sip coffee and eat cheesecake while gazing at the leaves changing colors outside. Seoul is one of the most modern cities in the world, a place suffused with the latest inescapable technology. This library was specifically designed as an antidote to that.\u201cWhat\u2019s so innovative about that?\u201d a friend who works for the library here in Toronto asked when I showed her pictures. Innovation to her meant digital technology, from drones and movie-streaming services and 3D printers, which the library was constantly showing off.\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t they both be innovative?\u201d I asked.We are told that innovation is the most important force in our economy, the one thing we must get right or be left behind. But that fear of missing out has led us to foolishly embrace the false trappings of innovation over truly innovative ideas that may be simpler and ultimately more effective. This mind-set equates innovation exclusively with invention and implies that if you just buy the new thing, voil\u00e0! You have innovated! Each year businesses, institutions and individuals run around like broken toy robots, trying to figure out their strategy for the latest buzzword promising salvation.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]True innovation isn\u2019t just some magic carnival of invention, like a Steve Jobs keynote with a pretty toy at the end. It is a continuing process of gradual improvement and assessment that every institution and business experiences in some way. Often that actually means adopting ideas and tools that already exist but make sense in a new context, or even returning to methods that worked in the past. Adapted to the challenges of today, these rearview innovations have proved to be as transformative as novel technologies.Look no farther than the streets of New York, which have been radically redesigned over the past decade to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians with bike lanes and car-free zones. These ideas aren\u2019t new. They were espoused by city planners and activists more than half a century ago, when Robert Moses was crisscrossing the city with expressways, bulldozing neighborhoods in the name of the car\u2019s transformational technology. At the time Jane Jacobs and other advocates of slower, friendlier streets were dismissed as Luddites. It took more than 50 years of evidence, accidents and political courage to realize what a colossal mistake the Moses approach was and to begin to undo that with proven ideas in people-centric urban planning that aim to bring cities back to those who live in them.Perhaps the best examples of rearward innovation are edible. The culinary story of the past several decades is dominated not by the scientific improvements we were promised, but by a return to food and drink\u2019s more delicious past. Traditional cooking, craft beer, heirloom vegetables and grass-fed beef have brought food forward by turning back. We take this as gospel today, but during the 1980s, when pioneering artisan bakers like Nancy Silverton and Jim Lahey were trying to get the world to abandon Wonder bread for traditional sourdough, their ideas were radical and innovative, and ultimately changed the way many of us cook, shop and eat.These innovations aren\u2019t mired in the past. They are solutions firmly focused on the future \u2014 not some technocentric version of it, where we invent our way to utopia, but a human-centric future that reflects where we\u2019ve been, what we\u2019ve learned and how we actually want to live. If that means we build more libraries in parks, then we are moving in the right direction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Fall for Facebook\u2019s \u2018China Argument\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerica\u2019s global dominance in technology requires fierce competition at home, not the coddling of monopolies.Mr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust.Over the last year or so, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and other American tech leaders have issued a stark warning to those who want to see more competition in the industry. It goes something like this: \u201cWe understand that we\u2019ve made mistakes. But don\u2019t you realize that if you damage us, you\u2019ll just be handing over the future to China? Unlike America, China is standing behind its tech firms, because it knows that the competition is global, and it wants to win.\u201dBut to accept this argument would be a mistake, for it betrays and ignores hard-won lessons about the folly of an industrial policy centered on \u201cnational champions,\u201d especially in the tech sector. What Facebook is really asking for is to be embraced and protected as America\u2019s very own social media monopolist, bravely doing battle overseas. But both history and basic economics suggest we do much better trusting that fierce competition at home yields stronger industries overall.That\u2019s the lesson from the history of Japanese-American tech competition. During the 1970s and into the \u201980s, it was widely believed that Japan was threatening the United States for supremacy in technology markets. The Japanese giant NEC was a serious challenger to IBM in the mainframe market; Sony was running over consumer electronics, joined by powerful firms like Panasonic and Toshiba. These companies enjoyed the support of the Japanese state, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which pursued a nationalistic industrial policy thought to be infallible.That\u2019s the risk of a governmental embrace of companies like Facebook, Apple and Google. While they may now seem as extraordinary as IBM did in the 1970s, they might not seem that way a decade from now. And if no one can imagine doing social networking better than Facebook, remember that no one dreamed that the personal computer, once little more than a toy for hobbyists, would displace the mighty mainframe.If we give these companies a pass when it comes to antitrust enforcement, allowing them to dominate their markets and buy up their competitors, America may lose what has been its signature advantage: its willingness to allow the new to replace the old, to accept rebellion and change \u2014 the industrial version of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s cycle of rebellion and the \u201cblood of patriots.\u201dAnd then, as Zuckerberg has prophesied, the future of tech may very well belong to China after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nancy Roman, \u2018Mother of the Hubble\u2019 Telescope, Dies at 93", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Nancy Grace Roman was 11 years old, her family was living in Reno. She was enthralled by the stars in the clear night skies and joined with friends in forming an astronomy club.It was the beginning of a lifelong fascination with the cosmos.When she died on Wednesday in Germantown, Md., at 93, Dr. Roman was remembered as \u201cthe mother of the Hubble.\u201dThe idea for that kind of large optical telescope had circulated in the scientific world since the astronomer Lyman Spitzer Jr. envisioned it in 1946. But the concept met with skepticism over feasibility and cost. So the road toward getting the Hubble into the skies was a long one.In addition to coordinating the efforts of astronomers and engineers in their development of the Hubble, Dr. Roman wrote testimony for NASA representatives making the case for the Hubble before Congress and she pitched the project to the Bureau of the Budget.Dr. Roman also took part in development of the Cosmic Background Explorer, a satellite launched in 1989 that confirmed the Big Bang theory of the universe\u2019s creation.She was a trailblazer for women at a time when science was considered a man\u2019s world, and she became a longtime advocate for women in science.\u201cI still remember asking my high school guidance teacher for permission to take a second year of algebra instead of a fifth year of Latin,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe looked down her nose at me and sneered, \u2018What lady would take mathematics instead of Latin?\u2019 That was the sort of reception that I got most of the way,\u201d she told the Voice of America.Dr. Roman was born on May 16, 1925, in Nashville, the only child of Irwin Roman, a geophysicist, and Georgia (Smith) Roman, a music teacher. When she was three months old, the family left for Texas and Oklahoma, where her father advised oil companies on drilling possibilities.The family moved to Reno when her father was named western regional chief for federal research into geophysics.\u201cIn Reno, of course, the skies were very clear, a beautiful place to observe the sky, and we lived on the edge of the city at the time,\u201d Dr. Roman recalled in a 1980 interview for the National Air and Space Museum. \u201cWe had very few lights. I started an astronomy club with the girls in the neighborhood. We learned the constellations, read astronomy. I just never lost my interest in it.\u201dThe family later moved to Baltimore, where she attended high school. She received a degree in astronomy from Swarthmore College in 1946, obtained a doctorate in astronomy from the University of Chicago in 1949, then worked at its Yerkes Observatory as a researcher.She later joined the United States Naval Research Laboratory, specializing in radio astronomy, and was recruited by NASA in 1959, a year after it was founded.\u201cThe idea of coming in with an absolute clean slate to set up a program that I thought was likely to influence astronomy for 50 years was just a challenge that I couldn\u2019t turn down,\u201d she recalled in her National Air and Space Museum interview.The Soviet Union\u2019s launching of Sputnik in October 1957 proved that satellites could fly. Nonetheless, Dr. Roman\u2019s early work at NASA lacked the glamour attached to the manned spaceflight program of the 1960s in response to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s call for America to put a man on the moon by the decade\u2019s end.Dr. Roman retired from NASA in 1979 but continued as a consultant as work progressed toward the Hubble\u2019s launching. In 2017, when Lego created a 231-piece Women of NASA set, Dr. Roman\u2019s likeness was among four it featured as women who were space pioneers.Dr. Roman\u2019s death, at a hospital, was confirmed by a cousin, Laura Verreau, The Washington Post reported. It said she had lived in Chevy Chase, Md., and had no immediate survivors.In her later years, Dr. Roman passed on her love for space research to young people and especially sought to inspire girls to pursue a career in science. She taught astronomy to fifth graders at Shepherd Elementary School in Washington in the late 1990s.As she put it: \u201cOne of the reasons I like working with schools is to try to convince women that they can be scientists and that science can be fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In France, School Lessons Ask: Which Twitter Post Should You Trust?", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVAULX-EN-VELIN, France \u2014 A group of teenagers recently swarmed into a room at Coll\u00e8ge Henri Barbusse near Lyon, France, for a class typically dedicated to learning Spanish. But on that Wednesday, an unusual lesson awaited them.Five posts from Twitter were up on the board. The assignment: Decipher whether they were trustworthy or suspect.\u201cShe picks a topic, she exaggerates things, and then people will say, \u2018She\u2019s right, I should vote for her,\u2019\u201d Ms. Houbiri said.At the front of the class, Sandra Laffont, a journalist teaching the workshop, nodded and said, \u201cPoliticians may sometimes exaggerate reality because their goal is to convince people that their ideas are the right ones.\u201dThe class was part of a novel experiment by a government to work with journalists and educators to combat the spread of online misinformation. France is coordinating one of the world\u2019s largest national media and internet literacy efforts to teach students, starting as early as in middle school, how to spot junk information online.Since 2015, the French government has increased funding for courses about the downsides of the online world. About 30,000 teachers and other educational professionals receive government training on the subject every year. In some places, the local authorities require young adults to complete an internet literacy course to receive welfare benefits, such as a monthly stipend.The French Culture Ministry has doubled its annual budget for the courses to 6 million euros (about $6.8 million), and the Education Ministry is adding an elective high school course on the internet and the media to the national curriculum, making it available to thousands of students. Some educators are calling for the courses to be mandatory, taught alongside history and math.\u201cThe younger you start, the better,\u201d said Serge Barbet, who heads Clemi, the main program within the Education Ministry coordinating the effort. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been pushing for more media education in recent years. It\u2019s become a vital need and a threat.\u201dOutside France, internet literacy programs are also growing, but have largely been left to groups, such as the News Literacy Project in the United States, that are funded by foundations and companies like Facebook and Google. European Union officials this month called on countries in the bloc to expand education programs as part of a push against misinformation and election interference.France\u2019s centralized strategy is \u201cquite unique\u201d and \u201cabsolutely noteworthy,\u201d said Renee Hobbs, a professor at the University of Rhode Island who specializes in media literacy.The government points to Ms. Laffont\u2019s program as a model and has provided an annual injection of tens of thousands of euros since 2017 to help it grow. Now 155 journalists volunteer, including many from Le Monde, France\u2019s leading newspaper, and the group held about 500 workshops with students this year.Ms. Laffont keeps lessons simple. She incorporates Twitter and YouTube, and shares links to websites that students can use as references to check facts. She also explains the basics of how journalists gather and confirm facts, hoping that may help reverse some students\u2019 mistrust of the media, as well as help them develop a more critical eye for what they see online.\u201cWe realized that we had to go back to the fundamentals before even mentioning fake news and conspiracy theories: what\u2019s news, who makes it, how do you check the sources,\u201d Ms. Laffont said.There is little research to gauge whether these lessons work. Technology trends move fast, and courses can quickly become outdated. Even basic infrastructure can be a problem: Before the class at the Henri Barbusse middle school, teachers struggled to get the internet access working.Guillaume Chaslot, a French engineer who helped develop YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm, said the efforts were worthwhile but wondered how effective they would be against Facebook and Google. Their algorithms put a priority on engagement, he said, meaning false and sensationalistic content from questionable sources can spread quickly.\u201cI don\u2019t think you solve the problem with these trainings,\u201d Mr. Chaslot said. \u201cThe power is the platforms. It\u2019s a mismatch.\u201dBut educators said the workshops helped people realize they must take responsibility for their online behavior, particularly in lower-income areas where young people are more vulnerable.At a recent internet literacy workshop outside Paris, students were asked to write their own false news article. One participant paused as he finished a post that exaggerated police brutality, realizing many of his friends would believe it.\u201cThat\u2019s so scary,\u201d said the student, Faycal Ben Abdallah, 20.\u201cMany young adults don\u2019t look for news today \u2014 they just come across it,\u201d said Baptiste Larroud\u00e9-Tasei, a community worker at Groupe SOS in Paris who specializes in prevention of radicalization. \u201cIf all of a sudden they are interested in something, they feel a need to learn more about it without always knowing how to do it properly.\u201dAt the Henri Barbusse class, most of the 24 students came from housing blocks in Vaulx-en-Velin, a predominantly low-income neighborhood with a large immigrant population. On that Wednesday, Ms. Laffont began by asking the teenagers if they used Facebook. No hands went up.\u201cFacebook is for old people,\u201d one student shouted, followed by laughter. They said they favored Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp. (Facebook owns Instagram and WhatsApp.)Some students said that the class was helpful, but that they weren\u2019t sure how they would apply the new information.Yacine Saidi, 14, who spends most of his internet time on YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, said the class should be longer. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how useful it can be when I\u2019m back home on my phone,\u201d he said.A group of girls including Ms. Houbiri said they mainly got their news from Snapchat and YouTube. \u201cWe\u2019re not aware enough of how journalists work, how fake news is created or why such or such thing lands in our social media feeds,\u201d Ms. Houbiri said. \u201cSchool can be the place where we become more aware of all this.\u201dThen the lunch bell sounded, and the two-hour class drew to an end. Ms. Laffont was energized by the teenagers\u2019 engagement and interest.\u201cIt\u2019s your role to sort things out online,\u201d she told them. \u201cBe attentive to all the subtleties we\u2019ve seen today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Another represents a person who travels with the mayor of New York during the day and returns to Long Island at night.Yet another leaves a house in upstate New York at 7 a.m. and travels to a middle school 14 miles away, staying until late afternoon each school day. Only one person makes that trip: Lisa Magrin, a 46-year-old math teacher. Her smartphone goes with her.An app on the device gathered her location information, which was then sold without her knowledge. It recorded her whereabouts as often as every two seconds, according to a database of more than a million phones in the New York area that was reviewed by The New York Times. While Ms. Magrin\u2019s identity was not disclosed in those records, The Times was able to easily connect her to that dot.The app tracked her as she went to a Weight Watchers meeting and to her dermatologist\u2019s office for a minor procedure. It followed her hiking with her dog and staying at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s home, information she found disturbing.\u201cIt\u2019s the thought of people finding out those intimate details that you don\u2019t want people to know,\u201d said Ms. Magrin, who allowed The Times to review her location data.Like many consumers, Ms. Magrin knew that apps could track people\u2019s movements. But as smartphones have become ubiquitous and technology more accurate, an industry of snooping on people\u2019s daily habits has spread and grown more intrusive.By Michael H. Keller and Richard Harris | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeAt least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information, The Times found. Several of those businesses claim to track up to 200 million mobile devices in the United States \u2014 about half those in use last year. The database reviewed by The Times \u2014 a sample of information gathered in 2017 and held by one company \u2014 reveals people\u2019s travels in startling detail, accurate to within a few yards and in some cases updated more than 14,000 times a day.Businesses say their interest is in the patterns, not the identities, that the data reveals about consumers. They note that the information apps collect is tied not to someone\u2019s name or phone number but to a unique ID. But those with access to the raw data \u2014 including employees or clients \u2014 could still identify a person without consent. They could follow someone they knew, by pinpointing a phone that regularly spent time at that person\u2019s home address. Or, working in reverse, they could attach a name to an anonymous dot, by seeing where the device spent nights and using public records to figure out who lived there.Many location companies say that when phone users enable location services, their data is fair game. But, The Times found, the explanations people see when prompted to give permission are often incomplete or misleading. An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. That disclosure is often buried in a vague privacy policy.\u201cLocation information can reveal some of the most intimate details of a person\u2019s life \u2014 whether you\u2019ve visited a psychiatrist, whether you went to an A.A. meeting, who you might date,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has proposed bills to limit the collection and sale of such data, which are largely unregulated in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not right to have consumers kept in the dark about how their data is sold and shared and then leave them unable to do anything about it,\u201d he added.After Elise Lee, a nurse in Manhattan, saw that her device had been tracked to the main operating room at the hospital where she works, she expressed concern about her privacy and that of her patients.\u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Ms. Lee, who allowed The Times to examine her location history in the data set it reviewed. \u201cIt feels like someone is following me, personally.\u201dThe mobile location industry began as a way to customize apps and target ads for nearby businesses, but it has morphed into a data collection and analysis machine.\u201cWe look to understand who a person is, based on where they\u2019ve been and where they\u2019re going, in order to influence what they\u2019re going to do next,\u201d Ms. Greenstein said.Financial firms can use the information to make investment decisions before a company reports earnings \u2014 seeing, for example, if more people are working on a factory floor, or going to a retailer\u2019s stores.By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google Earth\u201cThe book \u20181984,\u2019 we\u2019re kind of living it in a lot of ways,\u201d said Bill Kakis, a managing partner at Tell All.Jails, schools, a military base and a nuclear power plant \u2014 even crime scenes \u2014 appeared in the data set The Times reviewed. One person, perhaps a detective, arrived at the site of a late-night homicide in Manhattan, then spent time at a nearby hospital, returning repeatedly to the local police station.By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google EarthThe most prolific company was Reveal Mobile, based in North Carolina, which had location-gathering code in more than 500 apps, including many that provide local news. A Reveal spokesman said that the popularity of its code showed that it helped app developers make ad money and consumers get free services.WeatherBug, owned by GroundTruth, asks users\u2019 permission to collect their location and tells them the information will be used to personalize ads. GroundTruth said that it typically sent the data to ad companies it worked with, but that if they didn\u2019t want the information they could ask to stop receiving it.By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeThe Times also identified more than 25 other companies that have said in marketing materials or interviews that they sell location data or services, including targeted advertising.The spread of this information raises questions about how securely it is handled and whether it is vulnerable to hacking, said Serge Egelman, a computer security and privacy researcher affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley.\u201cThere are really no consequences\u201d for companies that don\u2019t protect the data, he said, \u201cother than bad press that gets forgotten about.\u201dCompanies that use location data say that people agree to share their information in exchange for customized services, rewards and discounts. Ms. Magrin, the teacher, noted that she liked that tracking technology let her record her jogging routes.Brian Wong, chief executive of Kiip, a mobile ad firm that has also sold anonymous data from some of the apps it works with, says users give apps permission to use and share their data. \u201cYou are receiving these services for free because advertisers are helping monetize and pay for it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou would have to be pretty oblivious if you are not aware that this is going on.\u201dBut Ms. Lee, the nurse, had a different view. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what they have to tell themselves,\u201d she said of the companies. \u201cBut come on.\u201dMs. Lee had given apps on her iPhone access to her location only for certain purposes \u2014 helping her find parking spaces, sending her weather alerts \u2014 and only if they did not indicate that the information would be used for anything else, she said. Ms. Magrin had allowed about a dozen apps on her Android phone access to her whereabouts for services like traffic notifications.But it is easy to share information without realizing it. Of the 17 apps that The Times saw sending precise location data, just three on iOS and one on Android told users in a prompt during the permission process that the information could be used for advertising. Only one app, GasBuddy, which identifies nearby gas stations, indicated that data could also be shared to \u201canalyze industry trends.\u201dMore typical was theScore, a sports app: When prompting users to grant access to their location, it said the data would help \u201crecommend local teams and players that are relevant to you.\u201d The app passed precise coordinates to 16 advertising and location companies.A spokesman for theScore said that the language in the prompt was intended only as a \u201cquick introduction to certain key product features\u201d and that the full uses of the data were described in the app\u2019s privacy policy.The Weather Channel app, owned by an IBM subsidiary, told users that sharing their locations would let them get personalized local weather reports. IBM said the subsidiary, the Weather Company, discussed other uses in its privacy policy and in a separate \u201cprivacy settings\u201d section of the app. Information on advertising was included there, but a part of the app called \u201clocation settings\u201d made no mention of it.Even industry insiders acknowledge that many people either don\u2019t read those policies or may not fully understand their opaque language. Policies for apps that funnel location information to help investment firms, for instance, have said the data is used for market analysis, or simply shared for business purposes.\u201cMost people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Emmett Kilduff, the chief executive of Eagle Alpha, which sells data to financial firms and hedge funds. Mr. Kilduff said responsibility for complying with data-gathering regulations fell to the companies that collected it from people.Many location companies say they voluntarily take steps to protect users\u2019 privacy, but policies vary widely.By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeSome companies say they delete the location data after using it to serve ads, some use it for ads and pass it along to data aggregation companies, and others keep the information for years.Several people in the location business said that it would be relatively simple to figure out individual identities in this kind of data, but that they didn\u2019t do it. Others suggested it would require so much effort that hackers wouldn\u2019t bother.It \u201cwould take an enormous amount of resources,\u201d said Bill Daddi, a spokesman for Cuebiq, which analyzes anonymous location data to help retailers and others, and raised more than $27 million this year from investors including Goldman Sachs and Nasdaq Ventures. Nevertheless, Cuebiq encrypts its information, logs employee queries and sells aggregated analysis, he said.There is no federal law limiting the collection or use of such data. Still, apps that ask for access to users\u2019 locations, prompting them for permission while leaving out important details about how the data will be used, may run afoul of federal rules on deceptive business practices, said Maneesha Mithal, a privacy official at the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cYou can\u2019t cure a misleading just-in-time disclosure with information in a privacy policy,\u201d Ms. Mithal said.Apps form the backbone of this new location data economy.The app developers can make money by directly selling their data, or by sharing it for location-based ads, which command a premium. Location data companies pay half a cent to two cents per user per month, according to offer letters to app makers reviewed by The Times.Targeted advertising is by far the most common use of the information.Google and Facebook, which dominate the mobile ad market, also lead in location-based advertising. Both companies collect the data from their own apps. They say they don\u2019t sell it but keep it for themselves to personalize their services, sell targeted ads across the internet and track whether the ads lead to sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Google, which also receives precise location information from apps that use its ad services, said it modified that data to make it less exact.Smaller companies compete for the rest of the market, including by selling data and analysis to financial institutions. This segment of the industry is small but growing, expected to reach about $250 million a year by 2020, according to the market research firm Opimas.Apple and Google have a financial interest in keeping developers happy, but both have taken steps to limit location data collection. In the most recent version of Android, apps that are not in use can collect locations \u201ca few times an hour,\u201d instead of continuously.A spokesman said the company mandates that developers use the data only to provide a service directly relevant to the app, or to serve advertising that met Apple\u2019s guidelines.Apple recently shelved plans that industry insiders say would have significantly curtailed location collection. Last year, the company said an upcoming version of iOS would show a blue bar onscreen whenever an app not in use was gaining access to location data.After examining maps showing the locations extracted by their apps, Ms. Lee, the nurse, and Ms. Magrin, the teacher, immediately limited what data those apps could get. Ms. Lee said she told the other operating-room nurses to do the same.\u201cI went through all their phones and just told them: \u2018You have to turn this off. You have to delete this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cNobody knew.\u201dSept. 12, 2018May 10, 2018May 19, 2018Advertisement"}

The Times recorded all interactions with the app over two five-minute sessions, including pop-up messages and other prompts related to data use when the apps asked for location details.The Times analyzed the location transmissions from each app by looking for the latitude and longitude where testing was conducted, as well as known Wi-Fi IDs, which can be used to triangulate location. Reporters tallied only the transmissions precise enough to place the device in the correct building.Reporters examined the websites, marketing materials and privacy policies of the companies receiving precise location data. Companies that deal only in services such as fraud prevention were separated out. Reporters then counted the transmissions of precise location data to advertising, marketing and analysis companies.The Times app did not request precise location data and did not send it. It sent location data to several companies based on an IP address that placed the device elsewhere within the city.Frequently, location data companies make packages of code that collect phones\u2019 whereabouts. Developers who add this code to their apps can get paid for location-targeted ads, or earn money for providing the location data, or get free mapping or other services for their apps.The Times asked MightySignal to look for packages of code made by the more than 25 location-collection companies that the firm tracks. The Times excluded code packages that collect location primarily for mapping, as opposed to the sale or use of the data.The Times restricted results to apps that MightySignal had scanned within the previous six months. Many little-used apps on Android include location-gathering code, so The Times filtered out apps with fewer than 5,000 downloads. Because Apple does not provide download figures for its apps, the iOS apps were not sorted by user base.Times reporters examined each company identified in the testing. Those that said they didn\u2019t handle precise location data at all, despite having received it, were not counted as part of the location-tracking industry. In these cases, apps may have sent the data to multiple companies and relied on the recipients to delete it if they didn\u2019t want it.The Times also did not count companies that were merely processing the data for the app \u2014 for security, for example, or to tell the app maker about its own users.The apps included in the test are listed below, along with comment from the companies. Many other apps share data in similar ways; this list should not be used as a guide to problematic apps.

{"Headline": "Digital Data Gives Billboard Owners More Reason to \u2018Love a Good Traffic Jam\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingThe increasingly lengthy commute isn\u2019t just a traffic jam. It\u2019s a captive audience for advertisers.\u201cWe love a good traffic jam,\u201d said John Miller, vice president of sales and sales operations for Lamar Advertising in Baton Rouge, La. \u201cWe are all about eyeballs on billboards, and the increased amount of traffic is helping us.\u201dLamar has 175,000 billboards throughout the United States, Mr. Miller said, adding that slower traffic had helped the company\u2019s data collection program determine who was looking at the board and for how long. Using anonymous data from mobile devices and apps, Lamar has figured out how fast cars are passing by, how much \u201cdwell time\u201d drivers spend paying attention to billboards, what the demographics of the drivers are, and even where they live, travel and shop.Roughly three years ago, Clear Channel Outdoor started its own data collection service, Radar. Using global positioning data from mobile apps that require mapping \u2014 navigation, dating, shopping and restaurant ads \u2014 the service blends third-party demographic data with information about people passing billboards to determine not only where commuters will spend, but how.\u201cNow we\u2019re starting to understand what mobile devices we saw exposed to our billboards, and we look back in time and say, \u2018Where else have we seen those devices?\u2019\u201d said Dan Levi, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Clear Channel Outdoor. \u201cIn the case of businesses trying to get people into Target, we say, \u2018What are the locations that are the most efficient in getting people whose devices we\u2019ve seen in Target?\u2019\u201dHe noted that a recent analysis of fast-food customers in Southern California had found a strong (and perhaps counterintuitive) correlation with their going to the gym, largely because commuting whittled away time for sit-down meals and other forms of exercise. It also showed that billboards for gyms worked better when placed near a commuter\u2019s workplace than near his or her home.Mr. Miller said that data could also help digital billboards, which make up 2 percent of Lamar\u2019s billboard inventory, change to meet an advertiser\u2019s needs at specific times of the day. That could mean a movie studio\u2019s billboard mocking traffic congestion at the height of rush hour, a Dunkin\u2019 billboard changing from coffee in the morning to sandwiches at night, or sequential billboards telling a story.If advertisers can\u2019t catch commuters\u2019 eyes with billboards, they are also trying to reach them through radio.For instance, iHeartMedia \u2014 which owns Clear Channel Outdoor \u2014 has spent the last three years looking at listener behavior on both its radio stations and its app. Its research has produced data that iHeartMedia now sells to advertisers along with demographic information and specific ad time.However, Robert Pittman, chairman and chief executive officer of iHeartMedia, said commuters were so bombarded with information that advertisers might get them to want a product or service in the moment but not get them to remember once they\u2019re out of their cars.Mr. Pittman said introducing a Taco Bell breakfast menu to commuters when they\u2019re hungry, suggesting they drink Bacardi rum when they get home or pitching a car dealership while they\u2019re stuck in their clunker put those advertisers foremost in a commuter\u2019s mind when they\u2019re most susceptible to persuasion.When 20th Century Fox was preparing to release the Queen biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d this year, iHeartRadio stations used peak commute times to air interviews about the rock band, Mr. Pittman said. On Nov. 1, a day before the film\u2019s release, different versions of the six-minute title song played across all 650 iHeartRadio stations and sites.\u201cThe longer the commute and the more time they\u2019re in the car, the more they\u2019re looking to enjoy the experience in the car or to make it at least more tolerable,\u201d Mr. Pittman said. \u201cWe really try to make the programming that way, and we\u2019re able to bring our advertising partners into it as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen some amazing ads on my 2 train going back in the morning and coming back in the evening,\u201d Ms. Sarnoff said. \u201cIn this market, I\u2019ve seen advertisers really raise their game, and people\u2019s expectations of what people are going to see when they go into the subway are high.\u201dOutfront Media is rolling out 50,000 digital video boards at subway and rail stations in New York, the Bay Area, Washington and Boston.\u201cBrands like Casper and Seamless have becomes household names by sharing their brand stories with subway riders,\u201d Mr. Male, Outfront\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cSmart brands like Spotify, StreetEasy and WeWork leverage consumers\u2019 predictable travel paths, frequency and time spent, and in-the-moment-in-time mentality to drive app usage, sales and site visits.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of the advertising technology company Intersection.

{"Headline": "Apple to Add $1 Billion Campus in Austin, Tex., in Broad U.S. Hiring Push", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company, which has 90,000 workers in the United States, also plans to open 1,000-worker operations in San Diego, Seattle and Culver City, Calif., and add hundreds of employees in offices in New York, Pittsburgh and Boulder, Colo., in the next three years.\u201cApple is proud to bring new investment, jobs and opportunity to cities across the United States and to significantly deepen our quarter-century partnership with the city and people of Austin,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Apple has been criticized for years for not doing enough for the American economy because it has made most of its products in China and stashed most of its profits abroad to avoid tax payments in the United States.A provision in the code allowed for a one-time repatriation of corporate cash held abroad at a lower tax rate than what would have been paid under the previous tax plan. Apple used it to bring back $252 billion that it had stashed abroad.Mr. Trump, who had chided Apple over various issues in the past, reacted to the January announcement by praising the company while crediting his own policies for getting it to make the investments.In September, though, Mr. Trump took aim at Apple again over jobs after the company told trade officials in a letter that the administration\u2019s tariffs would affect a wide range of products.\u201cMake your products in the United States instead of China,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cStart building new plants now.\u201dNone of the new positions announced by Apple on Thursday appeared to involve manufacturing.Unlike Amazon, whose competition for a new headquarters was highly publicized, Apple has been relatively quiet about its expansion plans. The company opened its own new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., last year.The new 133-acre campus in Austin will initially employ 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support. It will ultimately have the capacity for up to 15,000 workers. Apple said it expected that its expanded presence in Austin, where it already employs 6,000 people, would make it the area\u2019s largest private employer.Apple said it had applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County. Those rebates would be in the tens of millions of dollars over 15 years, said a person familiar with the application, who declined to be named because the negotiations are private.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas hailed Apple\u2019s decision on Thursday as \u201ca testament to the high-quality work force and unmatched economic environment that Texas offers.\u201dCities and states are competing to lure high-paying tech jobs that can improve their economies and generate tax revenue.But tech companies, which rank among the world\u2019s largest by market value, carry downsides like gentrification and higher living costs that can push out longtime residents. Austin, like Seattle and the Bay Area, has experienced those effects in recent years as Apple and other technology companies expand.Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said the concentration of tech jobs in a few metropolitan areas was widening a gap between big cities and the rest of the country. He said the dynamic was contributing to the nation\u2019s political divide.\u201cThe digitalization of the economy is exaggerating the urban-rural divide,\u201d said Mr. Sundararajan, who studies the technology industry\u2019s role in the economy. \u201cThe part of the digital revolution that I have been waiting for, that I haven\u2019t seen kick in in the United States, is the large platforms enabling opportunities for individuals who may not have high-tech skills.\u201dJack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Spain is introducing its own 3 percent tax on online advertising services, brokering services and the resale of personal data.But, the commission spokesman noted, \u201cthe announcement by France does make it even more urgent for the E.U. to agree on a common digital services tax.\u201dMr. Le Maire said he still hoped that a union-wide agreement could be reached by March.Amazon, Apple and Twitter declined to comment. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment, although the director general of Google France told reporters this month, \u201cGoogle will pay if a tax on revenue is put in place\u201d in France or in the European Union.Large technology companies have long avoided paying taxes comparable to other businesses in the European countries where they operate.Facebook, for instance, paid corporate taxes of \u20ac1.9 million in 2017 in France on stated revenue of \u20ac55.9 million. The company has more than 34 million users in the country, and much of its revenue was logged in Ireland. Apple paid around \u20ac19 million in 2017 taxes in France.Amazon, too, does business across the union, but has benefited by having its regional headquarters in the low-tax haven of Luxembourg. The European Commission estimates that the online retailer and other companies pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the roughly 23 percent paid by traditional businesses.The big companies are not alone in opposing the commission\u2019s digital tax proposal. European start-ups have said it would handicap an expanding tech sector in the region that has struggled to match the scale of markets in the United States and China.France and Germany responded to such concerns by narrowing the proposal to include only larger technology companies, particularly advertising-focused companies like Facebook and Google. Those changes have not mollified everyone.France\u2019s imposition of a digital tax is one front in a wider campaign in Europe to target American technology companies amid growing concerns about their power and influence in society as well as their business practices.Germany has enacted a law requiring Facebook and Twitter to remove flagged hate speech within 24 hours or face fines. France has passed rules allowing judges to order the removal of misinformation around elections.Regulators at the European Commission have also targeted Google, Apple and Amazon for antitrust violations, imposing billions of euros in fines and orders to return unpaid taxes.The French government sued Google this year for \u20ac1.12 billion in taxes it claims the company avoided paying on advertising revenue earned. A Paris court ruled that the government could not collect because Google had declared that the revenue belonged to an Irish subsidiary. The government is appealing.Amazon reached a settlement in May over a long-running dispute with French tax authorities, who had been seeking nearly \u20ac200 million euros in back taxes, interest and penalties for the 2006 to 2010 fiscal years in relation to \u201cthe allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions.\u201d The government did not disclose the size of the settlement.And last year, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Adam Satariano contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Life After Horrific Death for the Journalist James Foley", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a cool October evening, in a Brooklyn studio crowded with canvases, some still wet, Diane Foley stood before an oil painting of two solemn grade-school boys in the Libyan civil war. One of the boys held aloft a photo of a middle-aged man, a relative, who was missing.\u201cI like this one,\u201d Mrs. Foley said to the artist, Bradley McCallum. \u201cI particularly like the ones that show the victims because it\u2019s not just destroyed buildings. Jim wanted to inspire us to reflect on what really happens in a war.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. McCallum, 52, approached Mrs. Foley with an idea for a project that would play the role of a memorial, reframe the collective memory of Mr. Foley and make tangible the quality of empathy in his work. After teaching a graduate seminar at Columbia University that examined the way ISIS used visual imagery, including its violent online propaganda videos, to spread cyberterrorism, Mr. McCallum said, \u201cThe memory of seeing it when it was first on television, and the kind of trauma, and the sophistication in the way that video was framed, I wondered, would it be possible for me, in making art, to change the way we see Jim when we search his name?\u201dFrom the start, Mr. McCallum conceived of the project as a collaboration with Mrs. Foley. And after a year of conversations, she agreed to license her son\u2019s work to him. Mr. McCallum was interested in unpublished source material, the workaday backdrop to the war. Mrs. Foley provided some of her son\u2019s external hard drives she hadn\u2019t opened, which he had left behind during his last visit home.From them Mr. McCallum is close to completing 23 paintings and has prepared canvases for 10 more. The paintings include collages of images from Mr. Foley\u2019s video or photographic stills, a process that Nicholas Mirzoeff, a professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, described as \u201ca physical manifestation of the photoshop process.\u201d Photorealist in style, the paintings are oil on linen. Most also include a silk overlay, like a theatrical scrim, with text from Mr. Foley\u2019s journal entries.As he worked on the paintings, Mr. McCallum sometimes shared with Mrs. Foley the text he was printing. They discussed titles for the paintings and at times, struggled to walk the line between consultation and collaboration.\u201cI\u2019d say to Diane, \u2018Just trust me because if you try to make the selections, try to be curator of this image or that one, this isn\u2019t going to work,\u2019\u201d Mr. McCallum said. But taking charge and speaking her mind come easily to Mrs. Foley, a flinty New Englander with a model\u2019s frame who raised five children and worked as a nurse practitioner.\u201cIt\u2019s nice but I don\u2019t think it really captures him,\u201d she said as she stood in the studio before Mr. McCallum\u2019s large-scale portrait of her son. She added: \u201cI like the ones with the children. Jim loved children.\u201dWith its reliance on photojournalism, Mr. McCallum\u2019s project stands on the shoulders of artists like Andy Warhol, whose visceral Death and Disaster paintings appropriated newspaper headlines and images, like the 1962 Air France crash, one Warhol created the day after it appeared on the cover of the New York Daily Mirror, or his use of Charles Moore\u2019s 1963 photographs for Life magazine of dogs tugging at civil rights protesters in Birmingham, Ala.The Foley series is still underway, with the artist seeking a gallery or museum showing. But the collaborative process of memorializing a loved one with a non-artist is already precedent-setting. According to Dr. Mirzoeff, it encourages \u201cpersistent looking,\u201d raising questions about the ethics of appropriating imagery, of war and conflict, memory and mourning, the refugee crisis, and the varieties of terrorism.The paintings telegraph literal and figurative loss. In one, a soldier rests a gun on the sill of a broken window that overlooks a street gutted by explosions. \u201cMother\u2019s Lament\u201d captures six different video frames and features a woman in a double-layered veil and abaya, her face tight with anguish. In \u201cFallen\u201d men snap pictures of the bloodied corpse of Mutassim el-Qaddafi, the son of the former Libyan strongman. The painting draws its images from 20 video stills stitched together from Mr. Foley\u2019s raw video footage. Other paintings, of sky or desert, function as pauses between conflict photography.\u201cBradley is not just giving us the most disturbing images \u2014 that\u2019s certainly there \u2014 but also paying attention to what is the banality of war, its everydayness, little moments where you are just looking up, at a beautiful arrangement of light,\u201d Dr. Mirzoeff said.Ms. Keshavarz said she focused the narrative of the film around the \u201cemotional anguish of a parent not having control, having to wait, and doing it alone,\u201d while their child is a hostage.The film is dedicated to conflict journalists, specifically Mr. Foley and four other reporters killed in the Middle East. Google made a small donation to the Foley Foundation. Produced by Google\u2019s YouTube Premium, the film will be available via subscription next year.\u201cI think the film is much safer,\u201d Mrs. Foley said of the subsequent changes.She and Mr. McCallum have settled on \u201cInescapable Truths\u201d as the title for his paintings.\u201cThis is inescapable: that children are orphaned, people are widowed,\u201d Mrs. Foley said. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrific, the toll it takes because of people\u2019s inability to get along.\u201dFamily and friends describe Mr. Foley as warm and outgoing, with a fierce intelligence yet self-effacing and humble. Ms. Tung thinks he would have been \u201ca little embarrassed\u201d by the spotlight.\u201cFor him, it was about the people he documented and whose stories were being amplified and not about him \u2014 on the other hand he would have been very honored,\u201d she said by email from her current post, in the Central African Republic.In the studio, Mrs. Foley and Mr. McCallum fanned through family photographs. There were also prints of the video stills Mr. Foley took in Libya and Syria, in his slivers of ordinary time, between the bombing victims and ruined cities. In one, a flock of dark birds appears in a corner of blue sky, their upturned wings flashing white. His mother studied the images, leaning in closely, and lingering on one that a colleague took of Mr. Foley, his lanky frame curled up with a notebook.\u201cI love this photo of Jim in the desert, trying to write in the desert,\u201d she said, her fingertips touching the small cross on her necklace. She pointed out two other images, of the sun rising and setting. \u201cIt was very important when Jim was in captivity, the sound of the birds and of children playing, the sound of prayer, the call to prayer,\u201d Mrs. Foley said. \u201cJim would pray with them.\u201dMr. McCallum held up a photo of Jim as a teenager at a national park, on a family trip. In it, Mr. Foley is very near a sign that says \u201cDanger. Keep Off Rocks.\u201d His mother looked at it and shook her head.\u201cThat was where he liked to be,\u201d she said. \u201cRight at the edge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Yoda of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "Profiles in scienceDonald Knuth, master of algorithms, reflects on 50 years of his opus-in-progress, \u201cThe Art of Computer Programming.\u201dSupported byFor half a century, the Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth, who bears a slight resemblance to Yoda \u2014 albeit standing 6-foot-4 and wearing glasses \u2014 has reigned as the spirit-guide of the algorithmic realm. Here is your book, the one your thousands of letters have asked us to publish. It has taken us years to do, checking and rechecking countless recipes to bring you only the best, only the interesting, only the perfect.Now 80, Dr. Knuth usually dresses like the youthful geek he was when he embarked on this odyssey: long-sleeved T-shirt under a short-sleeved T-shirt, with jeans, at least at this time of year. In those early days, he worked close to the machine, writing \u201cin the raw,\u201d tinkering with the zeros and ones. \u201cKnuth made it clear that the system could actually be understood all the way down to the machine code level,\u201d said Dr. Norvig. Nowadays, of course, with algorithms masterminding (and undermining) our very existence, the average programmer no longer has time to manipulate the binary muck, and works instead with hierarchies of abstraction, layers upon layers of code \u2014 and often with chains of code borrowed from code libraries. But an elite class of engineers occasionally still does the deep dive.\u201cHere at Google, sometimes we just throw stuff together,\u201d Dr. Norvig said, during a meeting of the Google Trips team, in Mountain View, Calif. \u201cBut other times, if you\u2019re serving billions of users, it\u2019s important to do that efficiently. A 10-per-cent improvement in efficiency can work out to billions of dollars, and in order to get that last level of efficiency, you have to understand what\u2019s going on all the way down.\u201d Or, as Andrei Broder, a distinguished scientist at Google and one of Dr. Knuth\u2019s former graduate students, explained during the meeting: \u201cWe want to have some theoretical basis for what we\u2019re doing. We don\u2019t want a frivolous or sloppy or second-rate algorithm. We don\u2019t want some other algorithmist to say, \u2018You guys are morons.\u2019\u201d Dr. Knuth\u2019s exacting standards, literary and otherwise, may explain why his life\u2019s work is nowhere near done. He has a wager with Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google and a former student (to use the term loosely), over whether Mr. Brin will finish his Ph.D. before Dr. Knuth concludes his opus.During summer vacations, Dr. Knuth made more money than professors earned in a year by writing compilers. A compiler is like a translator, converting a high-level programming language (resembling algebra) to a lower-level one (sometimes arcane binary) and, ideally, improving it in the process. In computer science, \u201coptimization\u201d is truly an art, and this is articulated in another Knuthian proverb: \u201cPremature optimization is the root of all evil.\u201dEventually Dr. Knuth became a compiler himself, inadvertently founding a new field that he came to call the \u201canalysis of algorithms.\u201d A publisher hired him to write a book about compilers, but it evolved into a book collecting everything he knew about how to write for computers \u2014 a book about algorithms. When Dr. Knuth started out, he intended to write a single work. Soon after, computer science underwent its Big Bang, so he reimagined and recast the project in seven volumes. Now he metes out sub-volumes, called fascicles. The next installation, \u201cVolume 4, Fascicle 5,\u201d covering, among other things, \u201cbacktracking\u201d and \u201cdancing links,\u201d was meant to be published in time for Christmas. It is delayed until next April because he keeps finding more and more irresistible problems that he wants to present.In order to optimize his chances of getting to the end, Dr. Knuth has long guarded his time. He retired at 55, restricted his public engagements and quit email (officially, at least). Andrei Broder recalled that time management was his professor\u2019s defining characteristic even in the early 1980s. This decade-long detour took place back in the age when computers were shared among users and ran faster at night while most humans slept. So Dr. Knuth switched day into night, shifted his schedule by 12 hours and mapped his student appointments to Fridays from 8 p.m. to midnight. Dr. Broder recalled, \u201cWhen I told my girlfriend that we can\u2019t do anything Friday night because Friday night at 10 I have to meet with my adviser, she thought, \u2018This is something that is so stupid it must be true.\u2019\u201dWhen Knuth chooses to be physically present, however, he is 100-per-cent there in the moment. \u201cIt just makes you happy to be around him,\u201d said Jennifer Chayes, a managing director of Microsoft Research. \u201cHe\u2019s a maximum in the community. If you had an optimization function that was in some way a combination of warmth and depth, Don would be it.\u201dOf course, all the algorithmic rigmarole is also causing real-world problems. Algorithms written by humans \u2014 tackling harder and harder problems, but producing code embedded with bugs and biases \u2014 are troubling enough. More worrisome, perhaps, are the algorithms that are not written by humans, algorithms written by the machine, as it learns. All the more so if you\u2019re an algorithm versed in Knuth. \u201cToday, programmers use stuff that Knuth, and others, have done as components of their algorithms, and then they combine that together with all the other stuff they need,\u201d said Google\u2019s Dr. Norvig. \u201cWith A.I., we have the same thing. It\u2019s just that the combining-together part will be done automatically, based on the data, rather than based on a programmer\u2019s work. You want A.I. to be able to combine components to get a good answer based on the data. But you have to decide what those components are. It could happen that each component is a page or chapter out of Knuth, because that\u2019s the best possible way to do some task.\u201dLucky, then, Dr. Knuth keeps at it. He figures it will take another 25 years to finish \u201cThe Art of Computer Programming,\u201d although that time frame has been a constant since about 1980. Might the algorithm-writing algorithms get their own chapter, or maybe a page in the epilogue? \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d said Dr. Knuth.\u201cI am worried that algorithms are getting too prominent in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cIt started out that computer scientists were worried nobody was listening to us. Now I\u2019m worried that too many people are listening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Next America\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow do we govern in the age that will begin with the 2020 election? Opinion ColumnistI have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime \u2014 and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent \u2014 he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus \u2014 but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the \u201cNext America\u2019\u2019?\u201cYou know William Gibson\u2019s line, \u2018The future is already here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed\u2019? Well, the future is here, and now it\u2019s starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,\u2019\u2019 Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of \u201cIndispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,\u2019\u2019 remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. \u201cThe basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.\u2019\u2019This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass.Where do I start? A good place is with 5G \u2014 fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around \u2026 2020.Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 like deploying self-driving vehicles \u2014 requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor.As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, \u201cThink of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.\u2019\u2019It could be as revolutionary as the internet. But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides.An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently \u201cabout 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.\u2019\u2019But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be \u201ccontinuous lifelong learning\u2019\u2019 \u2014 because when the pace of change is accelerating, \u201cthe fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition.\u201dThat means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 we will need new national trampolines.We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time.Tennessee has already done that.These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services?\u201cBut that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for \u2018free\u2019 in exchange for personal data,\u201d Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. \u201cThis has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.\u2019\u2019Just one person \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain \u2014 and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros \u2014 should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look.Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump\u2019s tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We\u2019ve had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we\u2019ve never run one so huge during a boom.That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare \u2014 just when all the baby boomers are retiring.In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more \u2014 from climate change to zoning rules \u2014 and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won\u2019t let us do that again. The Next America won\u2019t wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Data Scandals Stoke Criticism That a Privacy Watchdog Too Rarely Bites", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers, consumer advocates and even former commission officials were clamoring for tough action against Facebook, arguing that it had violated an earlier F.T.C. consent decree barring it from misleading users about how their information was shared.But the enforcement official, James A. Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm \u2014 echoing Facebook\u2019s own argument \u2014 cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm\u2019s reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.Almost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country\u2019s de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.\u2019s future.\u201cThey have been asleep at the switch,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.\u201dThe agency \u2014 overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president\u2019s party \u2014 is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.\u201cIf the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,\u201d Mr. Simons said in a statement. \u201cOur investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.\u201dThe agency\u2019s defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.As the federal government\u2019s main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.But it is hampered by its relatively small size \u2014 about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency\u2019s enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn\u2019t have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.\u201cThey have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,\u201d said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.F.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as \u201cKidVid.\u201d Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.\u2019s power to issue new regulations.Even today, \u201cin just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,\u201d said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.\u201cThey think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. \u201cThey have an institutional culture of deference.\u201dNor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.(The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebook used the data.)Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.Ashkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn\u2019t see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi\u2019s data could not identify specific individuals.Ms. Ohlhausen\u2019s staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.With limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should \u201cpursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.\u201dBut that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.Two former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.In recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users\u2019 locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.Mr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm \u201chas dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.\u201dMichael LaForgia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The more we know about you, the argument goes, the more we can show you products you actually want instead of ads that just annoy you. Consumers, they say, are happily trading very specific information about their lives in order to receive this kind of personalized advertising and marketing \u2014 relevant ads, as the industry calls them.He added, \u201cIt\u2019s that calculus people have, rather than, geez, this is a rational decision I\u2019m making because I know this is what I have to do.\u201dProfessor Turow is among the academics, privacy advocates and regulators who have long been critical of how companies extricate vast amounts of personal information from consumers in the digital world. In 2018, it became harder for the tech and media industries to ignore those voices, with more consumers and lawmakers discovering how extensive, secretive and unstoppable data collection can be.\u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Steve Satterfield, director of privacy and public policy at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201dGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cThere are so many aspects of how companies deal with the public that obfuscates what actually goes on and so many attempts to placate people using jargon,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who write privacy policies who admit \u2014 they admit \u2014 that they aren\u2019t written for the public.\u201dIn their survey this year, researchers led by Professor Turow found that most Americans did not understand privacy policies on websites. More than half did not know the correct answer to this true-or-false statement: \u201cIf a website has a privacy policy, that means the site won\u2019t share user information with other sites or companies without permission.\u201d (The statement is false.)The researchers also found that most Americans did not know that companies can legally collect and keep personal data on 13-year-olds as if they are adults. Companies are able to do that because the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law, extends only to children who are 12 and under.\u201cI would argue that\u2019s because people can\u2019t imagine that the law would allow this kind of attitude,\u201d Professor Turow said. The researchers conducted national surveys in 2015 and this year, working with two polling companies to interview a representative sample of Americans on their landlines and cellphones.The findings are particularly notable as tech companies and marketers argue that individuals should be responsible for understanding and navigating all of these policies and their privacy settings. Some people may delete Facebook, but what about Instagram and WhatsApp? Avoiding Google for search purposes is one thing. Then try avoiding Gmail, YouTube and Waze.Advertisers are watching closely as Americans question these services. They are the ones, after all, paying to use all this data to send messages to the right consumers. There is a stark difference between targeting consumers who are eagerly sharing their information for so-called relevance and targeting those who have given up, and who may not even understand how, exactly, their data is being collected and interpreted.\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that Americans see privacy as an important issue,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cThe question is: What do you do about it?\"Advertisement"}

Mr. Steyer advocates protections for children who use technology. But laws in the United States offer students very little digital privacy or security protection against the wiles of the industry.Wherever the rules are muddy for the industry, we should make them resoundingly clear in such a way that protects our children and, implicitly, our national interest. If we have learned anything about Silicon Valley this year, it is that we cannot sit back and wait for the industry to voluntarily act on behalf of children; our government must intervene before more harm comes to them.Tech companies should not be permitted to collect data on children and profile them using their personal data without a parent or guardian\u2019s meaningful consent to the data collection. In an educational setting, in which children might be denied the ability to participate in certain learning activities if their parents object, meaningful consent is a often simply not possible. They should not be allowed to market products to a child based on inferences about the child\u2019s behaviors, preferences, beliefs or interests, and they should not be allowed to sell or share a child\u2019s personal data to a third party under any circumstances. These protections, must be brought to every child in America.National policymakers should act more decisively. They should reignite efforts in the House and Senate to federalize the California law, and we should tack on the additional measures proposed in the Do Not Track Kids bill. They should assure that industry efforts to encourage passage of a weak federal privacy law do not interfere with efforts made by state legislatures to protect students.

{"Headline": "Are You There, User? It\u2019s Me, Facebook!", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial platforms want to run the world. But look how they treat your email. It was 8:03 p.m., Wednesday, Dec. 12, and my body had sent me a notification, via my throbbing skull: You\u2019re probably getting the flu. Facebook, too, had just notified me, via an alert on my phone, of its own plan for me: \u201cYou and Rosie Schaap are celebrating two years of friendship on Facebook.\u201dOver the next few days, my body followed up with a series of messages: you have a sore throat; you have a fever; you have the chills. In that same period, Facebook emailed me four times. \u201cSee Rosie Schaap\u2019s message and other notifications you\u2019ve missed,\u201d it demanded on Thursday, then on Friday, then again on Sunday and once more on Tuesday. By Wednesday, feeling better, I was catching up on emails. \u201cSee Rosie Schaap\u2019s message.\u201d Rosie Schaap\u2019s message? Had I missed something?I had not. \u201cRosie Schaap\u2019s message\u201d did not exist; it was the automatic notification generated by Facebook, about the anniversary of the moment we added each other to Facebook\u2019s database of human connections. I asked Rosie if she had gotten a similar notification about, or \u201cfrom,\u201d me, and she hadn\u2019t, but she said she had removed Facebook Messenger from her phone some time ago. It was a decision that she said \u201cI think has improved my quality of life generally,\u201d but it had also left her out of our Facebook \u201ccelebrating.\u201d And so we had reconnected, to the extent we had ever connected on Facebook in the first place. I had done as I was told.The emails, however, would not stop. Like many millions of others, I get emails from Facebook all the time. Some days I get three, some days none. In November, I got 42. Each one is deceptive in its own way. \u201c[Person whose profile I checked not so recently] has posted an update\u201d is a subject line that shows up frequently, but the email body contains nothing more than the same text, with a link and a big button that says: \u201cView.\u201d Underneath, it will say something like \u201c13 people reacted to this,\u201d and below that, there will be another button that simply says: \u201cOpen Facebook.\u201d Others include \u201c[Old acquaintance] commented on his photo\u201d and \u201c[Cousin] shared [stranger\u2019s] post,\u201d which open to emails that never contain a photo, or a post, just the same set of solicitations to visit Facebook. First: Who honestly cares? They\u2019re just emails! It\u2019s just Facebook! I don\u2019t have to open these emails, and my inbox automatically puts them in special tab. And also: I don\u2019t have to use Facebook in the first place, and I could turn off emails \u2014\u00a0while these messages contain almost nothing in the way of information, they do contain an \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link. And, besides, anyone with an internet connection should know that any company to which you give your email address should be expected to use it as much as possible. There was also a time not so long ago when Facebook\u2019s emails contained the entirety of the things they described: the post, or the photo, or, at least, the text of that \u201cmessage\u201d from a friend. And, sure, my inbox is otherwise full of solicitations from various companies to buy their products or use their services or read their content. They share a set of obvious tactics: overpromising and underdelivering; creating unnecessary mystery in subject lines; manufacturing urgency at commodity scale. In aggregate, over time, these thousands of solicitations and misdirections have gently but constantly made my inbox a worse place. I\u2019ve dealt with this by using a combination of filters, new email apps and rationalization. It\u2019s a situation much like the one Facebook has struggled with for years on its own service. Since the advent of the News Feed \u2014 it was about a dozen years ago that the company created a stream of content for its users to endure \u2014 Facebook has made clear its disdain for what it has called, variously, \u201clow-quality content,\u201d \u201clow-quality web page experiences\u201d or, occasionally, \u201cengagement bait.\u201d We hear from our community that they\u2019re disappointed when they click on a link in News Feed that leads to a web page that contains little substantive content, and is covered in disruptive, shocking or malicious ads.Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people\u2019s feeds. Our research further shows that the links they share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait, sensationalism, and misinformation.There was this issue with clickbait, where there were a bunch of publications that would push content into Facebook, [and] people would click on them because they had sensational titles but then would not feel good about having read that content.People who \u201cwould not feel good\u201d about content they expect to be \u201csensational\u201d sounds like a tiny but probably less than optimal experience, and it would be a shame if it happened all the time!Among them: pages that \u201clack substantive or original content\u201d or \u201cprovide an unexpected content experience.\u201d As an attribute of \u201clow-quality content,\u201d it describes something familiar: Ads that purposefully withhold information are ones that entice someone to click a link in order to understand the full context of something.So: Spam for me, but not for thee! Of course, we don\u2019t need to place Facebook\u2019s email behavior in the context of the service itself to understand what it is the company is doing. We all know the word for nagging promotional emails sent with no regard for the general well-being of our inboxes: spam. But Facebook isn\u2019t just another e-commerce operation trying to get you to buy something else, or a publication trying to get you to resubscribe, or a scammer trying to fix your erectile dysfunction or let you in on the ground floor of the latest cryptocurrency or both. It\u2019s Facebook! Like email, it\u2019s a near-universal online service. It wants people to use it and its sister apps for basically everything, which makes it sort of a competitor to email. In 2010, it even provided users with @facebook.com email addresses, and linked them to their Facebook inboxes. \u201cIt seems wrong that an email message from your best friend gets sandwiched between a bill and a bank statement,\u201d the company wrote at the time. \u201cWith new Messages, your Inbox will only contain messages from your friends and their friends. All other messages will go into an Other folder where you can look at them separately.\u201d (The service has been discontinued.)As higher-stakes questions about the biggest social platforms are finally creeping to the fore \u2014\u00a0about what kind of world they want, and what kind of world they\u2019re creating \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s worth taking note of how these companies have behaved where they think they won\u2019t bear the burden of their actions. And as the tech giants ask you to trust them with ever more access to your work and personal lives, consider what they\u2019ve done with the first piece of information you entrusted to them, all these years later: your email address.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Workers Got Paid in Company Stock. They Used It to Agitate for Change.", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley technology firms are known for giving stock to their workers, a form of compensation that often helps employees feel invested in their companies.At Amazon, more than a dozen employees who had received stock grants recently exercised their rights as shareholders. In late November and early December, they filed identical shareholder petitions asking the e-commerce giant to release a comprehensive plan addressing climate change.Their filing appears to be the first time that tech employees have led their own shareholder proposal, according to activist investors. In the proposal, which will be voted on at Amazon\u2019s annual shareholder meeting next spring, employees asked the company\u2019s board to say how it would respond to climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.\u201cWe realized we could use our position as employees and our power and our rights as shareholders to bring visibility of this issue to the board and the top leaders of this company,\u201d said Eliza Pan, a program manager who has worked at Amazon for five years and is one of the employees who signed on to the proposal.Ms. Pan, who earned Amazon shares as part of her compensation package, said workers must own at least $2,000 in stock for a year to file a shareholder proposal. \u201cWe had this power, and we wanted to leverage that power,\u201d she said.The move by Amazon\u2019s employees builds upon similar activism at Google this year. In March, its workers were part of a shareholder petition by Zevin Asset Management that sought to link executive compensation to diversity and inclusion goals. Google\u2019s employees did not directly file the proposal, but joined Zevin and presented it at the annual shareholder meeting of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.The proposal was ultimately voted down, but Pat Miguel Tomaino, the director of socially responsible investing at Zevin, said the firm planned to work with Google employees to resubmit it for the 2019 shareholder meeting.\u201cWorkers are looking at who holds power and where changes can be made,\u201d said Yana Calou, an engagement manager at Coworker.org, an organization that allows colleagues to start campaigns together. \u201cWorkers are shareholders themselves, and risks to workers and users are often risks to shareholders, so there is a natural alliance of shared interests.\u201dAmazon declined to comment on its employees\u2019 advocacy, but it said it was taking steps to address climate change.\u201cWe have set a goal to power our global infrastructure with 100 percent renewable energy and are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency innovations,\u201d said Kara Hurst, director of worldwide sustainability at Amazon. The company, based in Seattle, has installed solar energy systems at 25 of its fulfillment centers and has streamlined its packing process to reduce its use of packing materials, she added.Google declined to comment on its employees\u2019 participation in shareholder proposals.Shareholder proposals have in the past been used largely by activist investment firms and others to advocate for changes.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly unusual to see this, where employees are taking a stand in regard to the company they\u2019re working for,\u201d said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a wealth-management fund that focuses on climate issues.Tech employees, more than in many other industries, have a ready-made way to become activist shareholders because of how they are paid. Google, Facebook, Apple and tech start-ups such as Airbnb have all made stock a component of compensation. At privately held companies, tech workers often get stock options, which give them the option to buy shares at a set price. Publicly traded companies tend to grant restricted stock options that automatically transfer shares to employees over a period of time.\u201cBecause so much value is being created, or we hope is going to be created, it\u2019s appealing to employees to receive some potential part of that pop or growth in value,\u201d said Mary Russell, a lawyer and founder of Stock Option Counsel, a legal firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that advises tech employees on their compensation. \u201cThe culture of the companies is that we need to do this to incentivize people to build the value of the company.\u201dBut by paying employees this way, tech companies open themselves up to this kind of shareholder advocacy, she said. \u201cThey are setting themselves up to have quite a large group of stockholders who would of course, like any other stockholder, have the right to bring forward a shareholder proposal,\u201d Ms. Russell said.Employee shareholder proposals may ultimately not be effective since shareholder-led proposals are often shot down. And because tech founders often possess a large chunk of the shares in their companies \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and its largest shareholder, owns 16 percent of the company; the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have about 51 percent of voting shares in Alphabet \u2014 the proposals have little chance of passing without founder support.Tech employees said it was worth taking that risk. Shareholder proposals often gain attention because they are distributed to stockholders and are included in annual proxy statements, the employees say, and they give workers a way to raise their grievances directly to the board, rather than just to managers.\u201cBanding together with other shareholders amplifies my voice and makes all of our voices more powerful,\u201d said Ms. Pan of Amazon.\u201cIt\u2019s important to make change and work for change wherever you happen to be, and I happen to be an employee at Amazon,\u201d said Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer who is backing the climate change proposal and who has received Amazon shares as part of her compensation.She said it was important for employees to publicly demand a plan. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting the public, it\u2019s affecting business,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

There is even a hint of Queens: Most addresses in Fair Lawn are hyphenated, some with numbers as bizarre as 0-01.\u201cWe\u2019re not one of those sleepy, up-north Bergen County towns,\u201d said Kurt Peluso, the mayor. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff going on here.\u201dMs. Greenfield Estersohn, a native of rural Sussex County, N.J., serves on Fair Lawn\u2019s Green Team Advisory Committee, and sees the town as a balance between leafy and busy. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable for people coming from either the country or the city,\u201d she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t culture shock from any direction.\u201dIrina and Charles Ventura, originally from Upper Manhattan, moved to Fair Lawn in 2015, renting a three-bedroom, two-bathroom Cape Cod on a street lined with similarly modest houses. \u201cWhen I was little, we visited relatives in Fair Lawn, and it was the only place in New Jersey I knew,\u201d Ms. Ventura said. \u201cBecause I was kind of familiar with it, I investigated and kept hearing about the school system.\u201dMr. Ventura, 41, is an operations manager at a hospital in Westchester County, and Ms. Ventura, 38, is a program manager at a nonprofit in Newark, about 15 miles south. In July, they bought the house they were renting, paying $340,000.\u201cIs it our forever home? Probably not,\u201d Ms. Ventura said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great starter home.\u201dFor now, though, she is fairly certain the family is staying put, because \u201cour kids would kill us if we moved out of Fair Lawn.\u201dTheir 11-year-old son plays on multiple sports teams, and their 8-year-old daughter participates in arts programs at the recreation center. The sand-bottom municipal pool at Memorial Park costs $200 per family for the summer. And the neighborhood streets are easy to bicycle. \u201cYou feel a sense of community here right away,\u201d Ms. Ventura said.Fair Lawn occupies five square miles between the shopping malls of Paramus and the city of Paterson, to the west across the Passaic River. Route 208, a state highway, bisects Fair Lawn diagonally, and Route 4 runs through the southern portion as Broadway, in the largest of the borough\u2019s three principal commercial districts. The others are in Radburn \u2014 which Mr. Peluso said will be rehabilitated and made more pedestrian-friendly in the coming year \u2014 and along River Road.Cape Cods, split-levels and bi-levels abound, with newly constructed colonials mixed in. \u201cFair Lawn has a lot of midcentury houses with good bones,\u201d said Paula Royak, a Fair Lawn native who works as a sales associate with Terrie O\u2019Connor Realtors, in Ridgewood. \u201cThey\u2019re solid, with features like brick exteriors, plaster walls, hardwood floors and steel-beam construction, and distinctive finishing touches certain builders were known for.\u201dWhat Fair Lawn lacks is Victorian architecture, so those looking for wraparound porches and other 19th-century flourishes will be disappointed. But there is charm to Radburn, created in 1928 as \u201ca town for the motor age.\u201d The community\u2019s 680 homes, most single-family, are set amid cul-de-sacs, pedestrian pathways, parkland and gardens. The association fees Radburn homeowners pay on top of municipal, county and school taxes \u2014 $2,000 a year is a typical assessment \u2014 afford them the use of tennis courts, two swimming pools and summer recreation programs for children. But to maintain Radburn\u2019s ambience, homeowners must abide by architectural rules that include restrictions on things like fence heights (not to exceed 36 inches).\u201cHomes in Radburn are definitely on the quainter side and not for everybody,\u201d Ms. Greenfield Estersohn said. \u201cThose who want a large house or a large, private yard won\u2019t find it in Radburn, but will find it elsewhere in Fair Lawn.\u201dWith single-family home prices starting in the $300,000s, Fair Lawn is affordable for many first-time buyers and young families, said Zohar Zamir, founder of the Zamir Group, a local real estate agency. \u201cThe sweet spot is $450,000 to $600,000,\u201d Mr. Zamir said. \u201cIn that range, you can get an updated split or Cape with three or four bedrooms.\u201d (The units at Crossings at Radburn start in the mid-$500,000s.)On Dec. 19, the listing service\u2019s website showed 71 homes for sale, from a two-bedroom cooperative apartment listed for $189,900 to a newly built, five-bedroom, four-bathroom colonial for $1.195 million. Near the median price was a three-bedroom, two-bathroom brick Cape Cod on Tunbridge Road listed for $429,900, with annual property taxes of $7,977.Public school enrollment stands at 5,200 and is projected to rise by some 100 students a year in the near future. To address crowding, voters recently approved a $25 million middle-school expansion and renovation that will shift fifth-graders from the six elementary schools to the two middle schools, which currently serve grades six through eight. The realignment is planned for 2020-21, said Nick Norcia, the schools superintendent.\u201cThe fact the referendum passed overwhelmingly shows how much the residents of Fair Lawn value education,\u201d Mr. Norcia said.Average SAT scores in 2016-17 were 578 in reading and writing and 581 in math, versus 551 and 552 statewide. From the class of 2017, 78 percent went on to four-year colleges, compared with 70.5 percent statewide.Fair Lawn\u2019s two rail stations, Radburn and Broadway, are on New Jersey Transit\u2019s Bergen County Line. Traveling to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan takes about 50 minutes, including the transfer at Secaucus. The fare is $7.75 one-way or $270 monthly.New Jersey Transit buses reach the Port Authority terminal in 40 minutes to an hour; the fare is $6 one-way or $167 monthly.The Dutch farming community took its name from Fair Lawn, the hilltop house David DePeyster Acker built in the 1860s, which had a broad, sheep-grazed lawn bordered by a semicircular carriage drive. The railroad appropriated the name for its station, and residents created the borough of Fair Lawn in 1924, after breaking off from the Saddle River township.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a street with several businesses.

{"Headline": "Google Hearing to Preview Democrats\u2019 Strategy on Big Tech", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats and Google executives worked arm in arm for years, particularly during the Obama administration. But when Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, testifies before Congress on Tuesday, some of the toughest questioning is likely to come from Democrats.The hearing will provide an early glimpse of how Democrats plan to approach Silicon Valley giants in the coming year as they assume control of the House of Representatives. And the testimony from Mr. Pichai, who is appearing before lawmakers after initially resisting, may provide clues about how he and the company will approach them.Democratic lawmakers, angry about Russian misinformation online during the 2016 campaign and concerned about the expanding influence of tech\u2019s biggest companies, are expected to target the industry in the next Congress. Some have already raised concerns about potential antitrust and privacy violations, showing more willingness than Republicans to regulate an industry viewed as an engine of economic growth.Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, have warned that Amazon and other tech giants aren\u2019t paying fair wages. Two other Democrats, Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have called for privacy and online ad legislation, saying big tech companies can\u2019t be trusted to regulate themselves.Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cWe need to restore competition and protect our rights online.\u201d He added: \u201cThe promise of an open internet is fundamentally threatened by the ability of a few powerful gatekeepers to bully competitors, cripple innovation and exploit consumers. This must be a top priority going forward.\u201dThe concerns are aimed broadly across the tech industry. On Tuesday, however, they will focus on Google, as Mr. Pichai will be alone in testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.Republicans have accused Google, Twitter and Facebook of secretly placing conservative voices lower in news feed and search rankings. President Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, have joined the chorus of critics, saying that the liberal views of Silicon Valley leaders and employees have led them to program their services to limit conservative voices.\u201cRecent reports suggest Google might not be wielding its vast power impartially,\u201d said the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, who called on Mr. Pichai to meet with members during his September visit. \u201cIts business practices may have been affected by political bias.\u201dSome Democrats warned that Republicans could focus too much on the accusations of anti-conservative bias, arguing that it would distract from more pressing issues like misinformation and the handling of user data.\u201cThe public has voiced grave concerns about privacy, discrimination, lack of diversity and incivility online,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cUnfortunately, House Republicans are instead choosing to use their final days in the majority to peddle conspiracy theories about conservative bias.\u201dThe prospect of legislation to rein in tech remains slim, because Republicans still control the Senate and have shown no signs of wanting to add regulations. But the harsh criticism from Democrats has put the companies in a defensive crouch.\u201cThe internet companies\u2019 blue wall of protection in Washington seems to be crumbling,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen & Company. \u201cDemocrats now see political gain in taking on tech.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Pichai participated in a White House business round table that included Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella; Oracle\u2019s co-chief executive Safra Catz; Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf; and others.While Mr. Trump made a brief appearance, his daughter and special adviser, Ivanka Trump, represented the White House. She was joined by some administration tech advisers. The topics of discussion included artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation 5G wireless networks.Democratic and Republican lawmakers are also expected to press him on Google\u2019s possible plans for re-entering China, a market the company left in 2010 over concerns about censorship and government hacking.Mr. Pichai has kept a relatively low profile since becoming Google\u2019s chief in 2015. A soft-spoken engineer who grew up in Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company and is seen as more at home dealing with products and technology than with policy and politics. But like other technology chief executives facing questions about the societal impact of their products and the policies of their companies, Mr. Pichai is being forced to take a more active role in Washington.Mr. Pichai\u2019s political donations also mirror Google\u2019s attempts to foster better relationships with Republicans. After donating mostly to Democratic candidates since 2008, Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in Silicon Valley, adopted a more bipartisan approach to his donations. In 2017, he donated nearly $34,000 to both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018White Christmas\u2019 (1954) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.It was twelve years ago that Bing Crosby was in a place and a film called \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d wherein he sang a little number tagged \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d written\u2014as was all the music in that picture\u2014by Irving Berlin. The occasion was happily historic, for a reason we scarcely need recall: \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d and Mr. Crosby became like \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and Kate Smith\u2014so much so, indeed, that the notion of starring Mr. Crosby in a film that would have the title \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d was broached as long as six years ago.Various obstructions beset it, but the purpose was ultimately achieved. \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d with Mr. Crosby, opened yesterday at the Music Hall.What\u2019s more, it is in Technicolor and VistaVision, which is Paramount\u2019s new wide-screen device, and it has Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen in addition to its focal star. A new batch of Irving Berlin numbers comprises its musical score. Paramount, to put it simply, has done \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d up brown.But, oddly enough, the confection is not so tasty as one might suppose. The flavoring is largely in the line-up and not in the output of the cooks. Everyone works hard at the business of singing, dancing and cracking jokes, but the stuff that they work with is minor. It doesn\u2019t have the old inspiration and spark. For one thing, the credited scriptwriters\u2014Norman Krasna, Norman Panama and Melvin Frank\u2014have shown very little imagination in putting together what is sometimes called the \u201cbook.\u201dThey have hacked out a way of getting two teams of entertainers\u2014a pair of celebrated male hoofers and a singing sister act\u2014to a ski lodge in New England (reminiscent of the Holiday Inn) which happens to be run by the good old general of the outfit the fellows Were in during the war. And to show their appreciation of the good old general and the difficult circumstances he appears to be in, they provide free entertainment and call in a big rally of comrades for the Christmas holidays.It is a routine accumulation of standard romance and sentiment, blessed by a few funny set-ups that are usually grabbed with most effect by Mr. Kaye.And the music of Mr. Berlir is a good bit less than inspired Outside of the old \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d which is sung at the beginning and the end, there are only a couple of numbers that have a measure of charm. One of these is \u201cCount Your Blessings,\u201d a song of reassurance that Mr. Crosby and Miss Clooney chant, and another is \u201cThe Best Things Happen While You\u2019re Dancing,\u201d which Mr. Kaye sings and to which he and Vera-Ellen cavort. Three numbers are given over to the admiration of generals and Army life, which seems not alone an extravagance but a reckless audacity.Even the sweetness of Dean Jagger as the old general does not justify the expense. Someone\u2019s nostalgia for the war years and the U. S. O. tours has taken the show awry. Fortunately, the use of VistaVision, which is another process of projecting on a wide, flat screen, has made it possible to endow \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d with a fine pictorial quality. The colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring\u2014or very little\u2014such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn\u2019t hit the eardrums and the funnybone with equal force.Running time: 127 minutes.Advertisement"}

Or sipped coffee from Irving Farm while they sat under a fig tree in a mini-park within the concourse. There is both a play area for children and an F.A.O.

Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.The opening titles for Shane Black\u2019s \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d \u2014 based not on Pauline Kael\u2019s collection of essays, but rather, at least in part, on a novel by Brett Halliday \u2014 evoke a bygone age of high pop style. The visuals are a loving tribute to the great graphic designer Saul Bass, while the jazzy sounds of John Ottman\u2019s score summon up the easy heat of Henry Mancini in his prime. The movie itself, however, evokes a rather different era. I could say that its syncopated editing, its switchback chronology, its fourth-wall-breaking voice-over narration and its hectic mixture of humor and violence represent a fresh and exciting twist on sturdy noir conventions. In fact, I would say just that \u2014 if it were 1995 and I were the kind of person whose mind had just been blown by the cinematic possibilities revealed in \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201dNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. I like \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d just fine, and I don\u2019t think \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d is an altogether bad movie. It\u2019s just a movie with no particular reason for existing, a flashy, trifling throwaway whose surface cleverness masks a self-infatuated credulity. Mr. Black, a longtime screenwriter (most famously of \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d) and first-time director, shows a lot of slick, dexterous self-confidence. As this shaggy-dog crime story hums along, you can almost convince yourself that something interesting is going on. And, in a way, something is, in that the film, as empty stylistic exercises sometimes do, offers its cast the chance to do some inspired, fast-paced riffing.Robert Downey Jr. plays Harry Lockhart, a small-time New York thief who winds up, via a deliciously improbable circumstance, in Los Angeles. Preparing for a screen test, he falls under the tutelage of Perry van Shrike, played by Val Kilmer, a private detective widely known as Gay Perry because of his sexual preference (which is apparently something of a novelty in Southern California). The two of them engage in a lot of pixilated, hard-boiled banter, hurling one-liners, non sequiturs and riddles at each other with impressive speed and agility. Though both are hyperarticulate, Perry is clearly smarter. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019ll find in the dictionary next to the word idiot?\u201d he asks Harry. \u201cMy picture?\u201d \u201cNo. The definition of the word idiot, which is what you are.\u201dTouch\u00e9! Before long, this verbal sparring match becomes a three-way tag-team scrimmage, as Harry meets Harmony, a girl he knew back home in Indiana who has come west to escape some family ugliness. Harmony is played by Michelle Monaghan, who holds her own nicely in fairly intense company. You may find yourself wondering, all the same, about Harmony\u2019s beauty secrets, since while she and Harry are meant to be around the same age, the more-than-10-year gap between Ms. Monaghan and Mr. Downey is glaringly evident.But why trouble yourself with logic and consistency? Mr. Black clearly hasn\u2019t. A plot that is meant to be fiendishly twisty and elaborate just feels overly busy. Harmony is a devotee of a pulp private eye named Jonny Gossamer, and the skein of criminality and double-dealing that she, Perry and Harry unravel is meant to resemble one of the novels in which Gossamer appears. The best detective fiction, of course, gestures toward the seamy realities of power, lust and greed that lie underneath the hectic surface. \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang,\u201d for all its atmospheric talk, has no such subtext, and its glib silliness is never more apparent than when it tries for strong emotions. A subplot involving the sexual abuse of a young child is not particularly upsetting, just crude and contrived.For the most part, though, the picture is content to be sleek, smooth and contrived. Mr. Black can\u2019t quite manage the mixture of mayhem and humor he is attempting, but at least he hops adroitly from one frantic scene to the next. In the end, it\u2019s more exhausting than thrilling. At one point, a villainous smoothie played by Corbin Bernsen looks pityingly at Harry, who has just been subjected to painful torture, and says, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t judge Los Angeles solely based on your experience here tonight.\u201d That would be an apt tag line for this movie\u2019s lobby posters.\u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has lots of obscenity, nudity and graphic violence. Running time: 103 minutes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Problem With Banning Pornography on Tumblr", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision has taken away an essential platform for some women and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Ms. Powell is the former head of communications for Google.While we can get hung up on debating what kind of content should or shouldn\u2019t be allowed on a particular platform, none of that alters an equally important but less-visible problem: When tech companies tackle large-scale problems with large-scale solutions, underrepresented groups are often further marginalized as a result. This is not the first time a social media or blog platform has banned adult content. Twitter, Facebook, and many other platforms all prohibit pornography. But in the United States, we seem to ignore public debate about the censorship of sex and the human body, reflecting the American tendency to get more offended by the sight of a female-presenting nipple than by guns, hate speech or violence.While all efforts must be made to eradicate illegal content on Tumblr, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that underrepresented groups have carved out safe spaces on the platform. Tumblr has thrived in part thanks to its unique identity as a place for adult content. Young women dominate the platform, and many turn to it as a place to find more empowering, female-centric takes on pornography and the female body. On Tumblr, one could find pages dedicated to celebrating bodies of all types, could browse sophisticated fetish images curated from a female perspective, and could find GIFs and videos that \u2014 unlike most mainstream pornography sites \u2014 depict female pleasure.Similarly, many in the L.G.B.T.Q. community have said the adult content on Tumblr provided a space to connect with those with similar interests and to explore sexuality without judgment.The problem isn\u2019t just about agreeing on what kind of content to allow on a platform, or whether adult content is a positive or negative force in society. It\u2019s also that tech companies like Tumblr make statements about wanting to be a positive place for diverse communities, all the while not truly understanding these communities and allowing their algorithms to target their adult content.To be fair, it is a hard nut to crack. Platforms with millions of users need algorithmic solutions to solve issues like content regulation at scale. The problem is, machines are not yet very good at nuance. Can Tumblr\u2019s artificial intelligence tell the difference between a curated page of visual erotica and violent sexual imagery the same way a trained human could? Probably not. There are many examples of Tumblr\u2019s A.I. making mistakes, in which non-explicit fan art, pictures of a person\u2019s hands, a cartoon image of two men kissing and a vigorous, sweaty game of Ping-Pong set off the platform\u2019s A.I. filters. Tumblr has said there will be an appeals process staffed by real live humans, but the human part seems like an afterthought, as it so often does with tech companies.While there is no perfect solution, there are many steps Tumblr could take if it truly wanted to support these communities. A more nuanced policy could be developed and then implemented through greater short-term investment in more human moderation and long-term investment in A.I. Without the ability to judge nuance at scale and to distinguish between empowering versus damaging content, Tumblr has adopted a policy that destroys communities who are among its greatest fans. It is a lesson all tech companies should keep in mind when they are debating policy changes: When you cast a wide net, you may sacrifice a group you never intended to hurt. Advertisement"}

We are the buyers, users and supporters of the products and services that help Big Tech thrive.So what do we do at this point to become more ethical consumers?\u201cI think this is an incredibly powerful question to ask,\u201d said Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that focuses on technology\u2019s impact on families. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important moment where consumer behavior can have a transformational impact.\u201dI talked to a broad range of people \u2014 ethicists, activists, environmentalists and others \u2014 about how to become a more empowered, socially responsible tech consumer. Here\u2019s what they agreed on.First and foremost, when tech does you wrong, one of the most powerful ways to protest is to take your business elsewhere and ask your friends and family to go along.Even so, damage to a brand may have plenty of repercussions because it motivates the company to change its behavior, Mr. Steyer said. Both Uber and Facebook, facing enormous pressure, have modified some of their practices and committed to improvements.\u201cSometimes shame is one of the most important arrows in your quiver,\u201d Mr. Steyer said. We can also take the path less traveled \u2014 that is, take our data and money to products made by more ethical vendors.Pulling the plug on Facebook is a hassle, but not impossible. Taking on the challenge of finding alternatives is an example of how people can give up some convenience in exchange for individual empowerment, said Shahid Buttar, a director of grass-roots advocacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit.The same approach can be applied to Google if you take issue with its behavior. While Google offers a comprehensive suite of web services, including news, email and maps, you could switch to an alternative for each of those products.A rush shipment could involve multiple vehicles and various facilities before it gets to your door. So pause and ask yourself if you actually need that smartphone or scented candle tomorrow. If you can wait, choose no-rush delivery, which could take about a week.\u201cOne of the things you can do to be more responsible is to take greater ownership of your stuff,\u201d Mr. Lai said.The Cambridge Analytica scandal this year illustrates our responsibility to think about others, not just ourselves, when using technology.In other words, if people had disabled Apps Others Use, Cambridge Analytica most likely couldn\u2019t have collected the data of their friends. More important, if those who took the quiz were aware of the potential of sharing information about their friends, they might have opted not to participate.But how can you be more conscious of your actions when technology is so confusing in the first place?The bottom line is that you are not alone. And if a company makes it too difficult for you and your friends to stay safe while staying connected, you can leave.\u201cIf you\u2019re really uncomfortable with the values of a company, don\u2019t use their product,\u201d Mr. Steyer said.

They came up with a device that slips inside a bag, backpack or suitcase and keeps track of items using radio-frequency identification technology. If a wallet is not returned to the bag, the device sends a cellphone alert. If the cellphone is missing, the device beeps.The school\u2019s graduates and researchers have parlayed their ideas, skills and ambition into more than 50 start-up companies that have raised a total of $60 million from investors and created about 200 jobs. One start-up, Nanit, sells a smart baby monitor online and in stores, while three others have been acquired by companies, including one by Adobe.So far, 534 of the school\u2019s graduates \u2014 of whom, more than 60 percent remain in the city \u2014 have been hired by Google, Bloomberg, Microsoft and other technology companies.\u201cIt really sends a message to the broader tech industry and also the whole world that New York City is serious about tech,\u201d said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech: NYC, a nonprofit industry group.Citywide, the technology industry employs more than 320,000 people, according to Tech: NYC. Many work in what Ms. Samuels calls an expanding \u201cecosystem\u201d of more than 7,000 small start-up companies. New York\u2019s ascendance as a technology hub was reaffirmed by Google\u2019s announcement on Monday that it would create a $1 billion campus in the West Village that would allow the company to double the size of its 7,000 employee work force in the city.Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, won $100 million and a spot on Roosevelt Island.\u201cThey\u2019re a very prestigious institution that is free-riding off the backs of a working population to function in an environment that they really are not adequately paying for,\u201d said Joyce Short, a writer and longtime resident.All the money and attention showered on Cornell Tech has, at times, overshadowed other schools. New York University, which also took part in the 2010 competition, is creating a $380-million tech hub for emerging media, technology and the arts in the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority. Across the street, its Tandon School of Engineering runs several incubators for start-ups.Josh Hartmann, a former chief technology officer for Travelocity and Amplify who now teaches at Cornell Tech, said technology-focused schools are an integral part of what he called a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d that drives the city\u2019s tech industry. The schools attract faculty members and support research, both of which draw more students. The students increase and diversify the talent pool, which in turn brings more companies.On a recent evening, students were huddled together in \u201cthe collaboratory\u201d \u2014 Cornell Tech\u2019s version of a library with tables and smart boards. Downstairs, the school\u2019s \u201cstudio_code:\u201d displayed seven principles for innovation, including \u201cBuild Things That Matter\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Jerk.\u201dEvery student is assigned to a team that works with more than 50 companies, including Amazon and Samsung, on real-life problems that begin with, \u201cHow might we \u2026\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said that part of the challenge is learning to work together across different backgrounds, interests and programs.In the spring, students team up on their own to develop start-ups and then present them to parents, technology leaders and investors. Last May, four teams were chosen from dozens of entrants. Each team received a $100,000 award, including office space, to pursue its start-up.Ms. Le Cam, 24, who studied computer science, wrote the app for the device, which keeps track of every item marked by a chip-implanted sticker. The prototype started out shaped like an egg, but testers gave that a thumbs down because it would not fit in small bags. It was flattened, and took on a pocket shape.But Cornell Tech\u2019s entrepreneurial culture is contagious, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in an environment where everyone is thinking about it,\u201d Ms. Moldavskaya said.The school\u2019s operating budget is $50 million annually and is covered partly through student tuition, which starts at $54,584 a year and increases to $102,652 for a master\u2019s in business administration. The school has also raised $815 million in private donations, including $350 million from Atlantic Philanthropies, whose founder is a Cornell graduate, and $100 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies.Jay Jacobson, 82, a retired lawyer who lives on Roosevelt Island, recently worked with Cornell Tech students to address a daily problem for older people: how to carry a shopping bag when holding onto a walker? They came up with a 3-D-printed hinge to attach to a walker.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m part of their community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a delight to have them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the Downtown Brooklyn building where New York University\u2019s new tech hub is located. The building is the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority. It is not the former headquarters of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, of which New York City Transit is a subsidiary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Giant Step for a Chess-Playing Machine", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayThe stunning success of AlphaZero, a deep-learning algorithm, heralds a new age of insight \u2014 one that, for humans, may not last long.In early December, researchers at DeepMind, the artificial-intelligence company owned by Google\u2019s parent corporation, Alphabet Inc., filed a dispatch from the frontiers of chess.Computer chess has come a long way over the past twenty years. In 1997, I.B.M.\u2019s chess-playing program, Deep Blue, managed to beat the reigning human world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. In retrospect, there was little mystery in this achievement. Deep Blue could evaluate 200 million positions per second. It never got tired, never blundered in a calculation and never forgot what it had been thinking a moment earlier.These principles, which have been refined over decades of human grandmaster experience, are programmed into the engines as complex evaluation functions that indicate what to seek in a position and what to avoid: how much to value king safety, piece activity, pawn structure, control of the center, and more, and how to balance the trade-offs among them. Today\u2019s chess engines, innately oblivious to these principles, come across as brutes: tremendously fast and strong, but utterly lacking insight.Yet this peculiar retreat was venomous: No matter how Stockfish replied, it was doomed. It was almost as if AlphaZero was waiting for Stockfish to realize, after billions of brutish calculations, how hopeless its position truly was, so that the beast could relax and expire peacefully, like a vanquished bull before a matador. Grandmasters had never seen anything like it. AlphaZero had the finesse of a virtuoso and the power of a machine. It was humankind\u2019s first glimpse of an awesome new kind of intelligence.When AlphaZero was first unveiled, some observers complained that Stockfish had been lobotomized by not giving it access to its book of memorized openings. This time around, even with its book, it got crushed again. And when AlphaZero handicapped itself by giving Stockfish ten times more time to think, it still destroyed the brute.The question now is whether machine learning can help humans discover similar truths about the things we really care about: the great unsolved problems of science and medicine, such as cancer and consciousness; the riddles of the immune system, the mysteries of the genome.What is frustrating about machine learning, however, is that the algorithms can\u2019t articulate what they\u2019re thinking. We don\u2019t know why they work, so we don\u2019t know if they can be trusted. AlphaZero gives every appearance of having discovered some important principles about chess, but it can\u2019t share that understanding with us. Not yet, at least. As human beings, we want more than answers. We want insight. This is going to be a source of tension in our interactions with computers from now on.Although the four-color theorem was proved in 1977 with the help of a computer, no human could check all the steps in the argument. Since then, the proof has been validated and simplified, but there are still parts of it that entail brute-force computation, of the kind employed by AlphaZero\u2019s chess-playing computer ancestors. This development annoyed many mathematicians. They didn\u2019t need to be reassured that the four-color theorem was true; they already believed it. They wanted to understand why it was true, and this proof didn\u2019t help.But envisage a day, perhaps in the not too distant future, when AlphaZero has evolved into a more general problem-solving algorithm; call it AlphaInfinity. Like its ancestor, it would have supreme insight: it could come up with beautiful proofs, as elegant as the chess games that AlphaZero played against Stockfish. And each proof would reveal why a theorem was true; AlphaInfinity wouldn\u2019t merely bludgeon you into accepting it with some ugly, difficult argument.For human mathematicians and scientists, this day would mark the dawn of a new era of insight. But it may not last. As machines become ever faster, and humans stay put with their neurons running at sluggish millisecond time scales, another day will follow when we can no longer keep up. The dawn of human insight may quickly turn to dusk.Suppose that deeper patterns exist to be discovered \u2014 in the ways genes are regulated or cancer progresses; in the orchestration of the immune system; in the dance of subatomic particles. And suppose that these patterns can be predicted, but only by an intelligence far superior to ours. If AlphaInfinity could identify and understand them, it would seem to us like an oracle.We would sit at its feet and listen intently. We would not understand why the oracle was always right, but we could check its calculations and predictions against experiments and observations, and confirm its revelations. Science, that signal human endeavor, would reduce our role to that of spectators, gaping in wonder and confusion.Maybe eventually our lack of insight would no longer bother us. After all, AlphaInfinity could cure all our diseases, solve all our scientific problems and make all our other intellectual trains run on time. We did pretty well without much insight for the first 300,000 years or so of our existence as Homo sapiens.

And Twitter gave only scattered details about the Russian-controlled accounts that spread propaganda there.In the reports, Google, Twitter and Facebook (which also owns Instagram) were described by researchers as having \u201cevaded\u201d and \u201cmisrepresented\u201d themselves and the extent of Russian activity on their sites. The companies were also criticized for not turning over complete sets of data about Russian manipulation to the Senate.The data they did provide \u201clacked core components that would have provided a fuller and more actionable picture,\u201d said one of the reports, which was written by New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company, along with researchers at Columbia University and Canfield Research. The report added: \u201cRegrettably, it appears that the platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to Congress.\u201d\u201cEveryone wants to qualify the impact of the 2016 presidential election. They want to understand, did it swing the election?\u201d she said. \u201cNone of the data sets we were given gives us that answer.\u201dThe reports were especially critical of Google, whose YouTube site hosted 1,100 videos made by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency. The reports said Google had not only provided incomplete information about these videos, but one report accused Kent Walker, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, of giving misleading testimony to Congress this year about whether those videos were targeted at a particular audience.When compared with Facebook and Twitter, \u201cGoogle\u2019s data contribution was by far the most limited in context and least comprehensive of the three,\u201d said one of the reports, by researchers at Oxford University and Graphika.Of the information that the companies did hand over, some came in formats that were difficult to analyze. Researchers said that in many cases, information was provided in duplicate and triplicate, or was incomplete or corrupted. That meant it took months just to catalog and clean up before it could be studied.In a statement, Nu Wexler, a Google spokesman, said, \u201cWe conducted an in-depth investigation across multiple product areas, and provided a detailed and thorough report to investigators.\u201d He added that neither YouTube nor Google allowed people to target an audience by race.Twitter said it was committed to transparency and had improved its work with researchers. \u201cOur singular focus is to improve the health of the public conversation on our platform,\u201d said Katie Rosborough, a spokeswoman.A spokesman for Facebook, Matt Steinfeld, said it \u201cprovided thousands of ads and pieces of content to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for review and shared information with the public about what we found.\u201dOn Monday in Washington, lawmakers lashed out at the tech companies for hiding the ball.\u201cFor many months we urged the social media companies to undertake such a crosscutting analysis without success, even as we made as much of their data as public as possible,\u201d said Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California. He said the companies\u2019 reluctance to look deeply at Russian interference \u201cmade our task far more difficult than it should have been.\u201dSenator Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, \u201cThese reports are proof positive that one of the most important things we can do is increase information-sharing between the social media companies who can identify disinformation campaigns and the third-party experts who can analyze them.\u201dSocial media companies have been under fire for helping spread Russian disinformation. Facebook, Google and Twitter all initially played down or denied the Russian activity on their platforms. But over time, it became clear that Russia had used them to try to influence American voters.All three companies have since acknowledged that the scope of Russian interference was broader than what they originally disclosed.The Senate Intelligence Committee first asked the companies to provide data on Russian manipulation in October 2017. In the year that followed, the committee repeated the request several times. Six months ago, after accumulating dribs and drabs of data from the tech companies, the committee gave the material to the independent researchers.The reports noted how the incomplete information had caused problems. Because Google did not provide any data on how many times Russian-created videos were watched or shared on YouTube, researchers were forced to search for the videos through alternative websites to re-create how widely the propaganda had been shared.Google\u2019s data from 2014 to 2018 was \u201cremarkably scarce,\u201d the report from researchers at Oxford and Graphika said.The top Facebook and Instagram accounts made by the Internet Research Agency ultimately gained hundreds of thousands of followers and generated millions of interactions. One Instagram account, @blackstagram_, published posts that were regularly liked by more than 10,000 people by 2017.Twitter provided the most extensive data, the researchers said, covering 2009 through 2018. That included account names and information that is not visible to other users, such as the internet protocol addresses, login dates and locations for 3,841 accounts, which produced more than eight million tweets. Four of the five most popular Russian-made Twitter accounts posted messages targeting African-Americans.\u201cTwitter provided a vast corpus of detailed account information on the Twitter accounts the company knew were managed by I.R.A. staff,\u201d the researchers wrote.Yet the Twitter data was also disorganized. The researchers said the company made it difficult for them to collect their own data through its site, and repeatedly failed to work with them to track Russian influence operations over the last two years.Advertisement"}

Ross Douthat interviews special guest Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution about the latest revelations from Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation (Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone, oh my!).Then, the columnists debate Mueller\u2019s findings so far\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and what should be done about them. Ross wonders if we\u2019ll ever see definitive proof of explicit collusion between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin. Michelle Goldberg argues that a Trump-friendly media machine would overlook a damning Mueller report. And David Leonhardt thinks there\u2019s a chance that Mueller\u2019s findings could convince enough Republican lawmakers to abandon Trump, opening the door to impeachment.Background Reading:I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.This week\u2019s show is produced by Alex Laughlin for Transmitter Media, with help from Caitlin Pierce.

{"Headline": "These 5 Numbers Explain Why the French Are in the Streets", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it\u2019s not apparent that this single concession can clear the streets.The Yellow Vest movement \u2014 whose followers wear or display high-visibility vests used in emergencies \u2014 has morphed into a collective outcry over deeper problems that have plagued France for years: declining living standards and eroding purchasing power. Both of which have worsened in the aftermath of Europe\u2019s long-running financial crisis.Here are some numbers that explain why France has erupted.Many of the Yellow Vest demonstrators are protesting how difficult it is to pay rent, feed their families and simply scrape by as living costs \u2014 most notably fuel prices \u2014 keep rising while their household incomes barely budge.It wasn\u2019t always this way.Living standards and wages rose in France after World War II during a 30-year growth stretch known as \u201cLes Trente Glorieuses.\u201d Pay gains for low- and middle-income earners continued through the early 1980s, thanks to labor union collective bargaining agreements.The rich got richer, as top earners saw income gains of around 3 percent a year. Increasingly generous executive pay for very high earners has helped tip the scale.France is the third biggest economy in Europe after Britain and Germany, and the world\u2019s sixth largest before adjusting for inflation. Visitors to Paris can come away with the impression that the glitz of the French capital means the rest of the nation is just as well off.The quality of the recovery has been uneven. Large numbers of permanent jobs were wiped out, especially in rural and former industrial areas. And many of the new jobs being created are precarious temporary contracts.The growth slowdown makes it harder to resolve another French problem: the large numbers of people out of work.Unemployment in France has been stuck between 9 percent and 11 percent since 2009, when the debt crisis hit Europe. Joblessness has drifted back down to 9.1 percent today from 10.1 percent when Mr. Macron was elected. But it is still more than double the level in Germany.Mr. Macron promised to lower unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022, and has acknowledged that a failure to do so could fan the flames of populism.But to achieve that, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory, an independent research group.Mr. Macron has tried to re-energize the French economy.As part of his plan to stimulate the economy, Mr. Macron cut taxes for France\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers during his first year in office, including by creating a flat tax for capital income.But the centerpiece of the tax package, and the one that has drawn the most ire from protesters, did away with a wealth tax that applied to many assets of France\u2019s richest households, replacing it with one that applied only to their real estate holdings.That lowered by \u20ac3.2 billion, or $3.6 billion, the amount of revenue the state received this year.Even before the Yellow Vests took to the streets, Mr. Macron realized that support was withering, and his government tried to pivot toward those left behind in the previous round of tax cuts.While polls show that the Yellow Vests have the backing of three-quarters of the population, questions have swirled about how much pain the protesters are really experiencing \u2014 or how much of the outpouring can be chalked up to a centuries-old culture of demonstrating against change.France protects citizens with one of the most generous social safety nets in the world, with over one-third of its economic output spent on welfare protection, more than any other country in Europe.In 2016, France spent around \u20ac715 billion on health care, family benefits and unemployment, among other support.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JD.com Chief Richard Liu Will Not Be Charged With Sexual Assault", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe county attorney\u2019s office said it did not find enough evidence to pursue a case against Mr. Liu, a 45-year-old internet tycoon who was arrested in the early morning of Sept. 1 but released within hours and allowed to return to China.The decision could bring Mr. Liu, who founded and leads JD.com, back to a more visible role at his e-commerce behemoth. JD.com\u2019s stock has slumped since the accusations were revealed, and Mr. Liu, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, has skipped several public engagements.\u201cAs is the case in too many sexual assault incidents, it was a complicated situation,\u201d Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, said in a statement. \u201cIt is also similar to other sexual assault cases with the suspect maintaining the sex was consensual.\u201dJD.com said in a statement that it was pleased with the decision. Jill Brisbois, Mr. Liu\u2019s lawyer, reiterated in a statement her \u201cstrong belief from the very beginning that my client is innocent,\u201d adding that \u201cMr. Liu\u2019s reputation has been damaged like anyone falsely accused of a crime\u201d because of \u201cmisinformation and speculation that has been widely circulated.\u201dWil Florin, a lawyer for the woman, said he was considering bringing a civil case, adding that prosecutors had made their decision having never met or spoken with his client. Chuck Laszewski, a spokesman for the county attorney\u2019s office, declined to comment on Mr. Florin\u2019s claim.Also present that evening was a 21-year-old woman, a Chinese student who was volunteering for the doctoral program. As she later told police, she had been invited to the dinner by another Chinese executive in the program, who asked her to sit next to Mr. Liu.She told police that she got into a car with Mr. Liu after the dinner, and he began to touch her without her consent. She asked to be taken back to her apartment, where he forced himself upon her, despite her pleas, she told police.But Ms. Brisbois, in an email, said the woman was being \u201cflirtatious\u201d in the car and agreed to the contact with Mr. Liu. Ms. Brisbois said that the woman invited Mr. Liu into her apartment building and that \u201cwhat happened in the room was entirely consensual.\u201d\u201cThe woman was an active and willing participant and at no time did she indicate in any way that she did not consent,\u201d Ms. Brisbois said. The following day, the woman sent text messages to friends saying that Mr. Liu had raped her.Police were called to the apartment by a friend and fellow student, according to the county attorney\u2019s office.Ms. Brisbois said she spoke with the woman after Mr. Liu\u2019s release, at the woman\u2019s request. Over several phone calls and texts, the woman \u201cmade repeated demands for money, and threatened to make her allegations public and to sue Richard if her demands were not met,\u201d Ms. Brisbois said.Mr. Florin, the woman\u2019s lawyer, said that a lawyer for Mr. Liu initiated contact with the woman about a settlement. Mr. Florin added that many of Ms. Brisbois\u2019 descriptions of events are \u201cdirectly contradicted by eyewitness testimony.\u201dThe Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s sex crimes unit conducted a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d into the case, the county attorney\u2019s office said, followed by a \u201cmeticulous review\u201d by four sexual assault prosecutors, a group of three men and one woman. They determined that \u201cthere were profound evidentiary problems which would have made it highly unlikely that any criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201dInvestigators reviewed surveillance video, text messages and witness statements. Among the evidence was footage from a body camera worn by an officer that recorded conversations between Mr. Liu and the woman at her apartment after police arrived.The county attorney\u2019s office declined to provide more detail, saying prosecutors \u201cdo not want to re-victimize the young woman.\u201dIn his statement on social media, Mr. Liu apologized to his wife, Zhang Zetian, and said he felt \u201cdeep regret and remorse.\u201d\u201cI will continue to try in every possible way to repair the impact on my family and to fulfill my responsibility as a husband,\u201d he said.JD.com is a proud emblem of China\u2019s rising consumer class, and a major partner to global brands, like Adidas and Samsung, that use the platform. Walmart, Google and the Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent are all JD.com shareholders. And Mr. Liu is a celebrity tycoon whose rise from humble means to internet riches is the subject of many admiring books and television programs.The company\u2019s shares have lost around 60 percent of their value since early this year as it grappled with the accusations against Mr. Liu and slowing economic growth in China.The rape allegation against Mr. Liu has weighed on JD.com in part because he has never indicated who might succeed him as chief executive. Mr. Liu controls nearly 80 percent of shareholder votes at the company, thanks to a special class of stock with 20 times the voting power of regular shares.That appears to be changing, a little. In a November conference call, Mr. Liu told analysts that he would focus more on strategy and new businesses at JD.com in the future, leaving more of the management of mature businesses to subordinates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "George Bush and the Right", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.At lunch last week, a political strategist told me that she believes politicians spend their careers rerunning their first campaigns. No matter the issues, no matter the opponent, they can never quite shake that first playbook.During that race, Mr. Bush, a patrician New Englander nicknamed \u201cPoppy,\u201d refashioned himself into a kind of Barry Goldwater-lite, coming out against the Civil Rights Act, opposing the Nuclear Test Ban treaty and denouncing the United Nations, where he\u2019d serve as ambassador seven years later.Mr. Bush came to regret that pivot. After he lost the race, he told his minister: \u201cI took some of the far-right positions to get elected. I hope I never do it again.\u201dTwo years later, Mr. Bush ran for Congress as more of a centrist Republican. He won, flipping a Houston-area congressional seat that had been held by Democrats for more than 80 years.But he would never outrun the tensions of that first Senate race. That struggle \u2014 between his moderate, country club roots and a Republican Party shifting right \u2014 would come to define Mr. Bush\u2019s political life.In the broadest terms, Mr. Bush\u2019s political story mirrors that of the G.O.P. over his lifetime: a long-running civil war between moderates and conservatives that resulted in the all-but-extinction of the Rockefeller Republican and the rise of Donald J. Trump.Again and again, throughout his political career, Mr. Bush would cut right to stay on track with his party.Even his famous 1988 convention speech pledge \u2014 \u201cread my lips: no new taxes\u201d \u2014 was designed to boost enthusiasm for his presidential candidacy among the party\u2019s conservative wing.But when Mr. Bush broke that promise two years later, conservatives never forgave him. The fallout contributed to his re-election loss in 1992. And now, more than a quarter century later, there\u2019s little question that the forces that once pulled Mr. Bush to the right have won the battle for the Republican Party.That\u2019s a shift Mr. Bush felt personally. After his son Jeb Bush lost the Republican nomination in 2015, the former president did not attend the national party convention.He told the author Mark K. Updegrove that he voted for Hillary Clinton.If Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 was when moderate Republicans lost their final battle, then the midterms may be remembered as their apocalyptic era, leaving them cowering in a bunker as once-loyal suburban voters cast ballots for Democrats.That Texas district Mr. Bush turned red all those decades ago? It elected Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a 43-year-old lawyer \u2014 and its first Democrat in over 50 years.____________________We can all reset our doomsday clocks for the Friday before Christmas.Staring down the threat of a partial government shutdown on Friday if they couldn\u2019t strike an elusive deal to pass a year-end spending bill, congressional leaders were nearing agreement on Monday to give themselves a two-week extension.The new drop-dead? Dec. 21.The official reason for the delay is so lawmakers may pause to pay respects to George Bush, the 41st president, who died on Friday, and whose coffin was to arrive at the Capitol Monday afternoon to lie in state in the Rotunda. Mr. Bush\u2019s funeral at the National Cathedral on Wednesday is expected to draw congressional leaders and rank-and-file members.But the truth is that Republican congressional leaders, facing a dilemma over the year-end package and without a clear plan to avert a shutdown, were grateful for an excuse to punt the question to another day.President Trump has demanded $5 billion for his border wall, an ask that Democrats have refused to entertain, saying they will agree to no more than $1.6 billion for border security funding \u2014 and no money for the concrete wall that Mr. Trump has long championed. A meeting he had been scheduled to host on Tuesday to kick off negotiations with Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leaders, was postponed in light of the events honoring Mr. Bush.The reprieve could end up being a setback for the president, whose leverage is likely to wane with the approach of Christmas Day. Demoralized and defeated Republican incumbents are not exactly champing at the bit to cast controversial votes on Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall \u2014 or anything else, for that matter \u2014 as their last official acts. (House leaders had to abruptly cancel votes Friday on a bill to extend tax cuts \u2014 tax cuts! \u2014 when they realized they would be short of the support they needed.)So spike your eggnog a little stronger for a shutdown endgame that could stretch almost all the way to Christmas._____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "How to Connect Young People to Europe? Let Them See It All by Train", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMuch has changed in the 46 years since Interrail pass was introduced, but the essence of what it offers \u2014 experiencing new cultures and meeting new people \u2014 has remained the same.The four 18-year-olds packed their bags and set off on a familiar rite of passage for European youths: an Interrail journey. But their coming-of-age adventure arrived not only at a pivotal moment in their lives, but also in the life of the European Union.All Londoners, with the uncertainty of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the bloc looming over their futures, the four teenagers took up the European Union on an offer to give 15,000 young people a free Interrail pass \u2014 covering a month of free travel on almost all slow trains across Europe, and discounted journeys on high-speed trains \u2014 in the hope of connecting them to the Continent.Having spent many summers touring Europe by Interrail as a young man, I followed along to see this generation\u2019s experience, and stayed in touch in the weeks after to follow up on their impressions.In late summer, I visited Alfie Clarke, who is now studying German and French at Birmingham University, as he packed his bags for the journey with his friends, Rakul Sri, Shari Vockrodt and Usman Merchant.All of the young men had just finished at Queen Elizabeth\u2019s School in Barnet, North London. Shari knew them through going to its sister school, Henrietta Barnett. \u2018\u2018I decided to go Interrailing because I wanted to see more countries and experience more cultures,\u2019\u2019 said Shari, who wants to be a doctor and is now studying at the University of Nottingham.That remains the essence of the experience, even if much has changed since the Interrail pass was first introduced in 1972.My own experience \u2014 in the days before the internet and cellphones \u2014 depended greatly on improvisation. I recall being nudged awake at dawn by the boot of a policeman outside the Venice rail station. Passports were checked at every border. Money was changed country to country. Paper maps were used until they tore at the creases.For this generation, money was changed only once, borders were crossed invisibly, and almost everything was booked online in advance.After embarking from central London, the group arrived at the Gare du Nord in Paris, where Alfie led the way through the streets using Google Maps.They stayed at an Airbnb atop five steep flights of worn stairs on Rue des Dames. The apartment\u2019s peeling paint was easily overlooked by the eager travelers. They walked to Pont d\u2019l\u00e9na and the Trocadero Gardens, and waited for the lights of the Eiffel Tower to go on.\u2018\u2018Even just sitting in Paris doing nothing and taking the city in with my friends was one of the highlights of my trip,\u2019\u2019 Shari said.After one night in Paris, the group traveled to Aachen, a small northern German city where Alfie and Rakul had spent time on a school exchange trip. Friends met them at the station, and they all went to a local park. The conversation flowed into the night, occasionally turning to politics.\u201cAll over the world young people aren\u2019t interested in politics, which means they are not voting,\u201d said one of their friends, Julia Reisinger, 18. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a huge problem because it means that the older generation can make decisions on what will become our problems in the future.\u2019\u2019Later, they made dinner at Julia\u2019s place and hung out till 4 a.m. on the balcony, where they slept lined up like sardines.After goodbyes the next day, and a seven-hour train ride, they arrived in Munich and checked into a youth hostel. Along the way, they made friends with an Argentine music conductor, a Cuban student and an Australian photographer.\u201cLiving life through stories, that\u2019s the coolest thing \u2014 the stories along the journey,\u201d said Rakul, who wants to be a doctor and is now studying at Imperial College London.More than 100,000 young people applied for the free Interrail passes. But it is telling of Britain\u2019s relationship to Europe that just 4,000 young Britons did so.\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the repercussions even though we haven\u2019t even left yet,\u201d said Alfie of Britain\u2019s pending departure from the European Union, known as Brexit. \u201cIf we meet people in a bar, and we say we are British, they will immediately start to talk about Brexit and how it was a stupid decision.\u2019\u2019All four say they would have chosen to stay in the European Union, but they were not old enough to vote in the 2016 referendum.\u201cI\u2019ve had this wonderful experience here, talking to people, meeting people from different backgrounds and that\u2019s going to be reduced, that kind of rich experience of talking and listening,\u2019\u2019 Rakul said.As the only one with just a British passport, Usman, who has started an apprenticeship at the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the accounting firm, is especially worried that his ability to live, work and travel in Europe may now be curtailed.\u201cThey\u2019ve kind of screwed us,\u201d he said.Produced by Gaia Tripoli.Advertisement"}

Then it uses emails and text messages to \u201cnudge\u201d individual employees into small actions that advance the larger goal.At a company where workers feel that the way decisions are made is opaque, Humu might nudge a manager before a meeting to ask the members of her team for input and to be prepared to change her mind. Humu might ask a different employee to come up with questions involving her team that she would like to have answered.Using machine learning, Humu will tailor the timing, content and techniques of the messages it delivers based on how employees respond.\u201cOften we want to be better people,\u201d said Laszlo Bock, Humu\u2019s chief executive and Google\u2019s former leader of what the company calls people operations, or human resources. \u201cWe want to be the person we hope we can be. But we need to be reminded. A nudge can have a powerful impact if correctly deployed on how people behave and on human performance.\u201dIn Mr. Bock\u2019s decade-plus tenure at Google, the company\u2019s work force grew more than eightfold. Google struggled at times with how to manage its rapid expansion, and some employees accused the company of creating a workplace that was hostile to women.The episode underscored Google\u2019s unique and seemingly incongruous internal culture. Employees feel empowered to agitate for change, and the company takes innovative approaches to managing its work force. But deep-rooted problems fester as they would anywhere else.He started Humu in 2017 shortly after leaving Google with two former colleagues: Jessie Wisdom, who has a doctorate in behavioral decision research and worked with Mr. Bock in people analytics, and Wayne Crosby, a former director of engineering at Google. Humu has raised $40 million and has 15 customers, companies that range in size from 150 to 65,000 employees.One major challenge for the company is handling data and artificial intelligence in the sensitive area of human resources. Humu said its software was built with employee privacy in mind, allowing workers to delete personal data, including anonymous comments made in company surveys. Humu said it complied with Europe\u2019s stringent data privacy rules.But will workers consider the nudges useful or manipulative?Todd Haugh, an assistant professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business, said nudges could push workers into behaving in ways that benefited their employers\u2019 interests over their own.\u201cThe companies are the only ones who know what the purpose of the nudge is,\u201d Professor Haugh said. \u201cThe individual who is designing the nudge is the one whose interests are going to be put in the forefront.\u201dDr. Wisdom, who ran much of Google\u2019s nudge research, said it was hard to argue with most of the messages the company delivered because they encouraged behavior most people would welcome.\u201cAnybody can do whatever they want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about designing the context in which people are making the decision in ways that is going to help the most people. We\u2019re never trying to get people to do things that they don\u2019t actually want to do.\u201dSanjiv Razdan, the chief operating officer at Sweetgreen, a salad chain and one of Humu\u2019s customers, said that if nudges did not have a track record at Google, he would probably consider the concept a bunch of \u201chocus-pocus happiness nonsense.\u201dBut after receiving nudges for a few months himself in emails from Mr. Crosby, whose email address is used to send the messages, Mr. Razdan said the bite-size reminders made it easy to take action right away. In one instance, he said, he was prompted to ask members of his team for their opinions on decisions he was facing.\u201cThe team doesn\u2019t know I was nudged,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not ashamed to tell everyone that I heard from Wayne today.\u201dJonathan Neman, Sweetgreen\u2019s chief executive, said Humu had pinpointed the issue Sweetgreen cares about most: employee retention.Like most restaurant chains, Sweetgreen, which has 90 stores in the United States, depends on hourly employees. Retaining workers and keeping them happy is critical. Recruiting and training employees is costly, and experienced workers are more productive. Happier employees tend to treat customers better. And customers like seeing familiar faces.In August, when Humu analyzed a survey of sentiment among 1,800 store employees that Sweetgreen had conducted the previous month, it found that 43 percent of the respondents had occasionally considered applying for jobs outside Sweetgreen.If Sweetgreen wanted to improve its retention rate, Humu\u2019s algorithms determined, there was one statement from the survey that the chain needed more employees to agree with: \u201cI believe there are good development opportunities for me at Sweetgreen.\u201dOf the survey\u2019s respondents, 81 percent had reacted positively to the statement. That was a strong score for the fast-food industry, but it was still below the overall 88 percent happiness index Humu had given Sweetgreen overall. The suggestion was that although the company\u2019s employees were generally happy, some felt they lacked opportunities to advance their careers.Humu recommended that store managers \u2014 known as head coaches at Sweetgreen \u2014 hold one-on-one meetings with staff members to discuss development goals.About a month later, in early September, Elena Jimenez, the head coach at Sweetgreen\u2019s Mountain View store, got a nudge. So far, Sweetgreen is nudging only managers.\u201cConsider what skills each team member needs to be successful, both in their current role and longer term in their career,\u201d the email read. \u201cTake notes. Preparing this list of skills will help you spot opportunities for your team as they arise \u2014 so it\u2019s worth putting the work in now!\u201dMs. Jimenez discussed career development at her next \u201csweet talk,\u201d a short meeting before her store opened one day. Then she spoke to her employees individually and learned that many of them wanted to learn different skills, whether handling online orders or chopping and dicing the vegetables that go into Sweetgreen salads.\u201cIt was a good reminder to keep everyone happy and motivated,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope it helps me retain my staff. It\u2019s not easy around here.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

I am not a free-speech lawyer, but when human health is at stake, perhaps search engines, social media platforms and websites should be held responsible for promoting or hosting fake information.Presenting facts, though, might not be enough. The boomerang effect, in which people become even more entrenched in false beliefs when presented with facts, can also occur when medical misconceptions are challenged. To convince my patient that a statin was in her best interests, not only did I provide her the clinical rationale, but I also shared a personal story: After my dad had a heart attack, I urged his doctors to immediately start a statin at the highest dose. I told her that while a statin couldn\u2019t guarantee that he wouldn\u2019t have another heart attack, I wanted my dad to get his best shot at a healthy life. Only then did she agree to take the prescription.To have any chance at winning the information war, physicians and researchers need to weave our science with stories.

Democrats control the executive branch, have a huge majority in the Legislature and for the first time in decades will have a numerical edge on the state\u2019s Supreme Court: The expected confirmation this month of Joshua Groban, an adviser to Gov. Jerry Brown, will result in a court of four Democratic-appointed justices and three Republican-appointed ones.The chief justice is a Republican who was appointed by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yet she described the 600 court appointments that Governor Brown has made during his two terms as \u201cfantastic.\u201d She praised the state Supreme Court\u2019s consensus-based approach and said she doubted that the court would be much different with a majority of Democratic-appointed justices.\u201cI think all of us value the fact that there can be no resolution without courtesy and civility and humor,\u201d she said.In her remarks, Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye, 59, spoke about a new generation of judges who embodied what she described as California values \u2014 judges who cared about homelessness, climate change and \u201cwhat are we going to do about guns.\u201dShe defined the California ethos as \u201cunderdog centric\u201d and criticized the federal immigration authorities for making arrests in courthouses.

{"Headline": "Russian 2016 Influence Operation Targeted African-Americans on Social Media", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Russian influence campaign on social media in the 2016 election made an extraordinary effort to target African-Americans, used an array of tactics to try to suppress turnout among Democratic voters and unleashed a blizzard of activity on Instagram that rivaled or exceeded its posts on Facebook, according to a report produced for the Senate Intelligence Committee.The report adds new details to the portrait that has emerged over the last two years of the energy and imagination of the Russian effort to sway American opinion and divide the country, which the authors said continues to this day.The New Knowledge report is one of two commissioned by the Senate committee on a bipartisan basis. They are based largely on data about the Russian operations provided to the Senate by Facebook, Twitter and the other companies whose platforms were used.Both reports stress that the Internet Research Agency created social media accounts under fake names on virtually every available platform. A major goal was to support Donald J. Trump, first against his Republican rivals in the presidential race, then in the general election, and as president since his inauguration.Among the services the Russians have provided Mr. Trump is to join in and amplify his regular attacks on Mr. Mueller. Posing as fed-up Americans, the Internet Research Agency trolls have denounced the investigation of Russian election interference as a \u201cweird conspiracy\u201d pushed only by \u201cliberal crybabies,\u201d the New Knowledge report says.One Facebook page, called \u201c\u2018Merican Fury,\u201d declared falsely that Mr. Mueller \u201cworked with radical Islamic groups.\u201d Another, \u201cBack the Badge,\u201d called James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump, \u201ca dirty cop.\u201dCreating accounts designed to pass as belonging to Americans, the Internet Research Agency spread its messages not only via Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which have drawn the most attention, but also on YouTube, Reddit, Tumblr, Pinterest, Vine and Google+, among other platforms. Its attack on the United States used almost exclusively high-tech tools created by American companies.The New Knowledge researchers discovered many examples of the Russian operators building an audience with one theme and then shifting to another, often more provocative, set of messages. For instance, an Instagram account called @army_of_jesus_ first posted in January 2015 images from \u201cThe Muppet Show,\u201d then shifted to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and by early 2016 became Jesus-focused. Multiple memes associated Jesus with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Satan with that of his rival, Hillary Clinton.The Russian campaign was the subject of Senate hearings last year and has been widely scrutinized by academic experts. The new reports largely confirm earlier findings: that the campaign was designed to attack Mrs. Clinton, boost Mr. Trump and exacerbate existing divisions in American society.\u201cThe most prolific I.R.A. efforts on Facebook and Instagram specifically targeted black American communities and appear to have been focused on developing black audiences and recruiting black Americans as assets,\u201d the report says. Using Gmail accounts with American-sounding names, the Russians recruited and sometimes paid unwitting American activists of all races to stage rallies and spread content, but there was a disproportionate pursuit of African-Americans, it concludes.The report says that while \u201cother distinct ethnic and religious groups were the focus of one or two Facebook Pages or Instagram accounts, the black community was targeted extensively with dozens.\u201d In some cases, Facebook ads were targeted at users who had shown interest in particular topics, including black history, the Black Panther Party and Malcolm X. The most popular of the Russian Instagram accounts was @blackstagram, with 303,663 followers.The Internet Research Agency also created a dozen websites disguised as African-American in origin, with names like blackmattersus.com, blacktivist.info, blacktolive.org and blacksoul.us. On YouTube, the largest share of Russian material covered the Black Lives Matter movement and police brutality, with channels called \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot\u201d and \u201cBlackToLive.\u201dThe report does not seek to explain the heavy focus on African-Americans. But the Internet Research Agency\u2019s tactics echo Soviet propaganda efforts from decades ago that often highlighted racism and racial conflict in the United States, as well as recent Russian influence operations in other countries that sought to stir ethnic strife.Renee DiResta, one of the report\u2019s authors and director of research at New Knowledge, said the Internet Research Agency \u201cleveraged pre-existing, legitimate grievances wherever they could.\u201d As the election effort geared up, the Black Lives Matter movement was at the center of national attention in the United States, so the Russian operation took advantage of it, she said \u2014 and added \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d material when a pro-police pushback emerged.\u201cVery real racial tensions and feelings of alienation exist in America, and have for decades,\u201d Ms. DiResta said. \u201cThe I.R.A. didn\u2019t create them. It exploits them.\u201dRoger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.Of 81 Facebook pages created by the Internet Research Agency in the Senate\u2019s data, 30 targeted African-American audiences, amassing 1.2 million followers, the report finds. By comparison, 25 pages targeted the political right and drew 1.4 million followers. Just seven pages focused on the political left, drawing 689,045 followers.In response, the N.A.A.C.P. said it would not use Facebook or Instagram for a week and urged its social media followers and partners to do the same.While the right-wing pages promoted Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, the left-wing pages scorned Mrs. Clinton while promoting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. The voter suppression effort was focused particularly on Sanders supporters and African-Americans, urging them to shun Mrs. Clinton in the general election and either vote for Ms. Stein or stay home.The New Knowledge report argues that the Internet Research Agency\u2019s presence on Instagram has been underestimated and may have been as effective or more effective than its Facebook effort. The report says there were 187 million engagements on Instagram \u2014 users \u201cliking\u201d or sharing the content created in Russia \u2014 compared with 76.5 million engagements on Facebook.In 2017, as the American news media focused on the Russian operations on Facebook and Twitter, the Russian effort shifted strongly to Instagram, the report says.The New Knowledge report criticizes social media companies for misleading the public.\u201cRegrettably, it appears that the platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to Congress,\u201d the report says, noting what it calls one false claim that specific population groups were not targeted by the influence operation and another that the campaign did not seek to discourage voting.\u201cIt is unclear whether these answers were the result of faulty or lacking analysis, or a more deliberate evasion,\u201d the report says.The report suggests a grudging respect for the scale and creativity of Russian influence operations. But the Russians were not eager to take credit for their own efforts.After the election, the report says, the Internet Research Agency put up some 70 posts on Facebook and Instagram that mocked the claims that Russia had interfered in the election.\u201cYou\u2019ve lost and don\u2019t know what to do?\u201d said one such post. \u201cJust blame it on Russian hackers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This moody depiction of the Christmas slayings of university sorority sisters and their housemother, among others, is as murky as the script, which dotes largely on obscenities that are no more pointed than the violence, dull direction and pedestrian performances.Why this skulking psychopath is driven to making explicitly obscene phone calls in a variety of crazed voices to the girls before dispatching them remains a fairly foggy business. The slightly comic, alcoholic housemother, Marian Waldman, and Margot Kidder, who is also a drunk and as blatantly outspoken as the killer, and Andrea Martin and Lynne Griffin as the other victims, are obvious in perfunctory portrayals.Olivia Hussey, as the pregnant, sole survivor, is properly confused and terrified by the bloody events.

There she will glimpse lost loves and \u2014 she hopes \u2014 the fate of the daughter she might have had if she hadn\u2019t terminated her first pregnancy. Dan will fly off to Fukushima, Japan, to pursue a possible story but mostly to pursue Maryam, a beautiful, hyper-talkative transgender woman with a multinational background. (Maryam is a fascinating character, but the ease with which she walks through the world and the near shrug with which Dan accepts her gender seem more like the ideal than the real.) Back at home, a decision made by teenage Jack\u2019s best friend will create a crisis that exposes betrayals and threatens to unravel the fragile threads that have been holding the family together.The section of the novel devoted to Fukushima is unsettling in its immediacy. It\u2019s also strangely beautiful even if, at moments, the author\u2019s research feels blended in a bit insistently: \u201cFukushima City was never evacuated,\u201d Maryam announces. \u201cIt\u2019s the capital of the prefecture. Evacuation orders started small in an expanding radius surrounding the nuclear power station. Some residents of this city didn\u2019t even know about the nuclear accident until 10 or 11 days later.\u201d And so on. Discussions of multiverse theory are nearly as thorough.Even so, Schulman weaves all this material \u2014 along with multiple points of view \u2014 into a tight, urgent narrative that builds in tension until, about a hundred pages in, I found it difficult to put the book down.The disparate sections of the novel create a collective, coherent portrait of a world that\u2019s catastrophically out of balance, despite the comforts and privileges of certain corners. Radiation is leaking into the soil and ocean at Fukushima, and radioactive waste is deposited in trash bags left beside the road. In the buffered world of Silicon Valley, teenagers with keys to the future in their hands are following one another in copycat acts of self-destruction. The most loving and intimate relationships are perhaps ones like Jack\u2019s with his girlfriend, Lily, which is conducted mostly in virtual fashion. Amy and Dan\u2019s family sits down to eat organic vegetables from the farmer\u2019s market with a place set for Lily, who will be Skyped in from Texas on Jack\u2019s laptop. Even virtual sex, from Jack\u2019s perspective, can be \u201cbetter\u201d than the real thing. \u201cWhat was so amazing about Lily was when they did this, when they had phone sex, she just obeyed him. In real life, she sometimes talked.\u201dIn the end, all the travel in the novel \u2014 both real and virtual \u2014 leads back to the relatively conventional question of whether or not Amy and Dan can stay together after engaging in their different styles of straying. Amy arrives at her answer with the help of Donny, the least socially adept character we meet. Perhaps \u201cmath plus info\u201d can be put to some good use after all.The final pages of the novel don\u2019t tie up all the loose ends and don\u2019t offer promises of happily-ever-after for anyone. Instead, Schulman delivers an ending that\u2019s ambiguous but hopeful about human connections, tender without being sentimental about fated love. That\u2019s about as much as these characters can expect in their out-of-balance world and probably as much as we readers can expect in ours. One of the many triumphs of \u201cCome With Me\u201d is that Helen Schulman makes it enough.Stephen McCauley\u2019s seventh novel, \u201cMy Ex-Life,\u201d was published last spring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New 50s: Far From Retirement", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter Chip Conley sold Joie de Vivre, the boutique hotel company he created and ran for about 24 years, his life took an unexpected turn. At 52, he was sought out by Brian Chesky, the then-31-year-old chief executive of Airbnb, for advice on how to turn the fledgling home-sharing start-up into a major player in the hospitality field.For the next four years, Mr. Conley worked at Airbnb, toggling between being a mentor and an intern in a sometimes baffling new role \u2014 a \u201cmodern elder,\u201d as he put it. As a veteran hospitality executive, he was used to being the \u201csage on the stage.\u201d But as a newbie in the tech sector, he was often the oldest person in the room, learning from colleagues who were young enough to be his children.I think Mr. Conley\u2019s on to something. It used to be, 50 was a time to begin thinking about retirement. But today, many people in their 50s \u2014 myself included \u2014 plan to work two or even three more decades. To become modern elders, we have to find new ways to stay relevant and keep our minds open, skills fresh and humility intact.While I\u2019m determined to become a modern elder, I know it won\u2019t be easy. After all, most of us won\u2019t be getting a phone call from a tech chief executive seeking our counsel. So I started looking for approachable role models I could learn from, and I found plenty.Some did their homework and went back to school for jobs where there are known shortages \u2014 like nursing or teaching in STEM fields. Some found their way through volunteering or attending specialized fellowships or boot camps. Others teamed up with younger partners to lead new ventures. Most, it seems, did a combination of all these things.\u201cThe idea of working around so many younger people was exciting and invigorating,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel wiser, more well-rounded and updated, and I\u2019m almost in withdrawal now,\u201d she said. She especially appreciated the mutual mentoring. \u201cWe\u2019re just not competing with one another because we\u2019re at different life stages.\u201d\u201cBeing around Kevin is analogous to the kind of mentoring we\u2019re doing with the platform,\u201d Mr. Freund said. \u201cI get little bits of wisdom dripped on me.\u201d Within six months of their first meeting, Mr. Walker asked Mr. Freund to join the company as chief operating officer.Shortly after that, Mr. Walker had to return to a full-time job to bolster his finances so he turned over the daily management of the company to Mr. Freund. Mr. Walker says he is still totally committed to the ideals that led him to start the company and remains only a phone call or video chat away should his younger friend need his counsel.But with two young children at home, Mr. Walker has turned the company into a \u201cside hustle,\u201d something he said he learned from millennials. The two stay in close touch now that Mr. Walker lives in Los Angeles and Mr. Freund is still in Denver.Ms. Strong says the program has provided speaking opportunities, judging roles at pitch summits, and the chance to hone her investing skills.\u201cMy end game is to eventually be on a Fortune 1000 corporate board, and Pipeline gave me the opportunity to serve on start-up boards and gain experience,\u201d she said. And she\u2019s been able to mentor young female founders. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m the auntie to the start-ups,\u201d she said, and the beneficiary of \u201creverse mentoring.\u201dDespite these promising stories, I hear a lot from people over 50, even over 45, who are doing all the right things but still not finding successful midlife transitions. Ageism is rampant \u2014 and internalized, with midlifers questioning our own ability to succeed in a world where youth is prized. And while there are many new offerings to help people make late-career transitions, moving into an encore career still requires an immense amount of creativity and persistence.I have learned two things from my interviews about making these transitions easier. First, and most obviously, it helps to have a financial safety net. So volunteering or refreshing skills while still employed, collecting severance or a pension, or having a partner who provides an income or health insurance, all make a big difference. It is far more daunting without that kind of cushion.Second, the attitudes of younger colleagues are just as important as our own when we think about finding new roles in a rapidly transforming workplace. Shortly after reading Mr. Conley\u2019s book, I met Charlotte Japp, a 28-year-old with an infectious passion for bringing older and younger people together.This struck Ms. Japp in a personal way given that both of her parents lost their jobs when they were about 50. Her father\u2019s experience as the sole breadwinner in the family at the time is particularly etched in her memory.Over an extensive text strand, Ms. Japp explained the philosophy behind Cirkel. She told me there were many times she wanted advice on how to do something \u2014 from technical things like how to put a video treatment together, to \u201cpolitical maneuvering like how to confront a manager about a difficult situation with a colleague.\u201d She just needed someone older and more experienced to ask.The word Cirkel comes from the Swedish for circle. \u201cI believe Sweden is the culture behind great design,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of minimalist furniture, though, I\u2019m using it to describe good design in the culture and society.\u201dMs. Japp got right to the heart of one of the main points Mr. Conley makes in his book. At a time when we can Google the answer to just about anything, it\u2019s important to remember that some things come only through lived experience. And there\u2019s a certain magic when older and younger learn from, and with, each other.Because of an editing error, a photo caption in an earlier version of this article misstated the age of Charlotte Japp, who started an intergenerational networking event series called Cirkel. She is 28, not 27.Marci Alboher is the vice president for strategic communications at Encore.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Drone Deliveries on the Horizon, Europe Moves to Set Ground Rules", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut as e-commerce continues to grow, drones have the potential to reduce the time, cost and energy needed for many everyday deliveries \u2014 assuming they are managed well and used safely.Before a commercial drone industry can thrive, particularly in the crowded urban areas of Europe, different kinds of drones must be able to fly along their delivery routes without crashing into one another \u2014 and under a standardized set of regulations, experts say \u2014 not unlike cars on the road.The path to proving that drones can operate together and be tracked in crowded skies has brought a group of companies to a former military airfield outside Brussels, where they will test their unmanned aviation technology. The project, known as Safir, will help the European authorities devise a set of rules for the commercial use of drones.But Amazon\u2019s ambitions are just one part of the Safir initiative.\u201cIt is about testing 10 drones with different purposes, applications and IT systems,\u201d said Mark Vanlook, the chief executive of DronePort, the recently opened facility where the tests will take place.Other participants produce drones that can assist law enforcement, inspect power lines and monitor wildlife.The overall goal, Mr. Vanlook said, is making sure different drone systems can coexist while in flight. \u201cIf drones can\u2019t account for their surroundings, they will collide \u2014 and hurt people,\u201d he said.\u201cThe technology to build a single drone obviously exists, and now we are playing catch-up with registration, tracking and rule making, all things that will prevent chaotic, ad hoc incidents like the one at Gatwick,\u201d said Ellen Malfliet, an official from Unifly.\u201cThe market is Chinese dominated right now,\u201d said Ulrike Franke, a policy fellow focused on drones at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAnd if Europe wants to catch up, it first has to unify its rules and regulations, which will incentivize European drone producers to engage not just with their country but the entire European market.\u201dMembers of Safir met in Brussels at the end of November for planning. In the coming year, the group will test products together at DronePort, which provides users with office space and outdoor testing areas, as well as a long runway, a control tower and hangars. They are also planning a live demonstration over Antwerp, Belgium, provided that they pass a series of safety and certification tests, said Robin Garrity, an air-traffic management specialist helping to oversee the project.Participants say the live demonstration, if successful, will send a signal to businesses and consumers alike that a vibrant commercial drone industry is achievable.\u201cRight now, we are at the cusp of an industry that is completely changing, with tons of opportunities,\u201d Ms. Malfliet said. \u201cIt is vital to collaborate, to work together and move as quickly and as far as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patreon Bars Anti-Feminist for Racist Speech, Inciting Revolt", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySam Harris, the polemical atheist neuroscientist known for his popular podcast \u201cWaking Up,\u201d was making tens of thousands of dollars a month from fans who donated to him through Patreon, a crowdfunding site.That stopped this month. On Dec. 6, Patreon kicked the anti-feminist polemic Carl Benjamin, who works under the name Sargon of Akkad, off its site for using racist language on YouTube. That same week, it removed the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos a day after he opened an account.\u201cThese recent expulsions seem more readily explained by political bias,\u201d Mr. Harris wrote to his followers.The furor is a microcosm of the conflicts that are playing out across the internet as technology platforms try to limit the spread of hateful speech.But as tech platforms try to get a handle on the issue, they are stoking the ire of their content creators, many of whom brand themselves as free speech warriors. Some accuse the companies of censorship. Others say the tech sites are biased and that hate speech is an ambiguous term. Now the digital dissent is becoming increasingly widespread, upending even smaller websites.\u201cThe concept of hate speech is irreducibly subjective and vague,\u201d said Nadine Strossen, author of \u201cHate: Why We Should Resist It With Free Speech, Not Censorship.\u201dWhile the site is relatively small, with a little over 100,000 creators and two million people donating monthly to those creators, it has become the de facto paycheck for a cohort of prominent self-styled internet philosophers who eschew or have been ousted from traditional bastions like universities or magazines.Among Patreon\u2019s hodgepodge of creators is the left-leaning podcast group Chapo Trap House, which makes more than $110,000 a month from the site, according to Graphtreon, which tracks Patreon activity. Mr. Peterson, a best-selling author, earns around $66,000 a month from the site. Sex-related content creators are also getting monthly subscribers on Patreon, and a Pokemon Go community is the top earner, making up to $500,000 a month, according to Graphetreon.Patreon takes a highly personal approach to policing speech. While Google and Facebook use algorithms as a first line of defense for questionable content, Patreon has human moderators. They give warnings and reach out to talk to offenders, presenting options for \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201creform.\u201d Some activists hope this will become a model for a better and kinder internet.\u201cThere are no automated takedowns,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cAs a creator myself dealing with these big tech platforms and getting an automated takedown notice, there\u2019s no appeals process. You can\u2019t talk to a human. And I never want to do that.\u201dIf someone has breached Patreon\u2019s policy, the company contacts the offender with a specific plan, which usually involves asking for the content to be removed and for a public apology.The conversations with creators can quickly become complicated, nuanced, and, well, human, she said. Among other challenges, Patreon has to decide what qualifies as a sincere and thorough apology. Still, having human moderators has changed its users\u2019 behaviors more than simply deleting accounts would, Ms. Hart said.\u201cWe hand-hold creators, and we work with them one on one, and nearly every creator reforms \u2014 and so it\u2019s quite a successful process,\u201d she said.The work takes up a large amount of resources. Ms. Hart said around 10 percent of Patreon employees are dedicated to her team.On Dec. 6, the company told Mr. Benjamin that it would freeze his account and that he could appeal. Mr. Benjamin objected and said the video in question should not fall under Patreon\u2019s rules because it was on YouTube.For Mr. Benjamin, the timing was surprising. \u201cMy brand has been politically incorrect for years,\u201d he said in a video he later posted to his YouTube channel called \u201cThe Patreon Witch Trials.\u201dMr. Benjamin, who did not respond to requests for comment, has 870,000 subscribers on YouTube and had more than 3,000 subscribers on Patreon, from which he had been making around $12,000 a month. Many of his videos show just a static cartoon or a series of images, with his voice speaking against movements for gender equality.More recently, Mr. Benjamin has moved from the fringe toward the heart of the new right. In October, he posted an hourlong interview with Steve Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist.Mr. Benjamin did not respond to attempts to engage him in the reform process, Ms. Hart said.\u201cHis response to us when we told him about the reform process was to nitpick and say, \u2018I was being anti-Nazi,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hart said. \u201cYou cannot say those words on our platform. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re directing them at.\u201dHis removal from Patreon immediately stirred up others on the site.\u201cI think the most likely outcome, if this continues, is that all contentious speech or behavior will put the speaker or actor at risk of serious financial and social sanctions, and strip them of all defense,\u201d Mr. Peterson wrote in an email.Mr. Rubin and Mr. Peterson said they plan to start their own version of Patreon, which will be less censorious. Mr. Peterson said his Patreon subscriptions had dropped to around 7,500, from about 10,000 over the summer, according to Graphtreon.And while many internet creators argue that Silicon Valley is trying to censor free speech, what the companies are doing is legal, said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cThe First Amendment right is on the side of the company,\u201d she said.\u201cYou can use a press debacle like this to drum up your community and rile people up and get them to support a cause,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cWe welcome competition.\u201dIn his exit note from Patreon, Mr. Harris, who gathered his fan base as a pugnacious atheist and fierce critic of Islam, wrote that he wanted his business interests to be freed from the site. He singled out Ms. Hart\u2019s team.\u201cI consider it no longer tenable to expose any part of my podcast funding to the whims of Patreon\u2019s \u2018Trust and Safety\u2019 committee,\u201d Mr. Harris wrote. He added a link to his own website, where fans can enter their credit card information and choose a monthly contribution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhattan Real Estate Slows After Years of Record Activity", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s like we came off the autobahn: It feels very slow relative to the last three to four year years, but historically it\u2019s not.\u201dBut while brokers, developers and industry observers forecast more of the same for 2019, they aren\u2019t too concerned. The overall market remains healthy, they say, as does the local economy. Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, agreed with that assessment. \u201cSince 2009, the market has gone on a very aggressive ride, and I think it\u2019s normal that we see a bit of a slowdown.\u201dComparatively speaking, \u201csales are not low \u2014 they are just not unusually high,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we came off the autobahn: It feels very slow relative to the last three to four years, but historically it\u2019s not.\u201dIndeed, the average price for a condominium in Manhattan has risen 58 percent since 2008, according to CityRealty, which tracks unit sales, and the average price per square foot is 35 percent higher.During 2018, six apartment sales broke the $50 million mark, and nearly three dozen more closed above $25 million (though some were \u201clegacy contracts,\u201d signed during construction when the market was stronger). \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable by any objective measure,\u201d said Daniel Levy, CityRealty\u2019s chief executive.The year\u2019s biggest closings were two similarly configured duplexes at the just-opened 520 Park Avenue tower on 60th Street. The priciest property sold for nearly $74 million to James Dyson, the founder of the British home-electronics maker Dyson. The other duplex at 520 Park sold for $62 million. And downtown (which CityRealty defines as south of 30th Street) posted a record with the $59 million sale of a penthouse at the new Getty building at 503 West 24th Street, in Chelsea.Brokers say demand continued at all price levels, if not quite as insistently at the super high-end. But largely absent were the bidding wars of recent years and the rushed purchases from floor plans. Many buyers became more discerning as inventory, particularly in new developments, expanded. Others were more hesitant because of higher mortgage rates (which hurt the starter market in particular) and uncertainty about the new tax law. By Mr. Miller\u2019s account, there were 12 percent more housing units for sale in Manhattan than there were in 2017.As a result, developers have had to be more strategic to stay competitive. \u201cYou need to build in the right neighborhood for the right buyers, or offer something totally unique and in great demand,\u201d said Kenneth S. Horn, the founder of Alchemy Properties. He said sales at 250 West 81st Street, one of several new projects, have gone especially well because \u201cit was a new condo and there are not many new condos in that area.\u201dIndividual sellers, however, were slower to adapt to the changing marketplace, and saw their properties linger. As of the fourth quarter, it took an average of 152 days for a listing in Manhattan to go into contract, up from 101 days the same period in 2017, according to Garrett Derderian, the director of data and reporting for Stribling & Associates.Over all, the average Manhattan apartment price slid nearly 5 percent from 2017, to $2.06 million from $2.16 million, according to a year-end market report by CityRealty. (The drop would have been steeper without the pricey new-development sales.) Closed transactions for all condos and co-ops were projected to total 10,354, the report said, with sales reaching $21.3 billion. That\u2019s down from the 13,295 transactions and $25.7 billion in sales in 2017.\u201cThe larger story is volume,\u201d Mr. Levy said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s down, it\u2019s not falling off a cliff.\u201d Several luxury condominiums filled up in 2018, though the pace of sales and the average closing price declined significantly from the year before. \u201cPurchasers have more opportunities to select among many properties \u2014 they know they have choices, so they\u2019re taking their time,\u201d said Susan M. de Fran\u00e7a, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman Marketing. Developers also had to contend with fewer international buyers, who in past years were active in the new-construction sector. Some foreign buyers now face tighter restrictions for moving money out of their home countries, particularly in China.Within the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group\u2019s portfolio of new developments, for instance, about three-quarters of the deals were negotiated, on average, for 7.4 percent below the asking price, said Kelly Kennedy Mack, the group\u2019s president. Less common were purchases during early stages of construction (with the exception of the higher-profile buildings), she added.Developers were also willing to offer more incentives, Ms. de Fran\u00e7a said, absorbing some closing costs or adding in \u201ca storage room or a wine cellar in the top of the market.\u201d In recent weeks, Extell Development even offered to pay three to five years of common charges for purchases made by year\u2019s end.The CityRealty report projected that in 2018, 1,050 units would be sold in Manhattan\u2019s two dozen or so new developments, reaching $5 billion in total sales \u2014 a drop from the 1,848 units and nearly $9 billion in sales in 2017. The average price fell to $4.54 million from $4.79 million in 2017, and a record $5.16 million in 2016. Among the year\u2019s most active developments was 160 Leroy Street in the West Village, where nearly all 57 residences sold. Its priciest sale was to Michael Rubin, the chief executive of the e-commerce company Kynetic. He bought a penthouse for $43.5 million, which was below the $51 million list price. Also, One West End Avenue, on the Upper West Side near 60th Street, saw more than a quarter of its 246 units sell. Notable buyers included the actor Bruce Willis and the New York Yankees pitcher Aroldis Chapman; each acquired a four-bedroom for more than $7 million.While many top sales in 2018 were at brand-new developments, there were several pricey closings at buildings that have been around for a while.A penthouse on the 85th floor of One57, at 157 West 57th Street in Midtown\u2019s Billionaire Row, sold for nearly $54 million \u2014 though below its original $70 million price from 2017.At 432 Park Avenue, also on Billionaires\u2019 Row, between 56th and 57th Streets, two separate buyers, including the prominent art collector Hillel Nahmad, each paid a total of $60 million for pairs of half-floor apartments, presumably to combine them. The building, completed in 2015, remains the city\u2019s most expensive building, with the average price per square foot at nearly $6,000.And at 15 Central Park West, another Robert A.M. Stern limestone condominium, a duplex owned by the British musician Gordon Sumner, a.k.a. Sting, sold for $50 million, after a year on the market and an 11 percent price cut. (Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, are reportedly buying a place at 220 Central Park South.) Among other celebrity closings: The rocker Jon Bon Jovi sold a duplex at 150 Charles Street for $15 million, and the comedian Seth Meyers sold an apartment at 302 West 12th Street for $4.4 million. Both are in the West Village.For all of Manhattan, the average sale price for an existing condo unit fell to $2.91 million from $3.05 million in 2017, according to CityRealty\u2019s projections (though it\u2019s still more than $1 million above the average 10 years ago). \u201cIn some parts of the market, it is definitely a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d said Steven James, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman New York City. But he noted that sellers still have the upper hand in some neighborhoods, particularly downtown. In the West Village and NoHo, for example, prices per square foot were up around 10 percent from a year ago, according to CityRealty.Co-ops, which make up a major chunk of Manhattan\u2019s housing stock, also saw weakened sales volume in 2018, although average prices were slightly higher than the previous year.A total of 5,838 units were expected to close through the end of the year, according to CityRealty, a 15 percent drop from the 6,267 closings in 2017. The average price was $1.40 million, up from $1.37 million.Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage, said co-ops were better positioned in 2018, after price adjustments the previous two years. \u201cThey came down roughly 15 to 20 percent,\u201d during that time, he said. \u201cThey were increasingly a value compared to the condos.\u201dThe year\u2019s most expensive co-op sale was at 995 Fifth Avenue, across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, at 81st Street. An apartment encompassing the 15th floor was sold for $35 million by Joseph J. Plumeri, the vice chairman of the board of directors at First Data, a financial services company.There were numerous other notable closings. At 1 Fifth Avenue, near Washington Square Park, in Greenwich Village, the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards sold a $9 million duplex, while the actress Jessica Lange was poised to create one after paying $3.3 million for a unit above her apartment there. On the Upper West Side, Mr. Willis sold a duplex at 271 Central Park West, at 87th Street, for $17.8 million. And across town, the record and film executive David Geffen sold a unit at the Park V, at 785 Fifth Avenue, between 59th and 60th Streets, for $24.5 million.The Beresford, at 211 Central Park West, between 81st and 82nd Streets, also saw plenty of activity. The hedge fund manager William Ackman deeded to his former wife a duplex valued at $15 million, as part of an apparent property settlement. And Bob Weinstein, the younger brother and business partner of the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, sold a duplex for $20.5 million.Some of the year\u2019s most expensive closings were at townhouses, but like condos and co-ops, many of the transactions came with discounts.The biggest sale, at $40.25 million, was a 36-foot-wide house at 110-112 East 76th Street. The structure, originally listed for $51 million, was the largest of a trio of townhomes created from six brownstones by the developer Joseph Chetrit.Among the many other Upper East Side sales, the former Vanderbilt mansion, at 16 East 69th Street, sold for $39 million.

{"Headline": "Chase for Talent Pushes Tech Giants Far Beyond West Coast", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This generation\u2019s biggest technology companies \u2014 including Apple, Amazon and Google \u2014 have long been tied to their hometowns. Now these giants are increasingly outgrowing their West Coast roots.Driven by a limited pool of skilled workers and the ballooning cost of living in their home bases of Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as President Trump\u2019s shifting immigration policies, the companies are aggressively taking their talent hunt across the United States and elsewhere. And they are coalescing particularly around a handful of urban areas that are already winners in the new knowledge-based economy, including New York City, Washington, Boston and Austin, Tex.\u201cThey\u2019re expanding out,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cTech talent is in very short supply. So if these tech companies want to grow and flourish, they need to find talent in other parts of the country.\u201dThe chase for tech talent has been global for decades, and Silicon Valley\u2019s older companies have had big offices all over the world for years. Intel, for example, has far more employees in Oregon than it does in California. Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies three years ago, has had large outposts in Idaho and Oregon.Amazon, Apple and Google are now increasingly adopting the same strategy as they hire for growth and pursue the brightest minds in new technologies, in an effort to outmuscle one another. Over the past two years, Amazon\u2019s work force has doubled to 613,300 employees; Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, has increased its head count by 35 percent, to 94,300; and Apple has grown nearly 14 percent, to 132,000 workers.Like Cambridge, England, some cities in the United States have also become known for a particular area of tech expertise, in what has become a modern remake of the country\u2019s industrial era, when cities came to specialize in the production of cars, steel and coal.The search for talent outside Silicon Valley and Seattle has also been prompted by issues in the companies\u2019 hometowns, which have not built enough housing to keep up with their growing work forces. San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Seattle are the four most expensive major cities in the country based on home values, according to data from Zillow. The median home in San Francisco is valued at almost $1.4 million and more than $733,000 in Seattle. Questions also abound over the quality and funding of the areas\u2019 public school systems.\u201cEvery day as a C.E.O., you have employees coming to you saying, \u2018I don\u2019t make enough to buy a house for my family,\u2019 and you already feel like you are paying through the nose,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the real estate site based in Seattle. \u201cAlmost everyone is looking at other affordable places where you can open an office.\u201dThat has helped push some tech companies into building major outposts in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economics professor, said that even if H-1B workers were to come through in abundance, it would still make sense to put them in cheaper cities, like Austin. He said, \u201c$100,000 goes a lot further in Austin than in Silicon Valley.\u201dMore than 44 percent of all digital-service jobs in the United States were located in just 10 metro areas last year, including Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, as well as New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston, according to research by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 2015 to 2017, only nine metro areas increased their share of the nation\u2019s tech work force, including the West Coast tech hubs, as well as Austin and Denver.\u201cThe tech industry concentrates in very few markets,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cOur biggest concern is how do we make sure more cities, particularly midsized cities in the middle of the country, can be players in the tech economy?\u201dAmazon, which has about 45,000 people at its Seattle headquarters, has also opened 16 tech hubs in the United States. About 85 percent of those satellite employees are in six booming, highly educated urban areas \u2014 the Bay Area, Washington region, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. Each has at least 1,000 workers.(The bulk of Amazon\u2019s North American work force is made up of the more than 250,000 people who are dispersed in the company\u2019s roughly 110 warehouses around Canada and the United States and who make less money than their white-collar colleagues.)Apple, which has been criticized by President Trump for not creating more domestic jobs, said on Thursday that its plans for Austin included a new 133-acre campus that will initially have 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations and other functions. It will ultimately be able to accommodate up to 15,000 workers.Apple already has about 6,000 workers in Austin. The company said it applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County.A person familiar with Apple\u2019s decision to expand outside Cupertino, Calif., where it just opened a new $5 billion headquarters, said the move into Austin was partly driven by the extreme housing prices in the Bay Area, as well as its aim to find more talent and add more diversity and military veterans to its work force.The company added that it also planned to open 1,000-worker operations in Seattle, San Diego, and Culver City, Calif., and to add hundreds of employees in Pittsburgh, Boston, New York and Boulder, Colo., over the next three years.\u201cIn a sense, what we\u2019re seeing is tech becoming a normal industry,\u201d Mr. Glaeser said, \u201can industry that\u2019s not located in one incredibly expensive place.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco and Karen Weise from Seattle.

At the core of their questions was a concern over the company\u2019s commitment to free expression.\u201cAll of these topics \u2014 competition, censorship, bias and others \u2014 point to one fundamental question that demands the nation\u2019s attention,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader. \u201cAre America\u2019s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d\u201cBecause a free world depends on a free internet, we need to know that Google is on the side of the free world,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, highlighted the importance of scrutinizing Google because of the company\u2019s market power in search, cloud-based email and its Android mobile operating system.Mr. Goodlatte also raised concerns that the liberal-leaning political biases of employees may also affect filtering decisions for its search engine. He mentioned a leaked video the day after the 2016 presidential election showing top officials lamenting the victory of President Trump.\u201cThis committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cGiven the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google\u2019s values, these questions have become all the more important.\u201dMr. McCarthy is among several Republican members who have made online political bias a talking point in campaign fund-raisers. Claims of anti-conservative bias within the technology of Google, Facebook and Twitter have been disputed by numerous technologists and academics.Democrats had their own set of tough questions for Mr. Pichai on privacy and the company\u2019s competitive practices. But they also expressed frustration with the political bias claims.\u201cI must dispense with the complete illegitimate fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives that Google and other platforms have anti-conservative bias,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the committee.Officials were expected to be merciless for Mr. Pichai\u2019s first appearance before Congress. When he declined to appear in a Senate hearing in September, lawmakers called the act \u201carrogant,\u201d and they put out an empty chair in his absence.Though lawmakers asked Mr. Pichai a variety of pointed questions, they also lauded Google as an American icon.\u201cYour company should really be held out as a success story of America\u2019s free enterprise system,\u201d said Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican of Pennsylvania.\u201cDespite the nature and scope of today\u2019s hearing, Google is still the story of the American dream,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said.\u201cWe do not want to impose burdensome regulations on your industry,\u201d said Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana.Going into a third hour of the hearing, Republicans offered little detail on how they would follow up on concerns about privacy and anti-conservative bias.Democrats, in large part, defended the company of political bias claims.Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, said negative news coverage of members like Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, were perhaps the result of his views on immigration.\u201cDon\u2019t blame Google or Facebook or Twitter, consider blaming yourself,\u201d Mr. Lieu said.During Mr. Pichai\u2019s testimony, the first question from Mr. Goodlatte was about whether consumers understand the frequency and amount of location data that Google collects from its Android operating system.The sharpest exchange came when Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room.Mr. Pichai said, \u201cnot by default,\u201d adding that it depended on the congressman\u2019s settings on the apps he had installed. But when Mr. Pichai would not respond yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and said Mr. Pichai appeared to be evading his question.\u201cYou make $100 million a year,\u201d he said to Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in the technology industry. \u201cYou should be able to answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know. I think Google obviously does.\u201dBefore the hearing, Google\u2019s critics drew attention to their grievances against the company that became fodder for lawmakers.\u201cBut just as Google wants to convince the public that it can handle consumer privacy matters behind closed doors,\u201d the employee group wrote, \u201cit tells the same to its employees by forcing arbitration, requiring them to waive their right to sue or participate in a class-action lawsuit in all cases of discrimination.\u201dSeparately, more than 50 human rights organizations signed a letter to Mr. Pichai demanding that the company stop working on Project Dragonfly, the initiative within Google to build a censored search engine that it may use in the Chinese market. A search engine that restricts content banned by the Chinese government is \u201ctroubling,\u201d the groups said, because it would contribute to repressive censorship and surveillance.Google has eight products with more than one billion monthly users, including search, YouTube and Google Drive, its suite of productivity apps. But a product that has struggled to amass users provided fodder for questions from lawmakers about Google\u2019s handling of user data.Google announced on Monday that it found a security vulnerability last month in Google Plus, the company\u2019s answer to Facebook. The problem exposed the personal information of 52 million users to third-party developers even if the users had set their information to private. Google said it had no evidence that any developers were aware of or had misused the vulnerability during the six days that the bug existed. Google said it would now move up the timing of when it plans to shutter the consumer version of Google Plus, to April from August.In October, Google announced that it found a similar security issue with Google Plus. Google found this vulnerability in March but did not report it immediately, waiting seven months to disclose the bug because it had found no evidence that anyone had exploited the problem to obtain user information. However, it brought new light to questions about how big technology companies handle user data.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to See All the Vermeers in the World? Now\u2019s Your Chance", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMSTERDAM \u2014 Johannes Vermeer, whose acute eye captured the quiet beauty of Dutch domestic life, was not a prolific artist: Just 36 paintings are widely acknowledged as his work. Still, anyone who wanted to see them all had to travel far and wide \u2014 to New York, London, Paris and beyond.Until now.That painting will be on view once again in Meet Vermeer, the digital museum. Starting Monday, the free app will be accessible to anyone with a camera-equipped smartphone.\u201cThis is one of these moments when technology does something that you can never do in real life, and that\u2019s because these paintings could never be brought together in real life,\u201d said Emilie Gordenker, director of the Mauritshuis.She explained that some of the 17th-century paintings were too fragile to travel, while some were in private collections, and the Gardner\u2019s was lost. But even under different circumstances, it would be unlikely that all the owners would be willing to part with all of their prized Vermeers at the same time.The 18 museums and private collections that own Vermeer paintings, however, were willing to provide high-resolution digital image files of their Vermeers to the project.Although many of these images are already on the museums\u2019 websites, Ms. Gordenker said she wanted to give the public a sense of the paintings\u2019 size in relation to one another \u2014 something that is hard to convey in a flat picture on a screen.Opening the app, visitors gaze down at a museum with no ceiling. To enter one of the rooms displayed, they touch the phone\u2019s surface, pinching their fingers together and then opening them. As they land in a gallery, the perspective shifts so that they face the walls, where the framed paintings hang. Zooming in, they can approach each work and examine it closely.Laurent Gaveau, director of Google\u2019s Arts and Culture Lab, a nonprofit developed to experiment with new ways to make art and culture accessible to the public, said this was the first virtual museum that Google had created, but that he could certainly imagine making more.\u201cWe could think about all kinds of museums that never existed,\u201d he said in a telephone interview, although he added that no other such projects were yet in the works. \u201cWe want to first see how people will react to this, and we want to see, from a technological standpoint and a user standpoint, if it\u2019s right and how it can be improved.\u201dPaintings by Vermeer have long been reproduced in all types of formats, from posters to patterns on handbags and umbrellas. But as the technology improves and visitors have the artificial but intimate experience of seeing high-quality reproductions in a museum setting, does Ms. Gordenker worry that they will be less motivated to travel for the real thing?No, she said.\u201cThe more information we share, including images, the more I think that people want to have the authentic experience of seeing the work in its home,\u201d she said, \u201cand seeing it as an actual physical presence. One of the reasons that museums have becoming increasingly relevant, and why attendance is going up, is that we\u2019ve been able to harness these digital technologies. It breaks down barriers, and makes what we have much more accessible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How You Can Help Fight the Information Wars", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySilicon Valley won\u2019t save us. We\u2019re on our own. Contributing Opinion Writer The Russian trolls have been really good customers of Facebook, Google and Twitter.Now we know that the tech companies were not particularly helpful in trying to work with government investigators to unravel the mess, asserting that they were in the dark about the situation, both as the deception was happening and well after it was pointed out to them.Regrets? Apparently, tech has a few, but not enough to do a full mea culpa that might allow us to avoid this kind of disaster in the future.While all of the companies have insisted that they are committed to transparency, the fact is that they have long been resistant to the kind of self-reflection needed to fix the situation for the long term. The only solution is to overhaul their systems in ways that would force them to behave less like bystanders in what will be a never-ending \u201chigh-stakes information war.\u201d This is the disturbing term used in one of Senate reports that Ren\u00e9e DiResta, a disinformation expert and director of research at New Knowledge, worked on. It looked at over a thousand YouTube videos, upward of 100,000 Instagram posts, more than 50,000 Facebook posts and more than 10 million tweets.\u201cEach of the platforms has great visibility into their own platform, and third-party researchers have information and signal from across the platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at dissemination platforms and trends and saying: \u2018We think this is inauthentic. You\u2019ve got device IDs, you\u2019ve got I.P. addresses, you\u2019ve got a number of other signals that we don\u2019t have access to.\u2019\u201dIn other words, as was described in more detail this week, the tech giants have been holding back. It\u2019s a crouch posture that I think has its origins in the souring of the industry\u2019s relationship with government agencies in 2013 in the wake of Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about incursions into tech platforms by the N.S.A. surveillance program Prism.That moment deeply damaged what had once been a more cooperative back and forth between government and tech over issues of national security. While no one in tech was na\u00efve enough to be surprised about some level of government spying on information-rich environments \u2014 you rob banks because that is where the money is, after all \u2014 the level of it was indeed a shock to some.What will happen next?But in the end, such changes may prove impossible, given how the United States thinks about free speech. As the report noted: \u201cWe have conversations about whether or not bots have the right to free speech, we respect the privacy of fake people, and we hold congressional hearings to debate whether YouTube personalities have been unfairly downranked. It is precisely our commitment to democratic principles that puts us at an asymmetric disadvantage against an adversary who enthusiastically engages in censorship, manipulation, and suppression internally.\u201dFor now, it\u2019s not clear what we can do, except take control of our own individual news consumption. Back in July, in fact, Ms. DiResta advised consumer restraint as the first line of defense, especially when encountering information that any passably intelligent person could guess might have been placed by a group seeking to manufacture discord.\u201cThey\u2019re preying on your confirmation bias,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen content is being pushed to you, that\u2019s something that you want to see. So, take the extra second to do the fact-check, even if it confirms your worst impulses about something you absolutely hate \u2014 before you hit the retweet button, before you hit the share button, just take the extra second.\u201dIf we really are on our own in this age of information warfare, as the Senate reports suggest, there\u2019s only one rule that can help us win it: See something, say nothing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Amazon Could Learn From Google in New York City", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long after Google moved into the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan, its billionaire co-founder, Sergey Brin, went on a private tour of the old elevated freight line that would become the celebrated High Line.Mr. Brin looked over the barren landscape that would be filled with lush greenery and made a suggestion: How about a Frisbee golf course?That would not be a good idea, he was politely told during that walk in 2008. Frisbees would probably go flying off and strike people on the street below.It was the kind of small but telling lesson Google had time to learn. The company\u2019s slow expansion over two decades in New York City \u2014 from a single employee in 2000 to more than 7,000 today \u2014 gave the tech giant the chance to adapt its West Coast ideas to the confines of crowded New York City.\u201cThey\u2019re running their own play and it\u2019s a very different play than ours,\u201d said William Floyd, the head of external affairs for Google in New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government. We\u2019ve done it by the dint of our own work.\u201dStill, not all has gone smoothly. Some residents complain that Google\u2019s robust expansion in Chelsea keeps driving up the cost of housing, while small businesses say the company\u2019s free-food-at-work culture has taken money out of the pockets of local eateries. Others say Google has not opened up its wallet as much as it could.But in a city where almost any change is met by fierce resistance, Google has drawn relatively few complaints as it has made itself at home in Chelsea, a neighborhood where public housing projects sit beside luxury buildings, art galleries and trendy restaurants and clubs.Along the way, it has acquired a multibillion-dollar real estate portfolio, including two of the neighborhood\u2019s best-known buildings.Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker and a Chelsea resident, was unequivocal that Google has been \u201ca good neighbor.\u201dIn contrast, Amazon was not off to a good start, he said. \u201cThis is how they want to be a neighbor in Long Island City?\u201d Mr. Johnson asked, referring to the lack of community input on the deal to bring the company to the neighborhood.An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was \u201cexcited to learn more about the Long Island City community, to find out how we can best support residents.\u201d The company has also hired high-powered lobbying firms to help contend with local political unrest.Google made a statement simply by moving in. \u201cIt said to the world: This is where technology meets cool,\u201d said Paul Pariser, the co-chief executive officer of Taconic Investment Partners, which owned and redeveloped the building and still manages it today.Smaller technology companies soon followed in Google\u2019s wake. \u201cThere is a certain brand that comes with being in the area,\u201d said Mike Rudoy, 33, the chief executive of Jetty, an insurance start-up that moved to a nearby Chelsea building in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s less about customers and more about recruiting. It all comes down to recruiting.\u201dThese newcomers helped accelerate the gentrification sweeping Chelsea, especially after the High Line opened in 2009 and drew tourists and developers alike in what residents have called \u201cthe High Line effect.\u201dThe changes have divided residents of Chelsea, which had long been a hub of gay culture and night life. \u201cThere\u2019s been a massive exodus of gay people from Chelsea,\u201d said Allen Roskoff, a resident and gay rights activist. \u201cWhat caused it? I don\u2019t know, but Google coming in there will further the need for luxury buildings. It will further gentrify the neighborhood.\u201dGoogle is also leasing office space on Pier 57, a commercial hub on the Hudson River. As part of that move, Google said it would pay for the construction of a ferry dock for water taxis or a cross-Hudson ferry.Google workers have generally fit right in. They are typically young and educated and well paid. They favor jeans, shirt and no tie. They pack the Starbucks on the ground floor of the Eighth Avenue building. They browse at the T-Mobile store next door. The morning a new Android phone with a Google operating system was released, a Google employee was waiting by the door to snap up the first one, a T-mobile sales associate said.In recent years, Google\u2019s growing empire has started to attract the attention of its neighbors \u2014 some of whom point out that the company has not contributed as much as it could, given its extraordinary wealth and status.\u201cThey would be much more welcome in this community if they would do their part,\u201d said Pamela Wolff, 83, a Chelsea resident who struggled to name a big-ticket Google project for the entire neighborhood. \u201cI think any business that comes in with such a huge footprint should be offering more.\u201dGoogle\u2019s largess, for the most part, has been directed to specific groups and organizations. It outfitted a youth technology center with new laptops, smartboards and a music studio. Google employees have taught computer science in after-school and summer programs and have helped older immigrants learn to use Google translate.After the email system kept crashing at Hudson Guild, a nonprofit that offers social services, a Google team was dispatched to upgrade it for free. When the Guild needed a meeting place for its 175 employees, Google supplied an auditorium, as well as breakfast and lunch. It again lent space \u2014 and some glamour \u2014 for the Guild\u2019s \u201cfriend-raiser\u201d for potential donors.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to go to the Google office?\u201d said Ken Jockers, the Guild\u2019s executive director. \u201cI think they are an engaged and thoughtful neighbor.\u201dBut though Google has been generous with its time and space, it has been less so with its money, according to Brad Hoylman, the local state senator. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense in the local community that they could ramp up their giving,\u201d said Mr. Hoylman, a Democrat. \u201cTechnology hasn\u2019t yet figured out that New York City is their home, too.\u201dGoogle has also given $1 million to build the High Line and another $1.5 million to a cultural preservation project for the Stonewall Inn, a West Village bar and a symbol of the gay rights movement. In addition, the company has provided free Wi-Fi across broad swathes of Chelsea, including inside the subway station below its offices.Increasingly, Google has sought to deepen its community ties, including to two housing projects with more than 4,500 residents. Darlene Waters, the tenant association president for the Elliott-Chelsea Houses, said a Google worker introduced himself this year at an art gallery and told her to call. \u201cGoogle and I, we\u2019re going to be close,\u201d Ms. Waters said.Local residents were invited into the Eighth Avenue building, which came across to some as a giant playground. Google workers whizzed through the halls on scooters with their own docking stations. There were Ping-Pong and pool tables, a rock-climbing wall and a virtual reality room with special glasses. Food pantries were stocked with chips, candy, soda and juice for the taking. Afterward, residents were treated to lunch in a company cafeteria at Chelsea Market, where servers doled out steak, salmon, salads and desserts.\u201cI felt kind of good because they don\u2019t do this for everybody, but they did it for the neighborhood,\u201d said Sam Rosedietcher, 64, a carpenter, who lives at the Fulton Houses.Miguel Acevedo, 58, the president of the Fulton Houses tenant association, said Google supplied 980 turkeys this Thanksgiving. Its workers donated more than 100 dresses and shoes in the spring during a prom-dress drive. He now brags that Google is next door. \u201cWe have Google; you don\u2019t have Google,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody uses Google one way or another.\u201dBut as Google has expanded, it has also replaced smaller companies, including some that have left the neighborhood. Workers from those companies are no longer around to support local restaurants and stores. And Google workers, supplied with free food and entertainment, have not taken their place. As a result, some businesses are not as enthusiastic about Google.\u201cI wish they had given a little consideration and support to the food vendors,\u201d said Howard Nourieli, a co-owner of Bowery Kitchen Supplies in Chelsea Market, who figured that his sandwich counter has lost thousands of dollars a month in sales. \u201cIt would have been the right thing to do. Everyone\u2019s suffering here.\u201dSome residents also worry that Google is taking over too much of their neighborhood. Its purchase of Chelsea Market comes with the right to build additional space on top, which residents said could block sunlight on part of the High Line.Ms. Wolff, a member of Save Chelsea, a preservation group, said she did not object when Google first came to Chelsea, but that now it needs to be \u201cwatched like a hawk.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid of any business that comes into Chelsea and grows exponentially,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re going to be devoured.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then she fell in love.They started this job more than a year ago. Most homeowners would be annoyed at how long it\u2019s taking. I\u2019m not. They\u2019re building it for free. They\u2019re building it for me.I bring them water. I kiss one good night but not the other. One is my boyfriend of 10 years. The other is my husband. My husband and I actually consider ourselves exes, but we never divorced. We still love each other, just not romantically. We have lived together all these years under the same roof, although not the same bedroom.What happened was this: 15 years ago, I woke up in the night, nudged him awake and said, \u201cI need your permission to have an affair.\u201dOur then 2-year-old son had just left the family bed. My husband and I were alone again with a gaping hole where passion should be. We had tried to bring it back through counseling, sex therapy and lingerie. I needed the dance of knee against knee under the table. I needed an unabashed, open-mouthed kiss. So we came to an agreement.\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t bring it home.\u201dThis went on for several years. I met men at hotels and at their homes in the hills.Then, I met a new guy at a bar in the Mission District, the perfect place to meet before a one-night stand. Except I fell for him the moment he handed me a red Gerber daisy. I fell for the small gap between his teeth. I touched his hand by feigning interest in the ring he had made from a bicycle spoke. We loved the same obscure music.Days later, he waltzed with me on Berkeley Pier, my gloves arranged in his breast pocket like a kerchief. He created a rabbit out of a squeegee and a towel and made me laugh at its antics.The afternoon I chose to tell my husband, light streamed into our yellow kitchen. Our son was in his room, playing with Hogwarts toys.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our agreement,\u201d he said. We discussed it calmly. One of us mentioned divorce. One of us said, \u201cShould we move apart?\u201d Then it was silent again.I was a child of divorce. When I came home from school, the house was empty. My mother worked an hour away and didn\u2019t get home until after 6.I saw my father on Sundays, sometimes. He would take us to car shows or to buy fish for our aquarium. I don\u2019t think he ever wanted children. He wasn\u2019t interested in talking to me about books or cheerleading. He once jokingly tossed me over the side of a boat, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn to swim!\u201dMy siblings were wild, sneaking out to parties in the woods. I grew up mostly alone. I dreamed of having a family to travel with or joke together over dinner.I had this now. We made Lego villages, played music, sang out of tune. We stopped for smiley-face pancakes when we drove to San Diego to see my in-laws. We took up a whole row on the airplane, creating our own happy world of snacks, cartoons and surprises for our son.I couldn\u2019t imagine not waking up in the house with my child, having to drop him off at his father\u2019s house, not kissing his sleepy cheeks every night.I wanted my family. And I wanted my boyfriend.When I suggested we could be roommates, my husband agreed. I clung to the idea like a life raft.We ordered another bed and turned my husband\u2019s office into a second bedroom. I didn\u2019t know if it was possible to create a new kind of family, but like a child who pushes against the boundaries of her parents\u2019 rigid rules, I wanted to find out.Months later, I said, \u201cI want to introduce him to our son.\u201d\u201cIf you bring someone else in,\u201d my husband said, \u201cwe need to move apart. I don\u2019t want to meet him.\u201dWeeks passed. Then my husband said, \u201cWild Side West. 5:30. Wednesday night.\u201dI don\u2019t remember if I drove to that meeting with my husband or my boyfriend. I do remember sitting in the beer garden with sweat on my forehead.We sat in a little triangle, my husband sitting stiffly and my boyfriend leaning back as if to give us more room. I perched on a rickety stool. We could have been in a lawyer\u2019s office, drawing up papers.The moment was about a child. The conversation was about who we are to this boy. Who will we be to him and to each other? How do we trust?We set a meeting for the playground the following week. We three adults had planned it out carefully. My son and I would be playing on the monkey bars. My boyfriend would show up and I would introduce him as my friend.When he arrived, he was carrying an old radio and some tools. He had remembered from our conversations that my son loved to disassemble electronics.My boyfriend juggled two screwdrivers and a wrench and made my son laugh. He smiled and said, \u201cHey buddy, want to take this thing apart with me?\u201dWhen this began, we still lived in a large apartment in the Mission; there was room for privacy the nights my boyfriend stayed over. It was awkward at first, but as the years passed we spent more time as a foursome \u2014 cooking, playing board games.Twice a year we all traveled to my mother\u2019s house in Ohio, along with my husband\u2019s parents, spending two weeks in a flurry of card games, water balloon fights and lingering meals.Then the owner of our apartment decided to sell and offered us an enormous sum of money to surrender our rent-controlled lease. In most places, that money could have bought us a house. In the Bay Area, it wasn\u2019t even a down payment. The only place we could afford was half the size of our apartment. There wouldn\u2019t be room for home offices, most of our furniture or my boyfriend.At the new house, my beau built a platform so I could store the mattress beneath a raised office, but it never felt right. It wasn\u2019t sexy to sleep with him under piles of papers and the glow of the computer screen saver.One day when he and I were lying in the trundle bed staring up at a jumble of cords, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about building you a studio.\u201d But I didn\u2019t have the money.\u201cWe could scavenge what we need,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we start by building a foundation, maybe it will come together even if we don\u2019t see how it can work.\u201dThe backyard was a mess of dirt, broken bottles and rusty metal when he began digging. He patiently began clearing it out. One day my husband donned work gloves and jumped in, too. When we ran out of scavenged materials, my husband generously purchased supplies.Months of Sundays passed to the synchronized beat of hammers and the sound of music and laughter as the framing was built. My husband taught me how to use the nail gun. My boyfriend took pictures as I nailed on the avocado-green siding. There\u2019s a selfie of the three of us grinning from behind our dust masks, covered with flecks of fiberglass on the day we stuffed insulation into the walls.Those two men painstakingly installed layers of drywall, reaching their long arms to the ceiling over and over. Before they hung the last piece, I hid gold dollar coins inside next to the studs and a photo of three generations of people who are related in ways there aren\u2019t words for.They left the beautiful thick beam in the ceiling exposed. After you walk into the studio and admire the golden light and the warm oak floors, that exposed beam catches your eye. It\u2019s the through line, reminding me of our love for our son.We wanted this child to grow up in a happy household. That beam was strong enough to convince us all to hold onto the vision. It\u2019s like a dream I have had countless times in which I discover a room in my house that I didn\u2019t know was there.That\u2019s our life now. We are building a family without a blueprint.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let the Fountain Pens Flow! ", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn this coldly pixelated age, old-fashioned writing implements make a small but meaningful comeback. In fact, it quickly became clear that these were nerds. Twenty-first-century pen nerds.Lamy was handing out free Vibrant Pink Al-Stars, a sleek aluminum-bodied pen, and plastic Safaris (each around $40). And then there was the guest of honor: Brian Goulet, of Goulet pens, who had the handsomeness of a 1950s young dad, thick hair like mink, broad shoulders, a warm handshake. \u201cHe\u2019s, like, a rock star in the world of pens,\u201d said Steve Birkhold, the C.E.O. of Universal Luxury Brands, which own the American distribution rights to Lamy. Mr. Birkhold, formerly the C.E.O. of Diesel and Lacoste, has started his own company with a partner, Eli Hollander, to bring niche, design-focused European brands to the United States.Lamy, whose headquarters are in Heidelberg, is still owned by the German family that founded it in the 1930s. Its Lamy 2000, introduced in 1966, a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist steel pen, made the brand\u2019s reputation as the cool pen maker. This year Mr. Birkhold opened the SoHo store and another in the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. \u201cBusiness has already tripled,\u201d he said, since he bought the United States distribution rights in 2017. The office supply and paper company that held them previously, he added, didn\u2019t understand how to take an \u201comni-channel\u201d approach and correctly market the \u201cpen brand for millennials.\u201dThe fountain pen has been imperiled since the rise of disposable ballpoints in the 1960s; by the \u201990s and early aughts the almighty keyboard was positioned to kill it off entirely. Once-stalwart household names like Sheaffer (Sylvia Plath\u2019s preferred brand) were closing American factories to manufacture cheap parts in Asia and seeking corporate buyers. Holdout users were mainly aging collectors, and only a few companies, like Montblanc, which had been acquired in 1988 by Richemont, were flourishing.During his store appearance, he at first was standing by himself. As the evening drew on, and free champagne flowed, attendees edged closer to him, the way children may shyly creep toward a storyteller. Soon they were asking questions eagerly: What was his favorite pen? Favorite nib? Does he think a \u201cdemonstrator\u201d pen that shows its mechanism, by the upstart Taiwanese brand Twsbi, look like a vape? Would he be eating one of the large sugar cookies of his head in icing Lamy had set out for the party from the bakery Cupcake Market? (No, he would be taking them home for his two grade-school children, who will of course be learning cursive.) An avid woodworker, Mr. Goulet originally planned for the website to sell wooden fountain pens he made, but soon noticed that the accessories he sold to go with them, paper and ink, were doing well, without the hours of labor.Generationally at ease with the so-called pivot (he majored in commercial real estate management at Virginia Tech), he gave up on his own pens. The company\u2019s website cannily bottles and sells small ink samples and walks you through how-tos: how to \u201cflush\u201d a pen, how to use a wax seal (there are now flexible ones that can go through the postal machines). There are also reviews of new pens and interviews with pen personalities.Instagram, where illustrators post video demonstrations, has inevitably furthered pen nerd-dom. Fountain-pen ink looks beautiful as it dries, since it often has shading, or color variations, and sometimes shifting iridescence. There are hundreds of new, delicious ink colors and small-batch companies with romantic bottles and names like poems or perfumes (Organics Studio, Nitrogen; Colorverse, Andromeda, DeAtramentis Black, Roses, Pilot Iroshizuku, Kosumosu, Robert Oster Fire & Ice, Monteverde California Teal). Manufacturers like Diamine in England, once almost moribund, have customers again. Then there are the new start-up offices, coffee shops, which lack supply closets. \u201cSomeone might pull out a notebook from CVS and a Bic,\u201d Mr. Birkhold said. \u201cBut someone else has a cool notebook and fountain pen. They personify your personality.\u201dOriginally a straightforward system of organizing your how-to lists (and life) on pages with small points arranged as a grid, bullet journaling has become almost an art form. And it is one that is enhanced by a fountain pen, or so Kara Benz (a.k.a., Boho Berry) demonstrated at the Lamy event, where she was a host. The journaling is perfect for a form of faux calligraphy that involves fattening every down stroke, the rudiments of which anyone can learn in an hour or two.Ms. Benz, who lives in New Jersey and has electric-violet hair, uses shelves of different writing implements to create her impossibly artful rainbow pages of lists that include items like \u201cdeclutter X or Y\u201d or \u201cbook a spa day,\u201d and never \u201cspend all day making this page.\u201d But the company\u2019s customers are not all such obvious free spirits. \u201cA lot of people are administrative professionals who just have normal cubicle office jobs, and they just want interesting tools to make their day more their own,\u201d Mr. Goulet said.\u201cI got into fountain pens about three months ago,\u201d said Jeremy Whelchel, a young man in a puffer jacket during a holiday event at the Manhattan Fountain Pen Hospital downtown. The store is one of the few general pen shops that has survived, because it has the Wall Street crowd\u2019s business. Most of the people piling up to the counters there looked like the sort of 50-and-ups who would of course love a fancy, fusty fountain pen. The old-guard pen scene, like the cigar aficionados, appreciates a certain gaudiness. \u201cEncrusted\u201d might be the defining adjective to apply to the pricey, themed wares (\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Samurai) of Montegrappa, an Italian brand. But dotted among the blur of boomers were next-gen fellows like Mr. Whelchel, the sort who comfortably use terms like \u201cEDC\u201d (everyday carry).He had an old fountain pen lying around for years, but it was always dry and scratchy. \u201cI used to associate them with status seekers, with Montblanc, guys with fancy watches,\u201d Mr. Whelchel said. \u201cI\u2019m not into that, I\u2019m into the gadget aspect.\u201d The subreddit is \u201ca great community,\u201d he said, \u201cwith useful instructionals.\u201d He started with one Pilot Metropolitan, then bought a bunch of them to get familiar with the interchangeable nibs and mechanisms. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bike: If you keep them tuned up and take care of them, they\u2019re great.\u201d He is curious to see the Homo Sapiens Evolution, by the Italian brand Visconti. It is made from Mount Etna lava.\u201cI\u2019m not a convert, but it\u2019s nice to mark up a document with one,\u201d said his girlfriend, Hailey DeKraker, a lawyer. \u201cNow that I have my ink guy!\u201dMr. Whelchel doesn\u2019t tend to use the pens for daily correspondence. \u201cMore like notebooks,\u201d he said.Mr. Whelchel is an engineer at Google, and he likes the pens\u2019 through-line to the previous implications of that job title: building bridges, drawing plans on paper. With the same familiar irony that applies across the recent analog revivalism, the engine that was killing the fountain pen (and the pen store) as a necessity has resurrected it as a pure pleasure and a novel way to display personal style.The \u201cdisruption\u201d of the fountain-pen market provides a soothing escape from all the others: Amazon\u2019s unnerving dominion, Facebook\u2019s alleged tainting of democracy itself, and childhood\u2019s fast fade into screens.\u201cPeople describe drawing ink into their pen from an ink bottle and wiping the nib as a Zenlike experience,\u201d said Stephen Brown, 34, a cognitive psychologist from the Netherlands who teaches at a community college in Red Deer, Alberta. \u201cPeople are also reading studies coming out indicating that writing things down helps you remember,\u201d said Jane Andreasen, 27, a pen nerd with a Mia Farrow crop and Fury Road boots. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy step to go from, \u2018I want to write more to, \u2018and now I have a fountain pen,\u2019 to \u2018now I have five, what happened to me?\u2019\u201d Ms. Andreasen is the resident fountain-pen expert at the happening Oakland, Calif., outpost of Flax Art & Design, an art supply store. Nibs recall a time when the act of signing documents promised law and order. A time when Thomas Jefferson used his (up-to-the-minute) metal pen to draft the Declaration of Independence for people who had faith in a \u201cwe the\u201d and the God indicated as the key witness to the ensuing signatures.Considering this, it makes sense that one of the world\u2019s largest pen shows is in Washington, D.C. It also makes sense that there\u2019s some pen political drama, captured by the ink maker Nathan Tardif, whose Noodler\u2019s inks are known for their inventiveness, affordability and the libertarian convictions hidden in their charming illustrated labels.Mr. Tardif follows his ethics of self-sufficiency in the woods of Massachusetts, where he concocts and bottles his inks by himself. His Bernanke Black Ink is fast drying \u2014 an allusion to the Federal Reserve\u2019s act of essentially printing money by lowering interest rates during the financial crisis \u2014 and his Berning Red, also fast drying, a red for lefties, shows Bernie Sanders\u2019s head in front of the state seal of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan. Mr. Tardif\u2019s says his Warden\u2019s ink has properties that make it fraud proof. Mr. Tardif is an eccentric and not representative, Mr. Brown said, but, in his observations, the pre-internet dealers did tend to lean right and male.Mr. Brown\u2019s wife, Aziza Asgarali, runs Gourmet Pens, a pen blog. \u201cJust to reveal how much of a pen nerd I am, we met when we were both guests on a fountain-pen podcast,\u201d Mr. Brown said. But even though the pen world contains a few female luminaries, like Beate Oblau at Lamy (known for riding a Ducati) and Regina Martini, a dealer specializing in vintage collectibles and Pelikan, \u201cfemale enthusiasts are less visible,\u201d Ms. Andreasen said. She knows how to de-rust a vintage ink reservoir and replace ancient cracked bladders, but four years ago she was belittled on the Fountain Pen Network forum by a male commenter who didn\u2019t like a millennial woman disagreeing with him. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to try again because the whole community is changing,\u201d Ms. Andreasen said.Mr. Brown\u2019s subscribers are global, many from India and Asia, where fountain pens are more common. But when Ms. Asgarali, whose parents came to Canada from Trinidad, was featured in a YouTube review with her husband, a commenter wrote: \u201cI used to respect you, but I don\u2019t now that I see you\u2019re married to a half negro.\u201d\u201cI guess this says less about the pen world,\u201d Mr. Brown said with a sigh, \u201cand more about the world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a pen brand. It is Sheaffer, not Schaeffer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside Facebook\u2019s Secret Rulebook for Global Political Speech", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "Under fire for stirring up distrust and violence, the social network has vowed to police its users. But leaked documents raise serious questions about its approach.Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 In a glass conference room at its California headquarters, Facebook is taking on the bonfires of hate and misinformation it has helped fuel across the world, one post at a time.But for Facebook, it\u2019s also a business problem.The company, which makes about $5 billion in profit per quarter, has to show that it is serious about removing dangerous content. It must also continue to attract more users from more countries and try to keep them on the site longer.How can Facebook monitor billions of posts per day in over 100 languages, all without disturbing the endless expansion that is core to its business? The company\u2019s solution: a network of workers using a maze of PowerPoint slides spelling out what\u2019s forbidden.Every other Tuesday morning, several dozen Facebook employees gather over breakfast to come up with the rules, hashing out what the site\u2019s two billion users should be allowed to say. The guidelines that emerge from these meetings are sent out to 7,500-plus moderators around the world. (After publication of this article, Facebook said it had increased that number to around 15,000.)The closely held rules are extensive, and they make the company a far more powerful arbiter of global speech than has been publicly recognized or acknowledged by the company itself, The New York Times has found.An examination of the files revealed numerous gaps, biases and outright errors. As Facebook employees grope for the right answers, they have allowed extremist language to flourish in some countries while censoring mainstream speech in others.Moderators were once told, for example, to remove fund-raising appeals for volcano victims in Indonesia because a co-sponsor of the drive was on Facebook\u2019s internal list of banned groups. In Myanmar, a paperwork error allowed a prominent extremist group, accused of fomenting genocide, to stay on the platform for months. In India, moderators were mistakenly told to flag for possible removal comments critical of religion.The Facebook employees who meet to set the guidelines, mostly young engineers and lawyers, try to distill highly complex issues into simple yes-or-no rules. Then the company outsources much of the actual post-by-post moderation to companies that enlist largely unskilled workers, many hired out of call centers.Those moderators, at times relying on Google Translate, have mere seconds to recall countless rules and apply them to the hundreds of posts that dash across their screens each day. When is a reference to \u201cjihad,\u201d for example, forbidden? When is a \u201ccrying laughter\u201d emoji a warning sign?Moderators express frustration at rules they say don\u2019t always make sense and sometimes require them to leave up posts they fear could lead to violence. \u201cYou feel like you killed someone by not acting,\u201d one said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he had signed a nondisclosure agreement.Facebook executives say they are working diligently to rid the platform of dangerous posts.\u201cIt\u2019s not our place to correct people\u2019s speech, but we do want to enforce our community standards on our platform,\u201d said Sara Su, a senior engineer on the News Feed. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in our community, we want to make sure that we\u2019re balancing freedom of expression and safety.\u201dMonika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy management, said that the primary goal was to prevent harm, and that to a great extent, the company had been successful. But perfection, she said, is not possible.\u201cWe have billions of posts every day, we\u2019re identifying more and more potential violations using our technical systems,\u201d Ms. Bickert said. \u201cAt that scale, even if you\u2019re 99 percent accurate, you\u2019re going to have a lot of mistakes.\u201dThe Facebook guidelines do not look like a handbook for regulating global politics. They consist of dozens of unorganized PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets with bureaucratic titles like \u201cWestern Balkans Hate Orgs and Figures\u201d and \u201cCredible Violence: Implementation standards.\u201dBecause Facebook drifted into this approach somewhat by accident, there is no single master file or overarching guide, just a patchwork of rules set out by different parts of the company. Facebook confirmed the authenticity of the documents, though it said some had been updated since The Times acquired them.The company\u2019s goal is ambitious: to reduce context-heavy questions that even legal experts might struggle with \u2014 when is an idea hateful, when is a rumor dangerous \u2014 to one-size-fits-all rules. By telling moderators to follow the rules blindly, Facebook hopes to guard against bias and to enforce consistency.Facebook says the files are only for training, but moderators say they are used as day-to-day reference materials.Taken individually, each rule might make sense. But in their byzantine totality, they can be a bit baffling.One document sets out several rules just to determine when a word like \u201cmartyr\u201d or \u201cjihad\u201d indicates pro-terrorism speech. Another describes when discussion of a barred group should be forbidden. Words like \u201cbrother\u201d or \u201ccomrade\u201d probably cross the line. So do any of a dozen emojis.The guidelines for identifying hate speech, a problem that has bedeviled Facebook, run to 200 jargon-filled, head-spinning pages. Moderators must sort a post into one of three \u201ctiers\u201d of severity. They must bear in mind lists like the six \u201cdesignated dehumanizing comparisons,\u201d among them comparing Jews to rats.\u201cThere\u2019s a real tension here between wanting to have nuances to account for every situation, and wanting to have a set of policies we can enforce accurately and we can explain cleanly,\u201d said Ms. Bickert, the Facebook executive.Though the Facebook employees who make the rules are largely free to set policy however they wish, and often do so in the room, they also consult with outside groups.\u201cWe\u2019re not drawing these lines in a vacuum,\u201d Ms. Bickert said.As detailed as the guidelines can be, they are also approximations \u2014 best guesses at how to fight extremism or disinformation. And they are leading Facebook to intrude into sensitive political matters the world over, sometimes clumsily.Increasingly, the decisions on what posts should be barred amount to regulating political speech \u2014 and not just on the fringes. In many countries, extremism and the mainstream are blurring.In June, according to internal emails reviewed by The Times, moderators were told to allow users to praise the Taliban \u2014 normally a forbidden practice \u2014 if they mentioned its decision to enter into a cease-fire. In another email, moderators were told to hunt down and remove rumors wrongly accusing an Israeli soldier of killing a Palestinian medic.\u201cFacebook\u2019s role has become so hegemonic, so monopolistic, that it has become a force unto itself,\u201d said Jasmin Mujanovic, an expert on the Balkans. \u201cNo one entity, especially not a for-profit venture like Facebook, should have that kind of power to influence public debate and policy.\u201dIn Pakistan, shortly before elections were held in July, Facebook issued its moderators a 40-page document outlining \u201cpolitical parties, expected trends and guidelines.\u201dPakistan, one of the world\u2019s largest and most fragile democracies, enforces an Election Day blackout on campaigning. Facebook is a center of news and discussion during voting.The document most likely shaped those conversations \u2014 even if Pakistanis themselves had no way of knowing it. Moderators were urged, in one instance, to apply extra scrutiny to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, a hard-line religious party. But another religious party, Jamaat-e-Islami, was described as \u201cbenign.\u201dThough Facebook says its focus is protecting users, the documents suggest that other concerns come into play. Pakistan guidelines warn moderators against creating a \u201cPR fire\u201d by taking any action that could \u201chave a negative impact on Facebook\u2019s reputation or even put the company at legal risk.\u201dIn India, Chinmayi Arun, a legal scholar, identified troubling mistakes in Facebook\u2019s guidelines.One slide tells moderators that any post degrading an entire religion violates Indian law and should be flagged for removal. It is a significant curb on speech \u2014 and apparently incorrect. Indian law prohibits blasphemy only in certain conditions, Ms. Arun said, such as when the speaker intends to inflame violence.Facebook says it is simply urging moderators to apply extra scrutiny to posts that use the phrase. Still, even this could chill activism in Kashmir. And it is not clear that the distinction will be obvious to moderators, who are warned that ignoring violations could get Facebook blocked in India.In the absence of governments or international bodies that can set standards, Facebook is experimenting on its own.The company never set out to play this role, but in an effort to control problems of its own creation, it has quietly become, with a speed that makes even employees uncomfortable, what is arguably one of the world\u2019s most powerful political regulators.\u201cA lot of this would be a lot easier if there were authoritative third parties that had the answer,\u201d said Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism expert who works with Facebook.\u201cSometimes these things explode really fast,\u201d Mr. Fishman said, \u201cand we have to figure out what our reaction\u2019s going to be, and we don\u2019t have time for the U.N.\u201dBut the results can be uneven.The slides are apparently written for English speakers relying on Google Translate, suggesting that Facebook remains short on moderators who speak local languages \u2014 and who might understand local contexts crucial for identifying inflammatory speech. And Google Translate can be unreliable: Mr. Mladic is referred to in one slide as \u201cRodney Young.\u201dThe guidelines, said Mr. Mujanovic, the Balkans expert, appear dangerously out of date. They have little to say about ultranationalist groups stoking political violence in the region.But puzzled activists in Myanmar say that, months later, posts supporting the group remain widespread.The culprit may be Facebook\u2019s own rulebooks. Guidelines for policing hate speech in Myanmar instruct moderators not to remove posts supporting Ma Ba Tha. Facebook corrected the mistake only in response to an inquiry from The Times.Employees also touted their decision to shut down Facebook accounts belonging to senior military officials in Myanmar.But the company did not initially notify Myanmar\u2019s government, leading the barred officers to conclude that they had been hacked. Some blamed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s de facto civilian leader, and the episode deepened distrust between her and the military, lawmakers say.Facebook\u2019s most politically consequential document may be an Excel spreadsheet that names every group and individual the company has quietly barred as a hate figure.Moderators are instructed to remove any post praising, supporting or representing any listed figure.Anton Shekhovtsov, an expert in far-right groups, said he was \u201cconfused about the methodology.\u201d The company bans an impressive array of American and British groups, he said, but relatively few in countries where the far right can be more violent, particularly Russia or Ukraine.Countries where Facebook faces government pressure seem to be better covered than those where it does not. Facebook blocks dozens of far-right groups in Germany, where the authorities scrutinize the social network, but only one in neighboring Austria.The list includes a growing number of groups with one foot in the political mainstream, like the far-right Golden Dawn, which holds seats in the Greek and European Union parliaments.For a tech company to draw these lines is \u201cextremely problematic,\u201d said Jonas Kaiser, a Harvard University expert on online extremism. \u201cIt puts social networks in the position to make judgment calls that are traditionally the job of the courts.\u201dThe bans are a kind of shortcut, said Sana Jaffrey, who studies Indonesian politics at the University of Chicago. Asking moderators to look for a banned name or logo is easier than asking them to make judgment calls about when political views are dangerous.But that means that in much of Asia and the Middle East, Facebook bans hard-line religious groups that represent significant segments of society. Blanket prohibitions, Ms. Jaffrey said, amount to Facebook shutting down one side in national debates.And its decisions often skew in favor of governments, which can fine or regulate Facebook.Kate Cronin-Furman, a Sri Lanka expert at University College London, said this prevented Tamils from memorializing the war, allowing the government to impose its version of events \u2014 entrenching Tamils\u2019 second-class status.Facebook\u2019s policies might emerge from well-appointed conference rooms, but they are executed largely by moderators in drab outsourcing offices in distant locations like Morocco and the Philippines.Facebook says moderators are given ample time to review posts and don\u2019t have quotas. Moderators say they face pressure to review about a thousand pieces of content per day. They have eight to 10 seconds for each post, longer for videos.The moderators describe feeling in over their heads. For some, pay is tied to speed and accuracy. Many last only a few exhausting months. Front-line moderators have few mechanisms for alerting Facebook to new threats or holes in the rules \u2014 and little incentive to try, one said.One moderator described an officewide rule to approve any post if no one on hand can read the appropriate language. This may have contributed to violence in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where posts encouraging ethnic cleansing were routinely allowed to stay up.Facebook says that any such practice would violate its rules, which include contingencies for reviewing posts in unfamiliar languages. Justin Osofsky, a Facebook vice president who oversees these contracts, said any corner-cutting probably came from midlevel managers at outside companies acting on their own.This hints at a deeper problem. Facebook has little visibility into the giant outsourcing companies, which largely police themselves, and has at times struggled to control them. And because Facebook relies on the companies to support its expansion, its leverage over them is limited.One hurdle to reining in inflammatory speech on Facebook may be Facebook itself. The platform relies on an algorithm that tends to promote the most provocative content, sometimes of the sort the company says it wants to suppress.Facebook could blunt that algorithm or slow the company\u2019s expansion into new markets, where it has proved most disruptive. But the social network instills in employees an almost unquestioned faith in their product as a force for good.When Ms. Su, the News Feed engineer, was asked if she believed research finding that more Facebook usage correlates with more violence, she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cAs we have greater reach, as we have more people engaging, that raises the stakes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think that there\u2019s greater opportunity for people to be exposed to new ideas.\u201dStill, even some executives hesitate when asked whether the company has found the right formula.Richard Allan, a London-based vice president who is also a sitting member of the House of Lords, said a better model might be \u201csome partnership arrangement\u201d with \u201cgovernment involved in setting the standards,\u201d even if not all governments can be trusted with this power.Mr. Fishman, the Facebook terrorism expert, said the company should consider deferring more decisions to moderators, who may better understand the nuances of local culture and politics.But at company headquarters, the most fundamental questions of all remain unanswered: What sorts of content lead directly to violence? When does the platform exacerbate social tensions?Rosa Birch, who leads an internal crisis team, said she and her colleagues had been posing these questions for years. They are making progress, she said, but will probably never have definitive answers.But without a full understanding of the platform\u2019s impact, most policies are just ad hoc responses to problems as they emerge. Employees make a tweak, wait to see what happens, then tweak again \u2014 as if repairing an airplane midflight.In the meantime, the company continues to expand its reach to more users in more countries.\u201cOne of the reasons why it\u2019s hard to talk about,\u201d Mr. Fishman said, \u201cis because there is a lack of societal agreement on where this sort of authority should lie.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cit\u2019s harder to figure out what a better alternative is.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a restriction imposed by Pakistan on Election Day. It applies to campaigning, not the news media.Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting from San Francisco; Paul Mozur from Yangon, Myanmar; and Amanda Taub from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of Privacy Began in the 1960s", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChoices that Congress made decades ago allowed tech giants to become as powerful as they are.Dr. O\u2019Mara, a professor of history, is the author of a forthcoming book about the history of Silicon Valley.The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to question Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, over allegations of bias in its algorithms, and energized Democrats are vowing to turn up the heat on tech companies over antitrust and privacy when they take over House leadership in January. There is a growing recognition in Silicon Valley and Washington that current data privacy regulations need to be changed. Understanding how American lawmakers approached these issues in the past is essential to getting it right this time.The mid-1960s were the heyday of punch-card-powered mainframe computers. In the two decades since their invention, digital machines had proved capable of processing a dizzying amount of information. Much of this data was personal, from medical information to military records to the type of cereal families bought at the supermarket, and there were no legal limits on what kind of data could be collected or by whom. The targeted marketing business until then had been largely left alone by regulators because it was so inexact. The computer age, however, transformed consumer targeting into a far more powerful science.Unnerving amounts of personal information now could be sucked into bureaucratic databases, Packard observed. \u201cThere are banks of giant memory machines that conceivably could recall in a few seconds every pertinent action \u2014 including failures, embarrassments or possibly incriminating acts \u2014 from the lifetime of each citizen,\u201d he wrote.The uproar killed the National Data Bank. Over 100 pieces of data privacy legislation were introduced over the following years. The few that passed were landmarks \u2014 the Freedom of Information Act in 1967, the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970, and the Privacy Act in 1974 \u2014 but all of them focused on individuals\u2019 right to know about the information these databases held. None addressed the question of whether this information should have been gathered in the first place.In being so relentlessly focused on the government\u2019s use and abuse of data, Congress paid little attention to what private industry was doing. American companies remained free to gather data on the people who used their products. Congress is again wrestling with the balance between freedom of information and the right to privacy. Proposals for greater transparency \u2014 such as labeling bots so people know when they are interacting with a machine, and providing access for consumers to the data that companies obtain about them \u2014 are important first steps. But industry and lawmakers need to take a hard look at the data that companies are allowed to collect in the first place.Congress should recognize what it did not half a century ago: protecting privacy is bigger than quashing one databank, condemning one company or curbing one industry. And the decisions made now will shape technological generations to come.The computer never forgets.

{"Headline": "Finding a Story at the Trumps\u2019 Dinner Table", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderSeveral months ago, I was lingering over dessert at a restaurant where I am slightly acquainted with the chef, who came out of a quieting kitchen to join me. The conversation, as it often does in Washington, turned to the discernible changes in the dining scene since President Trump, who is known to dine almost exclusively at home, came to town.Things were largely moving along just fine \u2014 new outposts for Laotian fare had opened up, along with charred steak joints, exciting taquerias and Chesapeake oyster houses \u2014 but he noted with regret that Washington chefs were no longer making the scene at the White House. No more cookouts on the South Lawn. No more helping in the staff\u2019s mess, or taking trips around the world as culinary ambassadors on behalf of the State Department. Basta, pasta.I wondered if his was a pervasive view. Finding out would marry two of my long-term reporting interests \u2014 politics and food \u2014 and I would probably learn about five new restaurants along the way. Appetites thrive in darkness!During previous administrations, Washington\u2019s chefs played a role in spreading diplomacy with other countries \u2014 for instance, participating in Michelle Obama\u2019s healthy eating campaign and promoting the White House garden \u2014 and cooked for White House staff from time to time. It seems the fixations with gardening, dining out and chef culture that marked the Obama White House have gone away, one of many shifts in the culture and policy priorities that come with changes in any administration.In fact, restaurateurs in Washington, a place with ever-shifting partisan power dynamics, tend to take pains to avoid partisanship. The hospitality business thrives on volume, and taking positions against a large chunk of the city\u2019s population is just a bad business plan.Even the chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s \u2014 who had long concerned himself with humanitarian issues \u2014 was not really overtly political before he pulled out of his planned restaurant in the Trump International Hotel after Mr. Trump opened his presidential campaign with derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants.Chefs I spoke with almost uniformly agreed that they were no longer wanted in the president\u2019s house even as its denizens were welcome in theirs. But then I began to wonder about the history of professional cooking in the White House.She did, however, share some good kitchen tales she learned from her husband of both of the Johnson daughters\u2019 weddings, the difficulties surrounding a last minute Middle East peace accord dinner, her sadness over the fact that butlers had been replaced with plated dishes at formal White House dinners and her amazement that government cooking, historically a low-paying difficult gig, was now a coveted treat. Little of this had anything to do with what I was writing about, but I could have talked to Mrs. Haller all day. (I confess the feeling did not seem to be mutual.)How and what presidents eat \u2014 and how the White House chooses to meet those desires \u2014 I suspect, will always be of interest to Americans, in part for the voyeurism into the life of the first family, but also because those interests often chart food trends for a hungry nation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 3 Biggest Challenges for Tech in 2019", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow privacy, security and employee protests will shape the year ahead for Silicon Valley. Ms. Fowler is an editor in the Opinion section.If you thought 2018 was a bad year for tech, 2019 might turn out to be even worse. This year was filled with revelations about privacy, security and cyberwarfare. Next year, the consequences of those revelations will unfold. And we should be very worried about what the future holds. Privacy Is DeadAnd perhaps worse is what the future holds. We most likely aren\u2019t aware of all the companies that hold our personal data and what they are doing with it: the social media companies that know us as well as our friends do, the financial technology companies that sell our bank account transaction data, the messaging apps that hold our private photos and texts.Many of us will delete apps. We will disable as much tracking as we can on our phones. We will delete our Facebook accounts. We will delete our social media histories and old emails and text messages. But it won\u2019t be enough because most people will not care: The trade-off between privacy and convenience will be worth it to them, because the loss of their privacy will have little to no impact on their day-to-day life. Most people will read (or perhaps ignore) the news stories about every new privacy scandal, and they will then go back to their phones. The End of SecurityIt\u2019s not clear that these breaches were a result of poor security practices or corporate negligence. The truth is \u2014 and I say this as someone who has worked in Silicon Valley as an engineer \u2014 the security teams and security practices at Google and Facebook are among the best in the world. It\u2019s not clear that stronger punishments or more regulation will fix the problem or prevent these kinds of data breaches from happening.There\u2019s a lot at stake. The spies from foreign governments hacking into American companies aren\u2019t trying to destroy you, me or any specific individuals living in the United States \u2014 they are trying to destroy the country that we live in.Tech\u2019s Anti-Government StanceAn earlier version of this article incorrectly included Google+ among a series of hacked web services in 2018.

{"Headline": "Wielding Rocks and Knives, Arizonans Attack Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHANDLER, Ariz. \u2014 The assailant slipped out of a park around noon one day in October, zeroing in on his target, which was idling at a nearby intersection \u2014 a self-driving van operated by Waymo, the driverless-car company spun out of Google.He carried out his attack with an unidentified sharp object, swiftly slashing one of the tires. The suspect, identified as a white man in his 20s, then melted into the neighborhood on foot.The slashing was one of nearly two dozen attacks on driverless vehicles over the past two years in Chandler, a city near Phoenix where Waymo started testing its vans in 2017. In ways large and small, the city has had an early look at public misgivings over the rise of artificial intelligence, with city officials hearing complaints about everything from safety to possible job losses.Some people have pelted Waymo vans with rocks, according to police reports. Others have repeatedly tried to run the vehicles off the road. One woman screamed at one of the vans, telling it to get out of her suburban neighborhood. A man pulled up alongside a Waymo vehicle and threatened the employee riding inside with a piece of PVC pipe.\u201cThere are other places they can test,\u201d said Erik O\u2019Polka, 37, who was issued a warning by the police in November after multiple reports that his Jeep Wrangler had tried to run Waymo vans off the road \u2014 in one case, driving head-on toward one of the self-driving vehicles until it was forced to come to an abrupt stop.His wife, Elizabeth, 35, admitted in an interview that her husband \u201cfinds it entertaining to brake hard\u201d in front of the self-driving vans, and that she herself \u201cmay have forced them to pull over\u201d so she could yell at them to get out of their neighborhood. The trouble started, the couple said, when their 10-year-old son was nearly hit by one of the vehicles while he was playing in a nearby cul-de-sac.\u201cThey said they need real-world examples, but I don\u2019t want to be their real-world mistake,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Polka, who runs his own company providing information technology to small businesses.\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask us if we wanted to be part of their beta test,\u201d added his wife, who helps run the business.\u201cPeople are lashing out justifiably,\" said Douglas Rushkoff, a media theorist at City University of New York and author of the book \u201cThrowing Rocks at the Google Bus.\u201d He likened driverless cars to robotic incarnations of scabs \u2014 workers who refuse to join strikes or who take the place of those on strike.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense that the giant corporations honing driverless technologies do not have our best interests at heart,\u201d Mr. Rushkoff said. \u201cJust think about the humans inside these vehicles, who are essentially training the artificial intelligence that will replace them.\u201dThe emergency drivers in the Waymo vans that were attacked in various cases told the Chandler police that the company preferred not to pursue prosecution of the assailants.In some of their reports, police officers also said Waymo was often unwilling to provide video of the attacks. In one case, a Waymo employee told the police they would need a warrant to obtain video recorded by the company\u2019s vehicles.Officer William Johnson of the Chandler Police Department described in a June report how the driver of a Chrysler PT Cruiser wove between lanes of traffic while taunting a Waymo van.A manager at Waymo showed video images of the incident to Officer Johnson but did not allow the police to keep them for a more thorough investigation. According to Officer Johnson\u2019s report, the manager said that the company did not want to pursue the matter, emphasizing that Waymo was worried about disruptions of its testing in Chandler.The report said Waymo was concerned about the effect the attacks were having on its emergency drivers, who are intended to remain in monitoring mode. \u201cThe behavior is causing the drivers to resume manual mode over the automated mode because of concerns about what the driver of the other vehicle may do,\u201d Officer Johnson wrote.In a statement, a Waymo spokeswoman said the attacks involved only a small fraction of the more than 25,000 miles that the company\u2019s vans log every day in Arizona.\u201cSafety is the core of everything we do, which means that keeping our drivers, our riders, and the public safe is our top priority,\u201d said Alexis Georgeson, the Waymo spokeswoman. \u201cOver the past two years, we've found Arizonans to be welcoming and excited by the potential of this technology to make our roads safer.\u201dMs. Georgeson said the company took the safety of its emergency drivers seriously and disputed claims that Waymo was trying to avoid bad publicity by opting against pursuing criminal charges.\u201cWe report incidents we deem to pose a danger and we have provided photos and videos to local law enforcement when reporting these acts of vandalism or assault,\u201d Ms. Georgeson said. \u201cWe support our drivers and engage in cases where an act of vandalism has been perpetrated against us.\u201d\u201cDon't let individual criminals throwing rocks or slashing tires derail efforts to drive the future of transportation,\u201d Mr. Antoniak said.But the official welcome mat has failed to persuade the naysayers.One of them, Charles Pinkham, 37, was standing in the street in front of a Waymo vehicle in Chandler one evening in August when he was approached by the police.\u201cPinkham was heavily intoxicated, and his demeanor varied from calm to belligerent and agitated during my contact with him,\u201d Officer Richard Rimbach wrote in his report. \u201cHe stated he was sick and tired of the Waymo vehicles driving in his neighborhood, and apparently thought the best idea to resolve this was to stand in front of these vehicles.\u201dIt worked, apparently. The Waymo employee inside the van, Candice Dunson, opted against filing charges and told the police that the company preferred to stop routing vehicles to the area.Mr. Pinkham got a warning. The van moved on.Jonathan Higuera contributed reporting. Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re and Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christmas Fudge and Misremembered Snow Cream ", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesWhen it comes to memories, we each cling to our version like honey on a measuring spoon.My granny was not a traditional Southern home cook. I was an adult before I realized turkey could be something more than a dry vehicle for ketchup. Dinner with the grandparents was likely to include a kid\u2019s meal toy. Yet, like all Southern women, my grandmother had one or two recipes for which she was \u201cknown.\u201d If you have ever been to a church homecoming picnic, you\u2019ve experienced this phenomenon. Bessie makes the best potato salad; Tom\u2019s wife, Mildred, has a lemon icebox cake that is to die for; and Susan\u2019s casseroles are out of this world.For my granny, it was her Christmas fudge.Each year, I stood on a chair pulled up to the counter as she measured ingredients, her watchful eye on the pot of boiling sugar. My eyes followed the large metal spoon as she quickly dipped it into the bubbling mixture and drizzled the syrup into a glass measuring cup full of ice-cold water. Without hesitation, her hand plunged into the glass and rolled the transformed sugar between her fingers.She made the perfect fudge. External flakiness gives way to something both creamy and slightly gritty with sugar. Sweet, but not too. All qualities that could apply to the women in my family as much as the fudge.We are all certain that we remember seeing the recipe, handwritten on an index card. Or was it lined paper? Was it in a file box or a notebook? By the time I stood at the counter watching the strands of liquid coalesce, my grandmother had long since committed it to memory. We know the written recipe existed, but nobody has seen it since she died. We have never perfectly recreated her fudge.Memory gets us only so far.They may be lost to time, but we do have a record of the day, and of my red nose, because my aunt held a breadbox-sized camcorder to capture the scene on videotape. Wearing my father\u2019s U.N.C. sweatshirt, with the cuffs rolled several times, I looked up from the snow and said, \u201cThis is our first white Christmas since record-keeping began.\u201dToday it seems like our every moment is recorded. The massive video camera has shrunk to fit in our pockets. Back in 1989, after the red light was turned off and life was no longer preserved on Mylar, we trudged inside for snow cream.We carefully scraped the top layer of snow into a bowl, avoiding twigs and leaves. With mittened hands, we took our precious delicacy into the house and poured on sweetened condensed milk to make nature\u2019s ice cream. I always loved adding chocolate syrup.It was not haute cuisine. But the allure of this dish was not about the taste. It was the thrilling risk of taking something so rare from the outdoors \u2014 something that might even be slightly polluted \u2014 and turning it into food.I\u2019ve been surprised, as an adult, to find that not everyone has childhood stories of snow cream.Recently, my sister and I explained the recipe and process to the uninitiated. My aunt jumped in, \u201cIt was never condensed milk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has always been evaporated milk and sugar.\u201dWhen it comes to memories, we cling to our version like honey on a measuring spoon.My sister and I are both certain that we recall the slow pour of condensed milk as it edged its way toward the frozen concoction. Today this is the recipe that tastes like childhood. It is jarring to discover a reminiscence so cherished has been inaccurate, even when the subject is as inconsequential as snow and sweetened milk.What else might be inaccurate in my version of our family\u2019s history? Was my grandmother\u2019s fudge actually as outstanding as I recall? My aunt\u2019s challenge to my memory made me feel as though tiny pieces of my grandmother were being pulled away. My family takes its few cherished recipes seriously. My snow cream failure seemed like a personal affront to the dead.I slipped my hands into my granny\u2019s tan driving gloves to collect the one thing we all agree we need for snow cream: a big pile of snow, as dazzling and ephemeral as memory itself. These gloves, one of the last physical connections I have with her, have become threadbare. Soon, the memories will be all I have.The accuracy of recollection seems to matter less and less in modern life. You can use technology to find your way to an old friend\u2019s house or remind you where you parked your car. Google quickly resolves any arguments over who won the World Series or the best actor award in any given year. Nostalgia, on the other hand, is unconcerned with truth.Imperfections in our personal narratives don\u2019t render our pasts obsolete. It does not matter if we stand in our kitchen today with sweetened condensed milk or evaporated milk and sugar. The vital piece of memory is being at the counter together in the first place.I take a deep breath and mentally place myself in my grandparents\u2019 house 25 years ago. My granny is sitting in her spot on the couch, cigarette in hand. The cushion under her small frame has sunken slightly from years of use and a Childcraft encyclopedia evens out a broken chair leg. My mom is reading a paperback on the love seat. My grandpa is asleep in the recliner as the occasional snore makes its way through his loose-jawed mouth.The heavy curtains are tinged with nicotine and tar. I feel the shaggy brown carpet under my arms as I stretch lazily across the room, listening to Granny\u2019s stories of hurricanes, tornadoes and house fires.

But they believe it to be much deeper.Its other distinguishing feature is a gushing river formed by melting glaciers above. It exits the cave about 1.3 miles away through another opening, called a resurgence.Mr. Pollack took hundreds of photographs from various heights in the helicopter and stitched them together to create the 3D rendering above.\u201cCaves are hard to measure because they\u2019re so irregular,\u201d said Mr. Pollack, who has been surveying them since the late 1960s.\u201cThere\u2019s an art to it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not just collecting data; you\u2019re filling in the blanks.\u201dMr. Hollis was the person on the September expedition who descended into the cave. He carried about 50 pounds of gear, including a hulking battery-powered hammer drill to set bolts into the rock and about 500 feet of rope.\u201cIn my 30-plus years of caving, this is by far the biggest pit that I\u2019ve had the privilege to descend,\u201d he said.According to Dr. Hickson, the cave is most likely tens of thousands of years old, and the rocks are hundreds of millions of years old.They\u2019re what\u2019s known as \u201cstripe karst,\u201d which means layers of marble, schist and quartzite that, over millenniums of pressure and heat, have fused together to form a stripelike pattern.Mr. Hollis descended about 280 feet into the maw of the cave as the cascade roared. Because the cave is in a shaded area, the bottom of the pit was full of last winter\u2019s snow, creating a misty haze.The September expedition took about 10 hours. The team is planning to make at least two more forays between now and 2020.\u201cAs a geologist, there aren\u2019t necessarily a lot of things we do that excite people,\u201d said Dr. Hickson.But there is a mystery here, she said. \u201cCaving is all about the exploration of the unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turning Smythson\u2019s Heritage into Sales (He Hopes)", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When Luc Goidadin left his job last year as chief design officer of Burberry, the company where he had spent 16 years in various creative positions, he was ready for a change.\u201cThe scale was quite huge when I left,\u201d he said recently, sitting in his office near Sloane Square, in London\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood. \u201cI knew I wanted something smaller and more specialized.\u201d\u201cI love brands with history,\u201d said Mr. Goidadin, 43. \u201cIt gives you a passport to be daring and push things, to use the history as a diagram between past and present and add a story.\u201dMr. Goidadin\u2019s first full collection for Smythson won\u2019t arrive in stores until July \u2014 a company spokeswoman said the timing of his arrival was the reason for the almost 18 month gap. But some of his initial designs are already available online and in selected boutiques, including the brand\u2019s Madison Avenue store.For women, for example, there is the small structured Wigmore crossbody purse, based on a bag originally created in 1910 by the brand\u2019s founder, Frank Smythson, to hold sheet music. It is being offered in millennial-attracting metallic petrol blue, as well as gold and, soon, pink. (At $1,895, it is not exactly millennial-priced, although a version in more sober colors, like burgundy, is several hundred dollars less.) In the men\u2019s selection, there\u2019s a classic black leather duffel, tweaked with a thick stripe of Yves Klein blue, an addition to the Burlington collection and listed at $2,395. Also available are new leather notebooks, hot-pressed with words like \u201cFierce\u201d and \u201cWow\u201d in archival fonts on their covers.For inspiration, Mr. Goidadin said, he and his team of six regularly delve through the brand\u2019s archives, stored in a windowless, shelf-lined room in the basement of Smythson\u2019s New Bond Street flagship. (The brand has 10 boutiques, including a sale shop at the Bicester Village outlet mall near Oxford, and is stocked in major department stores around the world, like Barneys New York, Harvey Nichols and Le Bon March\u00e9.)\u201cThere\u2019s no point in coming to a brand like Smythson and being completely insensitive and doing something that\u2019s unrelated,\u201d Mr. Goidadin said.The brand has long stressed its history, its website noting, among other distinctions, that Mr. Smythson created the first practical, portable datebook in 1908; the company customized address books for Katharine Hepburn in 1955; and, as a supplier to Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip and Prince Charles, it holds three royal warrants.Mr. Goidadin\u2019s fans say he has a flair for working with heritage. \u201cHe was always able to look at historical references and make sense of how they were created for that time and then express them for this moment that we\u2019re living in,\u201d said Christopher Bailey, the former Burberry chief creative officer and president, who hired Mr. Goidadin soon after joining the company in 2001.Yet the designer also had a practical side, said Rose Marie Bravo, Burberry\u2019s chief executive from 1997 until 2006. \u201cBurberry was one of the brands that, yes, wanted to be part of the fashion world, but we also wanted to sell \u2014 we had a business and we needed to be commercially viable,\u201d she said. \u201cLuc was one of the designers that understood that and said, \u2018Yes, it has to be beautiful and make a statement but we also need to sell\u2019.\u201dJust as Mr. Goidadin left Burberry at a time of change ( Mr. Bailey had stepped down and Riccardo Tisci would soon take over as chief creative officer) he arrived at Smythson during turbulence, too.Jacques Bahbout, Smythson\u2019s owner and chairman, also had been filling in as chief executive since 2016. Then, in October, the chief executive\u2019s post was taken by Xavier Rougeaux, Smythson\u2019s former chief commercial officer.And in its fiscal year ending March 2017, the most recent figures available, Smythson had global sales of 37 million pounds, or $47.23 million, and losses of nearly \u00a33 million.Presumably, part of Mr. Goidadin\u2019s appeal to Smythson was the growth achieved during his tenure at Burberry. \u201cIt is an obvious place for them to look for talent,\u201d said Thoma\u00ef Serdari, an adjunct associate professor of marketing at N.Y.U. Stern School of Business and founder of the strategic branding company Brand(x)Lux. \u201cIt\u2019s a very successful story of a company that has been transformed from a singular product company into a fashion company.\u201d (She was referring to the Burberry trench coat; Thomas Burberry invented gabardine in 1879 and first sold raincoats to the British Army in 1901.)\u201cIt will be very interesting to see how Smythson moves from a very specific category of leather goods to other brand extensions,\u201d Ms. Serdari added.Certainly the brand\u2019s strong association with engraved stationery and gilt-edged diaries doesn\u2019t make things easy in an era of Evernote and Google Calendar. But Mr. Goidadin said he has no plans to abandon those core categories, especially the notebooks and paper goods that he called \u201cone of the brand\u2019s greatest assets.\u201d He is reworking some items \u2014 like more handbags inspired by archival pieces and a series of diaries with specialized content on subjects like food and the arts, expanding the concept of Smythson\u2019s current Fashion and Sports diaries \u2014 and adding new ones, like scarves in silk and cashmere. (The company\u2019s line now ranges from a 10-piece notecard set, at $25, to a large calfskin backgammon set or a cuff link box with battery-powered compartments to wind two watches automatically, each selling for $4,395.)Although he has lived in London for many years, Mr. Goidadin was born in Geneva, the son of a French father and a British mother who both worked for CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Even as a child in Switzerland, he said, he felt especially British \u2014 partly because of regular visits to his maternal grandmother, whose attention to fashion details, like shoes and handbags that always matched, left a mark.\u201cHe\u2019s the most English person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Mr. Bailey said with a laugh. \u201cBiologically he is half-English, but he\u2019s a Brit from the inside.\u201dMr. Goidadin intended to become a lawyer, but a yearlong art course that he took in what was intended to be a gap year changed his path. He earned fashion degrees from Central St. Martins and the Royal College of Art, both in London, and worked at Max Mara and Mugler before joining Burberry in 2001.He has, perhaps not coincidentally, had a soft spot for notebooks since he was a child, when he drew during family drives to keep himself entertained. In the Victorian house he shares with his partner, Nick Quinn, a literary agent, located a few District Line stops from his office, there is a room that stores hundreds of notebooks, each partially filled with drawings.\u201cI\u2019m a complete sketchbook addict,\u201d he admitted.His notebooks as a child were, incidentally, not as grand as the leather-bound ones he now works with. \u201cThey weren\u2019t Smythson, because obviously that would\u2019ve been slightly expensive,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Zealand Rebukes Google for Airing Name of Suspect in Backpacker\u2019s Killing", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 The New Zealand government admonished Google on Friday for disclosing the identity of a man charged with killing a female British backpacker, highlighting the tension that arises when local courts order the suppression of information that can be easily found online.Google executives from the United States and Britain are set to travel to New Zealand to meet with Andrew Little, the justice minister, on Tuesday. Mr. Little is demanding that the company change its algorithms to ensure that material published outside New Zealand that violates local court suppression orders is not visible in the country.The man\u2019s name has been suppressed under a legal provision often invoked by defendants in New Zealand that is meant to guarantee fair trials, and it was not released by local reporters.But several British media outlets published it, and on Thursday Google included the man\u2019s name in the subject line of an email sent to people in New Zealand who subscribe to a service that highlights local topics that are trending online.\u201cWhen we receive valid court orders, including suppression orders, we review and respond appropriately,\u201d the statement said, adding that Google respected New Zealand\u2019s laws.Mr. Little, the justice minister, said he took \u201cwith a grain of salt\u201d the suggestion that Google did not know, or would expect to be told, about suppression orders in the case.\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to change their algorithm, because it\u2019s not right that they think they can get away with undermining fair trial rights,\u201d he said.Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and a former Google employee, said it was a \u201cscary standard\u201d to say Google \u201cshould have known\u201d about a suppression order in New Zealand.\u201cIf that applies, that means they would have to actively monitor every court case going on in the world, looking for names and pre-emptively taking them down,\u201d he said.Mr. Little said he also planned to contact British publications that published the man\u2019s name, adding that they could have gotten it only from reporters in New Zealand who found it in court filings in Auckland.\u201cI don\u2019t have any legal pressure to put on them,\u201d he said, adding that he did have \u201cmoral pressure, which I will be applying as hard and as fast as I can.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t accept their arrogance and their conceit in saying that it\u2019s nothing to do with them and New Zealand\u2019s laws are New Zealand\u2019s laws,\u201d he added.It was not clear whether the email about trending topics that breached the suppression order originated at the company\u2019s operations in New Zealand or in another country, and whether it fell within New Zealand\u2019s legal jurisdiction.A spokesman, Taj Meadows, did not address where the email originated, but said it had been received by fewer than a few hundred people.Mr. Little rejected the idea that the internet\u2019s existence had rendered name suppression orders irrelevant.He said he planned to ask the Google executives whether there was a problem with the company\u2019s algorithms that allowed suppressed information to be distributed widely, and, if so, whether Google would take action to fix it.If not, Mr. Little said he would consider a campaign that \u201cmight take years\u201d to persuade other countries to agree to a treaty stating \u201cthat orders issued in one country can be enforced in another.\u201d\u201cThat way, publishers and republishers like Google don\u2019t have the excuse that they\u2019re not responsible, the law can\u2019t be enforced, and they don\u2019t even have to worry about it,\u201d he said.Professor Tsui, the former Google employee, said such an approach was not feasible.\u201cThat solution would cause so many other problems that we really wouldn\u2019t want to go there,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Cellphones Aren\u2019t Safe", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySecurity flaws threaten our privacy and bank accounts. So why aren\u2019t we fixing them?Mr. Quintin is a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.This should be at the top of our cybersecurity agenda, yet policymakers and industry leaders have been nearly silent on the issue. While government officials are looking the other way, an increasing number of companies are selling products that allow buyers to take advantage of these vulnerabilities. How did we get here, and why is our cellular infrastructure so insecure? The international mobile communications system is built on top of several layers of technology, parts of which are more than 40 years old. Some of these old technologies are insecure, others have never had a proper audit and many simply haven\u2019t received the attention needed to secure them properly. The protocols that form the underpinnings of the mobile system weren\u2019t built with security in mind.Another protocol, GSM, invented in 1991, allows your cellphone to communicate with a cell tower to make and receive calls and transmit data. The older generation of GSM, known as 2G, doesn\u2019t verify that the tower that your phone connects to is authentic, making it easy for anyone to use a cell-site simulator and impersonate a cell tower to obtain your location or eavesdrop on your communications. The lack of action could be because it is a big task \u2014 there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist. This needs to change. To start, companies need to stop supporting insecure technologies such as 2G, and government needs a mandate to buy devices solely from companies that have disabled 2G. Similarly, companies need to work with cybersecurity experts on a security standard for SS7. Government should buy services only from companies that can demonstrate that their networks meet this standard.Finally, this problem can\u2019t be solved by domestic regulation alone. The cellular communications system is international, and it will take an international effort to secure it. We wouldn\u2019t tolerate gaping potholes in our highways or sparking power lines. Securing our mobile infrastructure is just as imperative. Policymakers and industries around the world must work together to achieve this common goal.Cooper Quintin is a senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where he investigates digital privacy and security threats to human-rights defenders, journalists and vulnerable populations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Asked a Mississippi Senator to Refund Donations. They Are Still Waiting.", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When video surfaced last month of Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi telling a supporter she would be \u201con the front row\u201d if he invited her to a \u201cpublic hanging,\u201d some of the country\u2019s largest corporations found themselves in a public relations nightmare.Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign told at least one company, Walmart, on Thursday that it did not intend to refund its money. What it did not say: The campaign is out of money anyway after a frantic push to the finish line, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the finances.Another company, the drugmaker Amgen, said that it had been able to cancel a $5,000 check before it was cashed by the campaign, but that it was still waiting for another $4,000 in earlier contributions to be returned.A host of other companies, including some of the nation\u2019s largest, said they had not received checks or even a promise of returns. Among them were AT&T, Union Pacific, Aetna and Pfizer. Google and Facebook, which had also requested refunds, did not return requests for comment.But she is not required to return the contributions, and on the campaign trail she never said she would do so. Federal law and campaign finance regulations require only that campaign committees refund prohibited or illegal contributions or checks that exceed the maximum allowable dollar amount.\u201cIn other words, the act and regulations don\u2019t mandate refunds upon request,\u201d said Judith Ingram, a spokeswoman for the Federal Election Commission.Ms. Hyde-Smith declined to discuss the refund requests. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a list,\u201d she said briskly in the Capitol, referring additional questions to her campaign. On Friday, a top campaign official declined to comment on the matter.The senator\u2019s decision not to return the money puts many of the companies in a difficult position. Corporate giving is typically handled by government affairs specialists in Washington and funneled through a company\u2019s political action committee to help smooth relationships with lawmakers. But the companies have little recourse or even incentive to demand the money at this point. And they will have to decide soon whether to support Ms. Hyde-Smith in her re-election campaign in 2020.Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s \u201cpublic hanging\u201d comments, which surfaced in November in the run-up to a special election to fill the seat of Senator Thad Cochran, helped infuse the contest with questions about race and racism.Her problems worsened with the release of a second video that appeared to show her joking about voter suppression, but which her campaign said was selectively edited.Walmart, the country\u2019s largest retailer, said that \u201cSen. Hyde-Smith\u2019s recent comments clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates\u201d and asked for its $4,000 contribution back.Union Pacific, one of the country\u2019s largest rail systems, wrote on Twitter that it \u201cin no way, shape or form condones or supports divisive or perceived to be divisive statements.\u201dAnd a spokeswoman for Boston Scientific, a medical device maker, which last month issued a tweet announcing that \u201cwe reject the Senator\u2019s statements, which are not aligned with our company\u2019s core values,\u201d said Thursday that the company had followed up several times with the campaign about its donation, without luck.Advertisement"}

Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.\u201cDie Hard,\u201d the movie that gambles a $5 million salary on Bruce Willis, has to be the most excessive film around. It piles every known element of the action genre onto the flimsy story of a New York cop who rescues hostages from a Los Angeles office tower on Christmas Eve. Partly an interracial buddy movie, partly the sentimental tale of a ruptured marriage, the film is largely a special-effects carnival full of machine-gun fire, roaring helicopters and an exploding tank. It also has a villain fresh from the Royal Shakespeare Company, a thug from the Bolshoi Ballet and a hero who carries with him the smirks and wisecracks that helped make \u201cMoonlighting\u201d a television hit. The strange thing is, it works: \u201cDie Hard\u201d is exceedingly stupid, but escapist fun.The film\u2019s producers and director were also responsible for the Arnold Schwarzenegger hit \u201cPredator.\u201d Here they graft the Schwarzenegger-style comic hero onto Mr. Willis\u2019s boyish, mischievous \u201cMoonlighting\u201d persona, and send this new creature sauntering into \u201cThe Towering Inferno.\u201dThere is a slow half-hour at the start, when John McClane (Mr. Willis) lands in Los Angeles to visit his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and goes to her office Christmas party. Minutes later, a group of terrorists shows up, planning to steal $6 million in bonds. The terrorists have to crack a difficult computer code before getting into the vault, so there is plenty of time for McClane to play hero.Mr. Willis\u2019s true expertise is in banter, so the director, John McTiernan, shrewdly blends bursts of action with comic dialogue. McClane races up and down elevator shafts. He kills one terrorist, taking his machine gun and citizens\u2019 band radio. Now he can have a running conversation with Al, the sympathetic black cop who arrives first at the scene. Al (played by Reginald Veljohnson) becomes part of the only buddy film where the friends don\u2019t meet until the story is over.Meanwhile, back in the executive suite, there is Hans, the ruthless terrorist leader in a very well-tailored suit. He is the film\u2019s best surprise, played by Alan Rickman, who was recently the seductive, manipulative Valmont in the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s stage production of \u201cLes Liaisons Dangereuses.\u201d Here, he makes Hans a perfect snake. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he superciliously asks McClane via radio. \u201cAre you just another American who saw too many movies as a child?\u201dWell, yes, he did. McClane is a movie maverick, who asks to be called Roy, because he always liked Roy Rogers\u2019s fancy shirts. Here, he walks around in a sleeveless undershirt, a tattoo on his left bicep, getting sweatier and dirtier and bloodier by the minute. A great part of the film\u2019s appeal is in watching the down-and-dirty cop match wits with the aloof master criminal. The film makers even have the wit to play the \u201cOde to Joy\u201d when Hans finally walks into the opened vault.\u201cDie Hard,\u201d which opens today at the Baronet and Criterion Center, has more than its share of bloody moments and blasted bodies, and it has some abysmal scenes as well. The former ballet star Alexander Godunov is a conspicuous terrorist, jumping around the set in a basic black costume and flowing blond hair. As the brother of McClane\u2019s first victim, he gets to say things like \u201cI want blood!\u201d And when McClane realizes he has been too hard on his wife, he radios an unintentionally funny message to Al: \u201cTell her that she is the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Year That Bill de Blasio Became Donald Trump* and 9 Other Improbable Transformations", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityThe drama of the past year played out locally in big civic and social changes: surprise political upsets and reversals, decent reputations gone bad and bad reputations gone much worse. Here, a highly subjective (and in some cases exaggerated) list of who and what seemed to morph into someone or something else.When Bill de Blasio Became Donald Trump (*Wait, what?)When an Unknown Bartender Became a Che Guevara T-shirtAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez rose from obscurity over the summer to defeat longtime incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary to represent the city\u2019s 14th Congressional district. But that is easily the dullest and least relevant way to describe her change of fortune. On the left she has become a symbol of working-class grievance, of an urban youth class mired in student debt and locked out of domestic comforts by a national housing crisis. On the right she has become a lightning rod for those who fear and loathe a rising progressive energy. Is she weak on policy? Does it matter? She is leading an emotionally charged movement.When Andrew Cuomo Became the Bartender Who Became the Che Guevara T-shirtWhen the New York City Housing Authority Became the Ultimate SlumlordIn June the federal government delivered a brutal rebuke to the nation\u2019s biggest public housing authority, accusing it of gross mismanagement and failure to provide a safe living environment for residents, especially children who had been exposed to lead paint. The city was supposed to move quickly making repairs; it didn\u2019t. Reports of squalid conditions continue, and in one complex, thousands of residents didn\u2019t have heat or hot water on Thanksgiving.When Amazon Became Philip MorrisSo it turned out that Amazon was more or less just kidding when it solicited proposals from cities around the country hoping to be home to the company\u2019s second headquarters. The company affirmed its elitist commitments when it chose to locate in New York and suburban Washington over, say, Detroit or Pittsburgh. And while that was maddening enough to plenty of urbanists, many New Yorkers have greeted the impending arrival of Amazon with a rage toward the company that was not necessarily foreseeable. Amazon\u2019s encroachment into Queens, where the terror is that it will drive housing prices up even further and deny jobs to the people who really need them, has made the retailer the brightest new emblem of corporate malevolence.When Sheryl Sandberg Became Ayn RandMany women in New York\u2019s pop intellectual and publishing communities embraced Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s book \u201cLean In\u2019\u2019 when it came out a few years ago. Its simple advice for female empowerment: Women need to just buck up and assert themselves if they wanted more from the patriarchy. For some of us \u2014 I will say smugly \u2014 that did not pass the feminism smell test.When Juul Became CrackWhen Rudy Giuliani Became Alex JonesWhen New York Became PeoriaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Britain, a Team Effort to Help Local News Survive", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When Lucy Ashton quit The Sheffield Star in 2009 to have children and work in public relations, she had already seen other reporters steadily leaving the paper as circulation and advertising fell, and figured she\u2019d never see jobs being added again.Now she has returned, as part of a new initiative with a simple goal: to help news organizations cover local government.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t on the agenda,\u201d Ms. Ashton said. \u201cWithout a reporter at that meeting, we wouldn\u2019t have got that.\u201dIn an unusual effort to revive coverage of local government, smaller news publishers in Britain can get a share of the BBC\u2019s license fee, the annual charge paid by every household with a television that has sustained the BBC as local newsroom budgets have shrunk.The money, 8 million pounds a year (about $10.2 million), is used by local newspapers and news sites to pay the salaries of additional reporters, like Ms. Ashton.Publications across Britain can apply for the reporting positions, and so far about 90 percent of the 144 places have been filled. The reporters, who are expected to be experienced journalists, receive additional training from the BBC and are paid a minimum of \u00a322,000 each, a salary broadly comparable to other reporting positions at Britain\u2019s regional news organizations. The reporters are hired by the newspapers for an initial period of about two years.Matt Hancock, a member of Parliament and former minister for the government department responsible for media and culture, said he hoped the program would restore some vigor to the way local government was being covered.Fewer journalists were challenging statements by politicians, he said, and reporters who once covered public officials were now often working for them in public relations jobs.\u201cYou think, hold on, is that really how to have a vibrant democracy?\u201d Mr. Hancock said.The partnership with the BBC has already yielded some significant stories. Among them are these:Stories like these are helping to remind readers about areas that aren\u2019t always being covered, said Jeremy Clifford, editor in chief of Johnston Press, a chain of newspapers that includes The Sheffield Star.\u201cIt\u2019s a really important investment in the lifeblood, our way of life,\u201d Mr. Clifford said.In return for the financing, newspapers cannot use the new positions as an opportunity to cut newsroom staffs, and must assign the reporters to cover local government beats. The BBC and dozens of media organizations are allowed to republish the articles, creating a kind of wire service for local news.For the BBC, the arrangement also serves as a counter to critics in Parliament who say that it can crowd out commercial companies. Some have even argued that the TV license fee should be scrapped.There are no strict benchmarks to determine whether the project has been a success. But organizers at the BBC and the News Media Association said they would measure how the stories were shared, how often they were picked up by other news outlets and whether attendance at meetings was affected by the presence of a reporter.Some officials were taken aback to see reporters at their meetings, said Calvin Robinson, one of the reporters. Others put on a performance when they know that a reporter is in the room, said Daniel Jaines, the other Local News Partnership reporter at the website. \u201cIf there\u2019s a reporter there, they\u2019re a lot more shouty,\u201d he said.The partnership with the BBC will be no more than a Band-Aid over a gaping wound, said Roy Greenslade, a former editor and honorary visiting professor of journalism at City, University of London. \u201cThese companies are gradually going out of business because their business model is wrecked, totally and utterly wrecked.\u201dMr. Ionescu said he had seen the traffic to his site driven by Facebook slow, and advertising money increasingly spent on platforms like Google and Facebook rather than local online publishers.He isn\u2019t sure there is much more that can be done to stave off the growing power of huge technology companies.\u201cI don\u2019t see what more they could do in order to tackle the advertising gap or the revenue gap,\u201d Mr. Ionescu said. \u201cThe publishers who create everything, they just get the scraps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Your Dog Has Seen Me Naked", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveI love Fido, but does he have to be on the bed while we have sex?Josie was first, a Chihuahua/Pomeranian mix and an emotional wreck. In her defense, she was often left alone for long periods of time and, well, anything that small is justified in its mania. When her owner finally did come home, Josie would yap incessantly until someone petted her. She was like a furry alarm clock. Ring, ring, ring, and then silence the moment you rolled over and laid a hand on her.That\u2019s all she wanted. One hand. You didn\u2019t even have to pet her. Any contact would do.I did not hate Josie. She wasn\u2019t mean or snobbish as some small dogs tend to be \u2014 just in a constant fight for attention. And in that fight, neither of us was doing very well.The chemistry between her owner and me was less a firework and more an old lighter that works every sixth flick, but that didn\u2019t stop us from entering into a lazy singles agreement to end up at each other\u2019s apartments a couple nights a week.The first time we slept together, things went smoothly with one exception: Josie wouldn\u2019t stop barking. So her owner reached down, plucked her up and sat her on the bed, where she became more uncomfortable as she realized what was happening. By the end, she had gone silent, peeking over a pillow every few minutes to see if we had finished.I barely noticed her that first time. My attention was elsewhere, and having her on the bed seemed preferable to her soundtrack of high-pitched yapping. But when it happened a second, third and eighth time, Josie grew harder to ignore. I imagined things from her perspective, especially in those horrifying moments when we made eye contact.I may not have minded as much if she was simply in the room. But on the bed? That felt too close. Plus, Josie was too small to get down on her own so it was somewhat of a hostage situation.One night, as Josie\u2019s owner and I were switching positions, I accidentally kicked her off the mattress; I looked over my shoulder in horror to see a nose and two tiny paws fall out of sight. I was mortified. Her owner looked over and shrugged.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s real fluffy.\u201dAnd we went back at it.I could have suggested to Josie\u2019s owner that we take her off the bed or at the least put a tiny blindfold over her eyes, but I didn\u2019t want to further intrude on the intimate bond between pet and owner (a relationship stronger than the one we shared, after all). And I figured she knew Josie better than I did. Maybe that forsaken look in her eyes was, uh, normal?Two months in, the momentum started to slow between Josie\u2019s owner and me. Things ended as they so often do in this era, with an unanswered text. Josie wasn\u2019t the only one in the room with communication issues.The next couple months of solitude took some adjustment. The type of reliable hookup I had with Josie\u2019s owner was a rarity for me. Losing it was like having the restaurant around the corner go out of business. Now, on quiet nights when my relationship refrigerator was bare, I had to figure out something else or go to bed hungry \u2014 usually the latter.I was relieved when I met someone months later, and even more relieved when I met her dog, Rigatoni. Like Josie, he was part Chihuahua, but he had none of her emotional hangups. He was a good boy and he knew it. His strut had bounce. If I had an eighth of Rigatoni\u2019s confidence, I\u2019d be president tomorrow.His owner and I met on a dating app, and that\u2019s how she met Rigatoni too, on some sort of pet adoption app where you swiped yes or no on animals. Under normal circumstances, being virtually selected alongside a pet may have felt unsettling, but clearly she had great taste in dogs and it was flattering to be in such good company. Whatever quality caused her to swipe yes on Rigatoni, I hoped, was also visible in my profile.He chaperoned us on nearly every outing and I didn\u2019t mind a bit. He came along on one of our first dates, a trip to the beach, and guarded our towel while we swam. He nestled up to my chest afterward \u2014 all sandy and warm \u2014 and I was thrilled at his approval.We ended up back at her (tiny) place later and had only been kissing for a few seconds when she pulled back, gasped and said, \u201cYou\u2019re so weird!\u201dI was horrified until I realized she was talking not to me but to Rigatoni, who had suddenly appeared over my shoulder with a menacing look.That became the theme of our next few dates. We would be kissing and then I\u2019d hear, \u201cToni!\u201d and turn around to see her dog looking like he wanted to punch me in the nose.There was nowhere to hide; the apartment was too small. I would never suggest locking him in the bathroom; she would have sooner locked me in the bathroom. And I understood. He was special.When we moved from the couch to the bed, I was disappointed to learn he could jump up on his own. Rigatoni was an agile fellow and, unlike Josie, was not afraid to intervene. He would never bite, but he would try to grab me with his little T-rex arms and wrestle me away from his beloved master.\u201cYou\u2019re making everyone uncomfortable!\u201d she would shout as he had me by the ankle like a little Greco-Roman wrestler. You could see the conflict on his face, the push and pull between obedience and protection. Right when we thought we had successfully distracted him with a toy, he would leap onto the bed like a secret service agent and position himself between us.But even Rigatoni had his price \u2014 a meat-flavored bone \u2014 that could usually buy us 20 minutes. Afterward, he would leap back onto the bed and cast disapproving looks our way until he got sleepy.Rigatoni wasn\u2019t exactly an aphrodisiac, but his heart was in the right place. If someone was going to stop me from having sex, I was glad to know the effort came from virtuous intentions. It could have been worse. When my ex-girlfriend and I used to visit my childhood home, my family dog would run into the bathroom as if he were hunting truffles, snatch my used condoms from the trash, and then drop them in the most heavily trafficked area of our house.Courtship has never been easy for me. I have found the process to be high-risk and emotionally exhausting. It hasn\u2019t helped that nature itself seems committed to my celibacy. Lately, my sex life has felt like a reverse Snow White scenario; I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll unbutton my pants and every woodland creature within a 5-mile radius will come crashing through the window, clutching awkward middle school photos of me in their paws and talons.Whenever I meet a woman, I can\u2019t help but wonder what creature waits in her apartment, eager to make our encounter more awkward for me than it already feels.I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about a date I went on with a woman between Josie and Rigatoni. We had talked for hours, gone from one bar to another and watched the sunset over a pair of Moscow mules. We laughed. She snorted. I found myself listening to her instead of scrambling to think of a new topic to keep the conversation going. The hamster wheel of my mind actually stopped spinning, and when that happens I get excited because it signals something more serious is on the horizon.I really wanted to see her again.But she had to leave town for a couple of weeks. When she got back, I tried to set up another date, but something had changed. Or maybe it was never there. Either way, she read my final text but didn\u2019t reply, and that hurt.She had a dog, too: Bubba. In pictures, he was a tank. Shoulders like a linebacker and jaws like a bear trap. Bubba lived in a house, not a studio apartment, but I doubt that would have mattered. He looked like he could run through a brick wall like the Kool-Aid Man.Maybe I got off lucky with Bubba\u2019s owner. After all, she had the power to hurt me, and she did. Just imagine the damage he could have done.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Credit Cards Are Used to Finance Mass Shootings", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "Massacres are frequently carried out by killers using military-grade equipment that\u2019s easier to obtain when buying on credit.Two days before Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, he went on Google and typed \u201cCredit card unusual spending.\u201d Mr. Mateen had opened six new credit card accounts \u2014 including a Mastercard, an American Express card and three Visa cards \u2014 over the previous eight months. Twelve days before the shooting, he began a $26,532 buying spree: a Sig Sauer MCX .223-caliber rifle, a Glock 17 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, several large magazines, thousands of rounds of ammunition and a $7,500 ring for his wife that he bought on a jewelry store card. His average spending before that, on his only card, was $1,500 a month.His web browsing history chronicled his anxiety: \u201cCredit card reports all three bureaus,\u201d \u201cFBI,\u201d and \u201cWhy banks stop your purchases.\u201d He needn\u2019t have worried. None of the banks, credit-card network operators or payment processors alerted law enforcement officials about the purchases he thought were so suspicious.Mass shootings routinely set off a national debate on guns, usually focused on regulating firearms and on troubled youths. Little attention is paid to the financial industry that has become an instrumental, if unwitting, enabler of carnage. A New York Times examination of mass shootings since the Virginia Tech attack in 2007 reveals how credit cards have become a crucial part of the planning of these massacres. There have been 13 shootings that killed 10 or more people in the last decade, and in at least eight of them, the killers financed their attacks using credit cards. Some used credit to acquire firearms they could not otherwise have afforded. Those eight shootings killed 217 people. The investigations undertaken in their aftermath uncovered a rich trove of information about the killers\u2019 spending. There were plenty of red flags, if only someone were able to look for them, law enforcement experts say.\u201cBanks will complain this is the government\u2019s job and it\u2019s not our job, but you know what? They are the only ones with the ability to do this,\u201d said Kevin Sullivan, a former New York Police fraud investigator who consults with banks as president of the Anti-Money Laundering Training Academy. After the shooting last February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and staff members were killed, this column suggested that financial firms had an opportunity to help reduce violence by pushing for more responsible practices by the gun industry. As a result, some banks ended their relationships with gunmakers and some investors pushed manufacturers for more transparency. Financial firms have so far resisted changing the way they deal with the sale of guns.Banks and credit-card networks say it is not their responsibility to create systems to track gun purchases that would allow them to report suspicious patterns.\u201cWe do not believe Visa should be in the position of setting restrictions on the sale of lawful goods or services,\u201d said Amanda Pires, a Visa spokeswoman. \u201cOur role in commerce is to efficiently process, protect and settle all legal payments. Asking Visa or other payment networks to arbitrate what legal goods can be purchased sets a dangerous precedent.\u201dA spokesman for Mastercard echoed that sentiment, emphasizing its protection of \u201ccardholders\u2019 independence\u201d and the \u201cprivacy of their own purchasing decisions.\u201d But the financial industry is uniquely positioned to see, if it chose to do so, a potential killer\u2019s behavior in a way that retailers, law enforcement officials, concerned family members or mental health professionals cannot.

They Can Use It With Gun Makers.Citigroup Acted. Now, Two New Ideas on How Banks Can Limit Gun Sales.When it comes to certain crimes, banks are on the front lines. They crunch transaction data to protect their customers from fraudulent purchases \u2014 often identifying stolen credit cards within seconds \u2014 and to detect money laundering, funding of terrorist organizations and other crimes. A labyrinth of rules prevents banks and credit-card networks \u2014 many of which also handle debit card transactions \u2014 from seeing exactly what customers are buying. Retailers have historically resisted providing item-by-item information \u2014 known as SKU-level data, a reference to the stock-keeping unit number of an item \u2014 for fear that banks would sell that information or use it to steer customers to rival merchants. In the case of gun purchases, even the nature of the retailer can be obscure: The Merchant Category Code, which identifies the type of store that sold an item, is the same for gun shops and sporting goods stores.But retailers have the ability to send far more detailed transaction information. A feature known as a \u201cboxcar\u201d allows retailers to tag transactions with extra data. It is often used by online retailers to send the bank details about consumer behavior, such as the device used to make a purchase and the location of the buyer.If banks required retailers to transmit details on sales of guns and ammunition, they would be able to make more informed decisions about transactions.\u201cThey can fine-tune their own systems, because in these cases the suspicious purchasing patterns could have been picked up on and quite frankly should have been picked up on,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, the Anti-Money Laundering Training Academy president.Banks could also add information about gun sales to the infrastructure they already use to help the government investigate other criminal activity.\u201cWe need to step back and think about what tools we use to combat terrorism and money-laundering and think about the financial rules associated with the Patriot Act,\u201d said John Streur, chief executive of Calvert Investments, a mutual fund firm that is an advocate for responsible investing. \u201cIn a very real sense, I think these mass shootings are terrorism.\u201dThe shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas last year was described as the worst mass murder on American soil since the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The gunman, Stephen Paddock, killed 58 people and injured more than 800.When his body was found on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, the police noticed four credit cards scattered across the kitchenette countertop next to his hotel key card.Unlike most other mass killers, Mr. Paddock was wealthy. He spent over $600,000 at casinos in the two years leading up to the massacre, and paid over $170,000 to credit card companies. Law enforcement officials saw the full picture of his gun purchases only after they talked to the banks, but they wish they could have connected the dots in advance.\u201cThey have all the infrastructure in place,\u201d said Joseph Moreno, a former federal counterterrorism prosecutor and a staff member of the F.B.I.\u2019s 9/11 Review Commission who is now a partner at Cadwalader. \u201cA.T.F. is already involved in S.A.R.s task forces,\u201d he said, referring to suspicious-activity reports. \u201cIt would just be tweaking it to consider firearm-related information.\u201d Over the last several months, I have spoken to senior executives at the country\u2019s largest banks and credit card companies who were taken aback when I presented them with the list of shootings that involved their cards: Virginia Tech in 2007, Binghamton in 2009, Fort Hood in 2009, Aurora in 2012, San Bernardino in 2015, Orlando in 2016, Sutherland Springs in 2017 and Las Vegas in 2017. That list is based on interviews and hundreds of documents including police reports and credit card receipts. It may actually underreport the use of credit cards in shootings: In some cases the payment method could not be learned.While some executives expressed grief and were open to discussing possible solutions, virtually none were willing to speak about them on the record for fear of upsetting gun-rights advocates and politicians invoking the Second Amendment. Some raised the prospect that by trying to help they would be held responsible if the system failed. Others made a slippery-slope argument: If they were to police gun sales, should they do the same for alcohol in an effort to prevent drunk-driving deaths? After the school shooting in Parkland, Citibank and Bank of America said they would no longer finance or advise gun manufacturers, while investment firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the retirement fund for public employees in California, said they would demand more information from the gunmakers they invested in.Several payment systems \u2014 including PayPal, Square and Apple Pay \u2014 already had established rules that ban the sale of guns and gun-related items using their systems.But no bank has instituted a ban or committed to tracking gun purchases.John Shrewsberry, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo \u2014 which counts the National Rifle Association as a client \u2014 has dismissed the notion that banks should regulate the use of its credit cards for gun purchases.\u201cThe best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process,\u201d he said in April on a conference call with investors.The bill was directed at banks that changed their policies regarding guns.  \u201cOur friends at Citigroup and Bank of America apparently aren\u2019t busy enough with their banking business; they have decided that they are going to set policy for the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Kennedy wrote on Twitter.And a policy expert at the American Civil Liberties Union recently expressed concern about how efforts to prevent mass shootings could infringe on individual rights.\u201cThe implication of expecting the government to detect and prevent every mass shooting is believing the government should play an enormously intrusive role in American life,\u201d Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst at the A.C.L.U. Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, wrote in July.Not all the concerns involve privacy or politics. Some are practical.George Brauchler, the district attorney who oversaw the investigation of Mr. Holmes after the Aurora shooting, said the deluge of data the police receive already presents challenge.\u201cTo some extent we are looking for a needle in a haystack and that haystack keeps getting bigger and bigger,\u201d he said. The data could inform old-fashioned police work that might or might not lead to something more, he said.\u201cDo I wish someone from law enforcement had been able to go to his door and knock on his door and figure out a way to talk their way into it or to freak him out?\" he said of Mr. Holmes. \u201cYeah, absolutely.\u201d Jared L. Loughner had the Chase Visa he used to buy a 9-millimeter Glock handgun in the pocket of his jeans when he shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords in the head outside a Tucson supermarket on Jan. 8, 2011. She survived, but six people died. \u201cThere are a lot of steps that credit card companies can take that could prevent some of the tragic gun violence in the country,\u201d said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cFor companies to say they can\u2019t solve the entire problem and therefore shouldn\u2019t take any steps is just blindly ignoring what they can contribute to the solution.\u201dElected officials could force the financial system to act.In 29 states, consumers cannot use credit cards to buy lottery tickets because legislators don\u2019t want consumers racking up debt gambling. And under the Gun Control Act of 1968, firearms dealers must report if someone buys two or more handguns in a span of five business days.That requirement can be evaded simply by buying at more than one store, but a system involving the banks and credit card networks could have the opportunity to flag the purchases.Mr. Sanfeliz\u2019s father, Carlos, was surprised to learn that the same industry that once employed his son had unwittingly bankrolled other shootings.\u201cSomething needs to be done to prevent more attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI live with this torment every day of my life.\u201dOlivia Carville contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Five Takeaways From New Reports on Russia\u2019s Social Media Operations", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Senate Intelligence Committee released on Monday two new reports that it commissioned about the Russian campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media platforms during the 2016 election and beyond. The reports, by teams led by experts at the cybersecurity company New Knowledge and Oxford University, fill out a portrait of the impressive operations by the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg.Together, they essentially burnish the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, a loyal associate of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s, who owns the Internet Research Agency and its multiple corporate siblings.Americans might be infuriated by what Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s companies are doing, but they\u2019re doing it well.Here are major takeaways from the reports.The New Knowledge report finds that while \u201cother distinct ethnic and religious groups were the focus of one or two Facebook pages or Instagram accounts, the black community was targeted extensively with dozens.\u201dFacebook ads were targeted at users who had shown interest in black history, the Black Panther Party and Malcolm X. The most popular of the Russian Instagram accounts was @blackstagram, with 303,663 followers.On YouTube, the Russians played on police shootings of unarmed black men with channels with names like \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot\u201d and \u201cBlackToLive.\u201dWhile most media attention has focused on Facebook pages appealing to the political right, the Russian effort aimed at black Americans was actually larger, reaching almost as many people. Of 81 Facebook pages created by the Internet Research Agency, 30 targeted African-American audiences, amassing 1.2 million followers, the report finds. By comparison, 25 pages targeted the political right and drew 1.4 million followers.The N.A.A.C.P., a civil rights group, said that it would begin a weeklong protest starting Tuesday called #LogOutFaceook. The group said it would stay off Facebook and Instagram and asked its social media followers and the organizations with which it works to do the same.The N.A.A.C.P. said that the protest was \u201ca way to signify to Facebook that the data and privacy of its users of color matter more than its corporate interests\u201d and that its users should be protected from \u201cpropaganda and misinformation.\u201dThe group said it also had returned a recent donation from Facebook.One strand focused, once again, on African-American voters. \u201cThese campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African-American community was to boycott the election,\u201d the Oxford report says. One bogus post declared: \u201cHILLARY RECEIVED $20,000 DONATION FROM KKK TOWARDS HER CAMPAIGN.\u201dThe Russian accounts urged people who had backed Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination to stay home or to vote for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, in the general election. The New Knowledge report also describes what it calls \u201cmalicious misdirection\u201d and \u201ctweets designed to create confusion about voting rules.\u201dMost of the early media coverage of the Russian campaign focused on Facebook. The New Knowledge report argues that the Internet Research Agency\u2019s presence on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has been underestimated and may have been as effective or even more effective than its Facebook effort. The report says there were 187 million engagements on Instagram \u2014 users \u201cliking\u201d or sharing the content created in Russia \u2014 compared with 76.5 million engagements on Facebook.\u201cOur assessment is that Instagram is likely to be a key battleground on an ongoing basis,\u201d the report concludes.Both reports note that there was hardly a social platform, however obscure, that the Internet Research Agency did not invade: Reddit, Google+, Vine, Gab, Meetup, Pinterest, Tumblr and more. The Russian trolls even created a podcast on SoundCloud.Russia had used similar online influence tactics inside Russian borders and in neighboring countries, including Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine. But the campaign against the United States in 2016 was historic on several counts: It was the first major foreign influence campaign aimed at affecting a presidential election; it was the biggest influence operation ever to be aimed at Americans from another country; and it was the biggest attack ever \u2014 using virtual, not physical weapons \u2014 on the United States by its old Cold War adversary, albeit slimmed down from the Soviet Union to Russia alone. It will be studied for years.Inevitably, some American political operatives are learning from Russia\u2019s example, testing the tools of chicanery in their online operations. So the Internet Research Agency may have taught a new generation of tricksters how to swing an election in the cyberage.Remarkably, no. The Russian trolls shift their tactics, swap corporate names and move to new buildings, but they don\u2019t stop. The Oxford group reports: \u201cThe highest peak of I.R.A. ad volume on Facebook is in April 2017 \u2014 the month of the Syrian missile strike, the use of the Mother of All Bombs on ISIS tunnels in eastern Afghanistan, and the release of the tax reform plan.\u201dThe pace was stepped up for Instagram posts in particular: 5,956 in 2017, more than double the 2,611 posts in 2016, according to the Oxford report. While they reacted slowly and reluctantly to the evidence of Russian manipulation, social media platforms have stepped up their efforts to block fraudulent activity. But the Russians often seem to be able to outmaneuver the watchdogs and stay online.\u201cOver the past five years, disinformation has evolved from a nuisance into high-stakes information war,\u201d the New Knowledge report concludes. American concerns about protecting free speech have made both the government and the platforms uneasy about acting decisively, it says.\u201cOur deeply felt national scruples about misidentifying a fake account or inadvertently silencing someone, however briefly,\u201d the report says, \u201ccreate a welcoming environment for malign groups who masquerade as Americans or who game algorithms.\u201dBoth reports suggest that the effort to understand everything that happened in 2016 \u2014 let alone figuring how to prevent a repeat \u2014 is far from finished.Advertisement"}

Like most people, I used to take once-a-year vacations, with a massive suitcase and a rigid itinerary, hopping from hotel to hotel stressed about train connections and tour reservations.It was all unnecessary stress on the two weeks a year I was supposed to be relaxing. so while working for years as a digital nomad, I\u2019ve figured out a few ways to minimize that stress. Here are a few of them.Sure, keep a list of things you want to do, but allow for lots of flexibility. You\u2019re not going to see everything, so enjoy what you can and don\u2019t rush. Less planning allows you to stay longer in spots you like, and leave early from places you don\u2019t.This is a hard one. It may come across preachy and I\u2019m sorry, but cramming 15 cities into 14 days is going to make you miserable. I try to spend at least three days in each place. That gives you enough time to get the feel and decide if you want to stay, or go somewhere else.

{"Headline": "Amazon Sees in Brazil Continent-Size Profits and Problems", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExpansion south, into the nation where Amazon\u2019s namesake river ends, may prove a little harder.\u201cAmazon is still kind of irrelevant here,\u201d said Raul Prado, a vendor in the rural town of Guaipava, Brazil, who has relied on online retail sites to build up his business. Less than 1 percent of his sales are through Amazon.Brazil, home to more than 200 million people and the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, is in many ways an obvious target for Amazon\u2019s next major expansion. Google and Facebook have done well in Brazil, but their digital services \u2014 search, social media and advertising \u2014 do not have to overcome the hurdles of selling goods and making deliveries.As a retail behemoth wading into the market, Amazon has found itself playing catch-up with local rivals that know how to navigate Brazil\u2019s distinct challenges: a complicated tax structure, high import costs and the headache of moving goods across a continent-size country.\u201cBrazil is really kind of the natural next country in terms of sheer size,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who was the director of Amazon research at Gartner L2, a business intelligence and research company, but has since left. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity, and they are laying the groundwork for that today.\u201dNext year, he said, \u201cAmazon is going to be all about Brazil.\u201d His prediction came with a caveat: \u201cBut it\u2019s no small undertaking.\u201dAmazon has been present in Brazil\u2019s online retail market since 2012, but until recently it focused on selling books and its Kindle e-reader. A little over a year ago, Amazon made a splash when it expanded to let third-party brands sell electronics directly to consumers on its marketplace.Shares in local competitors tanked following the news, but they later rebounded when it became apparent that Amazon wasn\u2019t on the cusp of rolling out the services that have helped make it a market leader in the United States: first-party sales, by which brands supply Amazon with products and Amazon is the retailer; and its fulfillment service, which packages and ships products from the company\u2019s warehouses.\u201cAmazon arrived a little late to the game,\u201d said Marcel Motta, the Brazil director of the global research company Euromonitor International. Local, established companies, he said, \u201cknow how to get around the obstacles.\u201dMercadoLibre, for instance, the e-commerce leader that first began in Argentina and modeled itself after eBay, has been in Brazil for 19 years.\u201cWe helped build e-commerce in this region,\u201d said Cristina Farjallat, the head of MercadoLibre\u2019s third-party marketplace. \u201cWe have portfolios of sellers and portfolios of consumers that no one else has.\u201dShe said the company had lured more sellers to its site than any other online retailer by working with vendors to create the tools they need. MercadoLibre has a roster of 12 million vendors and its own fulfillment service, and is rolling out a payment service to bypass banks and credit cards.The company helped Mr. Prado, the vendor, turn a modest business venture \u2014 selling satellite antennas door-to-door in his remote village, where cellphone coverage was virtually nonexistent \u2014 into a national enterprise, with 20 employees.\u201cHonestly, I had no idea what I was doing when I started, but MercadoLibre is the first site people open when they go on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the brand name, their own payment plan, the logistics infrastructure and they even offer loans to sellers.\u201dMr. Prado, who created his company, Lojas Mineiras, in 2008, now offers his satellite and telephone products through nearly a dozen online retail sites. More than half of his sales are made through MercadoLibre.That doesn\u2019t mean it will stay that way.This year, Amazon broadened its catalog of products, offering sporting goods, fashion and home accessories, and signed up some major brands \u2014 but all remain independently sold and delivered.As of November, Amazon had just under 1 percent of the market share in Brazil, and was ranked 10th behind online retailers that offer both first- and third-party sales, according to Euromonitor\u2019s research. MercadoLibre had 19 percent of the market share.Experts say the window for Amazon to establish itself as a major player in Brazil is closing, which is why they expect the company to make a significant push in the next year. The question is whether it\u2019s too late.Mr. Smith said he had heard from industry sources, including investors, that Amazon had acquired a lease on a large warehouse outside S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s biggest city; advertised more than 100 jobs, many of them high level; and started negotiations to sell American brands on its Brazilian site. Amazon declined to comment.\u201cJeff Bezos has always harped on the idea that as Amazon saturates the U.S. market, he can go to emerging markets around the globe,\u201d Mr. Smith said, referring to the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s coming. Amazon wants to have boots on the ground in Brazil.\u201dAmazon appears to be moving cautiously in Brazil: It has not had a new platform up and working in the country in time for the Christmas shopping season.\u201cAmazon wants all the pieces of its ecosystem in place first,\u201d Mr. Smith said.One of the major pieces is transportation. Brazil is larger than the continental United States, but its roads are poorly maintained and often flood during rainy season, and the state postal service is widely seen as inefficient and unreliable.Magazine Luiza, one of Brazil\u2019s top e-commerce companies, which began as a mom-and-pop store selling televisions, has said it had overcome these problems by leveraging its pre-existing and growing presence: It has 900 stores across the country.Those stores, which now sell appliances, electronics and furniture to working-class Brazilians, are being converted into mini-distribution centers for Magazine Luiza, and help educate shoppers about the ease of online retail.\u201cPhysical stores are a fundamental part of our platform. We have succeeded in cutting delivery time and price,\u201d said Eduardo Galanternick, the executive director of e-commerce at Magazine Luiza. \u201cWhen you go deep into the interior of Brazil, Magazine Luiza is often the only department store around.\u201dFor example, thousands of rural families use the Magazine Luiza store in Graja\u00fa, a city in northern Brazil\u2019s soybean country, to order appliances and pick up online orders like diapers and brand-name cosmetics.In addition to difficult competitors and terrain, Amazon will face thickets of regulation. Brazil\u2019s convoluted tax structure can make delivering goods across state borders a costly affair, while high import tariffs have priced many foreign-made goods out of reach for all but the wealthiest Brazilians.Nonetheless, the potential for growth \u2014 Brazil represents just 1.1 percent of global sales in online retail \u2014 is expected to attract major investments from Amazon and other companies.Euromonitor forecasts that the Brazilian market will nearly double over the next five years to $35 billion, and some competitors will be squeezed out as obstacles to online retail are eliminated.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of Amazon conforming to our market,\u201d Mr. Prado said. \u201cRight now, they can\u2019t compete. But you never know. I\u2019ll keep offering my products on Amazon, just in case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Scrooged\u2019 (1988) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.Locked deep inside Bill Murray there is a small, hyperactive misanthrope fighting to be heard through the large heavy body that contains him. The misanthrope never sleeps. He\u2019s a busy demon, peering out through Mr. Murray\u2019s squinty eyes, seeing all and remaining actively unimpressed. By the time his nastiest observations fight their way to the surface, however, much of their sting has been absorbed by flesh, leaving a sometimes revivifying but thoroughly domesticated skepticism.Because Mr. Murray is funniest when the big, laid-back, good-natured slob gives in to the furious mini-misanthrope, \u201cScrooged,\u201d an updated variation on Dickens\u2019s \u201cChristmas Carol,\u201d is best when Mr. Murray is allowed to be his secret self.As Frank Cross, the ratings-mad program chief of the IBC television network, Mr. Murray\u2019s contemporary Scrooge is a joy as long as he\u2019s making life miserable for everyone around him. When, finally, Frank sees the error of his ways, the movie succumbs to its heart of jelly. This may well be the secret of Mr. Murray\u2019s enormous popularity in a series of similarly second-rate comedies, including \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d In the end Mr. Murray must always deny what has appeared to be, until then, his redeeming offensiveness.\u201cScrooged,\u201d which opens today at Loew\u2019s Astor Plaza and other theaters, has some very funny things in it, including snippets from IBC\u2019s big Christmas show, an adaptation of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d with a lot of leggy, scantily clad showgirls and a boozy actor (Buddy Hackett) playing a conventional Scrooge.The actor has trouble with his lines. Standing in the middle of a set representing a Christmas card\u2019s vision of 19th-century London, this Scrooge barks out, \u201cWhy must I be molested by sea urchins!\u201d The show-within-the-show promises a lot, but it is never allowed to attain the sublime bad taste of the \u201cSpringtime for Hitler\u201d number in Mel Brooks\u2019s \u201cProducers.\u201dThat is not Mr. Murray\u2019s style. In spite of the jokes at the expense of television-network censors, there\u2019s very little in the film, aside from naughty words, that wouldn\u2019t be perfectly acceptable on prime-time television. \u201cScrooged,\u201d written by Mitch Glazer and Michael O\u2019Donoghue and directed by Richard Donner, exemplifies the kind of lazily executed comedies Mr. Murray seems always to make.\u201cScrooged\u201d works in fits and starts. The mundane demands of the sentimental story keep interrupting what are, essentially, revue sketches, a few of which are hilarious.Frank stuns a network staff meeting when he tosses out the Christmas show\u2019s trailer, which features an avuncular John Houseman reading from Dickens, and substitutes his own. This is an action-packed montage of clips of freeway killers, airplane terrorists and A-bomb detonations. Says one aide, \u201cIt looks like \u2018The Manson Family Christmas Special.\u2019 \u201c Frank dismisses the man on the spot.When the newspapers report that an old lady has died of a heart attack watching the trailer, Frank says, \u201cYou can\u2019t buy publicity like this.\u201d A production assistant complains that he is unable to fasten a pair of tiny antlers to the head of a mouse. Frank\u2019s solution: \u201cStaple them.\u201d John Forsythe appears in an amusing turn as the movie\u2019s Marley, Frank\u2019s predecessor at the network who died seven years before on the golf course, which explains why the ghost is wearing rotting sports clothes. After Mr. Murray (at least when he\u2019s being all-out mean), Carol Kane gives the film\u2019s funniest performance, as the Ghost of Christmas Present. Looking like Billie Burke\u2019s Glinda in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d she\u2019s a pretty, diaphanous creature who alternately reasons with Frank and punches him in the stomach with the force of Muhammad Ali.No expense has been spared in the film\u2019s physical production and casting. The movie looks as if it cost a lot even when it\u2019s not necessary; the classiness of the supporting cast, however, is. Robert Mitchum is cool and comic as the network president. He warns Frank to prepare for the day when cats and dogs will be a significant portion of the viewing audience. Karen Allen is charming as the girl Frank leaves behind in his ruthless climb to the top, and John Glover is the ever-smiling, patronizing new boy at the network who, if things go wrong, will be Frank\u2019s successor.\u201cScrooged\u201d is nothing if not contemporary. Frank Cross\u2019s passionately delivered final speech, in which he endorses the power of love and the importance of old-fashioned family values, might have come out of the recent Presidential campaign.\u201cScrooged,\u201d which has been rated PG-13 (\u201cSpecial Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13\u201d), contains vulgar language and sexual references.

{"Headline": "Uber Is Said to File for an I.P.O. as It Races Lyft to a Public Debut", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber confidentially filed paperwork on Thursday to go public, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, officially moving toward what is expected to be one of the biggest and most anticipated tech company stock market debuts ever.Uber and Lyft are expected to presage a wave of I.P.O.s by other tech start-ups, many of which have delayed going public for years because of the plentiful availability of private capital. But as these companies mature and their early investors push to cash out their stakes, many are readying for their stock market debuts.\u201cIt is like the graduation. The adolescents have become adults,\u201d said Mamoon Hamid, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. \u201cThe longest bull run in history is now culminating with a whole slew of I.P.O.s.\u201d He added, \u201cUber is in the same ballpark as Facebook and Google.\u201dMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have submitted proposals to take Uber public. Lyft, which was last valued by private market investors at $15 billion, recently picked JPMorgan Chase to lead its I.P.O.Ride-hailing \u2014 where people hail rides through their smartphone and drivers with their own cars supply the rides \u2014 is an inherently expensive business because the company has to pay to recruit drivers, expand in new markets and beat back rivals.Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has focused on paring back the unprofitable segments of the company\u2019s business. He has sold off its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, where it faced heavy competition from local rivals, while expanding into potential new businesses like food delivery and bike and scooter rentals.\u201cRevenue growth is significantly more important than worrying about the bottom line at this point,\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who advises on I.P.O.s.Uber began as a ride-hailing service for upscale clientele in 2009, the pipe dream of Garrett Camp, an entrepreneur who eventually tapped a friend, Travis Kalanick, to run the company. They quickly pushed the service into numerous cities with little regard for local laws, causing tension with established taxi companies, lawmakers and regulators.As competitors like Lyft appeared, both rushed to compete for smaller fares. The rivals have since spent billions of dollars on fare subsidies to attract people to their platforms.Passengers loved Uber\u2019s convenience and embraced it in cities such as San Francisco, New York and London. Uber now operates in more than 600 cities across 63 countries, providing more than 15 million trips a day.Venture capitalists and other investors, seizing on Uber\u2019s rapid growth, shoveled billions of dollars into the company to help it dominate. The company\u2019s investors include the venture capital firm Benchmark, First Round Capital, TPG, SoftBank, Toyota and Fidelity Investments. Many of them are set to reap big returns from an I.P.O.\u201cUber\u2019s stock is widely distributed, and it will transform the lives of many thousands of families who have worked hard for this outcome,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a venture capitalist who invested in Uber when it was a young company. Many Uber employees will go on to start other companies, he said. \u201cThis \u2018virtuous cycle\u2019 is still a big part of what makes the Valley great,\u201d he added.Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed Uber\u2019s chief executive a few months later. He has vowed to improve the company\u2019s culture and mend broken relationships with regulators, lawmakers and others.Uber\u2019s backers are eager to put last year\u2019s troubles behind them. \u201cI know Dara has the full trust of investors and employees, and we are confident he knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Chris Sacca, an early investor in the company.\u201cWe\u2019re not done by any means, but if you look at where we were one year ago, we were dealing with fundamental issues of governance, of board alignment, of these continuing battles amongst power-brokers on our board and whether or not we were going to have SoftBank with us or against us,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. \u201cThose were very important issues to deal with and to resolve, and I think we resolved them quite effectively in a positive way.\u201dMike Isaac and Erin Griffith reported from San Francisco and Kate Conger from Vancouver, British Columbia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Version of YouTube Takes Shape With Pranksters, Magicians and Cartoons", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant sees Facebook Watch, with its rising number of videos from internet stars, as a key to future growth. A 20-something magician performing on the streets of Thailand and Jamaica. Three Australian brothers who shock bystanders with devious pranks. A conservative commentator in Mississippi who rants about America\u2019s priorities from his car. These are some of the video makers who in recent months have started making serious money from Facebook Watch, the tech giant\u2019s answer to YouTube. Julius Dein, the magician, said his videos had attracted revenue in the \u201csix figures\u201d since July, when he became able to run ads on them. The prankster brothers, known as the Jalals, said they had earned more than $500,000 since August. But creating a space that can attract that money has been a challenge for Facebook. Since beginning Watch in August 2017, the company had limited the number of pages that could run video ads to a tightly curated set of entities, including well-known publishers, TV networks and celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith and Tom Brady. That has now changed. At the end of August, Facebook started to allow more pages to run ads on videos that were at least three minutes long. The number of Facebook pages that can run video ads has gone from about 3,700 on Aug. 1 to more than 23,000 this month, according to data shared with The New York Times by OpenSlate, an analytics firm that helps advertisers assess online video content. While Facebook has invested in plenty of original programming and established shows like \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d this year, it has also opened up Watch to much more do-it-yourself content from comedians, video bloggers and other digital entertainers. In other words, the YouTube crowd \u2014 though the number of videos on Watch is a small fraction what\u2019s available on YouTube.\u201cThey need premium, hit, intellectual-property-driven stuff to fuel the idea that this is TV-style content,\u201d said Ben Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine Media, which oversees brands with popular Watch shows like \u201cThe Dodo\u201d and \u201cNowThis.\u201d \u201cBut then they need the volume that comes from News Feed content coming into Watch. That\u2019s a balance that\u2019s really delicate.\u201dWith more pages showing video ads, there are more places for advertisers to run their messages, and more opportunities for Facebook users to get access to videos on the platform. Among the most popular of these pages are entries from mainstream companies like Disney, BuzzFeed and Vice, according to OpenSlate. But in October and December, the most popular pages included a provocative group of bare-chested performers known as Magic Men Live, and others with names like \u201cInsane Stunts,\u201d \u201cJesus Today\u201d and \u201cNurse Blake.\u201d There was little in the way of news and politics. Facebook said on Thursday that more than 75 million people around the world spent at least one minute on Watch every day, and that those users then spent at least 20 minutes there on average. Ms. Pinkett Smith\u2019s \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d is its most-followed show and has the most active Facebook group, according to the company. Fidji Simo, who leads Facebook\u2019s video efforts, said that most users were getting access to Watch by clicking into it from the platform\u2019s main site rather than through videos on their News Feed.  \u201cSeeing how many people are coming in and watching for an average of more than 20 minutes has definitely been encouraging,\u201d Ms. Simo said. \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing this content create communities and social engagement on the platform.\u201d\u201cOne\u2019s a more lean-forward experience, and one\u2019s a more lean-back experience,\u201d said George Manas, who leads performance marketing across Omnicom Media Group agencies. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that because it\u2019s running across both environments, it\u2019s creating challenges in measurement and, frankly, just in quality control because the user experience just isn\u2019t the same.\u201d Graham Allen, the 31-year-old host of \u201cRant Nation With Graham Allen,\u201d a Watch show from Conservative Review\u2019s CRTV (which recently merged with TheBlaze to form Blaze Media), said the viewership had made up for a sharp drop in traffic to his personal page after Facebook shifted its algorithms to favor its video offering.\u201cMost people don\u2019t even realize that the majority of videos they\u2019re watching now on their News Feeds are from Watch pages,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that was intentional from Facebook, to make it a seamless transition, or they just didn\u2019t think it through enough, like, \u2018Wow, people might not be able to know the difference.\u2019\u201d He added, \u201cAs far as video content goes, if you don\u2019t have a Watch page, you\u2019re kind of dead in the water right this second.\u201d The ad revenue has been welcome, he said, noting that he was previously more reliant on outside deals with sponsors. Mr. Dein, a 24-year-old magician from London who posts videos of street performances around the world, was able to start running video ads on his page in July. He said Facebook\u2019s rules affected the kind of videos that performed well, noting that ads can run after a minute as long as the video is at least three minutes long. \u201cWith me, since I\u2019m magic, I\u2019ll make sure the ad is on an exciting moment of the video,\u201d Mr. Dein said. \u201cIf I\u2019m about to cut my finger open for a magic trick, the ad plays just as the knife goes down.\u201d Mr. Dein said he had found it harder to produce \u201csuper-viral videos,\u201d like one he posted last year about homeless people reacting to magic, which he said had been watched more than 200 million times. But he said it made sense for Facebook to mimic YouTube and adopt longer-form content to appeal to advertisers. \u201cIf someone\u2019s watching a vlogger like Logan Paul and tuned into that person, they\u2019re paying more attention to the ad, whereas if someone is watching a seven-second clip, they don\u2019t care about the video or the ad,\u201d he said. \u201cNews content tends to be on the shorter side, so we\u2019ve seen a lot of news partners have a lot of one-minute videos,\u201d she said. Advertisers are also able to opt out of categories that tend to be closely related to news and politics, like \u201cdebated social issues\u201d and \u201ctragedy and conflict,\u201d she said. 1.

Mr. Manas of Omnicom said that while the service had potential, advertisers were still figuring out how people react to ad breaks in social videos. The agency also wants more control over choosing the specific videos for its clients\u2019 ads, rather than simply being offered genres or other bundles. Advertisers are also already spending plenty of money with Facebook on display ads and even other video ads, including sponsored posts that appear on the News Feed, said Susan Schiekofer, chief digital investment officer at GroupM, the media buying arm of ad giant WPP. There are also numerous other online platforms offering original content, from Amazon, Netflix and Hulu to Snap and Google. \u201cThe burden of proof is on Facebook\u2019s end to be able to illustrate to people that they are providing a longer-form video experience,\u201d Amanda Grant, GroupM\u2019s United States head of paid social, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a role for the highly produced content, but it\u2019s more of the sizzle, not the steak,\u201d said Mike Henry, the chief executive of OpenSlate. \u201cSuccess for these guys will come from scale and diversity of content.\u201d\u201cIf Facebook gets this right and can generate scale of inventory and scale of audience, they have the opportunity to combine sight, sound and motion with incredible user targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the holy grail.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sexual Harassment Is Illegal, but It May Not Get You Fired", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe grim lesson of the Les Moonves scandal at CBS is that many companies still don\u2019t take sexual harassment allegations seriously.Contributing Opinion WriterIt\u2019s a small sliver of justice for the women who say he harassed them and then ruined their careers when they rebuffed him. But the fact that he stood to gain any money at all exposes the preposterous way that corporate America has treated sexual harassment.It\u2019s worth noting what should be obvious: Sexual harassment is illegal. That has been the case ever since Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, a 1986 Supreme Court decision that said that sexual harassment violates laws prohibiting workplace sex discrimination. And yet companies that catch an executive engaging in this illegal act can\u2019t always fire him for cause. Even more typically, they turn a blind eye to such conduct. It bears repeating: This behavior violates the law.But if company policies treat sexual harassment lightly, running afoul of them may be tough to do. CBS\u2019s policies \u201chave a \u2018check-the-box\u2019 quality,\u201d the investigators found, noting that they even include a provision laying out that employees who lodge a complaint could experience a \u201cnegative employment action\u201d that would not constitute retaliation. If companies took sexual harassment seriously as an illegal act, they might change the way they prepare for and react to it. Would they make allowances for paying out contracts to executives accused of stealing TVs? Would they decide to blame the people their executive stole from rather than take action against him? If an executive thinks it\u2019s O.K. to steal TVs, what else might he do?Bryce Covert is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.)

Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Last-Minute Shoppers Increasingly Trust Only Amazon to Deliver", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Olivia Zimmermann started her holiday shopping early this year, buying a Bluetooth speaker from Best Buy for her sister. It was supposed to arrive by Dec. 10, two weeks before Christmas.The speaker never showed up \u2014 and the post office said it had delivered the package to a different town. Best Buy apologized and offered to reship it. But Ms. Zimmermann, who works in marketing in Chicago, was over it.\u201cI just want a refund,\u201d she told the retailer, and then added: \u201cAt this point, I have already ordered from Amazon because I know for a fact it will be here when they say it will.\u201dAmazon is far and away the leader in e-commerce, outpacing competitors like Walmart, Target and eBay. But its dominance is never more pronounced than in the nail-biter last-minute sprint before Christmas.The company, based in Seattle, has had a two-decade-long obsession with shrinking the time from click to doorstep. It has built warehouses in more than 30 states and a sophisticated web of delivery methods, giving it a logistical advantage.Amazon has used that edge to lead people to expect near instant gratification that, for a while, only it could deliver. The company built trust in its delivery speed with its Prime membership, which costs $119 a year and includes two-day shipping. This year, in the days leading up to Christmas, Amazon\u2019s share of online sales will increase by almost 50 percent \u2014 to about half of all digital sales \u2014 while most rivals fade, according to the market research firm Rakuten Intelligence.\u201cAmazon\u2019s ability to fulfill more quickly and effectively than competitors has been a key differentiator back to the earliest days,\u201d said Kenneth Cassar, an analyst with Rakuten Intelligence, which is an independent subsidiary of the Japanese e-retailer Rakuten.Traditional retailers still enjoy strong sales when the holiday season begins around Thanksgiving. They advertise widely, luring shoppers with doorbuster deals. The promotions also drive sales to their websites instead of Amazon. Around Thanksgiving, Amazon\u2019s share of online sales can dip to as low as 20 percent in the United States, according to Rakuten.But as November turns to December, and then into Christmas crunchtime, shoppers\u2019 preferences change. Last year, Walmart and Target had their busiest online traffic of the month on Dec. 10. Amazon\u2019s was eight days later, on Dec. 18, according to an analysis by Griffin Carlborg, a researcher at the digital intelligence firm Gartner L2.Amazon\u2019s share of e-commerce sales tends to drop around Thanksgiving, and usually peaks about one week before Christmas \u2014 just enough time for packages to be delivered before the holiday. Amazon\u2019s quick delivery times may contribute to its popularity at Christmastime.Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 16Dec. 1650%20162017201840Amazon30CHRISTMASCHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVING10Best BuyTargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 16Dec. 1620162017201850%40Amazon30CHRISTMASCHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVING10Best BuyTargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 1650%2017201840Amazon30CHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGBest Buy10TargetWalmartCostco0NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 1650%20172018CHRISTMAS40Amazon3020THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGBest Buy10TargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4Costco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Note: E-commerce includes all companies with the exception of Amazon Fresh, Ebay, Etsy, Instacart and Tesla.By: The New York Times | Source: Rakuten Intelligence\u201cAmazon has just built up its reputation around rapid fulfillment incredibly well,\u201d Mr. Carlborg said. \u201cCustomers really trust Amazon\u2019s fulfillment offerings.\u201dThose shoppers include Carissa Vinovskis, 26, who puts in 12-hour days researching diabetes at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. She used to shop for Christmas gifts in stores, but as she got busy with graduate school and later her job, she had less time and patience.Panic set in fast in the middle of this month when Ms. Vinovskis realized she had just six days to get presents before visiting her parents. She found a few cute things on Etsy \u2014 \u201cbeautiful, handcrafted gifts,\u201d she said \u2014 and then realized they would take about four weeks to arrive.\u201cI was like, welp, Amazon Prime it is!\u201d she said.An Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a statement in which the vice president who runs Prime, Cem Sibay, said, \u201cWe keep working to add faster and even more convenient delivery options.\u201dMr. Bezos saw that quick delivery could change how people buy things. Price and selection have always been important in retailing, but delivery would surpass store location as another critical factor.In 2005, Amazon began offering free two-day shipping for Prime members, which Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates covers more than two-thirds of households in the United States. Almost a decade later, it started Prime Now, which delivers goods in as little as an hour in 30 cities.Amazon now has over 110 fulfillment centers in North America, more than 250,000 warehouse employees and dozens of its own planes. It is setting up warehouses that hold tens of millions of items closer to major cities, letting it offer free same-day and one-day shipping on more products.These traditional retailers are leveraging their physical stores \u2014 a key advantage they have over Amazon \u2014 and providing ways for people to order online and pick up in person. That is particularly powerful in the final days before Christmas, when shoppers return to stores.For some Walmart purchases, customers don\u2019t need to leave their car to get their order \u2014 an employee will drop it into their trunk. Best Buy said more than 40 percent of its online revenue is from orders that are now picked up in stores. And on Christmas Eve, people can order products online from store inventory as late as 5 p.m. and pick them up just an hour later.Marshal Cohen, who advises retailers for the NPD Group, a market research firm, said three years ago, retailers rushed to match Amazon, offering free two-day shipping until just before Christmas \u2014 but didn\u2019t have their delivery partners sufficiently prepared for the rush.\u201cThey just clogged the system so badly and really disappointed a lot of consumers,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThat memory was pretty strong in a lot of consumers\u2019 minds when it comes to thinking about shopping online.\u201dAmazon is faster than every major competitor, though other retailers are speeding up. In 2016, Old Navy, which is owned by Gap, took about 10 days to deliver a package ordered during the week after Thanksgiving, Rakuten data shows. This year its packages showed up about three days faster. Walmart cut its delivery time from more than a week to six days over the same period. And Best Buy said 80 percent of its small packages now arrive in two days or under.(Rakuten\u2019s data excludes eBay and Etsy because the formats of their electronic receipts are harder to track.)Yet most retailers still have to work to win people\u2019s trust. Jessica Palazzo, who runs after-school programs near Hartford, Conn., bought her mother pajamas from Old Navy two years ago that were guaranteed to arrive before Christmas, but which didn\u2019t appear until January. Old Navy offered her 10 percent off her next order.This year on Black Friday, she put a pair of Gap pajamas into her online shopping cart \u2014 but then had a change of heart.\u201cThat\u2019s embarrassing if you come on Christmas and have nothing for somebody,\u201d Ms. Palazzo said.

So what can you do about it?That\u2019s the question of the year after many of the biggest tech companies were mired in scandal after scandal or exposed as having committed necessary evils to offer the products and services that we have so blissfully enjoyed.All of this bad behavior circles back to you. We are the buyers, users and supporters of the products and services that help Big Tech thrive.So what do we do at this point to become more ethical consumers?\u201cI think this is an incredibly powerful question to ask,\u201d said Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that focuses on technology\u2019s impact on families. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important moment where consumer behavior can have a transformational impact.\u201dThe article explores several ways to become more empowered, socially responsible tech consumers, including boycotting and shaming:First and foremost, when tech does you wrong, one of the most powerful ways to protest is to take your business elsewhere and ask your friends and family to go along.Even so, damage to a brand may have plenty of repercussions because it motivates the company to change its behavior, Mr. Steyer said. Both Uber and Facebook, facing enormous pressure, have modified some of their practices and committed to improvements.\u201cSometimes shame is one of the most important arrows in your quiver,\u201d Mr. Steyer said.Students, read the entire article, then tell us:\u2014 Are you an ethical consumer? How much do you know about the companies whose products you buy? Does your knowledge factor into your consumer choices?\u2014 How concerned are you about the behavior of tech companies? Which example from the article concerns you most? Tell us why?\u2014 Do we as consumers bear any responsibility for the behavior of companies whose products we buy or use? Does buying a product mean you condone the actions of its seller?\u2014 Which of the author\u2019s recommendations do you think is the most practical or effective? Which is the least?

{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From Facebook\u2019s Leaked Moderation Documents", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes an emoji is just an emoji. Sometimes it may be a threat.And with only a few seconds to spare, Facebook moderators have to make the call \u2014 even if the text that accompanies the laughing yellow face is in an unfamiliar language.To help with those decisions, Facebook has created a list of guidelines for what its two billion users should be allowed to say. The rules, which are regularly updated, are then given to its moderators.For Facebook, the goal is clarity. But for the thousands of moderators across the world, faced with navigating this byzantine maze of rules as they monitor billions of posts per day in over 100 languages, clarity is hard to come by.Facebook keeps its rulebooks and their existence largely secret. But The New York Times acquired 1,400 pages from these guidelines, and found problems not just in how the rules are drafted but in the way the moderation itself is done.Here are five takeaways from our story:The rules are discussed over breakfast every other Tuesday in a conference room in Menlo Park, Calif. \u2014 far from the social unrest that Facebook has been accused of accelerating.Though the company does consult outside groups, the rules are set largely by young lawyers and engineers, most of whom have no experience in the regions of the world they are making decisions about.The rules they create appear to be written for English speakers who at times rely on Google Translate. That suggests a lack of moderators with local language skills who might better understand local contexts.Facebook employees say they have not yet figured out, definitively, what sorts of posts can lead to violence or political turmoil. The rulebooks are best guesses.Some of the rules given to moderators are inaccurate, outdated or missing critical nuance.One presentation, for example, refers to the Bosnian war criminal Ratko Mladic as a fugitive, though he was arrested in 2011.Another appears to contain errors about Indian law, advising moderators that almost any criticism of religion should be flagged as probably illegal. In fact, criticizing religion is only illegal when it is intended to inflame violence, according to a legal scholar.In Myanmar, a paperwork error allowed a prominent extremist group, accused of fomenting genocide, to stay on the platform for months.Facebook outsources moderation to companies that hire the thousands of workers who enforce the rules. In some of these offices, moderators say they are expected to review many posts within eight to 10 seconds. The work can be so demanding that many moderators only last a few months.The moderators say they have little incentive to contact Facebook when they run across flaws in the process. For its part, Facebook largely allows the companies that hire the moderators to police themselves.Facebook is growing more assertive about barring groups and people, as well as types of speech, that it believes could lead to violence.In countries where the line between extremism and mainstream politics is blurry, the social network\u2019s power to ban some groups and not others means that it is, in essence, helping pick political winners and losers.Sometimes it removes political parties, like Golden Dawn in Greece, as well as mainstream religious movements in Asia and the Middle East. This can be akin to Facebook shutting down one side in national debates, one expert argues.Some interventions are more subtle. During elections in Pakistan, it told moderators to apply extra scrutiny to one party, but called another \u201cbenign.\u201dAnd its decisions often skew in favor of governments, which can fine or regulate Facebook.Even as Facebook tries to limit dangerous content on its platform, it is working to grow its audience in more countries.That tension can sometimes be seen in the guidelines.Moderators reviewing posts about Pakistan, for example, are warned against creating a \u201cPR fire\u201d by doing anything that might \u201chave a negative impact on Facebook\u2019s reputation or even put the company at legal risk.\u201dAnd by relying on outsourced workers to do most of the moderation, Facebook can keep costs down even as it sets rules for over two billion users.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "10 Classic Christmas Movies That Our Critics Didn\u2019t See Coming", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom as far back as Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d which struggled to find its footing in the end-of-the-year glut of late December 1946, predicting the canon of Christmas movie future has never been easy. Some of today\u2019s favorites had to survive a critical drubbing, or a ho-hum box office. Others needed a push from cable TV. And still others just didn\u2019t seem like holiday movies, becoming classics almost accidentally thanks to reclassification or cult followings.The holidays have given us an occasion to dig through the archives to see if New York Times critics were on the right side of history when they first reviewed these films, or if they missed an annual tradition in the making. Here\u2019s a sample of 10 that are currently available to stream \u2014 some established favorites, others quirky upstarts \u2014 along with excerpts from what our critics first thought of them and links to their full reviews.Frank Capra\u2019s classic tear-jerker about Christmas Eve as a dark night of the soul has been a Yuletide standard-bearer for so long that it\u2019s easy to forget what a ho-hum reception it got at the time. A best picture nomination was the sole consolation prize for a film about a small-town family man (James Stewart) that neither critics nor audiences fully embraced until the mid-1970s, when its revival as an annual television staple commenced. Sentiments like these, from Bosley Crowther\u2019s review, were common:Indeed, the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer\u2019s point of view, is the sentimentality of it \u2014 its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra\u2019s nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical attitudes rather than average realities. And Mr. Capra\u2019s \u201cturkey dinners\u201d philosophy, while emotionally gratifying, doesn\u2019t fill the hungry paunch.Irving Berlin won an Oscar for the song \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d but not for the movie \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d which wasn\u2019t produced until a decade after \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d the Bing Crosby-Fred Astaire musical in which the song first appeared. Christmas was but one of the occasions for mirth in \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d but here it is the VistaVision payoff to the team-up of two different song-and-dance acts. Crowther was unimpressed:\u201cThe colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring \u2014 or very little \u2014 such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn\u2019t hit the eardrums and the funny bone with equal force.\u201dBefore taking a decidedly warmer view of the holiday season with \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d the director Bob Clark offered this nasty piece of counterprogramming, a proto-\u201cHalloween\u201d slasher film with big scares and boozy wit, much of it coming from Margot Kidder. \u201cBlack Christmas\u201d proved to be vastly influential, particularly in its use of first-person camera, but contemporaneous reviews, like A.H. Weiler\u2019s, were dismissive:This moody depiction of the Christmas slayings of university sorority sisters and their housemother, among others, is as murky as the script, which dotes largely on obscenities that are no more pointed than the violence, dull direction and pedestrian performances.Clark\u2019s nostalgia-soaked comedy about a put-upon nine-year-old (Peter Billingsley) in the 1940s and his disaster-prone Midwestern family owes its popularity to Turner broadcasting, which turned a modest hit into a phenomenon by airing it relentlessly on TBS and TNT. Cherished details like the \u201cLittle Orphan Annie\u201d decoder ring, a triple-dog dare on the schoolyard and the Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle were lost on Vincent Canby at the time:There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them.Chaos and malevolence come to a Capra-esque small town in Joe Dante\u2019s anarchic comedy about an exotic pet from Chinatown that turns out to be a troublemaking Christmas present. Dante\u2019s Looney Tunes-style upending of its wholesome holiday setting pushed its PG rating far enough to help trigger the development of PG-13, and the kiddie-movie violence left Canby shaken:[Dante and the screenwriter Chris Columbus] attack their young audience as mercilessly as the creatures attack the characters. One minute they\u2019re fondly recalling Frank Capra\u2019s sentimental classic, \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d and the next minute they\u2019re subjecting this Capraesque Smalltown, U.S.A., to a devastation that makes the original \u2018Invasion of the Body Snatchers\u2019 look benign.Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d had been adapted so many times to heartwarming effect \u2014 as drama, in the Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim standards from 1938 and 1951; as a musical, with Albert Finney in 1970; and with Muppets in 1992 \u2014 that it needed Bill Murray to drop a few coals in the stocking. The film\u2019s spiked nog of cynicism and sentimentality wasn\u2019t easy for some to swallow, including Canby:As Frank Cross, the ratings-mad program chief of the IBC television network, Mr. Murray\u2019s contemporary Scrooge is a joy as long as he\u2019s making life miserable for everyone around him. When, finally, Frank sees the error of his ways, the movie succumbs to its heart of jelly.The question of whether \u201cDie Hard\u201d is a true Christmas movie, rather than merely the template for the last 30 years of action cinema, has been a perennial debate for a long time now. But in 1988, critics like Caryn James were mostly coming to terms with its blockbuster excess:Partly an interracial buddy movie, partly the sentimental tale of a ruptured marriage, the film is largely a special-effects carnival full of machine-gun fire, roaring helicopters and an exploding tank. It also has a villain fresh from the Royal Shakespeare Company, a thug from the Bolshoi Ballet and a hero who carries with him the smirks and wisecracks that helped make \u2018Moonlighting\u2019 a television hit. The strange thing is, it works: \u2018Die Hard\u2019 is exceedingly stupid, but escapist fun.Fatigue is in the air. This third look at the quintessentially middle-American Griswold family, led by Clark (Mr. Chase) and the very patient Ellen (Beverly D\u2019Angelo) is only a weary shadow of the original \u2018National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\u2019 which found a lot to laugh at as it followed the dopey paterfamilias Clark and his quarrelsome brood on a hellish cross-country journey in their station wagon.Christmas seems like the only occasion big enough to accommodate this oversized mistletoe from Richard Curtis, the screenwriter of \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and \u201cNotting Hill,\u201d who combines about half a dozen rom-coms into one mega-rom-com. The film\u2019s too-muchness is an annual indulgence for fans, but A.O. Scott, in one of his most blistering reviews, is not one of them:A romantic comedy swollen to the length of an Oscar-trawling epic \u2014 nearly two and a quarter hours of cheekiness, diffidence and high-tone smirking \u2014 it is more like a record label\u2019s greatest-hits compilation or a \u201cvery special\u201d sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie.Starting with his breakthrough script for \u201cLethal Weapon,\u201d Shane Black has set six of his films over Christmas in Los Angeles, but \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d his directorial debut, is especially keen about finding evidence of the holiday in a city where it isn\u2019t so obvious. This neo-noir buddy picture about a thief posing as an actor (Robert Downey Jr.) who joins forces with a private eye (Val Kilmer) on a murder case is Yuletide fun for smart-alecks, but not for A.O. Scott:I don\u2019t think \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d is an altogether bad movie. It\u2019s just a movie with no particular reason for existing, a flashy, trifling throwaway whose surface cleverness masks a self-infatuated credulity.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the character played by Chevy Chase in \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation.\u201d He is Clark Griswold, not Griswald. An earlier version of this article also misspelled the surname of an actor. He is Alastair Sim, not Sims.Advertisement"}

They are approximate.Colin O\u2019Brady, one of two men racing across Antarctica, became the first person to trek across the continent solo, unsupported and unaided by wind. O\u2019Brady, an American adventure athlete, and Louis Rudd, a captain in the British army, were not only racing against each other, but also the ultimate challenge against the most unforgiving forces of nature. On Dec. 25, O\u2019Brady made a final epic push, covering the last 80 or so miles of his more than 900-mile journey in one last 32-hour burst. Here\u2019s a look at some of their daily progress during the nearly two-month journey.Dec. 26Dec. 18Dec. 16Dec. 14Dec. 13Dec. 12Dec. 8Dec. 7Dec. 6Dec. 4Dec. 2Nov. 29Nov. 22Nov. 12Nov. 9Nov. 3Day 54Dec. 26, WednesdayRead more about O\u2019Brady\u2019s final push in our latest story.Day 46Dec. 18, TuesdayDespite the altitude, and all of their pain and obstacles, O\u2019Brady and Rudd seem to be growing stronger, as counterintuitive as that sounds. Part of that comes down to the conditions. Winds have been light, the surface firmer, and their lightened pulk sleds have been gliding more easily across the ice. But their will to see their expedition through has to be recognized.\u201cI want to get this next leg cracked up, done as quick as possible,\u201d Rudd said on the day he passed the South Pole. Three days later, on Sunday, Dec. 16, with Pink Floyd blaring in his ears, Rudd logged a personal record, 21 miles.Yet O\u2019Brady\u2019s lead continued to grow. He put in a remarkable 23.3 miles on Sunday and another 21 miles on Monday to reach the top of Titan Dome, the high point of their route. On Tuesday, he faced neither headwind, sastrugi or snow, and there was no incline, either. For once, gravity was in his favor, and O\u2019Brady was free to hammer. He did just that, finishing another lonely, 12-hour trek in Antarctica with 25.5 more miles in the bank.\u201cI feel energized. I feel positive,\u201d O\u2019Brady said from his campsite on Dec. 12, \u201cbut there is a reason no one has done it. It\u2019s going to require digging very deep.\u201dDay 44Dec. 16, SundayJenna Besaw, Colin O\u2019Brady\u2019s wife and expedition manager, spent all weekend running formulas to give him the best meal plan possible in terms of daily calories and variety. She gave him instructions to re-ration his food so that each day\u2019s provisions were packed and ready. He would now consume 6,100 calories per day, 900 less than he had been eating since the journey began.This could become an issue, because O\u2019Brady\u2019s calf muscle was already emaciated. He reported that his lower legs \u201cfeel more like the size of my arms at this point.\u201d His watch was now sliding around on his wrist, and the cold was starting to get to him, too.He had developed frostnip, a precursor to frostbite, on his nose and cheek, which he was insulating with black tape to keep the areas protected.Day 42Dec. 14, FridayHaving reached the South Pole at 9,301 feet, O'Brady and Rudd weren\u2019t done climbing. Before descending Leverett Glacier toward their finishing point on Ross Ice Shelf they would have to traverse Titan Dome, a plateau which tops out at 10,230 feet.Would they have the energy to pull it off? After eclipsing the pole both men reported ravenous hunger.\u201cI can\u2019t eat enough,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cMy metabolism is like a furnace. I put food in and then half an hour later I\u2019m hungry again.\u201dO\u2019Brady said he could easily eat twice his daily rations and according to Jenna Besaw, his wife and expedition manager, he\u2019s been craving dal bhat, a lentil and rice dish served in Himalayan tea houses, that powered him up Everest in 2016. But he didn\u2019t have the option of adding calories to his diet. After setting up camp on Dec. 14, he did a complete inventory of all his remaining food so Besaw could crunch the numbers and determine just how many calories he had left.Day 41Dec. 13, ThursdayHe woke early because he knew O\u2019Brady, the 33-year-old attempting the same feat, was more than a day ahead of him. Rudd was just 15 miles from the South Pole, a pivotal landmark on their journey, but O\u2019Brady had passed the pole the day before.Ever since the two men had disembarked from their Twin Otter ski plane and stepped onto the Ronne Ice Shelf on Nov. 3, a mile apart, they had been aiming for the flag of the South Pole.For weeks, both men had struggled through what has been described as the most challenging summer season in Antarctica in over a decade. Snowfall has been El Ni\u00f1o-like. The normally hard, icy surface of the continent has been caked with inches of fresh powder, which makes hauling a 300-pound sled stacked with everything you need to survive in Antarctica for two months, very slow going.After that 4 a.m. wake-up call, with the roaring polar winds rattling his tent, Rudd emerged into another total whiteout. He plowed ahead for 11 hours, covering 18 miles before arriving at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station at 4:45 p.m. He received a hero\u2019s welcome from the scientists gathered at the candy-cane striped ceremonial pole. The pole is topped with a globe and surrounded by flags of the 12 original signatories of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. On the globe, someone had placed a sticker that read, \u201cGo Lou Go\u201dDay 40Dec. 12, WednesdayJust after 10 a.m., he saw the metallic geometric buildings that form the research station and zeroed in on the ceremonial South Pole. For O\u2019Brady\u2019s arrival, someone had placed a sticker that read \u201cGo Colin Go!\u201d The actual geographic South Pole was still 150 yards away, signified by a sign. (The ceremonial and geographic poles are different because the research station is built on snow and ice that is 10,000-feet thick in places, yet moves roughly 10 meters each year. Each New Year\u2019s Day, residents of the research station, who conduct seismology, astronomy and air quality studies and operate on New Zealand time, move the sign to the true geographic pole.)Two scientists, including an American, were there to cheer O\u2019Brady on. They represented the first bit of civilization he had seen in over a month. The appeal of human contact worried him (to remain \u201cunsupported,\u201d he couldn\u2019t accept so much as a cup of hot tea from them), so after an hour, he moved on.Day 36Dec. 8, SaturdayO\u2019Brady reached the 89th degree of latitude, also known in polar parlance as \u201cthe last degree.\u201d That put him just 69 miles away from the South Pole. It was getting colder. The wind chill within the last degree plummeted toward minus 80 degrees.O\u2019Brady described his condition via satellite phone: \u201cI\u2019ve definitely lost some weight,\u201d he said. \u201cMy legs are crazy skinny.\u201d He also talked about his fingers, which he said were \u201ccracking like crazy.\u201d He had taken to filling dozens of microcuts with super glue each night, to, in his words, \u201ctry to get my fingernails and fingers to not completely crack into a million pieces.\u201dHe also had to remain conscious of the ticking clock, which he had sped up. When he was getting ready to depart Union Glacier just before the launch of the expedition, he was having trouble pulling his sled and elected to leave three-and-a-half days of food behind. That meant he only had enough food for 61-and-a-half days, and if he didn\u2019t make the pole by Day 40, it would be hard to imagine making it to the far shore by Day 61. He still had a lead of over 20 miles on Rudd, but O\u2019Brady was also fighting time.Day 35Dec. 7, FridayFor 30 minutes, they spoke about taking risks and the dedication to craft it takes to achieve any masterwork. \u201cThis will be my \u2018Graceland\u2019 if I can complete it,\u201d O\u2019Brady wrote via text after they talked. \u201c[It\u2019s] taking every ounce of everything I\u2019ve trained for and learned.\u201dDay 34Dec. 6, ThursdayAs Rudd got his first taste of the polar plateau at 8,700 feet, he was noticing that his base layers felt loose. Before the expedition, Rudd mentioned that early on in the journey he would have to force feed himself the 5,000 to 6,000 calories he planned to consume each day, because he just wouldn\u2019t be that hungry, but at some point that dynamic would flip as his body mass started to shrink. On Dec. 6, he could feel it coming.Day 32Dec. 4, TuesdayO\u2019Brady ascended onto the polar plateau, leaving the sastrugi \u2014 wave-like speed bumps in the snow \u2014 behind. Although he still had 600 feet of elevation to gain before he reached the South Pole, it was over 100 miles away, which meant the terrain was relatively flat. Thanks in part to all the fresh snow, however, conditions remained treacherous. The cold (around minus 30 degrees) is more severe on the plateau, and as O\u2019Brady moved closer to the pole, the effects of altitude were compounded by pressure.The centrifugal force of the earth\u2019s rotation means that the atmosphere is thin at the poles, where the air is even drier. Combined with exertion, that dryness can lead to dehydration, which can cause or exacerbate altitude sickness. O\u2019Brady said that when you close in on the pole, 9,000 feet in elevation can feel like 12,000 or even 14,000 feet.But it\u2019s not all pain and misery out there. Antarctica does deliver rare gifts. Occasionally, when the conditions are right and there are enough frozen ice crystals in the air, a circular rainbow forms a halo around the sun. Sometimes called a sun dog, its scientific name is a parhelion, and on this journey, both men have been stopped, mesmerized by them. O\u2019Brady documented the phenomenon on Dec. 5 and Rudd on Dec. 4.Day 30Dec. 2, SundayBoth men had encountered severe sastrugi since early in the expedition, but on this day, the wave-like speed bumps in the snow were especially steep and severe. Sometimes their sleds caught on a lip behind them, yanking them down from behind. Other times they tripped on a ledge of ice they couldn\u2019t see and fell hard, face first.Another common demon the competitors share is isolation. Whenever O\u2019Brady is reached on his satellite phone, his opening greeting is some variation of \u201cHello from the middle of nowhere Antarctica, all alone!\u201d He says it with levity, but it\u2019s also true. Aside from a nightly call with their expedition managers, he and Rudd are on their own as they navigate a monotonous physical and emotional landscape. O\u2019Brady talks to himself a little every day, but mostly, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s just me stuck in my own head.\u201dRudd relies on audiobooks just to hear the sound of a human voice. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like having someone talking to you,\u201d Rudd said via satellite phone. \u201cI find that quite comforting.\u201dOn Day 30, Rudd was comforted by more than a faceless recording. He\u2019d had a tough morning battling sastrugi and was feeling \u201cdone in\u201d when, at about 2 p.m., he caught something moving out of the corner of his eye. He turned, and to his astonishment, there was a little white bird, a snow petrel about the size of a dove, fluttering in front of him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just like it flew by or anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was deliberately looking straight into me.\u201cI\u2019m not deeply spiritual or anything like that, but if there was ever someone coming to check up on me, that was it. It was just surreal.\u201dDay 27Nov. 29, ThursdayO\u2019Brady experienced his most difficult day since early in the expedition. After just three hours of travel, he lost a skin from his ski and was forced to set up camp to repair it. Because of the delay, Rudd, who began the day nearly 24 miles behind, finished within 12 miles of O\u2019Brady. The race was on.Day 20Nov. 22, ThursdayIn raging wind and swirling snow, Rudd decided to take a big risk that endangered his entire expedition. He decided to try and divide his gear in half and ferry the first load forward two miles before coming back for the rest. But his gear was buried in snow by the time he returned. Good thing for Rudd, he had marked the waypoint and found all of his supplies, but it could have been disastrous.Day 10Nov. 12, MondayAfter a somewhat smooth start, both men entered the sastrugi obstacle course. It's true that the more they ate, the lighter their pulks became, but the challenge didn't get any easier. Rudd and O'Brady had to drag their sleds up and over or around thousands upon thousands of sastrugi as they climbed toward the polar plateau.Day 7Nov. 9, FridayO\u2019Brady took the lead for the first time. During this first week, just pulling their pulks, which began at 375 pounds, was the stiffest challenge. O'Brady said the weight literally brought him to tears. He charged as many as 20 miles in one day at first but then struggled to put together a string of 12-mile days.Day 1Nov. 3, SaturdayAt around noon on Nov. 3, Rudd and O\u2019Brady boarded a Twin Otter ski plane that took off over Mount Rossman and banked east. After a 90-minute flight, they landed on the Ronne Ice Shelf. O\u2019Brady got out first and collected his gear. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Rudd told him. \u201cI think we\u2019re both going to make it.\u201dThey hugged goodbye, likely their last human contact for at least two months. Then, while O\u2019Brady strapped into his sled, the plane drove about a mile away to Rudd\u2019s parallel starting point. (That means O\u2019Brady technically had about a 10-minute head start, but it would prove negligible over such a long distance).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Husband Was Hurt by an I.E.D. The Lasting Injury Was to Our Family.", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarTwo years ago, my son, who is now 14, erupted in anger and stormed off to his bedroom. He\u2019d been having frequent fits of rage and anxiety, yelling and throwing things around the house or simply breaking down in tears. During his latest one, I was startled by how his tantrum abruptly fell silent. His bedroom was eerily quiet. I listened at his door knowing that he couldn\u2019t have calmed himself so quickly. I was terrified to walk into the room and find my son dead.Life after the Marine Corps wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. As a gunnery sergeant, my husband, Chuck, served as assistant kennel master and chief trainer for the military working-dog platoon. He served on active duty in the Marine Corps for 12 years, followed by two more in the reserve at Quantico in Virginia. We were high-school sweethearts who married after he enlisted and I graduated from college. In addition to our oldest son, we have twin 11-year-old daughters and a 7-year-old son, who was born just two weeks after Chuck returned home from his final deployment. Our family moved 11 times during Chuck\u2019s time in the service. When deploying and relocating got tough, I always thought we just had to hang on until retirement, when life would be simpler and more predictable. I knew that every combat deployment could end in an injury or worse. I never imagined that our lives, and the lives of our children, would be so torn apart by the damage we couldn\u2019t see.On March 29, 2011, a bomb blast struck him while he was on patrol in Afghanistan. While on a mission with a canine unit, one of Chuck\u2019s Marines stepped on an I.E.D. that left him with catastrophic wounds and threw my husband 20 feet from where he was standing. When he regained consciousness, Chuck provided medical support to his Marine, cleared a landing zone for a medevac and then came under heavy fire for the next six hours. He did not realize that the blood on his uniform was his own. His injuries \u2014 shrapnel wounds to his neck and back, hearing loss and a severe concussion \u2014 were bad enough that I received a call from the Marine Corps, but not so bad that he would have to leave the theater. They packed his shrapnel wounds and gave him the standard treatment for his pain and disorientation: two weeks off, with a generous prescription of sleep medication.While still deployed, Chuck immediately began having spells of confusion and memory loss. These symptoms only grew worse, accompanied by wild mood swings when he returned home. Chuck realized something was very wrong and decided to get out of the military. That was in 2012. The adrenaline and adventure of our Marine Corps life ended suddenly. We were separated from the love and support of our fellow military families. Chuck, who had always been on the move, was now at home every hour of every day, struggling with anger, depression, memory loss and fatigue. After a few years of dealing with these symptoms, the V.A. told us that Chuck had a traumatic brain injury, and doctors also diagnosed him with severe post-traumatic stress disorder. His ability to love, teach and care for our kids was deteriorating. I took on the full responsibility of watching over our family. Every task, from cooking dinner and paying bills to managing my husband\u2019s health care and our kids\u2019 schedules, falls on me. I am still a wife and mother, but often feel like a physician, pharmacist and social worker, too.In December 2011, a therapist asked our daughters, who were suffering from debilitating separation anxiety, to draw a picture of how they thought their dad was injured. We had always spared them specifics in hopes of protecting them. Now we learned they had filled in their own dramatic and disturbing details. I nearly broke down as my sweet little girls colored scenes of violence, blood and gore. It was no wonder they brimmed with stress. But our oldest son felt the impact the most. When he reached his teenage years, I leaned on him to watch his three younger siblings, so I could leave the house for errands. I quickly realized the responsibility was too much for him to handle. Our son grew hypersensitive to Chuck\u2019s moods, desperately trying to keep the younger kids quiet so they didn\u2019t trigger their father. If Chuck became agitated, our son would do his best to distract his siblings or move them to another part of the house. Even if my husband had a good day, our son couldn\u2019t shake the anxiety that the mood in the house might swing at any moment. The kids couldn\u2019t simply leave the house; Chuck occasionally struggles with the simplest daily tasks, such as remembering to eat and preparing his food. My son was terrified his dad would get lost or hurt himself while he was on caregiver duty.I watched as secondary post-traumatic stress overtook our son. He began to display many of the same symptoms as Chuck, becoming irritable, sullen and quick to anger. He was chronically late to school because panic attacks would keep him locked in the bathroom. Like his father, he complained of headaches and fatigue and wanted to stay in bed all day. When I told him he had to go to school, he resented it. He didn\u2019t understand why he was being forced to power through things.At 12 years old, our son reached a dangerous phase. I\u2019d find him sitting quietly with the chilling thousand-yard stare that I recognized from my husband. He began to see how close he could get to committing suicide without actually doing it. He stood near balconies and ledges, looking over the edge in a trance. I remember grabbing him by the shoulders once, pleading with him to let go of the responsibility he felt to help me care for his dad. I begged him to have fun and enjoy all the good times and mischief that come with being a teenager. But he couldn\u2019t shake the chronic nervousness and dread. The afternoon that I listened outside my son\u2019s bedroom door, I waited to hear any signs of the anger he\u2019d just shown, but there was only silence. I forced my way in and found him semiconscious on the floor \u2014 a dog leash that he had wrapped around his neck was still hanging from the top bunk. The feeling of suffocating and knowing that he was about to die saved his life. He had the strength to break free from the noose, but collapsed afterward.Some people are surprised that Chuck\u2019s injuries would cause such problems for our family, particularly because his wounds aren\u2019t as apparent as severe burns or lost limbs. At parties, friends will casually say, \u201cHe seems fine to me,\u201d not knowing that the exhaustion of socializing will keep him in bed for the next two days. Loved ones get angry when we arrive late for dinner, calling us inconsiderate rather than understanding how hard it is to get a family of six out the door when your husband constantly battles dizzy spells and struggles to keep track of time. Teachers are quick to label our kids\u2019 outbursts at school as poor behavior, not knowing how nervous they were that their dad had to go to the neurologist again to figure out why he was losing consciousness during conversations. In many ways, Chuck\u2019s injuries are even harder on our children than on him. Our kids don\u2019t understand why their mom and dad don\u2019t have a typical husband-wife relationship. They become frustrated when family outings are canceled at the last minute, or when their dad misses another event. And because they can\u2019t see their father\u2019s injuries, the details of what happened to him are supplied by their imaginations.We have now learned to avoid the types of situations that trigger Chuck\u2019s dark moods. Navigation apps and our shared Google calendar help me manage his daily schedule while giving him some independence. We\u2019re looking into promising alternative therapies for his PTSD, and we never lose hope that he can improve and heal. And for all the problems that don\u2019t come with solutions, we rely on our faith.Since our son\u2019s suicide attempt, we have become even more determined to restore some sense of normalcy and balance in our lives. Our kids attend regular appointments with psychiatrists, and we have seen a dramatic improvement in their behavior. My son and I have learned to talk more openly about when he can help at home and when he needs a break. I tell him not to be afraid of where life takes him; it will work out the way it is supposed to. He now wants to follow in his dad\u2019s footsteps by joining the military. Despite Chuck\u2019s injury and the way it affects our family, I know the experience will serve to make my son a better, more compassionate service member.Liz Rotenberry is the Fellows Programs Coordinator and a Dole Caregiver Fellow Alumna with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.

{"Headline": "\u2018A Christmas Story\u2019 (1983) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them.The film, which opens today at the Guild and other theaters, is about growing up in the early 1940\u2019s in a middle-size city in Indiana. In particular it\u2019s about 9-year-old Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) who, more than anything else in the world, wants to own a genuine Red Ryder air rifle, one that comes complete with a shockproof compass and a sundial set into its stock.\u201cA Christmas Story\u201d tells how Ralphie fares in his campaign to win such a Christmas present from his father and mother (Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon) and a good deal of what it was like to be young in pre- World War II Indiana.Just about everything that is good about \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d can be attributed to Jean Shepherd, the novelist and radio-television humorist who wrote the book \u201cIn God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,\u201d from which the screenplay was adapted by him, by his wife, Leigh Brown, and by Bob Clark, the director. The best thing to be said about Mr. Clark as a director is that he admires Mr. Shepherd\u2019s wildly hyperbolic humor, though he doesn\u2019t have much of a gift for translating it to film.Mr. Shepherd is a most engaging raconteur who transforms small stories of everyday life into tall tales of fantastic adventure. In his words, an after-school encounter between Ralphie and a neighborhood bully named Scot Farkus becomes a collision of Olympian deities. Mr. Shepherd himself reads the sometimes very funny voice-over commentaries on the screen action and, you may be sure, is responsible for the bits and pieces of 1940s trivia we see. These include the sight of Ralphie\u2019s younger brother so bundled up in a pre-miracle-fabric snowsuit that he can\u2019t even move his arms. Those were the days.Mr. Clark, the director of \u201cPorky\u2019s\u201d and \u201cTribute,\u201d does not have a light touch. However, his heavy touch is not quite the same thing as Mr. Shepherd\u2019s habit of finding humor through the exaggeration of language. The movie\u2019s big comic pieces tend only to be exceedingly busy. Though Mr. Billingsley, Mr. Gavin, Miss Dillon and the actress who plays Ralphie\u2019s school teacher (Tedde Moore) are all very able, they are less funny than actors in a television situation comedy that one has chosen to watch with the sound turned off.Most of the period details are good and accurate. However, I\u2019m not at all sure that the curriculum at the Warren G. Harding Public School, which Ralphie attends, would require that 9-year-olds read \u201cSilas Marner.\u201d\u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d which has been rated PG (\u201cparental guidance suggested\u201d), contains some vulgar language, though not one particular word that Mr. Shepherd, talking on the soundtrack, describes as \u201cthe queen-mother of dirty words.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the U.S. Stop China From Controlling the Next Internet Age?", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech executives worry China will turn to tit-for-tat arrests of Americans in response to the detention of Meng Wanzhou. And the worries don\u2019t stop there. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Imagine, if you will (and you should), a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing.\u201cIt\u2019s worrisome, because it\u2019s an escalation we did not need,\u201d one executive said, referring to the already tense trade talks between the two countries. \u201cWhat China will do, given all the existing tensions, is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201dNo one I spoke to would talk on the record, out of fear of antagonizing either side and also because no one knows exactly what is happening. But many expressed worry about the possibility of tit-for-tat arrests. While everyone focuses on the drama of the arrest \u2014 Ms. Meng was grabbed while changing planes at the airport \u2014 and its effect on the trade talks and stock prices, to my mind there is a much more important fight brewing, and it is about tech hegemony. Specifically, who will control the next internet age, and by whose rules will it be run?Until recently, that answer was clearly the United States, from which the Internet sprang, wiring the world together and, in the process, resulting in the greatest creation of power and wealth in history. While China has always had a strong technology sector, in recent years it has significantly escalated its investment, expertise and innovation, with major support from the government.That hand-in-glove relationship creates obvious issues, and the Trump administration is right to stop pretending that China does not present a threat both from security and innovation perspectives.But the high-profile arrest of Ms. Meng underscored a new and disturbing spiraling in the already complex relationship the tech industry has with China and the Trump administration.The Justice Department had been investigating Huawei on suspicion of having violated sanctions against exporting American technologies to Iran, and the arrest of Ms. Meng appears to be part of that effort. Since Huawei has become a global powerhouse in smartphones and equipment for the mobile networks, it\u2019s no surprise that scrutiny about whose interests it is serving would increase. The company\u2019s founder, and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which had long set off warning bells among American intelligence officials about Huawei\u2019s ties with the Chinese government. All this makes the move against Ms. Meng look like a particularly bold one and a message to China that the United States has come to play. The government has a lot to be concerned about. As critical 5G \u2014 fifth generation \u2014 wireless networks roll out over the world, many are being deployed by Huawei. These are the networks that will usher in the next age of innovation, and the idea of China \u2014 which pretty much exemplifies the surveillance economy \u2014 dominating that age is troubling.But I am perplexed about why the Trump administration has been such an embarrassment when it comes to the kind of actual leadership and vision needed to keep the United States at the forefront of the tech race. Our government\u2019s commitment to investment in what\u2019s coming next is the best counterpart to vigilance against competitors like China. Instead, we are seeing a loud but decidedly empty effort to promote the idea that tech manufacturing should return to the United States (it won\u2019t) and a very weak commitment to bringing qualified tech and science minds into the centers of power (a good pick for the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy has yet to be confirmed after being nominated this year).From where I sit, the sentiment in Silicon Valley seems to be: Good for the government for being tough on Chinese companies when they break the rules \u2014 that rule-breaking having been a longtime complaint of companies like Cisco and Apple. Vigilance is key, of course, but everyone would feel a lot more confident if the government was also focused on investing more in American innovation and if the crackdown looked less chaotic.Which is why you can imagine a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing. And our government should, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We Now Know About Russian Disinformation", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Senate gave my research team data from social media companies. The picture that emerges is grim.The Senate committee asked two research teams, one of which I led, to investigate the full scope of the recent multiyear Russian operation to influence American opinion executed by a company called the Internet Research Agency. The Senate provided us with data attributed to the agency\u2019s operations given to the Senate by Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company), companies whose platforms were manipulated for that purpose.Our report, announced by the committee on Monday, concludes that Russia was able to masquerade successfully as a collection of American media entities, managing fake personas and developing communities of hundreds of thousands, building influence over a period of years and using it to manipulate and exploit existing political and societal divisions. While Russia is hardly the only geopolitical actor with a well-thumbed disinformation playbook, a look at the data \u2014 which concerned the Internet Research Agency\u2019s operation over the last three years \u2014 reveals its enthusiasm for and commitment to modern information warfare.Regardless of what any tech executives may have said, the data indicate that this was not a small-scale problem fixable by tweaking a platform\u2019s advertising purchase policy. Rather, it was a cross-platform attack that made use of numerous features on each social network and that spanned the entire social ecosystem.Tech executives have also stressed that Russian disinformation efforts were a small percentage of the total content on any individual platform during the years in question. That is correct. But it obscures the more important point: For subgroups of targeted Americans, such as African-Americans, the messaging was perhaps ubiquitous. And disinformation does not stay within a subgroup. \u201cVirality,\u201d a term beloved by internet marketers, is apropos here: A vulnerable few contract an initial \u201cinfection\u201d that then spreads exponentially through the broader population, ultimately enabling the infection to \u201cjump\u201d into entirely different populations (including offline populations, in this case).In official statements to Congress, tech executives have said that they found it beyond their capabilities to assess whether Russia created content intended to discourage anyone from voting. We have determined that Russia did create such content. It propagated lies about voting rules and processes, attempted to steer voters toward third-party candidates and created stories that advocated not voting.Our analysis underscores the fact that such influence operations are not specific to one platform, one malign actor or one targeted group. This is a global problem. The consolidation of the online social ecosystem into a few major platforms means that propagandists have ready audiences; they need only blanket a handful of services to reach hundreds of millions of people. And precision targeting, made possible by a decade of gathering detailed user behavior data (in the service of selling ads), means that it is easy and inexpensive to reach any targeted group.Ultimately, the biggest lesson from the Senate committee\u2019s request for our investigation of Russian interference is the troubling absence of adequate structures for collaboration among multiple stakeholders, private and public alike, to establish solutions and appropriate oversight.The hard truth is that the problem of disinformation campaigns will never be fixed; it\u2019s a constantly evolving arms race. But it can \u2014 and must \u2014 be managed. This will require that social media platforms, independent researchers and the government work together as partners in the fight. We cannot rely on \u2014 nor should we place the full burden on \u2014 the social media platforms themselves.The landscape of disinformation is, frankly, a grim one. Russia has already signaled its intention to continue information operations. Terrorists strategically counter attempts to kick them off popular platforms. Domestic ideologues adopt the manipulative distribution tactics used by foreign propagandists. But there is some cause for hope. With our report (and that of others) on the Internet Research Agency data, we now have a far more complete picture of what happened with Russian disinformation efforts from 2014 to 2017. There is heightened public interest in the topic, the social platforms are actively participating in trying to find solutions and the government\u2019s investigation is fueling a conversation about regulation. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, has even proposed a comprehensive new cyberdoctrine.With discipline, rigor and broad collaboration, we can meet this challenge, establishing standards, protocols and governance that will defend the integrity of our information.Ren\u00e9e DiResta is the director of research at New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company that monitors disinformation.Advertisement"}

It all might have faded into history, except Mr. Relotius was outed this month by his own publication as a serial fraudster who invented sources, made up quotes and spent years engaging in broad journalistic deception.When he was exposed, the fact that his portrayal of Fergus Falls was false went public, too, as well as the efforts of some people in town to document what he got wrong.\u201cI just think of the false impression it gave to the people of Germany,\u201d said Mary Lou Bates, 85, as she drank coffee with a friend Wednesday at the Viking Cafe, one of the many places in town that Mr. Relotius described inaccurately in his March 2017 story.But Ms. Bates, who suggested that bias against Mr. Trump may have fueled the article, said she was not one to hold a grudge. \u201cIf the story is retracted, and the true story comes out,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can forgive. I\u2019m one for forgiveness.\u201dIndeed, amid the heartache and hassle, some in Fergus Falls have seized an opportunity to tell the world what their city is really like. Sure, it has its struggles and tensions. But on the whole, residents get along, there is plenty to do, people enjoy living there.\u201cIt\u2019s not Mayberry, but there\u2019s a lot of opportunity,\u201d said Mr. Schierer, who owns a pizza restaurant and brewery where Mr. Relotius would write when he was in town. \u201cThere\u2019s optimism.\u201dBecause the article was published only in German, its readership in Minnesota was limited. And at first, some in Fergus Falls said there was a desire to give Mr. Relotius the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps they had read a faulty translation. Or maybe the reporter made a few honest mistakes.Civic leaders eventually commissioned a professional translation, the text of which circulated around town in a shared online document. As the truth spread \u2014 that the story was not only largely false, but also deeply insulting \u2014 residents began weighing their options. City officials discussed whether they had any legal recourse. Ms. Anderson and a friend began compiling a list of the article\u2019s inaccuracies. But unsure what options they had and not wanting to draw more negative attention, residents mostly kept their anger within city limits until Mr. Relotius\u2019s broader misdeeds were exposed this month.The fabrications in the article ranged from the trivial (an account of a foreboding forest that does not exist and a Super Bowl party that did not happen) to the personally devastating (the city administrator was falsely portrayed as a gun-obsessed, romantically challenged man who had never seen the ocean) to the downright inflammatory (Mr. Relotius claimed \u2014 falsely, residents say \u2014 that there was a sign that said \u201cMexicans Keep Out\u201d at the entrance to town). He seemed to conflate and invent biographies for different Hispanic people and said \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d had been playing for months on end at the local movie theater, a claim rebutted by residents.\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing like this feeling \u2014 knowing that people in another country have read about the place I call home and are shaking their heads over their coffee in disgust,\u201d Ms. Anderson wrote in her post.The election results speak for themselves, but a series of interviews this week with Fergus Falls residents revealed political nuance \u2014 liberals, conservatives, people who politely said it was no one\u2019s business.\u201cIt\u2019s not an eyes-closed, all-for-Trump type of community,\u201d said Ward Uggerud, 69, a retired electrical engineer, who like many people declined to say whether he voted for the president. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-for-the-community place. Everybody\u2019s got to do their part.\u201dUnlike other American counties that voted for Mr. Trump, there was not a wild political swing in Fergus Falls, making it a strange place for Mr. Relotius to choose to profile. Otter Tail County had also supported Mitt Romney and John McCain. And well-trod story lines about factory closures and population decline, often cited in accounts of Mr. Trump\u2019s success, did not apply in Fergus Falls, where the downtown is bustling and the population is steady. (A Target store closed recently, despite community efforts to save it, but that was after Mr. Relotius left town.)All that left residents wondering: Why did Mr. Relotius write what he did? And since he wasn\u2019t going to tell the truth, why did he even bother coming?\u201cWhat happened, I think, was that he was trying to look for a clich\u00e9 of a Trump-voting town and he simply didn\u2019t find it,\u201d said Christoph Scheuermann, the Der Spiegel correspondent who visited Fergus Falls last week to apologize and write about the town\u2019s true story.Mr. Scheuermann said the Fergus Falls he encountered was \u201calmost the opposite\u201d of the one Mr. Relotius described.\u201cI felt a lot of warmth,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was welcoming.\u201dMatt Furber reported from Fergus Falls, and Mitch Smith from Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Self-Driving Cars Are Set to Return in a Downsized Test", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber was driving its autonomous vehicles on public roads in four cities \u2014 sometimes at night \u2014 at speeds as high as 55 miles an hour when testing was halted after the accident. Starting within a few weeks, it plans to run the vehicles on a mile loop between two company offices in Pittsburgh. They won\u2019t operate at night or in wet weather, and they won\u2019t exceed 25 m.p.h., Uber said Wednesday.But even as the company has lowered expectations, its autonomous car technology has faced considerable issues. The cars have reacted more slowly than human drivers and struggled to pass so-called track validation tests, the last step before returning to city streets, according to a dozen Uber documents and emails as well as interviews with seven current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk publicly about the company.The scaled-down street testing would be a humble return for a cutting-edge effort that Uber\u2019s executives once considered a key to its prosperity. While Uber is growing fast and is expected to make its debut on Wall Street next year, it is wildly unprofitable. The company lost $1 billion in its most recent quarter.Self-driving cars were supposed to help cut Uber\u2019s losses by eliminating the need for drivers, perhaps the company\u2019s biggest expense. But expectations were well ahead of the technology.At a recent staff meeting, Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, acknowledged errors in Uber\u2019s earlier driverless car efforts. \u201cWe did screw up,\u201d he said in comments provided by Uber.The San Francisco company took its autonomous vehicles to Arizona in 2017, deploying more than 100 on roads around Phoenix. In March, a woman in Tempe was fatally struck at night by one that was going 39 m.p.h. along a 13-mile route. It was one of about 200 Uber self-driving cars being tested on roads in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.Some test drivers had worried that Uber was too aggressive. They complained, for example, that a software update had led to erratic driving by the cars, including once when the vehicles started running red lights, two self-driving vehicle test drivers said.But as recently as a few weeks ago, the company\u2019s autonomous vehicle unit, Uber Advanced Technologies Group, or A.T.G., was still experiencing track testing \u201cfailures\u201d on different versions of its software, according internal company emails.To match the reaction time of a human driver at 25 m.p.h., the cars needed to drive \u201c20% slower than a human,\u201d Brandon Basso, a director at A.T.G., said in a Nov. 1 email. Even at slower speeds, the cars were passing only 82 percent of track tests, according to company documents.A week later, Eric Meyhofer, who heads the unit, declared that Uber was going back to 25 m.p.h. The faster speed would prove that the cars were \u201cunequivocally worthy of being back on the road,\u201d he wrote in an email.Some engineers thought there was another reason: Mr. Meyhofer wanted to demonstrate progress to his boss, Mr. Khosrowshahi. And they worried that Uber was taking shortcuts to hit internal milestones, according to two current employees.An Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said the company would not compromise safety to meet development goals.\u201cAs we have said many times before, our return is predicated on successfully passing our rigorous track tests and having our letter of authorization from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in hand,\u201d Ms. Abboud said.While Uber\u2019s cars have been off the streets, its competitors have pushed ahead with similar projects.Mr. Meyhofer was confident that Uber\u2019s cars could resume street testing in the summer, and he instructed engineers to start planning a party to celebrate their return, according to five people familiar with the plan. But employees worried that a party would appear insensitive, and it was set aside.Government guidelines for autonomous vehicle testing are, at best, piecemeal. But under rules the company set for itself, the testing vehicles would always have at least two people driving and monitoring their systems \u2014 a standard among its competitors \u2014 and the braking system would be turned on.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the wild West,\u201d said John P. Thomas, a research engineer specializing in autonomous vehicle safety at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cEveryone is just doing what they think is best.\u201dIn July, Uber put its self-driving cars back on the road in Pittsburgh, but with human drivers. The resumption of autonomous testing on city streets would take longer. Uber laid off the majority of its vehicle operators in Pittsburgh and shut down an autonomous trucking unit to focus exclusively on cars.By late summer, Uber was planning for an Oct. 12 return date. But executives worried that testing on closed tracks had been \u201cuncoordinated and slow\u201d at a September software leadership retreat in Montana, according to internal documents.\u201cWe are committed to anticipating and managing risks that may come with this type of testing, but we cannot \u2014 as no self-driving developer can \u2014 anticipate and eliminate every one,\u201d he wrote.Uber pushed the return date to Nov. 28. But when a test in early November ran Uber\u2019s vehicles through more than 70 categories at 25 m.p.h., they failed in 10 of them, including being slow to recognize another car that didn\u2019t yield.In an email, Jon Thomason, who leads the software efforts at A.T.G., urged employees not to \u201cpanic,\u201d because this wasn\u2019t the latest version of the autonomous software. Ms. Abboud, the Uber spokeswoman, said that some of the failures involved \u201cintermittent\u201d braking, but that the company did not consider it a safety issue.A number of engineers on the team anticipated that they would miss another deadline, but Mr. Meyhofer sent an email on Nov. 27 declaring that, as of 6:30 p.m. that day, Uber\u2019s autonomous system was ready for on-road testing.Uber still hadn\u2019t received permission from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, but management was ready to declare victory. Ms. Abboud said that as of Wednesday, the company had not received a response from the state.\u201cThis is a huge win,\u201d Mr. Meyhofer wrote. \u201cWe are nearly there! I can hardly wait to see us hit this milestone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When Facebook Goes the Way of Myspace?", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyFacebook earned more than $5 billion in profit last quarter, and yet it has spent much of 2018 trapped in a defensive crouch. This year was defined by brutal press coverage, internal strife, executive departures and unwanted attention from authorities. The company stands accused of various offenses: degrading politics; empowering despots; leaving users vulnerable to abuse; abusing its users\u2019 data for profit. It is in a constant state of crisis such that its executives\u2019 responses to scandals end up becoming scandals themselves.But the single event most pertinent to Facebook\u2019s future, and with the most explanatory power regarding its recent past, came in January, when the company admitted its flagship site had found a worrying limit. In late 2017, 185 million people a day were using Facebook in the United States and Canada. Despite strenuous efforts \u2014 you may have noticed more notifications lately \u2014 that number hasn\u2019t been exceeded since.The sheer scope and depth of a typical user\u2019s relationship with Facebook are unique to the site, as is its reach. Should the company ever collapse \u2014 or become so clearly moribund it might as well have died \u2014 more than a billion people worldwide would need to unwind their relationship with the platform. Of course, we\u2019ve lost plenty of networks before. One day, we\u2019ll be done with Facebook, at least as we know it. Will it be done with us?Myspace was always a mess. It encouraged users to tweak HTML on their profile pages, generating whole categories of expression and interaction beyond what was laid out for users. In hindsight, Myspace\u2019s amateurish sensibility made it difficult to understand and easy to dismiss: inscrutable user names, odd forms of interaction, millions of attempts at self-expression blending into a wall of aesthetic noise. But it bridged a dying web of personal sites with budding ideas about social networking \u2014 it\u2019s easy to forget just how sterile and organized Facebook looked in comparison when it first showed up. After years of relaunches, redesigns, data breaches and general neglect, many Myspace users have lost the ability to contact their former selves. If they\u2019re lucky (and can remember or recover their passwords), they might get access to some old photos and a list of friends \u2014 at best, shreds of evidence of something far greater, now lost.Where did everything else go? After it peaked, Myspace underwent its series of reinventions. News Corp., which acquired Myspace in 2005 for $580 million, sold it six years later for $35 million. The buyer, Specific Media, was an internet advertising company. Myspace was shrinking, but it still had lots of users, and lots of user data, as well as enough traffic to make money from ads. It had been popular with musicians, many of whom used it as a sort of home page, so Specific Media brought in Justin Timberlake to be the face of an entertainment-oriented relaunch. This version of the site, which you can still sign up for today, didn\u2019t catch on, but that didn\u2019t mean the Myspace purchase was a failure. While users had gradually lost access to their own data, Myspace\u2019s new owners had plenty of use for it. Specific Media\u2019s parent company, Viant, was a growing player in online advertising. Over the course of its life, Myspace had collected over a billion \u201cregistrations\u201d \u2014 profiles \u2014 many of which could still be matched against other, more recently updated sources of data. Viant used this data to build a \u201ccross-channel marketing initiative\u201d that the company called \u201cthe Advertising Cloud.\u201d When Time, Inc. purchased Viant in 2016, for $87 million, the company bragged that its \u201cvast pool\u201d of data, derived largely from Myspace, would help its new parent company build a \u201cdata set that rivals industry leaders Facebook and Google.\u201dAs presented, this material runs the gamut of comprehensibility. Old photos are old photos, while old chat transcripts, or a collection of \u201clikes,\u201d verge on absurdity. Facebook, it turns out, encourages you to engage in a lot of behaviors that only make sense when parsed by Facebook. At the time you might have felt you were interacting with an old friend, or your aunt \u2014 which you were \u2014 but you were also feeding data into a gigantic piece of machinery.Facebook has lived a full life \u2014 should death come, the cause will be the social media equivalent of \u201cold age.\u201d If 2018 does indeed represent some sort of apex for Facebook the site, Facebook the company won\u2019t be surprised. Unlike peak Myspace, with its impatient and half-interested owner, Facebook, still helmed by its founder and flush with cash, has the time and the freedom to begin planning for the future on its own terms. The company recently installed the executive who oversaw the growth of Facebook\u2019s News Feed to run Instagram, which has already grown from 30 million users when Facebook acquired it in 2012 to more than one billion. The founders of WhatsApp are gone, too, its 1.5 billion users now more freely and fully available to Facebook. And while Facebook is still the parent company\u2019s main moneymaker, the transfer of assets \u2014 and of data \u2014 has already begun. Instagram users have long been asked to link their accounts to Facebook; WhatsApp account information is already used, by default, to \u201cimprove\u201d a user\u2019s \u201cFacebook ads and products experiences.\u201d Advertisers buy ads for Instagram and Facebook using the same tool.The advertising data exposed in a user\u2019s personal Facebook archive is, of course, just a sliver of what is available to the company. Facebook\u2019s real profile of who you are \u2014 the one that it uses to fill your feeds and show you ads \u2014 is far more comprehensive. The company\u2019s relentless accumulation of user data isn\u2019t just a grab for power or a default behavior. It\u2019s a long-term investment. You may forget Facebook; it could happen sooner than you expect. But it\u2019s not likely to forget you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Love Actually\u2019 (2003) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.\u201cLove Actually,\u201d which opens today nationwide, is an indigestible Christmas pudding from the British whimsy factory responsible for such reasonably palatable confections as \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral,\u201d \u201cNotting Hill\u201d and \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary.\u201d A romantic comedy swollen to the length of an Oscar-trawling epic \u2014 nearly two and a quarter hours of cheekiness, diffidence and high-tone smirking \u2014 it is more like a record label\u2019s greatest-hits compilation or a \u201cvery special\u201d sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie.The air is thick with bad pop songs, which those plucky, ironical Britons seem to love in spite of their badness. A sparkling British-American cast of newly minted and long familiar stars chirp, swoon, pine, quip and shed the odd tear. Presiding over it all is the new prime minister, a twinkly bachelor with a tonsorial resemblance to Tony Blair, who is played by none other than Hugh Grant. As he did in the far superior \u201cAbout a Boy,\u201d Mr. Grant makes a climactic onstage appearance at a school talent show. He also sings \u201cGood King Wenceslas\u201d and disco-dances around 10 Downing Street in his shirt sleeves.In his opening voice-over, Mr. Grant establishes a new standard for bad taste masquerading as its opposite when he introduces this fluffy farrago, written and directed by Richard Curtis, with a reference to the World Trade Center attacks. The phone calls made from the towers, he suggests, show that however perilous the state of the world, \u201clove is all around.\u201d Further support for this thesis is gleaned from the arrival gate at Heathrow, where people tend to hug and kiss each other a lot.Like much else in \u201cLove Actually,\u201d you almost buy this moment of banal sentiment, because it is so prettily shot and smartly spoken. But the film\u2019s governing idea of love is both shallow and dishonest, and its sweet, chipper demeanor masks a sour cynicism about human emotions that is all the more sleazy for remaining unacknowledged. It has the calloused, leering soul of an early-60\u2019s rat-pack comedy, but without the suave, seductive bravado. The worst kind of cad is the one who thinks he\u2019s really a sensitive guy deep down.Most of the picture\u2019s half-dozen or so romantic subplots \u2014 which lie scattered about like torn wrapping paper on Christmas morning \u2014 involve workplace dalliances of one kind or another. The ones with the best chances of success all involve an older male boss and a young female subordinate. Jamie (Colin Firth), a writer cuckolded by his own brother, retreats to a villa in the South of France and falls for his Portuguese housekeeper, Aurelia, who speaks no English and who obligingly strips down to her underwear to rescue manuscript pages that have blown into the lake.Harry (Alan Rickman), the head of a nonprofit organization, is besotted with his secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsh), who makes no secret of her attraction to him. The prime minister, moral exemplar of the nation, develops a crush on Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), a member of the Downing Street household staff. When the goatish president of the United States, in London for a state visit, puts the moves on her, the P.M.\u2019s jealousy precipitates a chill in British-American relations (and also makes him a national hero).The funniest and most winning on-the-job romance bubbles up between two people (Martin Freeman and Joanna Page) who work as body doubles on a movie set, miming explicit sex scenes in the absence of the prudish stars. As their naked bodies go through the motions, the two of them chat mildly about traffic and the weather, and their mutual attraction is sealed, on the first date, by a chaste kiss on the cheek.The other genuine comic spark comes from Bill Nighy, playing a washed-up, dissolute rock star named Billy Mack, who is trying for a comeback with a treacly Christmas record. Billy says shocking, hilarious things in television and radio interviews, and his casual indifference to proper decorum makes him the most honest character in the film.The problem is that the movie, more than any of the characters in it, is a mess of crossed signals, swerving between cynicism and sincerity without quite knowing the difference between them. It is most grotesque when it tries for earnest drama, parading the grief of a widower (Liam Neeson) and the humiliation of a middle-aged wife (Emma Thompson) before us when it thinks our throats need lumping.It is disturbing to see Ms. Thompson\u2019s range and subtlety so shamelessly trashed, and to see Laura Linney\u2019s intelligence similarly abused as a lonely, frustrated do-gooder. The fate of their characters suggests that women who are not young, pert secretaries or household workers have no real hope of sexual fulfillment and can find only a compromised, damaged form of love. Perhaps Mr. Curtis wishes to offer this as an insight into contemporary social arrangements; if so, his indifference to the cruelty of those arrangements is truly breathtaking.But it is unlikely that any particular insight was intended. Instead, \u201cLove Actually\u201d is a patchwork of contrived naughtiness and forced pathos, ending as it began, with hugging and kissing at the airport (where returning passengers are perhaps expressing their relief at being delivered from an in-flight movie like this one). The loose ends are neatly tied up, as they are when you seal a bag of garbage \u2014 or if you prefer, rubbish.\u201cLove Actually\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, nudity and profanity. Running time: 128 minutes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "El Chapo Trial: How Many Gory Details Can One Jury Take?", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn terms of bloodshed described in court, even the most violent Mafia cases have nothing on the trial of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.Judge Brian M. Cogan, who is presiding over the trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, has kept a tight leash on the gore, attempting to balance what is necessary to convey the stark realities of Latin American drug cartels and what is \u2014 literally \u2014 overkill. Judge Cogan seems to have taken the Goldilocks approach, looking for the spot between too much and not enough.This week, however, his efforts were criticized by Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers as they began to cross-examine their client\u2019s main cocaine supplier, Juan Carlos Ram\u00edrez Abad\u00eda, an exceptionally violent man who, by his own admission, took part in at least 150 murders. When the lawyers asked Mr. Ram\u00edrez to describe some of these crimes, Judge Cogan halted the line of inquiry.\u201cI am not understanding the relevance,\u201d the judge confessed, noting he was concerned that the defense was \u201cspending a lot of time\u201d on Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s slew of executions. While he did not stop the questions altogether, he did encourage the lawyers to discriminate a bit.\u201cSee if you cannot do 150 murders,\u201d he suggested.\u201cThis is a drug conspiracy case that involves murders,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you try a murder conspiracy case that happens to involve drugs.\u201dJudges often limit prejudicial evidence. For their part, prosecutors are not supposed to inundate jurors with inflammatory testimony that could sway their feelings toward defendants. In a similar way, defense lawyers are expected to keep their questions on cross-examination focused on those that impeach a witness\u2019s credibility.They complained that the rulings and suggestions have not only stopped them from thoroughly exploring the sadistic nature of the government\u2019s witnesses, but have also sanitized the brutal violence for which drug cartels are known.\u201cMurder is an infamous act and infamous acts go right to the heart of someone\u2019s credibility,\u201d one of the lawyers, William Purpura, said in court of Mr. Ram\u00edrez. \u201cWe have a right to go over all of these bad acts to show what type of character this is.\u201dThe government, however, has seemed happy to comply with the judge. On direct examination, prosecutors never asked Mr. Ram\u00edrez about any of the executions, leaving the defense to lead him through his lengthy list of victims.Among them was an unnamed lawyer who was gunned down in a bookstore in Colombia after drunkenly discussing Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s business. There was also a certain Se\u00f1or Canoso who was shot in the head after stealing $2 million of the cocaine supplier\u2019s money.Mr. Ram\u00edrez admitted to the defense that he even recorded the various expenses for his killings in scrupulous accounting ledgers. Some of the entries were exactingly precise. One listed a payment to a hit squad for $338,776.It remains unclear how many more assassinations will be mentioned at the trial \u2014 and just how explicit the details will be. The government has not yet offered the evidence it has about the murder of Francisco Aceves Ur\u00edas, a Guzm\u00e1n gunman known as Barbarino, who was slain three years ago in a restaurant parking lot in Mexico. Nor has the jury heard about the two rival traffickers whom Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is accused of doing away with after relaxing over lunch. Prosecutors claim that once the men were dead, he had their bodies tossed into a pit and set on fire.But if Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s testimony is a guide, the government may fight to keep out any further graphic evidence.On Tuesday, for example, Mr. Purpura showed the jury a photo he had found by plugging the words \u201c150 people\u201d into a Google image search. It was a visual aid, he claimed, designed to indicate just how large Mr. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s group of victims really was.The prosecutors objected to the photo, saying it was \u201coverly prejudicial.\u201d But Judge Cogan let it in \u2014 given one condition.He asked Mr. Purpura to be sure to tell the jury that the people in the picture had not in fact been killed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Fake News in Fashion", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttonedUntangling the origins of a myth repeated so often that no one thought to question it.What is it?The definitive, and damning, pronouncement that the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world. It\u2019s so shocking, so catchy and so easy to believe. There\u2019s only one problem.\u201cIt is not factually true,\u201d said Jason Kibbey, the chief executive of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition.There is no question that there are major issues around sustainability and clothes. That fashion brands bear enormous responsibility for carbon emissions and chemical runoff and landfill gluts in different parts of the world. That mea culpas are absolutely merited. There is no question that designers and executives need to think systematically about their place in the natural and human supply chain, and how they can do the least harm.But wait, that\u2019s more than just fashion; it could include home wares and bedding, among other things. How, then, to parse fashion\u2019s share of that and what it could mean?There is no credible, verifiable source that will accept responsibility for the whole \u201csecond biggest\u201d idea. To trace the claim back to its origin is to play a game of telephone, hopping from link to link to quotation and never arriving. Which is perhaps why most of the people who first popularized the claim have finally started, with somewhat less fanfare, to try to take it back.When Cara Smyth, the vice president of Glasgow Caledonian New York College, was asked, she also said she thought the claim derived from the film. But when I asked Mr. Morgan, the director, where he got the fact back in 2015, he referred me to the organizers of the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, a conference on sustainable fashion, started in 2008. (I have been a speaker at the event.)Jonas Eder-Hansen, the public affairs director of the Global Fashion Agenda, a forum on sustainability issues and fashion, which grew out of the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, said he believed the original fact, oft repeated by Eva Kruse, the founder of G.F.A., had come from a report from the Deloitte consulting firm. That report surfaced in Denmark around 2012 but has since disappeared; when contacted, Deloitte was unclear about the identity of the report. \u201cI had my moment of fear that it came from me,\u201d said Linda Greer, a former senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cAbout a decade ago, I was looking at industries that polluted in China, and fashion came up in regards to water. But it really depends what you are looking at.\u201dThat is in part why Ms. Fisher has recently started to recant. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to stop saying it because my team has been saying internally that we can\u2019t confirm it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s been about six months.\u201dThe Copenhagen Fashion Summit founders have also been backpedaling, shifting \u201cto more vague statements like \u2018one of the most resource-intensive industries,\u2019\u201d Mr. Eder-Hansen said. \u201cBut we still hear it,\u201d Mr. Eder-Hansen said. And each time they hear it, he said, \u201cwe try to say it\u2019s not accurate.\u201d\u201cI went on an emailing spree a month ago, emailing the first 10 websites that came up when I Googled \u2018fashion is the second most polluting industry.\u2019\u201d Ms. Wicker said. \u201cOne person responded.\u201d Does it really matter if this exaggeration still stands? After all, as Ms. Greer said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s No. 2 or No. 5, the point is not totally bogus.\u201d If extremeness is what propels necessary action, does the end justify the means? Or does this push us further down the slippery slope of alternative facts on which we are currently sliding?\u201cWe need some drama, otherwise we\u2019re just going down on the Titanic,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. Then she sighed. \u201cBut untruths are not O.K.\u201dThe problem being, Mr. Eder-Hansen said, \u201cwe lose our credibility if we go around spreading hearsay, which is why having accurate data is so important.\u201dMr. Kibbey said that the sheer scale of \u201csecond largest\u201d also tends to mask the need for more granular data-gathering efforts \u2014 efforts that are key to quantifying fashion\u2019s impact in order to come up with ways to ameliorate it. \u201cI wish it would disappear,\u201d he said.The truth is, we should have suspected from the beginning that this was too pat a formulation. The fashion industry is full of intricate, sometimes impossible-to-trace supply chains, and the data is too sparse to come up with a number like that.So why did so many people fall for it, and why haven\u2019t the denials penetrated?In part, for the same reason that so many people fall other untruths: the gorgeous simplicity of the accusation; the way it plays into all the prejudices that exist around an industry often associated with indulgence and the culture of disposability; the way it pushes all the right buttons. \u201cFashion is a consumer-facing industry,\u201d Ms. Greer said. \u201cCement and steel have two of the largest industrial carbon footprints, but most people don\u2019t buy steel and cement.\u201d They can\u2019t relate.And unlike many of the distortions floating around in social media, this one didn\u2019t arise from malice aforethought, or result from anyone trying to perpetrate a scam or manipulate reality. It very likely comes from a good place: a desire to wake a global industry to the need to do better. That is partly why, \u201cwhenever someone says it at a panel or conference, it\u2019s nearly impossible to challenge them,\u201d Ms. Wicker said. If you do, she added, you are \u201caccused of negativity, or of apologizing for the fashion industry.\u201dYet what we do know should be bad enough on its own. Consider the following: Nearly three-fifths of all clothing ends up in incinerators or landfills within a year of being produced. More than 8 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions are produced by the apparel and footwear industries. And, around 20 to 25 percent of globally produced chemical compounds are utilized in the textile-finishing industry.Although admittedly, if you\u2019re trying to capture the public imagination, that title could use a little work.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mystery of the Holiday Fruitcake, Solved!", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMy father resembled a fruitcake. He also sent fruitcakes. Mine never arrived.He wanted me to have a particular brand of fruitcake. Made in Texas, it was famous among fruitcake lovers \u2014 or, at least, among people who gave fruitcakes to those who were assumed to love them.\u201cIt reminds me of my mother\u2019s,\u201d he told me in a phone call. \u201cHers was really moist, with lots of raisins.\u201dI later figured out that my grandmother\u2019s version, which I never had the chance to taste, was probably a Depression cake, made without milk, sugar, butter or eggs, scarce commodities when he was a child.Born in 1932, he grew up during the Great Depression in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On most Christmases, he received two gifts: a pair of homemade socks and a small sack of oranges.\u201cMy mother knitted the socks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those oranges tasted so good.\u201dOrdering the fruitcake was his way of trying to take care of me from afar, in an era that, in his mind, may at any moment turn economically perilous. Regardless of my middle-aged status, I was still his son.\u201cIt should arrive the first week of December,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you get it, let me know what you think.\u201dI would be going to California for Christmas, as I do every year, and I was looking forward to his gift and to sampling the flavors that transported him to his childhood.The first week of December passed with no sign of his fruitcake. Delayed by holiday mail, I assumed, or a backlog of orders.I knew there would be plenty to eat in California. In addition to my mother\u2019s cookies, fudge and other treats, my father always gave my sister and me each a large bag of assorted foods he called, rather plainly, the \u201cFood Bag.\u201d He produced these from some secret spot only after all the other presents had been opened.One year I listed the contents of my Food Bag in a notebook. I wanted to remember the details to tell my friends, and I suppose as a record for myself, for the day when I might not get a Food Bag for Christmas.That year my bag contained a can of deluxe mixed nuts, a box of whole-wheat crackers, a Belgian chocolate bar, a stick of hickory-cured turkey sausage, a half-pound sack of California red pistachios, some English breakfast tea and many other items, including an \u201cOh Deer Super Dooper Reindeer Pooper Jellybean Dispenser\u201d filled with jelly beans.I was 44 when my father gave me that Food Bag, and he was 72.His selections had no coherent theme, though the bags did have an uncanny but undeniable kinship with fruitcakes, featuring a little of this and that thrown together with intriguing results.The bags were so overstuffed that I often had to put most of the food in a box and mail it home. One year I assembled a few of the healthier items \u2014 sardines, rye crisps, dried apricots \u2014 and on the way to the airport made a special delivery of my own to the donation center of a local church.Fruitcake is a polarizing concept, a triggering word. People love it or hate it and like to debate whether it\u2019s cake at all. In some ways, my father\u2019s character resembled a fruitcake: whimsy and a little nuttiness mixed with a sweet foundation. When we were children and went to the local shopping mall, he liked to spritz on women\u2019s perfume \u2014 all of them.This was before men\u2019s cologne counters were common. Once they were, he would transform himself into pansexual bouquet of exotic fragrances. On our drives home, my mother would say, \u201cYou stink! What did you put on this time?\u201dWhile working as a meat cutter in grocery stores, he was called Crazy Charlie by his co-workers and was known for workplace pranks, like pretending to lock someone in the walk-in meat freezer. But he also gave out instructions to customers who didn\u2019t know how to roast lamb or make stuffing. When he came home from late shifts, he left candy bars under our pillow, thinking we might wake up wanting a snack.My father believed everyone was always hungry and needed to eat even if they weren\u2019t. When we visited him in the hospital during a three-month stay \u2014 he was battling a vicious infection after heart surgery \u2014 he would ask if we had eaten and never fail to remind us the cafeteria would be closing soon.\u201cAt least get a cup of coffee,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201dA fruitcake, in his mind, was a perfect Christmas gift. The culinary jumble of jeweled fruits suggested an extravagance that belied its practicality: Fruitcake can fill your belly and has a long shelf life. In 2017, a fruitcake thought to have been brought on Robert Scott\u2019s Antarctica expedition more than 100 years ago was discovered to be in \u201cexcellent condition.\u201dOn the day before my flight, the fruitcake still had not arrived. When my father called to wish me a safe trip, he said, \u201cDid you receive it?\u201d\u201cNot yet,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably delayed in the holiday mail.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be there today.\u201d He fretted deeply about that lost fruitcake.When I arrived at my parents\u2019 house, he said, \u201cDid you get the fruitcake?\u201d\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be there when I go home.\u201dAs soon as the word left my lips, I realized that \u201chome,\u201d for them, was also a kind of triggering word. Because wasn\u2019t this home? Wasn\u2019t I home now, with my parents greeting me, asking if I was hungry after the long flight? Wasn\u2019t New York only a stimulating adventure with an unscheduled end date? In my parents\u2019 living room, a Christmas tree stood above piles of presents in glittery paper, and in the spare bedroom, my father, I knew, had hidden our Food Bags, concealed under large towels.He remained hopeful the fruitcake would come by New Year\u2019s Eve, when I\u2019d be back in Midtown Manhattan, humanity roaring from Times Square.January, February and March came and went with no fruitcake. Though my father continued to ask about it, I never once considered lying and telling him yes, the fruitcake finally arrived and was delicious. Instead I said, \u201cThat cake is orbiting earth, and sooner or later it will land.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good one!\u201d he said.His sense of humor never wavered, and as time went on he would bring up the perpetual journey of his fruitcake.\u201cI wonder where it is now,\u201d he\u2019d say.\u201cIt\u2019s taken a detour to Pluto.\u201dHe liked that one, too.\u201cDo you want me to order another, in case it never comes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s O.K., Dad,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for this one. It\u2019ll taste even better after touring the cosmos.\u201dEarly last December, nearly a year after my father died from a failing heart, I got a call from a staffer at the front desk of my apartment building.\u201cYou have a package,\u201d he said.I went downstairs to pick it up. The brown box had a FedEx label with a return address in Texas.Riding the elevator back upstairs, I held the box with both hands. Though small, it was heavy and solid, as if its contents were indestructible. I shook the package but nothing moved. In my kitchen, I opened the box with a bread knife, and there it was: a decorative tin holding the fruitcake my father had wanted me to taste several years earlier.I lifted the tin cover and punctured the airtight plastic seal. The fruitcake before me was crowned with candied cherries, caramelized pecans and chunks of pineapple that had been dyed emerald green. I sliced into it, placing a big wedge on a plate. I made a cup of tea, as my father and his mother might have done.I sat down and ate the slice slowly, the only way one can eat fruitcake, really. It was as moist as my father had promised, and not too sweet.After finishing every speck, I wondered about the fruitcake my father had ordered so long ago. Was it still lapping the heavens? Had it hitched a ride on the rings of Saturn?Wherever it was, who on earth had sent me this one?I had ordered it for myself, of course. After my father\u2019s death, I found myself grasping for every memory of him, every cologne-scented hint of his being. The confection of known and mysterious morsels embodied his desire for me to enjoy a simple and not-so-simple piece of cake \u2014 and to never go hungry.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unrest in France Hinders Macron\u2019s Push to Revive Economy", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The need to accelerate growth has long been visible in almost every corner of the French economy, from dreary unemployment offices packed with job seekers to businesses whose financially stretched customers struggle to make do.President Emmanuel Macron came into office pledging to change all that by improving the country\u2019s long-term prospects. But his halting response to a month of violent demonstrations by the so-called Yellow Vest movement over social inequality has clouded his efforts for a revival.The same day, the country\u2019s central bank trimmed its growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent, well off the sluggish pace expected for the year. Businesses have sustained more than 10 billion euros, about $11.4 billion, in damage and lost sales, a figure that will probably grow.\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for business,\u201d Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said Sunday as he toured Paris businesses smashed up by rioters. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for our economy,\u201d he added, a point he pressed again on Tuesday in a briefing with a small group of reporters.He pledged tax cuts and financial support for those having trouble getting by, urged businesses to give employees year-end bonuses and said the government would help minimum-wage earners with a \u20ac100 monthly supplement starting next year.Mr. Macron\u2019s speech, a recorded message just 13 minutes long, was also notable for what he left out.\u201cWe know how important it is for us to be as attractive as possible for foreign investors,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe key point is to make clear that we will remain strong on structural reforms.\u201dWhile foreign investment in France has risen since Mr. Macron came to office, \u201cthere will be a mark left by this episode,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a given that this will succeed in calming the dissatisfaction of a part of the population.\u201dMany of those protesting understand that improving the economy is a long-term project, but their concerns are focused on their monthly efforts to make ends meet. On social networks, some protesters said Mr. Macron\u2019s offer fell short.Mr. Macron has lectured leaders of other eurozone countries \u2014 especially Italy \u2014 about the need to balance their books. Now he must follow his own advice. French ministries have been ordered to find cuts in their budgets, and the government could delay some tax cuts for companies that had been scheduled to kick in next year, Mr. Le Maire said.Mr. Macron also refuses to end a tax break for wealthy citizens that he granted upon taking office. He says the measure was intended to lure money into France, where it can be invested in French companies. The move has drained more than \u20ac3 billion from France\u2019s coffers this year, but Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday that there was no data yet to show whether it was having the promised stimulus effect.Mr. Le Maire has suggested another way to make up the shortfall: pursuing the taxes that he said Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google had avoided paying in France for years. The European Union is considering a plan to impose such taxes. If the union does not reach an accord on doing so by March, Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday, France will move to collect $500 million in back taxes from the tech giants.Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis Bank, which is based in Paris, said that even if the tax cuts and spending increases Mr. Macron had proposed increased France\u2019s budget deficit, \u201cmarkets will accept that\u201d as a price for restoring social stability.Still, the slowdown in growth caused by a month of disruption will make it harder for Mr. Macron to address several major problems.Retailers, including supermarkets and sellers of luxury goods, have collectively lost more than \u20ac1 billion, while small and medium-size companies have lost at least \u20ac10 billion, according to France\u2019s main retail and business associations.The agriculture sector is facing over \u20ac13 billion in losses, said ANIA, the main industry group, citing four weekends of protests that blocked roads, causing delivery delays and often preventing groceries from reaching stores.Tourism has also been affected, with hotels recording cancellation rates as high as 25 percent since the protests started last month. American and Japanese tour operators have been advising customers not to travel to France, according to the National Federation of Tourist Offices.Some companies have paused hiring plans. Auchan, a large supermarket chain, said it might not hire 4,000 temporary workers it had planned to employ across France for the holiday season.Stores that need to make up for lost revenue will be allowed to open on Sundays, something that has been prohibited in most of France by decades-old laws requiring that Sunday be a day of rest.In the end, the main issue for France is not the short-term cost from the demonstrations, said Mr. Artus, the economist.\u201cIt\u2019s whether Macron will keep the reforms going,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to maintain the attractiveness of France.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the bank where Patrick Artus is the chief economist. It is Natixis Bank, not Natexis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "LinkedIn Co-Founder Apologizes for Deception in Alabama Senate Race", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Hoffman said he had no idea that political operatives whose work he had financed had used fakery on Facebook and Twitter in the special Senate election a year ago in Alabama. But he had an obligation to track how his money was spent, he said, and he promised to exercise more care in the future.The New York Times and The Washington Post reported last week that $100,000 from Mr. Hoffman was spent on a deceptive social media campaign to aid Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, who barely defeated the Republican, Roy Moore.The money went to a small group of social media experts that included Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, a cybersecurity firm.They created a Facebook page intended to look like the work of conservative Alabamians, and used it to try to split Republicans and promote a conservative write-in candidate to take votes from Mr. Moore.They also used thousands of Twitter accounts to make it appear as if automated Russian bot accounts were following and supporting Mr. Moore, according to an internal report on the project. The apparent Russian support for Mr. Moore drew broad news media coverage.Democratic political strategists say the small Alabama operation \u2014 which accounts for a minuscule share of the $51 million spent in the contest \u2014 was carried out as a debate about tactics intensified within the party.Democrats had been shocked to learn of Russia\u2019s stealth influence campaign to damage Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential race. But at least a few Democrats thought their party could not shun such tactics entirely if others were going to continue to use them.The Alabama operation is among the first examples to come to light of such underhanded methods on social media in American politics. But because such efforts are generally very easy to hide and very difficult to trace, it is possible that other instances have gone undetected.In 2017, through a fund called Investing in Us, Mr. Hoffman gave money to a small company, American Engagement Technologies. The company\u2019s leader, Mikey Dickerson, is a former Google employee who founded the United States Digital Service during the Obama administration to try to upgrade the federal government\u2019s use of technology. An associate of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s said that his total grant to American Engagement was $750,000, which also went toward other political races and social media research. Mr. Dickerson has declined to comment.American Engagement then passed $100,000 to Mr. Morgan and other researchers. Mr. Hoffman\u2019s statement says the money went to Mr. Morgan\u2019s company, New Knowledge, but Mr. Morgan said the Alabama project was carried out separately from the company.The revelations of and fallout from the operation are being closely watched. Some American political experts fear that the Russian influence campaign of 2016 could become a dangerous model for stateside politics, with dirty tricks on social media becoming common. Laws and regulations have not been updated to cope with such a threat.\u201cWe cannot permit dishonest campaign tactics to go unchecked in our democracy \u2014 no matter which side they purportedly help,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said in his statement.He has made no secret of his opposition to President Trump, and in 2016 he offered to donate $5 million to veterans\u2019 groups if Mr. Trump released his tax returns.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Facebook Raised a Privacy Wall, It Carved an Opening for Tech Giants", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "Internal documents show that the social network gave Microsoft, Amazon, Spotify and others far greater access to people\u2019s data than it has disclosed.Supported byFor years, Facebook gave some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies more intrusive access to users\u2019 personal data than it has disclosed, effectively exempting those business partners from its usual privacy rules, according to internal records and interviews.The special arrangements are detailed in hundreds of pages of Facebook documents obtained by The New York Times. The records, generated in 2017 by the company\u2019s internal system for tracking partnerships, provide the most complete picture yet of the social network\u2019s data-sharing practices. They also underscore how personal data has become the most prized commodity of the digital age, traded on a vast scale by some of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley and beyond.The exchange was intended to benefit everyone. Pushing for explosive growth, Facebook got more users, lifting its advertising revenue. Partner companies acquired features to make their products more attractive. Facebook users connected with friends across different devices and websites. But Facebook also assumed extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2 billion users \u2014 control it has wielded with little transparency or outside oversight.Facebook allowed Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users\u2019 friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users\u2019 private messages.The social network permitted Amazon to obtain users\u2019 names and contact information through their friends, and it let Yahoo view streams of friends\u2019 posts as recently as this summer, despite public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years earlier.But the documents, as well as interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its corporate partners, reveal that Facebook allowed certain companies access to data despite those protections. They also raise questions about whether Facebook ran afoul of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred the social network from sharing user data without explicit permission.In all, the deals described in the documents benefited more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, including online retailers and entertainment sites, but also automakers and media organizations. Their applications sought the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, the records show. The deals, the oldest of which date to 2010, were all active in 2017. Some were still in effect this year.In an interview, Steve Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s director of privacy and public policy, said none of the partnerships violated users\u2019 privacy or the F.T.C. agreement. Contracts required the companies to abide by Facebook policies, he added.Still, Facebook executives have acknowledged missteps over the past year. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201d He said that the partnerships were \u201cone area of focus\u201d and that Facebook was in the process of winding many of them down.Facebook has found no evidence of abuse by its partners, a spokeswoman said. Some of the largest partners, including Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo, said they had used the data appropriately, but declined to discuss the sharing deals in detail. Facebook did say that it had mismanaged some of its partnerships, allowing certain companies\u2019 access to continue long after they had shut down the features that required the data.Data privacy experts disputed Facebook\u2019s assertion that most partnerships were exempted from the regulatory requirements, expressing skepticism that businesses as varied as device makers, retailers and search companies would be viewed alike by the agency. \u201cThe only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth into an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist at the F.T.C.Mr. Soltani and three former employees of the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection division, which brought the case that led to the consent decree, said in interviews that its data-sharing deals had probably violated the agreement.\u201cThis is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u201d said David Vladeck, who formerly ran the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u201dFacebook\u2019s stock price has fallen, and a group of shareholders has called for Mr. Zuckerberg to step aside as chairman. Shareholders also have filed a lawsuit alleging that executives failed to impose effective privacy safeguards. Angry users started a #DeleteFacebook movement.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is legitimate to enter into data-sharing partnerships where there is not prior informed consent from the user,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook. \u201cNo one should trust Facebook until they change their business model.\u201dPersonal data is the oil of the 21st century, a resource worth billions to those who can most effectively extract and refine it. American companies alone are expected to spend close to $20 billion by the end of 2018 to acquire and process consumer data, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Few companies have better data than Facebook and its rival, Google, whose popular products give them an intimate view into the daily lives of billions of people \u2014 and allow them to dominate the digital advertising market.Facebook has never sold its user data, fearful of user backlash and wary of handing would-be competitors a way to duplicate its most prized asset. Instead, internal documents show, it did the next best thing: granting other companies access to parts of the social network in ways that advanced its own interests.Facebook began forming data partnerships when it was still a relatively young company. Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to weave Facebook\u2019s services into other sites and platforms, believing it would stave off obsolescence and insulate Facebook from competition. Every corporate partner that integrated Facebook data into its online products helped drive the platform\u2019s expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue. At the same time, Facebook got critical data back from its partners.The partnerships were so important that decisions about forming them were vetted at high levels, sometimes by Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, Facebook officials said. While many of the partnerships were announced publicly, the details of the sharing arrangements typically were confidential.By 2013, Facebook had entered into more such partnerships than its midlevel employees could easily track, according to interviews with two former employees. (Like the more than 30 other former employees interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or still maintained relationships with top Facebook officials.)So they built a tool that did the technical work of turning special access on and off and also kept records on what are known internally as \u201ccapabilities\u201d \u2014 the special privileges enabling companies to obtain data, in some cases without asking permission.The Times reviewed more than 270 pages of reports generated by the system \u2014 records that reflect just a portion of Facebook\u2019s wide-ranging deals. Among the revelations was that Facebook obtained data from multiple partners for a controversial friend-suggestion tool called \u201cPeople You May Know.\u201dFacebook, in turn, used contact lists from the partners, including Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei \u2014 which has been flagged as a security threat by American intelligence officials \u2014 to gain deeper insight into people\u2019s relationships and suggest more connections, the records show.Some of the access deals described in the documents were limited to sharing non-identifying information with research firms or enabling game makers to accommodate huge numbers of players. These raised no privacy concerns. But agreements with about a dozen companies did. Some enabled partners to see users\u2019 contact information through their friends \u2014 even after the social network, responding to complaints, said in 2014 that it was stripping all applications of that power.As of 2017, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon and others could obtain users\u2019 email addresses through their friends.Facebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users\u2019 private messages, and to see all participants on a thread \u2014 privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems, the records show. Facebook acknowledged that it did not consider any of those three companies to be service providers. Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix said those companies were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them. A spokesman for Netflix said Wednesday that it had used the access only to enable customers to recommend TV shows and movies to their friends.\u201cBeyond these recommendations, we never accessed anyone\u2019s personal messages and would never do that,\u201d he said.Spotify, which could view messages of more than 70 million users a month, still offers the option to share music through Facebook Messenger. But Netflix and the Canadian bank no longer needed access to messages because they had deactivated features that incorporated it.These were not the only companies that had special access longer than they needed it. Yahoo, The Times and others could still get Facebook users\u2019 personal information in 2017.Yahoo could view real-time feeds of friends\u2019 posts for a feature that the company had ended in 2012. A Yahoo spokesman declined to discuss the partnership in detail but said the company did not use the information for advertising. The Times \u2014 one of nine media companies named in the documents \u2014 had access to users\u2019 friend lists for an article-sharing application it had discontinued in 2011. A spokeswoman for the news organization said it was not obtaining any data.Facebook empowered Apple to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were asking for data. Apple devices also had access to the contact numbers and calendar entries of people who had changed their account settings to disable all sharing, the records show.Apple officials said they were not aware that Facebook had granted its devices any special access. They added that any shared data remained on the devices and was not available to anyone other than the users.Facebook officials said the company had disclosed its sharing deals in its privacy policy since 2010. But the language in the policy about its service providers does not specify what data Facebook shares, and with which companies. Mr. Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s privacy director, also said its partners were subject to \u201crigorous controls.\u201dPam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit privacy research group, said that Facebook would have little power over what happens to users\u2019 information after sharing it broadly. \u201cIt travels,\u201d Ms. Dixon said. \u201cIt could be customized. It could be fed into an algorithm and decisions could be made about you based on that data.\u201dBesides Facebook, the F.T.C. has consent agreements with Google and Twitter stemming from alleged privacy violations.Facebook\u2019s agreement with regulators is a result of the company\u2019s early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, it changed the privacy settings of the 400 million people then using the service, making some of their information accessible to all of the internet. Then it shared that information, including users\u2019 locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.Facebook called this \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.The F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.Under the decree, the social network introduced a \u201ccomprehensive privacy program\u201d charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.But the privacy program faced some internal resistance from the start, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s efforts. Some engineers and executives, they said, considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews \u2014 numbering about a dozen people by 2016 \u2014 was moved around within Facebook\u2019s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.Critically, many of Facebook\u2019s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.Facebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \u201cdepended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\u201dIn 2014, Facebook ended instant personalization and walled off access to friends\u2019 information. But in a previously unreported agreement, the social network\u2019s engineers continued allowing Bing; Pandora, the music streaming service; and Rotten Tomatoes, the movie and television review site, access to much of the data they had gotten for the discontinued feature. Bing had access to the information through last year, the records show, and the two other companies did as of late summer, according to tests by The Times.Facebook officials said the data sharing did not violate users\u2019 privacy because it allowed access only to public data \u2014 though that included data that the social network had made public in 2009. They added that the social network made a mistake in allowing the access to continue for the three companies, but declined to elaborate. Spokeswomen for Pandora and Rotten Tomatoes said the businesses were not aware of any special access.Facebook also declined to discuss the other capabilities Bing was given, including the ability to see all users\u2019 friends.Microsoft officials said that Bing was using the data to build profiles of Facebook users on Microsoft servers. They declined to provide details, other than to say the information was used in \u201cfeature development\u201d and not for advertising. Microsoft has since deleted the data, the officials said.For some advocates, the torrent of user data flowing out of Facebook has called into question not only Facebook\u2019s compliance with the F.T.C. agreement, but also the agency\u2019s approach to privacy regulation.\u201cThere has been an endless barrage of how Facebook has ignored users\u2019 privacy settings, and we truly believed that in 2011 we had solved this problem,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an online privacy group that filed one of the first complaints about Facebook with federal regulators. \u201cWe brought Facebook under the regulatory authority of the F.T.C. after a tremendous amount of work. The F.T.C. has failed to act.\u201dAccording to Facebook, most of its data partnerships fall under an exemption to the F.T.C. agreement. The company argues that the partner companies are service providers \u2014 companies that use the data only \u201cfor and at the direction of\u201d Facebook and function as an extension of the social network.But Mr. Vladeck and other former F.T.C. officials said that Facebook was interpreting the exemption too broadly. They said the provision was intended to allow Facebook to perform the same everyday functions as other companies, such as sending and receiving information over the internet or processing credit card transactions, without violating the consent decree.When The Times reported last summer on the partnerships with device makers, Facebook used the term \u201cintegration partners\u201d to describe BlackBerry, Huawei and other manufacturers that pulled Facebook data to provide social-media-style features on smartphones. All such integration partners, Facebook asserted, were covered by the service provider exemption.Since then, as the social network has disclosed its data sharing deals with other kinds of businesses \u2014 including internet companies such as Yahoo \u2014 Facebook has labeled them integration partners, too.Facebook even recategorized one company, the Russian search giant Yandex, as an integration partner.Facebook records show Yandex had access in 2017 to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs even after the social network stopped sharing them with other applications, citing privacy risks. A spokeswoman for Yandex, which was accused last year by Ukraine\u2019s security service of funneling its user data to the Kremlin, said the company was unaware of the access and did not know why Facebook had allowed it to continue. She added that the Ukrainian allegations \u201chave no merit.\u201dIn October, Facebook said Yandex was not an integration partner. But in early December, as The Times was preparing to publish this article, Facebook told congressional lawmakers that it was.An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the commission agreed with Facebook\u2019s interpretation of the service provider exception, which is likely to figure in the F.T.C.\u2019s ongoing Facebook investigation. She also declined to say whether the commission had ever received a complete list of partners that Facebook considered service providers.The first assessment, sent to the F.T.C. in 2013, found only \u201climited\u201d evidence that Facebook had monitored those partners\u2019 use of data. The finding was redacted from a public copy of the assessment, which gave Facebook\u2019s privacy program a passing grade over all.Mr. Wyden and other critics have questioned whether the assessments \u2014 in which the F.T.C. essentially outsources much of its day-to-day oversight to companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2014 are effective. As with other businesses under consent agreements with the F.T.C., Facebook pays for and largely dictated the scope of its assessments, which are limited mostly to documenting that Facebook has conducted the internal privacy reviews it claims it had.How closely Facebook monitored its data partners is uncertain. Most of Facebook\u2019s partners declined to discuss what kind of reviews or audits Facebook subjected them to. Two former Facebook partners, whose deals with the social network dated to 2010, said they could find no evidence that Facebook had ever audited them. One was BlackBerry. The other was Yandex.Facebook officials said that while the social network audited partners only rarely, it managed them closely.\u201cThese were high-touch relationships,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Yahoo ended a feature on its website that incorporated Facebook user data.

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Pichai Faces Privacy and Bias Questions in Congress", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Google\u2019s chief executive, in perhaps the most public display of lawmakers\u2019 unease with his company\u2019s influence, was grilled on Tuesday about everything from search result bias and the data Google collects about its users to plans for a censored service in China.Sundar Pichai, an engineer who rose through Google\u2019s ranks to become its leader three years ago, faced more than three hours of questions from the House Judiciary Committee. Republicans expressed concerns about unfair treatment of conservatives, and lawmakers in both parties zeroed in on privacy issues.While Google had been under scrutiny before, particularly in Europe, where regulators have fined it, it had not had to address such an array of issues in one go and in such an open forum.\u201cMr. Pichai, it was necessary to convene this hearing because of the widening gap of distrust between Silicon Valley and the American people,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican House majority leader. He is not a member of the Judiciary Committee but made a point of attending the hearing.It was the latest in a series of congressional hearings that have made clear lawmakers\u2019 concerns about the power of big internet companies. Mr. Pichai fielded questions alone, after rejecting a request to testify with executives from Facebook and Twitter three months ago.Mr. McCarthy and other Republicans see Silicon Valley as the home of hugely influential companies with liberal executives and work forces that \u2014 intentionally or unintentionally \u2014 are allowing their biases to taint how people receive information on the internet.For Google, that means claims that its search results are skewed against conservatives, though academics and industry insiders largely dismiss those concerns. A video showing Google executives bemoaning President Trump\u2019s election victory in 2016 provided further evidence for Republicans when it was leaked this year.Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked if Google\u2019s employees had made decisions to filter search results contrary to the company\u2019s claims of political neutrality.\u201cThis committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cGiven the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google\u2019s values, these questions have become all the more important.\u201dWithout offering evidence, Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, said Google\u2019s antipathy toward conservatives gave Hillary Clinton a lift in the 2016 presidential election. He pushed Mr. Pichai to allow outside investigators to audit Google\u2019s search technology for indications of bias.\u201cGoogle could well elect the next president,\u201d Mr. Smith warned.But the company\u2019s search algorithms do not take political sentiment into account, Mr. Pichai said. Results are determined by about 200 factors, including relevance, freshness and the popularity of queries.\u201cOur algorithms have no notion of political sentiment,\u201d he said.The session offered a hint that when Democrats become the House majority in January, data privacy issues will become a priority.\u201cThere are legitimate questions regarding the company\u2019s policies and practices, including with respect to content moderation and the protection of user data privacy,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from New York.Mr. Pichai, who was roundly criticized by lawmakers for not appearing at the hearing three months ago, could not so easily sidestep the privacy issue.The sharpest exchange involved Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, who held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room.\u201cNot by default,\u201d Mr. Pichai said, meaning it depended on the settings on the apps that Mr. Poe had installed on the phone.When Mr. Pichai wouldn\u2019t respond with a definitive yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and interrupted.\u201cYou make $100 million a year. You should be able to answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know. I think Google obviously does.\u201dMr. Pichai said Google offered users controls for limiting the collection of location data and did not sell user data, though he avoided saying whether the company uses location data when it sells advertising.When asked whether Google would support a federal privacy law like Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, Mr. Pichai seemed open to it. He praised the European policy, which went into effect in May, as a \u201cwell-crafted piece of legislation\u201d and said there was value in consistent global regulation.Repeating earlier statements, Mr. Pichai said Google had no current plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search engine that censored information banned by the government.He characterized the initiative, Project Dragonfly, as an \u201cinternal effort.\u201d He said the company had not discussed its plans with Chinese government officials. Mr. Pichai would not commit to scrapping the initiative, however, and said it was \u201cour duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information.\u201dLike other Capitol Hill hearings on tech companies this year, the session on Tuesday offered as much theater as policy discussion. Seated a few rows behind Mr. Pichai \u2014 in sight of television cameras \u2014 was a person sporting a top hat, a fake giant mustache and a monocle like the Rich Uncle Pennybags character from the board game Monopoly.At one point, the session was interrupted by a protester holding a sign that read \u201cGoogle\u201d across a Chinese flag.Outside the hearing room, Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy news site Infowars, yelled \u201cGoogle is evil!\u201d until a police officer told him to quiet down. Mr. Jones has been barred from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, which is owned by Google.He was accompanied by Roger J. Stone Jr., the Republican political operative and a longtime acquaintance of President Trump who has drawn attention from the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III, for his potential role in Russian election meddling. Mr. Stone, who was also barred by Twitter, complained that big internet companies were \u201cmonopolistic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Advertisement"}

Breakfast, too. The overnight oatmeal cup is her specialty.\u201cYou see me with a pastry bag, doing my little cup, doing the tops, decorating it, and I feel like I\u2019m doing something close to cakes,\u201d she said. Cakes are her favorite.The program helped her land a job at Restaurant Associates, which operates the Google employee cafeteria. More than a year in, her tenure is the longest she has ever had.Ms. Hernandez struggled to get to a stable place. She grew up in the Dominican Republic, where she worked in her grandmother\u2019s bakeries. But she had different dreams. She moved to the Bronx with her family when she was 15 and enrolled in High School of World Culture, a technical high school that specialized in English as a second language, where she focused on fashion design.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make any cakes, any bread. I saw what the stress was like on my family,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cI wanted to be a fashion designer.\u201dShe graduated from the Art Institute of New York City in 2006 with an associate degree, then was hired in the jewelry department at the Sears in White Plains, which she hoped would be a steppingstone into the industry.But her car was repossessed, and the commute from the Bronx became too difficult. She then went through a series of jobs, never able to keep one for long because she could not find reliable child care for her sons, Edward, now 12, and Andres, 9.\u201cThe most painful thing is to walk home knowing that tomorrow you don\u2019t have a job because you just quit,\u201d she said.Two marriages also fell apart. \u201cThe model that I had in my head about family \u2014 a mom, dad, two kids \u2014 it started changing to \u2018my kids and I,\u2019\u201d she said.Hot Bread Kitchen helped her turn things around. In 2017, a back-to-work program for public assistance recipients steered Ms. Hernandez there. Participants receive a $300 weekly stipend and learn skills they need to work in a kitchen, including knife use, baking and food safety, and broader workplace skills like conflict resolution.\u201cOne of the unique things about our program is it\u2019s equal parts culinary training but also the soft skills that are necessary in the workplace,\u201d said Margo Sivin, Hot Bread\u2019s marketing and communications manager.Over the past 10 years, the course has trained more than 300 women, many of whom were seeking their first professional job outside of the home or in America. Trainees from 40 countries have come through the bakery, which has 85 types of breads on a rotating menu.\u201cI took it very seriously,\u201d Ms. Hernandez said, \u201cbecause they were very serious here, too.\u201d\u201cEven though it\u2019s only a month, it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d she said.The society also drew $600 from the fund and other sources to help Ms. Hernandez pay $2,880 in back rent as of Oct. 31. She is still $40,000 in debt from her associate degree program.After completing the Hot Bread program, Ms. Hernandez landed her job as a salad preparation specialist at Google. When she started, it took her almost three hours to prepare a box of kale and romaine for the salad bar. Now she practically runs the salad station.\u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s salad, I love it.\u201dLately she has been helping prepare breakfast, too, which gives her more room for creativity.And she has not stopped baking at home, drawing on her experience in her grandmother\u2019s bakeries as a child. She makes cakes for birthdays and special occasions; pineapple upside-down cake is a specialty of hers.She has not let go of her fashion dream, either. Ms. Hernandez promised herself that by the time she turns 35, she will have returned to her passion. She would like to create a line of dresses for little girls and has already begun sketching again.In the meantime, she is focused on her job at Google and providing for her children.

{"Headline": "Dans les \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises, la le\u00e7on du jour : \u00e0 quel tweet se fier ?", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVAULX-EN-VELIN, France \u2014 Ce mercredi-l\u00e0 au coll\u00e8ge Henri Barbusse, pr\u00e8s de Lyon, les adolescents de la 3\u00e8me G s\u2019appr\u00eatent \u00e0 assister \u00e0 un cours un peu particulier.Au tableau sont affich\u00e9s cinq tweets. La question pos\u00e9e aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves : lesquels sont fiables, lesquels sont suspects?Rapidement, ils portent leur attention sur un tweet de la dirigeante politique d\u2019extr\u00eame-droite Marine Le Pen, au sujet de menaces prof\u00e9r\u00e9es par un adolescent \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un enseignant, incident largement relay\u00e9 par la presse. Un \u00e9l\u00e8ve avance que le tweet est sans doute authentique puisque le compte de Mme Le Pen est v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 par Twitter. Mais pour Samia Houbiri, 15 ans, Mme Le Pen cherche simplement \u00e0 attirer l\u2019attention.\u00ab Elle choisit un sujet, elle exag\u00e8re les choses, et ensuite les gens disent \u2018Elle a raison, je devrais voter pour elle\u2019 \u00bb, argumente Mlle Houbiri.Face aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves, la journaliste Sandra Laffont, qui dirige la classe, approuve de la t\u00eate et ajoute: \u00ab \u201cLes hommes et femmes politiques exag\u00e8rent parfois la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 dans le but de convaincre l\u2019opinion publique qu\u2019ils ont raison \u00bb.L\u2019atelier s\u2019inscrivait dans un programme exp\u00e9rimental du gouvernement visant, en concertation avec des journalistes et des enseignants, \u00e0 contrer la propagation sur l\u2019internet de fausses informations. La France m\u00e8ne actuellement l\u2019une des plus actives campagnes d\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias et \u00e0 l\u2019information dans le monde, et ce d\u00e8s le coll\u00e8ge, afin de fournir aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves les moyens de reconna\u00eetre les informations fallacieuses que l\u2019on peut trouver en ligne.Le budget gouvernemental consacr\u00e9 aux ateliers traitant des \u00e9cueils de l\u2019internet est en augmentation depuis 2015. Environ 15 000 enseignants b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient chaque ann\u00e9e d\u2019une formation publique \u00e0 ce sujet. Et dans certains organismes de r\u00e9insertion, le versement d\u2019aides sociales \u00e0 de jeunes adultes, dont le revenu de solidarit\u00e9 active (RSA), est conditionn\u00e9 au suivi d\u2019un cours d\u2019\u00e9ducation aux medias.Le minist\u00e8re de la Culture a doubl\u00e9 le budget annuel consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 ce type de formation, le portant \u00e0 6 millions d\u2019euros. Par ailleurs, le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 un cours \u00e9lectif consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019information dans les prochains programmes de lyc\u00e9e. Certains enseignants appellent \u00e0 ce que le cours soit obligatoire au m\u00eame titre que l\u2019histoire et les math\u00e9matiques.\u00ab Plus on commence t\u00f4t, mieux c\u2019est \u00bb, juge Serge Barbet, directeur d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Centre pour l\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias et \u00e0 l\u2019information (CLEMI), qui coordonne les efforts du gouvernement. \u00ab C\u2019est pour cela que nous militons pour davantage d\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. C\u2019est devenu un besoin vital et une menace. \u00bbLa France a \u00e9t\u00e9 parmi les premiers pays \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias et \u00e0 l\u2019internet. L\u2019attentat contre Charlie Hebdo en 2015 avait mis en lumi\u00e8re une profonde m\u00e9fiance ambiante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des m\u00e9dias ainsi qu\u2019une vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 aux th\u00e9ories du complot circulant en ligne.Les mesures apparaissent d\u2019autant plus urgentes que les \u00e9lections pr\u00e9sidentielles am\u00e9ricaines et fran\u00e7aises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de campagnes russes de d\u00e9sinformation, et que des th\u00e9ories du complot circulent au sujet des attentats de Paris et de Nice. Les r\u00e9centes violentes manifestations en France contre les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s de revenus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 coordonn\u00e9es sur Facebook et d\u2019autres r\u00e9seaux sociaux, plateformes sur lesquelles des posts trompeurs ou des vid\u00e9os manipul\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab lik\u00e9es \u00bb et partag\u00e9es des milliers de fois.A l\u2019\u00e9tranger, les cours d\u2019\u00e9ducation \u00e0 l\u2019internet se multiplient \u00e9galement, souvent \u00e0 l\u2019initiative de groupes ind\u00e9pendants tels que le News Literacy Project aux Etats-Unis, un organisme financ\u00e9 par des fondations et des entreprises comme Facebook et Google. Des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019Union Europ\u00e9enne ont appel\u00e9 ce mois-ci \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper des programmes de l\u2019\u00e9ducation nationale de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 lutter contre la d\u00e9sinformation et la manipulation des \u00e9lections.Selon Ren\u00e9e Hobbs, professeure \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Rhode Island sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans l\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias, la strat\u00e9gie centralis\u00e9e de la France est \u00ab assez unique \u00bb et \u00ab tout \u00e0 fait remarquable \u00bb.Le gouvernement a fait du programme propos\u00e9 par Mme Laffont un mod\u00e8le du genre et a soutenu son d\u00e9veloppement \u00e0 hauteur de dizaines de milliers d\u2019euros depuis 2017. Plus de 155 journalistes b\u00e9n\u00e9voles participent d\u00e9sormais au projet, dont beaucoup travaillent au Monde. Environ 150 ateliers pour les jeunes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus cette ann\u00e9e.Mme Laffont tente de rendre ses exercices aussi simples que possible. Elle se sert de Twitter et de YouTube, et fournit aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves les liens de sites de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour le fact-checking. Elle explique comment les journalistes trouvent et confirment leurs informations, esp\u00e9rant pouvoir att\u00e9nuer la m\u00e9fiance de certains envers les m\u00e9dias et les mener \u00e0 davantage de discernement en ligne.\u00ab Nous nous sommes rendu compte qu\u2019il fallait revenir aux fondamentaux avant m\u00eame d\u2019aborder le sujet des \u2018fake news\u2019 et les th\u00e9ories du complot : qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019une information, qui la cr\u00e9e, comment v\u00e9rifier ses sources \u00bb, explique Mme Laffont.Il est encore trop t\u00f4t pour juger de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de tels cours. En raison de l\u2019\u00e9volution constante de la technologie, ils risquent de rapidement devenir obsol\u00e8tes. Sans parler des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019infrastructure : au coll\u00e8ge Henri Barbusse, les enseignants n\u2019arrivaient pas \u00e0 se connecter \u00e0 l\u2019internet.Guillaume Chaslot, un ing\u00e9nieur qui a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9laborer l\u2019algorithme de recommandation de YouTube, juge les efforts louables mais craint qu\u2019ils ne p\u00e8sent pas lourd face \u00e0 Facebook et Google. Les algorithmes de ces g\u00e9ants de l\u2019internet donnent priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019interaction, explique-t-il, et par cons\u00e9quent les contenus faux et sensationnalistes se propagent \u00e0 grande vitesse.\u00ab Je ne pense pas qu\u2019on resolve le probl\u00e8me avec ces atelier. Le probl\u00e8me vient des plateformes. Il y a un d\u00e9calage \u00bbLes formateurs estiment cependant que ces ateliers ont la vertu de faire r\u00e9aliser aux participants qu\u2019ils sont responsables de leur comportement en ligne.Les jeunes issus de milieux modestes sont particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 la d\u00e9sinformation.Lors d\u2019un atelier dans la r\u00e9gion parisienne, on demandait aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019\u00e9crire leur propre \u00ab fake news \u00bb. Fay\u00e7al Ben Abdallah r\u00e9digea un post mensonger \u00e0 propos des violences polici\u00e8res. Mais en le terminant, cet adolescent d\u2019une cit\u00e9 voisine r\u00e9alisa que beaucoup de ses amis pourraient y croire. \u201cC\u2019est tellement flippant\u201d, avait-il souffl\u00e9.Au coll\u00e8ge Henri Barbusse, la plupart des 24 \u00e9l\u00e8ves habitent une cit\u00e9 voisine de Vaulx-en Velin, une commune o\u00f9 le revenu moyen est inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la moyenne nationale et le nombre d\u2019habitants issus de l\u2019immigration \u00e9lev\u00e9. Ce mercredi-l\u00e0, Mme Laffont d\u00e9bute son cours avec une question : lesquels d\u2019entre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves pr\u00e9sents utilisaient Facebook ? Aucune main ne se l\u00e8ve..\u00ab Facebook c\u2019est pour les vieux \u00bb, s\u2019exclame une \u00e9l\u00e8ve, provoquant un \u00e9clat de rire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Nombre d\u2019entre eux disent pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram et WhatsApp. (Facebook est propri\u00e9taire d\u2019Instagram et de WhatsApp.)Certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves admettent l\u2019utilit\u00e9 d\u2019un cours d\u2019\u00e9ducation \u00e0 l\u2019internet et aux m\u00e9dias , mais ne sont pas certains comment ils pourront les mettre en application.Yacine Saidi, 14 ans, qui dit consacrer la majeure partie de son temps en ligne \u00e0 YouTube, Snapchat et Instagram, regrette que l\u2019atelier n\u2019ait pas dur\u00e9 plus longtemps. \u00ab Je ne suis pas s\u00fbr que \u00e7a me sera tr\u00e8s utile une fois de retour sur mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone chez moi \u00bbPlusieurs filles, dont Mlle Houbiri, expliquent s\u2019informer principalement sur Snapchat et YouTube. \u00ab On n\u2019a pas assez conscience de la fa\u00e7on dont les journalistes travaillent, comment les fake news se cr\u00e9ent, ou pourquoi telle ou telle information appara\u00eet sur nos r\u00e9seaux sociaux \u00bb.La cloche de midi sonne, mettant fin \u00e0 trois heures d\u2019atelier. Mme Laffont a trouv\u00e9 stimulants l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et l\u2019investissement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves.\u00ab C\u2019est \u00e0 vous de trier ce que vous voyez en ligne.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 Launches on Mission to the Moon\u2019s Far Side", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina is aiming to go where no one has gone before: the far side of the moon.Exactly when it will set down at its destination has not yet been announced \u2014 possibly in early January \u2014 but Chang\u2019e-4 will provide the first close-up look at a part of the moon that is eternally out of view from Earth.Chang\u2019e-4 includes two main parts: the main lander weighing about 2,400 pounds and a 300-pound rover. By comparison, NASA\u2019s Opportunity rover on Mars weighs about 400 pounds, and the Curiosity rover there is much bigger, at 2,000 pounds.The spacecraft is largely a clone of Chang\u2019e-3, which landed on the moon in 2013. Indeed, Chang\u2019e-4 was built as the backup in case the first attempt failed. With the success \u2014 the first soft landing of any spacecraft on the moon since 1976 \u2014 the Chinese outfitted Chang\u2019e-4 with a different set of instruments and decided to send it to a different location.The rover will land in the 110-mile-wide Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater. It is on the far side of the moon, which is always facing away from Earth. (The moon is what planetary scientists call \u201ctidally locked\u201d to the rotation of the Earth. That is, its period of rotation \u2014 its day \u2014 is the same as the time it takes to make one orbit around Earth.)The crater is within an area known as the South Pole-Aitken basin, a gigantic, 1,600-mile-wide crater at the bottom of the moon, which has a mineralogy distinct from other locations. That may reflect materials from the inside of the moon that were brought up by the impact that created the basin.The far side is also considerably more mountainous than the near side for reasons not yet understood.The suite of instruments on the rover and the lander include cameras, ground-penetrating radar and spectrometers to help identify the composition of rocks and dirt in the area. And China\u2019s space agency has collaborated with other countries. One instrument was developed at Kiel University in Germany; another was provided by the Swedish Institute of Space Physics.The instruments will probe the structure of the rocks beneath the spacecraft and study the effects of the solar wind striking the lunar surface. Chang\u2019e-4 will also test the ability of making radio astronomy observations from the far side of the moon, without the effects of noise and interference from Earth.According to the Xinhua news agency, Chang\u2019e-4 is also carrying an intriguing biology experiment to see if plant seeds will germinate and silkworm eggs will hatch in the moon\u2019s low gravity.Because the moon blocks radio signals from our planet, the Chinese launched a satellite, called Queqiao, in May. It is circling high over the far side of the moon, and will relay messages between Earth and the Chang\u2019e-4 lander.Zhang Xiaoping, an associate professor from Space Science Institute/Lunar and Planetary Science Laboratory of Macau University of Science and Technology, said that the spacecraft would follow the Chang\u2019e-3\u2019s trajectory. That means it would arrive in three to five days and then orbit the moon for several days (13 in the case of Chang\u2019e-3) while preparing for the landing, he said.The far side is not dark all of the time.The first new moon of 2019 is Jan. 6. That\u2019s when you cannot see the moon because the dark side \u2014 the side that is in shadow facing away from the sun \u2014 is facing Earth. And when the near side of the moon is dark, the far side is awash in bright sunshine.Chinese officials have talked about Chang\u2019e-4 in public, but their interactions with journalists more resemble the carefully managed strategy used by the Soviet program during the Cold War rather than the more open publicity by NASA and many other space agencies. That way, the Chinese, like the Soviets, could boast about the successes and downplay any failures.In Chinese mythology, Chang\u2019e is the goddess of the moon. Other missions have been named after her, too.Chang\u2019e-1 and 2 went into orbit around the moon but did not land. Chang\u2019e-1 was launched in 2007. Chang\u2019e-2 followed in 2010.The next step in China\u2019s moon program is for the Chang\u2019e-5 robotic spacecraft to land on the moon and then bring rock samples back to Earth for additional study.Chang\u2019e-5 was supposed to head to the moon before Chang\u2019e-4, but a launch failure of the large Chinese rocket needed to carry it to space delayed the mission until at least 2019.Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, has praised the Chang\u2019e-4 mission as exciting, and at the International Astronautical Congress in Bremen, Germany in October, talked of possible collaboration with the Chinese space agency. Federal laws limit any NASA interaction with the Chinese.Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.Zoe Mou contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Tech Expansion, Austin Is Still Weird. It\u2019s Just More Wired Now, Too.", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Walking distance from the pink dome of the Texas Capitol building, there were whiskey samples, tamales and Nerf guns.The Virtual Reality crowd talked Augmented Reality. The millennials in YETI shirts and the gray-haired post-hippies in psychedelic vests racked up points in a 3-D shootout on Space Pirate Trainer. And then there was Tim Porter, the guy with the hologram-creating Merge Cube. Using an app he developed, Mr. Porter pulled out his phone and put his 4-year-old daughter\u2019s stuffed penguin into the cube, virtually speaking.Austinites have a name for all this: a Tuesday night.It was just another event at the Capital Factory, Austin\u2019s techie community center and start-up hub \u2014 this time, a virtual reality holiday party. Located in an office and hotel complex downtown, the Capital Factory has helped a number of Austinites quit their day jobs to become tech entrepreneurs. The shared work space features a Star Wars-themed floor with Luke and Leia restrooms, local craft beer on tap and a conference room hidden, Hardy Boys-style, behind a bookcase that swings open when you press the right book (\u201cThe Plains of Passage\u201d).\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you want to do, there are five Meetups at night that will support it,\u201d said Mr. Porter, 34, the founder and chief technology officer at Underminer Studios. \u201cIt\u2019s a maker community.\u201dFor decades, Austin was defined by the bureaucracy of state government, the academia of the University of Texas and the funkiness of its hippie-cowboy, Willie Nelson-inspired music and arts scene. Today, the tech culture and economy have transformed Texas\u2019 capital city and surrounding suburbs, creating jobs, worsening traffic, raising prices and changing the region\u2019s politics, tempo and brand.None of this is entirely new \u2014 people have been calling the Austin area\u2019s tech scene \u201cSilicon Hills\u201d since the late 1980s and early 1990s. But the slogan and the hype have now dramatically caught up.Apple\u2019s planned expansion has raised a host of unanswered questions about traffic, gentrification, affordability and competition for jobs.Austin consistently ranks high on the lists of cities with the worst traffic in America. And a recent housing market analysis found a shortage of 48,000 rental units affordable to households earning less than $25,000 per year. Supplies for middle-income families are also increasingly strained.\u201dI think in the last 10 years, it\u2019s been a real struggle for Austin to keep its identity and keep its soul, as downtown is being razed and converted into condos and high-rises, and you have people like Google and Facebook and Apple taking over the town with these buildings,\u201d said Omar Gallaga, who covered the city\u2019s tech culture for The Austin American-Statesman for more than 20 years. \u201cIf you have all the artists and the creative people that make it interesting move away because they can\u2019t afford to live there, then it becomes a different place.\u201dFew dispute that tech has turned Austin into one of the most vibrant and distinctive capital cities in America. Its other varied cultures \u2014 music, military, higher-ed, food, politics, journalism, real estate \u2014 are inseparable from its tech culture.Joseph Kopser, an Austinite who founded and sold a start-up called RideScout, made an unsuccessful but attention-grabbing run this year for a seat in Congress. A longtime venture capitalist, John Thornton, was the founder of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, Austin-based digital news organization that has helped transform Texas journalism. The nonprofit Austin Tech Alliance has launched get-out-the-vote efforts and helped city government shift to paperless permitting. One of the city\u2019s biggest annual cultural attractions, the South By Southwest festival, is now as much a celebration of tech as it is music and film.On any given day, some of the state\u2019s far-right lawmakers may be rubbing elbows downtown with 20-something entrepreneurs headed to work on motorized scooters \u2014 or perhaps, not long ago, passing by Professor Dumpster, otherwise known as Jeff Wilson, the co-founder of the start-up Kasita, who lived in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year as part of an experiment in minimalist living.Austin is still weird. It\u2019s just more wired now, too.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to become Silicon Valley \u2014 we want to be Austin,\u201d said Joshua Baer, the founder and chief executive of the Capital Factory, launched in 2009 to mentor, finance and support start-ups and entrepreneurs. \u201cWhat makes Austin really different, to me, is the culture clash. But it\u2019s not a clash. It\u2019s the culture collaboration.\u201dThere are now more than 138,000 tech-related jobs in the Austin metropolitan region, about 14 percent of the total jobs in the area. Ray Perryman, an economist in Waco, estimated that the tech sector pumps about $31 billion into the area\u2019s overall economy, about 35 percent of the total. It is far from the biggest tech community in the country. In a ranking of the top tech-talent markets by CBRE, a commercial real estate company, Austin came up sixth, behind San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, Toronto and New York. But Austin\u2019s brand as a tech hub rivals that of some of its rivals, including other cities that have a larger tech presence.\u201cWe punch way above our weight class,\u201d said Barbary Brunner, the former chief executive of the Austin Technology Council, which was founded in the early 1990s and functions as the tech community\u2019s chamber of commerce. \u201cIf you\u2019re from outside Austin, you think the tech industry here is huge, super sophisticated, super mature. We don\u2019t have the innovation leaders here. We have executors here.\u201dThe buzz lately does not revolve solely around Apple. A different older global behemoth rarely embraced by hipster tech has become a major player \u2014 the United States Army. Months before Apple\u2019s announcement, the Army opened a new center in downtown Austin to help modernize its weapons and equipment and to identify, acquire and develop innovative technology.The Army Futures Command is the only so-called four-star command that is based not on a military installation but in a civilian building, in this case in the heart of the city in a satellite of the University of Texas. The soldiers mostly shun camouflage for button-down shirts and khakis. They have embedded in Austin\u2019s tech culture, military officials say, to help make the Army smarter and more cutting-edge. The leader of the Army Futures Command, Gen. John M. Murray, a four-star general who also wears casual business attire to work, has been meeting tech entrepreneurs, hanging out at the Capital Factory and recently attended his first Austin hackathon.\u201cOne of the things that we are working on \u2014 and we have not solidified yet, this is just still a concept \u2014 is can the Army work with venture capitalists?\u201d General Murray said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve probably had, in the last couple months, a dozen or a dozen and a half conversations with VCs. For me, it\u2019s more about understanding, because this is all new to me. So, understanding the world they live in, what their requirements are, how they can help us and how we can help them.\u201dOne of the first outcomes of the Army\u2019s new venture was a mixed success. General Murray wanted the Army to work with an Austin-based start-up, Senseye, to help reduce the amount of time a pilot spends in training. It did not work out as planned, but the Army found another application for the company\u2019s technology.The Futures Command will be fully operational in the summer of 2019, and a staff of about 500 will take over two floors of the UT System building. Until then, a subset of the Futures Command called the Army Applications Lab has a team that works out of the Capital Factory.The day after the VR holiday party, Mr. Baer and the rest of Capital Factory hosted a visit from one of the Army\u2019s top officials, Ryan D. McCarthy, the Army under secretary. Mr. McCarthy told reporters that he felt \u201cpretty good\u201d about Apple\u2019s planned expansion, and the Army\u2019s expanding role in Austin. \u201cI think it just shows the wealth of talent and opportunity that exists here in this city and this state.\u201dDavid Montgomery contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some of the Popular Images and Themes the Russians Posted on Social Media", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUsing an array of accounts on multiple platforms and targeting a variety of demographics, the Russians have generated millions of interactions with their posts.When Russia targets Americans on social media, it has political goals: in 2016, to damage Hillary Clinton and help elect Donald J. Trump; since then, to press Russian views on issues like the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine; and in the future \u2014 who knows? To wield influence, Russian online operators must first build an audience. Posing as Americans, they have to persuade Americans to pay attention and give them at least a modicum of trust.Two reports prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee and released on Monday shed some light on how Russia does it.

Experts who have studied the Internet Research Agency say such posts build a loyal audience, essentially preparing the ground for whatever future political message the Russian government may want to spread.The Black Matters theme was first created on a Facebook page in June 2015. But in the months that followed, Internet Research Agency operators spread the same brand across many platforms: Google+, Twitter and Instagram, where @blackmattersus drew 28,466 followers and 1,929,855 engagements \u2014 likes and shares. A YouTube channel with the same name posted 95 videos. There were Facebook and Google ads. A podcast ran on SoundCloud linked to a blog on Tumblr.

{"Headline": "A Toaster on Wheels to Deliver Groceries? Self-Driving Tech Tests Practical Uses", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Last Thursday morning in the desert town of Scottsdale, Ariz., a tiny robotic car turned onto a neighborhood street and pulled up to a home with a Spanish-tiled roof and synthetic grass in the front yard.Not even half the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, the toylike vehicle had no driver and no passengers. Instead, it held six bags of groceries from the Fry\u2019s Food Store down the road. One observer oohed and aahed over how cute the car seemed.\u201cThe more people work on urban self-driving, the more they realize what a long road it is,\u201d he said.Nuro was founded in 2016 by Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, two key engineers from Google\u2019s self-driving project, which eventually morphed into the Waymo autonomous business. (Both have the same parent company, Alphabet.) Nuro, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., and has raised $92 million in funding, decided to focus on creating tiny self-driving cars \u2014 they measure 104 inches long by 43 inches wide by 70 inches high \u2014 that would solely make local deliveries.Mr. Ferguson said there was an opportunity to automate all the trips that Americans make to local stores for goods and services \u2014 like buying groceries and picking up laundry \u2014 citing statistics that these errands account for a significant portion of all car journeys.\u201cIf we can reduce the cost of these deliveries and get them to you faster than you could make the trip yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cthere would be no reason for you to get in the car.\u201dWhile that endgame is nowhere close to reality, Mr. Ferguson said it was closer than autonomous passenger services. That\u2019s because Nuro does not have to worry about the comfort and safety of anyone in the vehicle. And by making the delivery automobiles much smaller than a regular car, it can also increase the margin of error on the roads.\u201cThere is a qualitative difference when you don\u2019t have to worry about passengers,\u201d he said.The trouble is that when testing this technology, Nuro cannot put someone in the mini-vehicle who can take over in case of emergency. So the start-up began by tests in full-size cars. It is now confident enough in its technology to put its tiny vehicles on public roads.Mr. Ferguson, who often refers to Nuro\u2019s mini cars as rolling toasters, acknowledged that the idea can seem \u201cweird.\u201d But, he said, he ultimately sees them as a safer way of getting autonomous technology rolling.Last Thursday, the Nuro cars looked even odder on second glance \u2014 because they were being trailed by regular-size vehicles. A dark Toyota Prius with a small wireless antenna perched on its rooftop was following just behind the self-driving robots. This was what the company calls a shadow car, which ferries technicians who can remotely take control of the robotic vehicle if anything goes wrong.Nuro declined to discuss its financial arrangement with Fry\u2019s. It said that a delivery today using its mini autonomous vehicles costs $6. Once it removes most of the human labor from deliveries, Mr. Ferguson said, the company can reduce the cost further and eventually serve people that cannot afford deliveries today.Even so, it was unclear how much demand there would be for the service. Joe Schott, 60, who saw the tiny Nuro car pass his bicycle on a recent afternoon, said it was ideal for his sister, who is disabled. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for her to get groceries in and out of her car,\u201d he said.But Keri Diggins, 45, who shops at Fry\u2019s and teaches sociology at a local college, questioned how much the service would suit people who are elderly or physically impaired.\u201cA car can\u2019t take the food to your doorstep,\u201d she said.When one of Nuro\u2019s cars pulled up to the curb in Scottsdale last week, I noticed it had small motorcycle rearview mirrors on it, even though the mirrors serve no practical purpose. Federal regulations for low-speed vehicles require the use of rearview mirrors, Mr. Ferguson said.\u201cIt\u2019s easier for us just to put them on than to try to get exemptions,\u201d he said.To see how well the cars worked, I walked up to the vehicle and punched a PIN code into a small digital touch pad. The doors opened upward, revealing two compartments filled with grocery bags.As I leaned forward to grab them, I hit my head on the open door. Then, reaching for the other bags, I hit my head again.It was a moment that showed how difficult it can be to design machines that interact with humans. In creating its robot, Nuro had not provided as much headroom as it should have \u2014 and people behave in inexplicable ways.\u201cWe\u2019ll take the blame for the first one,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said with a smile. \u201cThe second one is on you.\u201dIn a newer design, he added, the doors will open higher, so tall people will not hit their heads.Advertisement"}

Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.When Chevy Chase finds a good way to hurt himself in \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation,\u201d he generally tries it more than once. The board that whacks him in the chin is liable to strike again. Floors will collapse, ladders fall, Christmas trees come hurtling through windows. The film\u2019s penchant for breakage jokes is rivaled only by its taste for gross-out humor, and for the kinds of double-entendres best appreciated by 7-year-old boys. One extended comedy routine involves the panic caused by a runaway squirrel.Fatigue is in the air. This third look at the quintessentially middle-American Griswold family, led by Clark (Mr. Chase) and the very patient Ellen (Beverly D\u2019Angelo) is only a weary shadow of the original \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\u201d which found a lot to laugh at as it followed the dopey paterfamilias Clark and his quarrelsome brood on a hellish cross-country journey in their station wagon. The new film does little more than reintroduce these familiar characters (with new actors playing the children, who would otherwise be college age by now) and let them get on one another\u2019s nerves in earnest.The screenplay for \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation,\u201d by John Hughes, makes no pretense at being anything other than a disjointed collection of running gags; if it weren\u2019t for a calendar that marks the approach of Christmas Day, the film would have no forward momentum at all. The film also looks tacky, what with flimsy props and occasionally blurry cinematography, and the direction by Jeremiah S. Chechik displays comic timing that is uncertain at best. In spite of all this, however, the Griswolds do occasionally have their moments.The best thing the new film does is to bring back Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid), the wily, scene-stealing slob whose disgusting habits are a source of considerable amusement. There is also a good deal of funny seasonal kitsch, like the reindeer cups (complete with antlers) from which Clark and Eddie quaff their eggnog. Also on hand are a number of curious actors, like William Hickey and Mae Questel as a pair of elderly relatives, who don\u2019t do much but make the film more interesting than it otherwise might be. Miss Questel, the model for Betty Boop, provides a very Booplike rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation\u201d is rated PG-13 (\u201cSpecial Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13\u201d).

{"Headline": "The Corporate Donors Behind a Republican Power Grab", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalgreens and other major companies are key supporters of the Wisconsin legislators now trying to undermine democracy.Opinion ColumnistWalgreens portrays itself as the friendly neighborhood drugstore. It gives flu shots to children, helps communities after storms, donates to charity \u2014 and makes feel-good advertisements trumpeting its various good deeds.But Walgreens also has a tougher side, one you won\u2019t see in those ads. To protect a tax break, the company has allied itself with Wisconsin\u2019s brutally partisan Republican Party. That party is now in the midst of a power grab, stripping authority from Wisconsin\u2019s governor and attorney general solely because Republicans lost those offices last month. The power grab comes after years of extreme gerrymandering, which lets Republicans dominate the legislature despite Wisconsin being a closely divided state.The story of Walgreens and Wisconsin has its roots in a decade-old court case.In 2008, the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of an aggressive tax strategy by the company, in a case known as Walgreens v. City of Madison. When calculating the property taxes it owed, Walgreens used an artificially low valuation of its stores. It did not pay taxes based on the actual value of those stores, as reflected by their purchase price and rent. Instead, it took into account the value of vacant stores nearby.A few weeks later, Walgreens donated $1,000 to Vos. Over the summer, it donated another $6,000 to the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate. A couple of weeks before Election Day, the company gave $1,000 to Fitzgerald. These donations weren\u2019t simply a matter of spreading money around. Walgreens did not donate to state-level Democrats this year, as it has in the past.\u201cIt would be healthier for companies to spend a little more time thinking about the meaning of these donations,\u201d as Judd Legum, author of the political newsletter Popular Information, told me. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s all transactional.\u201d In recent months, Legum\u2019s reporting has caused Facebook, Google, Walmart, Major League Baseball and others to ask for the return of donations to politicians whose values the companies were not comfortable defending.So far, Walgreens has not been willing to do the same in Wisconsin. I asked the company last week what it thought about the recent events in Wisconsin, and it ducked the question. But Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman, told me the company was \u201cin the process of evaluating\u201d the situation.The silence of major companies is disappointing because they could actually make a difference. Republican politicians care about the opinions of their corporate backers.I realize that being able to operate in a well-functioning democracy doesn\u2019t bring the same obvious bottom-line benefits as, say, a tax break. But our corporate leaders are making a big mistake if they decide that democracy doesn\u2019t matter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Reduce Privacy Risks, the Census Plans to Report Less Accurate Data ", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGuaranteeing people\u2019s confidentiality has become more of a challenge, but some scholars worry that the new system will impede research.When the Census Bureau gathered data in 2010, it made two promises. The form would be \u201cquick and easy,\u201d it said. And \u201cyour answers are protected by law.\u201dOn Thursday, the bureau will announce the trade-off it has chosen for data publications from the 2018 End-to-End Census Test it conducted in Rhode Island, the only dress rehearsal before the actual census in 2020. The bureau has decided to enforce stronger privacy protections than companies like Apple or Google had when they each first took up differential privacy.Cynthia Dwork, the Gordon McKay professor of computer science at Harvard and one of the inventors of differential privacy, says that it is \u201ctailored to the statistical analysis of large data sets\u201d \u2014 precisely the issue facing the census with its mandate from Title 13 of the U.S. Code to keep each person\u2019s information private, and its responsibility to provide useful data.At the root of the problem are the tables of aggregate statistics that the bureau publishes. There are hundreds of tables \u2014 sex by age, say, or ethnicity by race \u2014 summarizing the population at several levels of geography, from areas the size of a city block all the way up to the level of a state or the nation. In 2010, the bureau released tables with nearly eight billion numbers in all. That was about 25 numbers for each person living in the United States, even though Americans were asked only 10 questions about themselves. In other words, the tables were generated in so many ways that the Census Bureau ended up releasing more data in aggregate then it had collected in the first place.In 2003, Irit Dinur and Kobbi Nissim, then with the NEC Research Institute, warned about extensive data publication and the inadequacy of many existing attempts to ensure confidentiality, including those used by the Census Bureau in 2000 and 2010. The two researchers\u2019 \u201cdatabase reconstruction theorem\u201d provides a road map for someone to turn collections of summary tables into approximate records on individuals.In November 2016, the bureau staged something of an attack on itself. Using only the summary tables with their eight billion numbers, Mr. Abowd formed a small team to try to generate a record for every American that would show the block where he or she lived, as well as his or her sex, age, race and ethnicity \u2014 a \u201creconstruction\u201d of the person-level data.On the face of it, finding a reconstruction that satisfies all of the constraints from all the tables the bureau produces seems impossible. But Mr. Abowd says the problem gets easier when you notice that these tables are full of zeros. Each zero indicates a combination of variables \u2014 values for one or more of block, sex, age, race and ethnicity \u2014 for which no one exists in the census. We might find, for example, that there is no one below voting age living on a particular block. We can then ignore any reconstructions that include people under 18 living there. This greatly reduces the set of viable reconstructions and makes the problem solvable with off-the-shelf software.By this summer, Mr. Abowd and his team had completed their reconstruction for nearly every part of the country. When they matched their reconstructed data to the actual, confidential records \u2014 again comparing just block, sex, age, race and ethnicity \u2014 they found about 50 percent of people matched exactly. And for over 90 percent there was at most one mistake, typically a person\u2019s age being missed by one or two years. (At smaller levels of geography, the census reports age in five-year buckets.)This level of accuracy was alarming. Mr. Abowd and his peers say that their reconstruction, while still preliminary, is not a violation of Title 13. Instead it is seen as a red flag that their current disclosure limitation system is out of date.The bureau has long had procedures to protect respondents\u2019 confidentiality. For example, census data from 2010 showed that a single Asian couple \u2014 a 63-year-old man and a 58-year-old woman \u2014 lived on Liberty Island, at the base of the Statue of Liberty.That was news to David Luchsinger, who had taken the job as the superintendent for the national monument the year before. On Census Day in 2010, Mr. Luchsinger was 59, and his wife, Debra, was 49. In an interview, they said they had identified as white on the questionnaire, and they were the island\u2019s real occupants.Before releasing its data, the Census Bureau had \u201cswapped\u201d the Luchsingers with another household living in another part of the state, who matched them on some key questions. This mechanism preserved their privacy, and kept summaries like the voting age population of the island correct, but also introduced some uncertainty into the data.The bureau\u2019s attack on itself showed that swapping wasn\u2019t enough. Swapping focused on people who were isolated like the Luchsingers or who had characteristics that made them stand out in their neighborhood \u2014 the cells in the tables with only a single person. But as we have seen, it is the zeros in the tables that give us power to perform the reconstruction in the first place. To guarantee privacy, we need to consider the zeros as well.\u201cAll of the sudden, Title 13 gets equated with differential privacy \u2014 it\u2019s not,\u201d he said, adding that if you make a guess about someone\u2019s identity from looking at census data, you are probably wrong. \u201cThat has been regarded in the past as protection of privacy. They want to make it so that you can\u2019t even guess.\u201d\u201cThere is a trade-off between usability and risk,\u201d he added. \u201cI am concerned they may go far too far on privileging an absolutist standard of risk.\u201dTimothy Donald Jones, a Ph.D. candidate in statistics at Columbia University, contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

By the late 1920s, women were largely shut out of directing in the American industry until the mid-1960s. If film pioneers like Lois Weber and Alice Guy Blach\u00e9 had continued, it\u2019s possible that a radically different movie world might have emerged. In my alt-Hollywood fantasy, female and male filmmakers would have worked side by side, perhaps giving us unimagined stories and heroines. That history in turn might have laid the foundation for an equitable present rather than an industry defined by entrenched sexism.In this quietly political Trump-era documentary, Wiseman offers a long, searching look at a small American town where homespun charm exists side by side with steadfast isolationism.With their gently nodding, brilliantly colored flowers and shifting shadows, Dorsky\u2019s heart-soaringly beautiful films are reminders that cinema is also about light and form.A.O. ScottA four-way tie for first place may look like wanton indecisiveness, but to me these lyrical, visionary documentaries add up to an indelible composite portrait of America right now. At a time when we tend to see ourselves and our fellow citizens as sociological stereotypes and ideological clich\u00e9s, these highly personal films suggest that a different way of telling the American story \u2014 the crazy multiplicity of American stories \u2014 may still be possible. Not because the filmmakers offer visions of consensus, but precisely because each one digs deep into the conflicts and contradictions that run through every neighborhood, household and individual heart. \u201cMonrovia,\u201d filmed in a tiny, mostly white heartland town, is the latest work from an 88-year-old master. \u201cHale County,\u201d set in a rural mostly black part of Alabama, and \u201cMinding the Gap,\u201d set in a mixed Illinois industrial city, are first features by skilled and intuitive young directors. \u201cBisbee \u201917,\u201d named for a mining town in Arizona, is a powerful midcareer foray into historical memory and political strife.Casting Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant as witty, cynical partners in crime in early \u201990s Manhattan is pretty much foolproof. They would be fun to watch if all they did was insult each other over drinks. They do a lot of that, and this movie \u2014 based on the real-life escapades of literary forger Lee Israel and her accomplice, Jack Hock \u2014 is admirably modest and specific in scale. It doesn\u2019t preach or pose, but in the fine grain of its characters and the skill of its performers (including Dolly Wells as a sweet and credulous bookseller), it achieves a kind of perfection.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Junk Removers Manhandle My Heart", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMeandering through grief, a man tries to replace his sofa. It doesn\u2019t go well.Our choice was the Beecroft, a tight-backed sofa with low arms and wooden legs capped with offset brass wheels and covered in a white denim slipcover. I didn\u2019t just feel grown up buying this sofa, I felt sophisticated.Initially, John balked. \u201cI\u2019m not paying $3,000 for a couch.\u201dBut it would last forever, I argued.\u201cThere has to be something cheaper that we like just as much,\u201d he said.There wasn\u2019t. Every other sofa we considered paled in comparison.When we moved into a new apartment 13 years later, Miss Beecroft was still as sturdy as ever. But with an opportunity to remodel and redecorate, we decided she was due for a refresh. We took the slipcover and cushions to an upholsterer who remade them in a natural-colored linen. The result was stunning.A few years later, our two new Chihuahua puppies, Sissy and Skeeter, quickly figured out how to pull the underside burlap from the wooden frame and create a little cave to hide in. Before long, all of the burlap had been ripped from its staples, which wasn\u2019t a good look for Miss Bee. Sadly, things went downhill from there.The linen slipcover didn\u2019t prove as durable as the white denim, especially with two small dogs. Holes appeared, so we flipped the cushions. The other sides got holes. Then one of Miss Bee\u2019s wooden legs came loose, developing a gruesome tilt.I removed the leg altogether and propped up that end on a pair of books. I had our tailor patch the fabric with large squares until the patches themselves developed holes.I handled that on my own because by then John had died, succumbing to a rare and aggressive cancer he\u2019d learned he had only two years earlier. My mind being elsewhere, I figured I would flip the cushions so no one would notice, forgetting that both sides were in tatters.I had a choice: Did I fix up Miss Bee, provider of comfort and anchor of my home and life with John? Or did I accept that she wasn\u2019t worth fixing?I don\u2019t remember what made me decide to bite the bullet and order a new sofa, only that it happened fast. I knew what I wanted. It was just a matter of checking a few boxes online, entering my credit card number and clicking \u201cBuy.\u201dAll that was left was to arrange to have Miss Bee taken away. I called a junk removal service I liked because they would try to donate reusable items to charity or thrift shops. Miss Bee had a solid frame (not to mention a beautiful heart, as crazy as that sounds), so I hoped the right person could restore her to glory.I prepared for the haulers\u2019 arrival by moving a huge shelving unit near the front door to provide fuller access to the entry. I had recently bought the unit to hold sentimental objects I had accumulated with John over the years. Before I could move the shelves, I had to remove those objects: seashells from vacations, random pottery, wasps\u2019 and hornets\u2019 nests, incense holders, pitchers, jugs and vases.I removed John\u2019s grandmother\u2019s metal salt-and-pepper shakers in the shape of two birds on a branch and her gold vase with ornate floral etching (the one John\u2019s mother keeps hinting that she wants back). I removed the simple wooden box that holds a portion of John\u2019s ashes. Made by my carpenter brother-in-law, the box also holds clippings from John\u2019s hair and beard, a few trinkets and a small bag of our first dog\u2019s ashes, because she was John\u2019s favorite little girl.I removed framed photos of John, the candles I light for him, the tiny Ganesh I bought for him in India, the incense he gave to me on our last Christmas together and the metal bird feet he bought for me many years ago and that I love so much.After moving the shelf, I was ready. Or so I thought.The October morning the haulers arrived, I explained that the sofa would fit through the doorway but only at a specific angle. I knew this because the movers who brought it in had an arduous time but finally figured it out.These haulers weren\u2019t so patient. They attempted to shove it through from different angles with no luck.And then it happened.Although I had moved the shelves and everything on them, I had left a small, porcelain deer head hanging on the wall near the door, a Christmas gift from John that was one of my most cherished possessions. The night before, I had considered moving it along with the rest of my keepsakes but then thought, \u201cNah, it won\u2019t be in the way.\u201dAs the haulers jostled and lifted, the sofa bumped the deer head and knocked it off.\u201cUh oh,\u201d the main guy said as I bounded from my chair. \u201cHold up,\u201d he said to his partner as I fell to my knees and scooped up the deer head and left antler, which had broken off.I cursed as I looked at the pieces in my hand, a wave of despair washing over me. Returning to my chair, I pulled out my phone.\u201ctrying not to have a total emotional breakdown,\u201d I texted to my friends Jessica and Rosella. \u201cthe sofa removers broke my john derian porcelain deer that john gave me for christmas.\u201d\u201ci\u2019m really heartbroken\u201d\u201cit\u2019s like john was angry at me for getting rid of our sofa\u201dNeither responded.Meanwhile, the haulers gave up trying to figure out how to fit the sofa through the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m going to the truck to get a hammer,\u201d the main guy said. Then, to me: \u201cDo you have a hammer?\u201dI didn\u2019t want them smashing up Miss Bee, but in my dazed state I retrieved a hammer for him. Within seconds, he was assaulting her back legs.They did not give in quickly. The hardwood frame was solidly built. I sat in my chair and watched as these two men violently attacked Miss Bee.\u201cthe guys are still trying to figure out how to squeeze the sofa through the door,\u201d I typed to Jessica and Rosella.\u201cthey\u2019re literally bashing it to bits with a hammer\u201d\u201ccan\u2019t stop crying\u201dNo response.Eventually, with much effort, the haulers succeeded in knocking off the back legs. Miss Bee had put up a fight, her legs cracking and splitting but not letting loose, even as chunks of wood flew across the living room.I felt as if I had watched a family member being murdered. This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to happen. They were supposed to give her to someone who would lovingly restore her, not butcher her in my own apartment.Once Miss Bee\u2019s shattered legs were ripped away, the men were able to swiftly carry her through the doorway. Wiping away tears, I picked up her tattered seat cushions and carried them to the door, handing them to one of the haulers. I didn\u2019t want those assassins coming back in.I signed for their work. It didn\u2019t occur to me to offer them a tip. And then, I lost it.Jessica responded to my text first: \u201cno, john not angry, it\u2019s just the clumsy removal man. glue the deer. it\u2019s ok. john loves you. go stand on your balcony and take some deep breaths, look up at the sky and tell him you love him so much. inhale some fresh air. everything is ok.\u201dThen Rosella: \u201cyes everything she said. i\u2019ll be home around 1:30 and i\u2019ll come by for moral support and with some gorilla glue.\u201dThe morning\u2019s saga had unlocked a trove of mounting grief within me that wasn\u2019t, of course, about the sofa. It was about Halloween, which John loved. It was about our anniversary, Nov. 6. It was about another Thanksgiving without John, and another birthday without him, and another Christmas, and then New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201cI miss you so much,\u201d I wailed. \u201cI want you back. I need you here. Please come back to me.\u201dOut on my balcony, taking deep breaths of fresh autumn air, I realized I was dying of thirst, completely dehydrated from all the sobbing. So I poured a glass of ice water, trudged to my bedroom and collapsed into bed.Grief and catharsis can take surprising forms. I hadn\u2019t expected a sofa to play such a starring role in mine, but the murder of Miss Bee had provided a powerful \u2014 and beneficial \u2014 release.Tomorrow would be another day, and a new year beckoned. Until then, Rosella (and her Gorilla Glue) were on the way.Mike Rucker, vice president of the NBC News Brand Studio, is writing a memoir about love and loss.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Sundar Pichai Has a Chat With Congress", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsIt was the first congressional hearing I had attended, and the spectacle was eye-opening. It underscored, to me, how Silicon Valley and Washington exist in their bubbles without really understanding each other. Lawmakers seemed like out-of-touch old people with little grasp of how technology works and where the real risks lie. Mr. Pichai came across as evasive and unwilling to acknowledge the legitimate concerns about Google\u2019s business practices.At holiday parties and informal discussions in Washington, the conversation often turned to big tech and privacy. There seemed to be a growing wariness among lawmakers, regulators and aides about data collection and the unrelenting push by companies to gather more information about us.While many expressed concern about the bigness of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, there wasn\u2019t a consensus on how to deal with them. A federal privacy law with real teeth seemed uncertain, and not many folks expected antitrust regulation even in the face of European action.All the while, tech companies continue to sell the message that they are job creators and engines of economic growth.\u25a0 An argument often made against antitrust action is that the technology industry is dynamic, and that today\u2019s dominant predator can become tomorrow\u2019s prey. Nokia once dominated mobile phones but lost its standing to Samsung and Apple in the smartphone era.\u25a0 It\u2019s rare for a bail hearing to make international news, but this was no ordinary arrest.Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the tech behemoth Huawei and a daughter of the company\u2019s founder, was arrested Dec. 1 at the airport in Vancouver, British Columbia, for extradition to the United States.The American and Canadian authorities claim Ms. Meng circumvented trade sanctions against Iran, using a Huawei subsidiary. The arrest of a prominent executive at one of China\u2019s biggest tech companies, with close ties to the government, complicates the Trump administration\u2019s negotiations to end a trade war with China.Advertisement"}

Yes, Traffic Is That Bad", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElaine Vespermann waited on the corner for his lead.Only when Preston Martin charged across six lanes of rush-hour traffic did she follow behind him. He waved at cars to keep them at bay. He watched over her until she reached the other side of the street.After too many close calls, Ms. Vespermann, 38, a babysitter, does not like to cross by herself anymore. \u201cHe helps, always,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard every day. There are too many cars and the people are crazy sometimes.\u201dWhile school crossing guards have long shepherded children across the street, the city\u2019s traffic has become so perilous that now even grown-ups need crossing guards. Officially known as pedestrian safety managers, they are vigilant escorts across some of the city\u2019s busiest intersections.They are not the traffic police; they cannot hand out tickets and their focus is not on keeping cars moving. Instead, they are bodyguards for pedestrians. As soon as the walk sign flashes, they are the first ones into the crosswalk. They shadow the elderly, the young and anyone needing extra time or care. They watch over everyone \u2014 especially those too distracted by texting or talking to watch out for themselves.\u201cThe traffic is overwhelming,\u201d said Doris Garcia, 44, a mother of four from Brooklyn who supervises the pedestrian safety managers in heat, rain and snow. \u201cPedestrians yell at drivers. If drivers don\u2019t listen, sometimes we have to put our whole body in the intersection just to stop the cars.\u201dAcross the city, 106 pedestrians were killed in crashes with motor vehicles last year and more than 10,700 other pedestrians were injured, according to traffic data.The pedestrian managers stand guard over one of the city\u2019s worst choke points: where Varick Street feeds into the Holland Tunnel. An average of 40,742 vehicles go through the tunnel every weekday to New Jersey and beyond, often backing up onto Varick.The stretch of Varick between Houston and Spring Streets has become one of the most dangerous in Manhattan. Though there have been no deaths, 119 people \u2014 including 40 pedestrians and nine cyclists \u2014 were injured in crashes from 2012 to 2016, the most recent year available.Ellen Baer, the president of the Hudson Square Business Improvement District, came up with the idea for pedestrian managers in 2011, after seeing traffic managers expertly move people around a construction site at the World Trade Center. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is change the focus from cars to people, and put people first,\u201d Ms. Baer said.Now, the business district has expanded the operation from three weeknights to every weeknight, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., when outbound tunnel traffic jams the streets. (Incoming tunnel traffic enters Manhattan elsewhere.)Up to nine pedestrian managers are on duty, often with two at a time in the busiest intersections. It costs $300,000 a year, or as much as other neighborhoods spend on street cleaning and trash pickups. The pedestrian managers are paid $22 to $25 an hour.Ms. Baer calls them \u201cpedestrian safety and sanity managers\u201d because they improve the quality of life. They unblock crosswalks and intersections, deter jaywalking and even help to lessen honking. And they keep people safe; no injuries have been reported while they have been on duty, she added.Though pedestrians come first, Mr. Martin, 49, has also talked down irate drivers stuck in gridlock. He leans over to chat about local sports teams. He listens to their woes. They have somewhere else to be. They are going to miss a flight. One man said he had to get to his pregnant wife.While Hudson Square is the only city neighborhood with pedestrian managers stationed at intersections, they are also used on a limited basis near construction sites, shopping malls and the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.Other neighborhoods, Ms. Baer said, have expressed interest in starting similar operations.The city\u2019s Transportation Department requires pedestrian traffic managers to have at least five years\u2019 experience working in law enforcement or in directing traffic and pedestrians at construction sites, and to receive specialized training.The pedestrian managers in Hudson Square complete a two-day safety course, which reviews traffic rules, verbal commands and hand motions and gives pointers on avoiding being drawn into arguments. Then they are sent into traffic for on-the-job training.Carl Vitale, who teaches the safety course, said some people have dropped out when they realize just what the job demands. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everyone,\u201d he said.Michael Gary, 59, a pedestrian safety manager in Hudson Square who lives in East Harlem, said he liked helping people and had rescued pedestrians from close calls at least three or four times a week. \u201cThere\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d he said.There is no excuse for not seeing the pedestrian managers in their glow-in-the-dark yellow jackets. Mr. Martin joked: \u201cI\u2019m a human highlighter.\u201dMany pedestrians said they were less worried having the pedestrian managers there as an extra layer between them and cars.\u201cYou just know that cars are going to stop when they see the yellow jackets,\u201d said Karen Sweeney, 63, an administrative assistant who would like to see them in other neighborhoods.Other pedestrians said they helped ensure a clear path across, took away the uncertainty of whether or not there was enough time to cross, and brought order to crosswalks that could turn chaotic.Even some drivers approve. \u201cI like that they\u2019re around and help move the traffic,\u201d said Anthony Pignalosa, 33, a security officer who was picking up his wife from work.Still, some pedestrians and drivers have questioned whether these monitors are really necessary. \u201cThe traffic is still the same. It\u2019s not like the traffic has improved,\u201d said Evita Gossai, 35, an accountant who added that the walk light was sufficient.Mr. Martin has his own system for keeping pedestrians safe. When there are four seconds left on the walk light, he walks back toward the curb and waves pedestrians back. Most listen, he said, but a few do not. They dart past him. He follows to make sure they make it across.When things get ugly, the thanks from pedestrians are what keep him going. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our regulars,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really eases the pain out here.\u201dEvery time one local businessman crosses, he bumps fists with Mr. Martin. A 2-year-old girl he calls \u201cthe first lady of Spring Street\u201d smiles and waves, and presented him with chocolate eggs for Easter.And there is Rachelle Fernandez, 34, of Queens, who is blind and uses a walking stick. They met a year ago, and now walk together most nights. \u201cHe does a very good job,\u201d she said.Ms. Fernandez showed up recently holding onto a friend. Mr. Martin protested, no, no, that was his job. She took his arm.\u201cIt takes no effort for me to get her across safely,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel I need to get her across the street.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On their Instagram accounts, the group\u2019s adherents post pictures of roaming through Thailand on a Tuesday or sailing the Caribbean. Many of the people chasing FIRE, whose lifestyle combines living on less, earning more and saving as much as they need for the rest of their lives as soon as possible, are driven by a desire to see the world, so the community is a wealth of information about how to do just that, even if you have a still have a day job.When he knew he wanted to go to Greece, he first priced flights on traditional travel sites to get a sense of how much it would cost to pay cash, which might be a better deal than paying with points.He compared the costs of flights in dollars and points. If he found, for example, a flight for $600 or 60,000 points, cash would be the better option. He divides the cost in dollars by the cost in points, and if the result is less than 2 cents a point, he\u2019s unlikely to go for the deal.Maximizing rewards requires understanding the system, which can be complicated. \u201cIt does require some level of organization, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d said Mr. Barrett, a retired C.P.A. \u201cYou have all these logins, you have these credit cards and you have to spend a certain amount.\u201dAnd Mr. Barrett, who lives in Richmond, Va., said a financial background was not required. \u201cAnybody could do this. Anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m loosely organized and I\u2019m somewhat aware, I can take one to two free vacations a year. To me, that\u2019s just such an obvious choice.\u201dBut, he cautions, the game is not for everyone.\u201cClearly, anyone who has issues paying their credit cards on time or in full every single month should steer as far from this as they possibly can.\u201dSylvia Hall says she hasn\u2019t paid for a hotel room in five years. The 38-year-old Seattle resident, who could afford to retire today if she\u2019d like to, is working a few more years, just in case. She uses strategies to stay for free, as she just did for a week in the Dominican Republic.\u201cHotels are different from flights because there are different systems you can work to get deals on hotels,\u201d Ms. Hall said. \u201cThe three strategies are points, free nights or cash back.\u201dFirst, she often redeems points from the 11 credit cards she has open. As with flights, you can redeem points for hotels, but some companies have direct partnerships allowing you to transfer points to hotels for better deals. For example, some of Capital One\u2019s cards offer 10 times the points if you book at their partner site on hotels.com.Ms. Hall, who is happy to fly coach and stay free in modest hotels, said she looked for the best deal.\u201cThe workhorses on free stays are my Chase cards, IHG cards and my hotel-branded cards,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sort of brand agnostic. I just go where I can go for free.\u201dPart of what made her Dominican Republic trip free was paying quarterly estimated taxes from her work as a self-employed lawyer by using a credit card through the site plastiq.com, which allows users to pay with a card any bill that accepts a check or bank transfer. It does so for a fee of 2.5 percent, so you have to make sure paying that fee is worth it. For Ms. Hall, it was, because she got enough cash back to cover her full stay at the resort including the $60 daily food and drink fee. As someone pursuing FIRE, she usually feeds herself on about $65 a month.\u201cI was like, wow, every day is like my monthly budget,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to know that part of why you save money for one thing is so you can spend it on something else,\u201d she said \u201cIt helps to just get a good deal on your flight and your room so that you know when a mango is five bucks, you can roll with it.\u201dAfter flying more than a million miles, she said, \u201cThe stuff that I really have down is about being opportunistic and thinking about timing.\u201dTo travel this winter, she and her husband looked at Google Flights for opportunities from their home airport in Reno, Nev., to almost anywhere in the world, and found a flight to France for about $700 per person. Their rental car for 15 days of the 22-day trip cost $300, \u201cwhich is kind of unheard of,\u201d Ms. Hester said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that deal in peak season. It\u2019d be like four times that.\u201dOver all, she said, if you can find a time you can go when most people won\u2019t and be open to visiting places you hadn\u2019t thought of, you can save 30 percent to 50 percent on your trip. Ms. Hester and her husband visited Taipei, Taiwan, in January and Tokyo in February last year.And there\u2019s an added bonus: the joy of being free from crowds.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing I just can\u2019t overstate the value of: being able to enjoy things in peace instead of fighting to see the Mona Lisa through a crowd of 800 people,\u201d Ms. Hester said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way nicer way to travel.\u201dWhen she travels, she takes public transportation or walks and, rather than looking to guidebooks for restaurants, she finds unassuming places where locals gather. Lunchtime often finds her in a grocery store, enjoying the game of trying to figure out what everything is in the local language.\u201cI love strolling a city, walk around, getting coffee, strolling some more, getting a glass of wine,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more interesting, I think; you get to experience it like a local, and it\u2019s so much cheaper.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The internet company\u2019s push into one of Manhattan\u2019s most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of New York\u2019s biggest occupants of office space, allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than 14,000 over the next decade.\u201cLaw, medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at New York University who studies the city\u2019s economy.The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John\u2019s Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet.Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.Other big tech companies quickly followed. Amazon and Facebook each now have more than 2,000 employees in New York, while Apple and Salesforce each employ more than 1,000. LinkedIn has a large office in the Empire State Building, and IBM chose New York as the base for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Since 2009, jobs in tech and advertising in New York have increased 31 percent to 360,600, while financial-services jobs in the city increased about 12 percent to 475,500, according to an analysis of federal data by Ken McCarthy, principal economist at the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. By contrast, the education and health sectors employ about one million people in New York, while the hospitality industry employs 465,800, according to his analysis.Mr. McCarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer, meaning any bank employee is counted as finance. But New York\u2019s traditional industries \u2014 banking, retailing and consulting \u2014 have also added thousands of tech jobs. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers, including many in new fields like data science, blockchain and machine learning.And New York\u2019s tech sector is accelerating. Over the past year, the share of New York postings on the job site Indeed increased nearly 13 percent for tech jobs and just 2 percent for finance and accounting jobs. About 5 percent of all New York jobs posted on Indeed are now tech related, the site said, compared with 3 percent for finance and accounting.That growth has made San Francisco, which is a gateway to Silicon Valley, a sort of sister city to New York. As a result, the air route between them is one of the nation\u2019s most competitive and heavily trafficked.\u201cThere is more economic connectivity between New York and San Francisco than between New York and any of the declining upstate cities,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Google has expanded quietly and has not asked for public subsidies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government,\u201d William Floyd, Google\u2019s head of external affairs in New York said this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it by the dint our own work.\u201dAnd some in Manhattan are wary that Google and other businesses will begin to spread into historic neighborhoods.\u201cMy concern is that with Google\u2019s concentration in that area, it\u2019s going to pull in even more intense pressure for office development, particularly tech office development, in adjacent neighborhoods like the Village and East Village, where we are seeing it happen already,\u201d said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.Mr. Berman said he did not oppose Google\u2019s expansion in Hudson Square, which in the past decade has transformed into a commercial district, with many of its lofts and factories converted to offices for more than 1,000 companies, many in technology, advertising and media. Today, more than 50,000 people work in the neighborhood, and thousands more have made their home there following a 2013 city rezoning that allowed residential development.But Mr. Berman said the growing demand for offices has led to the demolition of historic buildings, pushed out longtime businesses and residents, and resulted in modern office towers that are out of character with the rest of the neighborhood.Chelsea has also witnessed rapid development over the past decade as it has mostly shed its working class roots and identity as a hub of gay night life. It still maintains large public housing projects, but is dotted with art galleries, new condominiums and expensive restaurants.In response, Google invested in local nonprofit organizations and said it would pay for a ferry stop at Pier 57, where it is renting office space, earning some plaudits from local elected officials.\u201cIn terms of buying the new buildings, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not chasing anyone out,\u201d said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been awfully good neighbors in Chelsea.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting from New York, and Ed Shanahan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Homegrown Chips Threaten Silicon Valley Giant Intel", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips.Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world.Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker.Intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends, from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence, as influence over chip designs has been shifting to Amazon, Apple and Google, which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry.The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn\u2019t had much competition in the server market in recent years. The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options.Intel acknowledges that companies like Amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier. \u201cI am not unaware of the dynamic,\u201d Lisa Spelman, an Intel vice president, said. \u201cOur goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire.\u201dAbout 35 percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about 10 companies, including large internet companies like Amazon and a handful of telecommunication firms, said Shane Rau, a chip analyst with the research firm IDC. That just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for Intel.\u201cEach one of these companies is so large, they represent a market unto themselves,\u201d Mr. Rau said.Apple beat the other tech giants to this cost-saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom-built chip for the iPhone. Google and Microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.Amazon has upped the ante. In 2015, it spent a reported $350 million to acquire a chip maker, Annapurna Labs, which helped build the new central processing unit, or C.P.U.A C.P.U. \u2014 the centerpiece of a computer\u2019s operations \u2014 is the sort of chip that Intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers. Building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. It is a big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks.\u201cThe belief was that you needed some magic to build a processor, particularly a server processor,\u201d said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the chip start-up Cerebras and a former executive at the chip maker AMD. \u201cYou had to be Intel or AMD \u2014 and that was about it.\u201dAmazon executives believe the chip, which was designed to be more energy efficient, will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers. It said it was offering a cloud-computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip. The cost of the service could be 45 percent lower than other options.And when Amazon buys chips from other companies, a homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices. \u201cThey can now say to Intel, \u2018We will just move the workloads to other chips,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feldman said.Though it is still enormously difficult, building a chip is easier than it used to be. Amazon licensed much of the technology from ARM, the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips. It made the chip through TSMC, a Taiwanese company.For Intel, Amazon\u2019s move into C.P.U.s is a strike at a longtime strength. Intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market a decade ago, a significant missed opportunity. The tech industry shifted, and Intel didn\u2019t shift with it.But Intel has a 96.6 percent share of server chip sales, according to IDC. It was 98.6 percent until its longtime competitor, AMD, which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about a decade, recently re-entered the market.Intel\u2019s profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry. But the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker\u2019s dependence on servers. Intel\u2019s data center group, which sells both server and A.I. chips, pulled in $6.1 billion, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The group now accounts for more than 30 percent of Intel\u2019s revenue.As the chip market has changed, Intel has tried to diversify. In recent years, it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones, cars and data centers.Through their fast-growing cloud computing services, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks. Going to a cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back-room computer systems \u2014 the tech experts do it for them.It is a lucrative business. Amazon Web Services brings in nearly $27 billion a year, and it accounts for 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s profits.Inside these cloud operations, the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built. They are designing much of their own hardware, from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers. Facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers.Amazon\u2019s new chip is running only a small fraction of the software across the company\u2019s online empire. But that is expected to expand.\u201cWe will look back at this as a watershed moment,\u201d said Mr. Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "H.E.R. Slips Out from the Shadows With Five Grammy Nominations", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byH.E.R. \u2014 the stage name of the R&B singer who earned a star-making five Grammy nominations Friday morning \u2014 stands for \u201chaving everything revealed.\u201d In fact, the 21-year-old songwriter and multi-instrumentalist behind the project, Gabriella Wilson, is notable for her lack of exposure: For years, she\u2019s played the enigmatic artist, \u00e0 la the Weeknd\u2019s early rise, hiding her face and insisting on letting the music speak loudest.On Friday morning, after a tour stop Thursday night in Houston, Wilson spoke to The New York Times about breaking through, the power of playlists and how she learned about her Grammy nominations. Though she sounded surprisingly Zen over the phone, the singer insisted: \u201cI\u2019m really not calm at all.\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Congratulations on your nominations. Where were you when you found out the news, and how long did it take to feel real?I\u2019ve got to tell you the story because it\u2019s actually hilarious. It\u2019s 7 in the morning and I get a call from my tour manager saying, \u201cEverybody needs to come to your room, we need to have a meeting, the tour might be canceled, it\u2019s an emergency.\u201dHe tried to make a big thing, telling everyone the tour might be canceled \u201cbecause \u2026 you\u2019re nominated for five Grammys!\u201d I started bugging out, going crazy and we\u2019re all just celebrating. A few of us started crying. I didn\u2019t know how to take it. It just felt so surreal. Five! Not even just one. It\u2019s such a big deal.How did you sleep last night knowing the nominations were coming?I didn\u2019t think about it. I\u2019ve actually been sick for the past few days and kind of down, trying to push through the shows. That was the last thing I was thinking about. But it just made everything better.Mystery and anonymity have been part of your brand up to this point \u2014 you perform in big sunglasses and don\u2019t like to discuss your biography. Are you ready for the spotlight that comes with being a five-time Grammy nominee?I guess so [laughs]. It\u2019s organically happening and I think I did exactly what I wanted to do, considering the five Grammy nominations. People are focused on the music and that was what was most important to me \u2014 people appreciating my art above all things. It was God\u2019s plan and everything worked out in my favor.Do you think you\u2019ll wear sunglasses to the show?Probably! [laughs]How would you describe the H.E.R. project to the people who might be running to Google this morning?Man, first of all, it\u2019s an EP project, not even a real album yet. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s musical, but also this new R&B sound. Lyrically, it\u2019s real and true to me, and I\u2019ve experienced so much. But it\u2019s true to so many other women. It\u2019s honest.Like SZA or Lauryn Hill before her, your songs seem to connect with women of your generation. Do you think of yourself as part of a movement with the other women nominated today, from Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Cardi B to people like Brandi Carlile or Kacey Musgraves?Absolutely. It\u2019s girl power, you know? The recognition is dope. It\u2019s empowering to see how many talented women there are, especially right now.As a black woman in a genre like R&B, how have you thought about the way the Grammys recognize your culture and community before today? Obviously there have been a lot of conversations about diversity and inclusion the last few years; do you see these nominations as a step in the right direction?Absolutely. But number one: We\u2019re taking it. As a black woman, I\u2019ve always had to work hard to earn my respect as a musician \u2014 and as a young woman, too. As a writer, in certain sessions or certain rooms people think, \u201cWho\u2019s kid is this? Who\u2019s this little girl?\u201d I\u2019ve had to prove myself. It\u2019s unfortunate sometimes that we have to work twice as hard, but we\u2019re taking it now and we\u2019re empowering each other. The diversity is great, but it\u2019s about that, \u201cI don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going against the grain, it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in the way\u201d mentality.I don\u2019t feel much pressure, honestly. Being nominated for five Grammys with an EP \u2014 and nobody knows what I look like \u2014 that\u2019s already enough of a statement. A lot of women need to know that they don\u2019t have to conform, they don\u2019t have to take no for an answer.You also come from a streaming background \u2014 building buzz and a fan base on SoundCloud more than, say, the radio. Do you think the industry is catching up to these scenes?Oh, absolutely. I\u2019m selling out every single one of my shows on this tour \u2014 3,000, 4,000 people a night \u2014 with no radio single. I think sometimes we build a stronger base when it comes to streaming. People are singing all the words to every song. That\u2019s how we receive music nowadays \u2014 it\u2019s Apple Music, it\u2019s YouTube, Tidal, whatever. It\u2019s playlists. Being put on those playlists is more important than being put on the radio. Some people can have a No. 1, but can\u2019t sell 200 tickets. It\u2019s really powerful to have a strong base that genuinely loves the music and plays it over and over again.Even though you\u2019re a newcomer to the Grammys, you\u2019ve been training and playing music professionally since you were a child. Were you the type to practice your Grammy performance or acceptance speech into a hairbrush or did you not even let yourself imagine a moment like this?Hell yeah \u2014 I was that kid! I would not be able to sleep at night and I would practice my Grammys speech. That was definitely me. Maybe I spoke it into existence.Any big plans you\u2019ve had in the back of your mind for the ceremony in February?Man, I don\u2019t know! I\u2019m making them now. I\u2019m just so excited and overwhelmed. Ask me tomorrow.Advertisement"}

Year after year, I watch in dismay as students obsess over getting straight A\u2019s. Some sacrifice their health; a few have even tried to sue their school after falling short. All have joined the cult of perfectionism out of a conviction that top marks are a ticket to elite graduate schools and lucrative job offers. I was one of them.

But I was wrong.[Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.]Straight-A students also miss out socially.

{"Headline": "New Life for Old Classics, as Their Copyrights Run Out", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a century ago, the publisher Alfred A. Knopf released a slim book of spiritual fables by an obscure Lebanese-American poet and painter named Kahlil Gibran.Knopf had modest expectations, and printed around 1,500 copies. Much to his surprise, the book \u2014 titled \u201cThe Prophet\u201d \u2014 took off. It became a huge hit, and went on to sell more than nine million copies in North America alone.Until now, the publishing house that still bears Knopf\u2019s name has held the North American copyright on the title. But that will change on Jan. 1, when \u201cThe Prophet\u201d enters the public domain, along with works by thousands of other artists and writers, including Marcel Proust, Willa Cather, D. H. Lawrence, Agatha Christie, Joseph Conrad, Edith Wharton, P. G. Wodehouse, Rudyard Kipling, Katherine Mansfield, Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens.This coming year marks the first time in two decades that a large body of copyrighted works will lose their protected status \u2014 a shift that will have profound consequences for publishers and literary estates, which stand to lose both money and creative control.But it will also be a boon for readers, who will have more editions to choose from, and for writers and other artists who can create new works based on classic stories without getting hit with an intellectual property lawsuit.\u201cBooks are going to be available in a much wider variety now, and they\u2019re going to be cheaper,\u201d said Imke Reimers, an assistant professor of economics at Northeastern University who has studied the impact of copyright. \u201cConsumers and readers are definitely going to benefit from this.\u201dThe sudden deluge of available works traces back to legislation Congress passed in 1998, which extended copyright protections by 20 years. The law reset the copyright term for works published from 1923 to 1977 \u2014 lengthening it from 75 years to 95 years after publication \u2014 essentially freezing their protected status. (The law is often referred to by skeptics as the \u201cMickey Mouse Protection Act,\u201d since it has kept \u201cSteamboat Willie,\u201d the first Disney film featuring Mickey, under copyright until 2024.)Now that the term extension has run out, the spigot has been turned back on. Each January will bring a fresh crop of novels, plays, music and movies into the public domain. Over the next few years, the impact will be particularly dramatic, in part because the 1920s were such a fertile and experimental period for Western literature, with the rise of masters like F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and Virginia Woolf.\u201cEventually, these books belong to the people,\u201d said James L. W. West III, a Fitzgerald scholar. \u201cWe can have new attempts to edit and reinterpret all of these iconic texts.\u201dOnce books become part of the public domain, anyone can sell a digital, audio or print edition on Amazon. Fans can publish and sell their own sequels and spinoffs, or release irreverent monster mash-ups like the 2009 best-seller \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies.\u201dTheater and film producers can adapt the works into movies, plays and musicals without having to secure rights. Rival publishing houses can issue new print editions, and scholars can publish new annotated versions and interpretations. Free digital copies will circulate online. At the start of the new year, Google Books, which has more than 30 million works scanned in its vast online digital library, will release full digital editions of works published in 1923, among them Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019s \u201cTarzan and the Golden Lion\u201d and Edith Wharton\u2019s \u201cA Son at the Front.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to say exactly how many works will enter the public domain this January, because some authors and publishers allowed their copyright to lapse, and some foreign-language books first published overseas in 1923 may remain under copyright for now, like Felix Salten\u2019s \u201cBambi.\u201d More than 130,000 copyright registrations were filed in 1923 for various creative works, but most of those were not renewed, according to John Mark Ockerbloom, a digital library strategist at the University of Pennsylvania.Some publishers and the writers\u2019 heirs fear that losing copyright protections will lead to inferior editions with typos and other errors, and to derivative works that damage the integrity of iconic stories.\u201cPublishers are right to be concerned about a proliferation of unreliable editions, some of them probably not very good,\u201d said John Kulka, the editorial director of Library of America, a nonprofit organization that publishes American literary classics.Still, many scholars and legal experts argue that American copyright law, which is mind-numbingly complex, has skewed toward enriching companies and the heirs of writers and artists at the expense of the public. When the first Copyright Act was passed in the United States in 1790, the maximum term was 28 years. Over the decades, lawmakers repeatedly prolonged the terms, which now stretch to over a century for many works. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than the tax code,\u201d said Rebecca Tushnet, an intellectual property expert at Harvard Law School. \u201cThe copyright term is way too long now.\u201dFor readers and book buyers, the proliferation of competing texts and editions will mean more selection and cheaper books. In 2019, the digital publisher Open Road Media is publishing around a dozen newly available works from 1923, including e-books of Jean Toomer\u2019s \u201cCane,\u201d Gibran\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet,\u201d Sigmund Freud\u2019s \u201cThe Ego and the Id,\u201d P. G. Wodehouse\u2019s \u201cThe Inimitable Jeeves\u201d and Christie\u2019s \u201cThe Murder on the Links,\u201d one of her early novels featuring the detective Hercule Poirot.Blake Hazard, Fitzgerald\u2019s great-granddaughter and a trustee of his estate, said she hoped some interesting new interpretations of the story would emerge. But she also worries about what would happen to the novel\u2019s legacy when the inevitable homages and retellings land, which will probably include unauthorized Gatsby sequels or novels told from Daisy Buchanan\u2019s perspective.\u201cI hope people maybe will be energized to do something original with the work, but of course the fear is that there will be some degradation of the text,\u201d Ms. Hazard said.But publishers who specialize in classics see a tremendous opportunity to reintroduce old works. Some have been planning for this moment for decades.Penguin Classics had a number of 1923 titles lined up for 1998, when the copyright for books published that year was set to lapse, but those plans were scrapped after Congress extended protections. About three years ago, Penguin\u2019s editorial team went back to their list of 1923 titles and began looking for classics that still resonate and sell well. Several jumped out, including \u201cThe Prophet.\u201dJohn Siciliano, the executive editor of Penguin Classics, wanted something to distinguish its edition of \u201cThe Prophet\u201d from the others, so he decided to commission a new introduction from a contemporary poet.\u201cI\u2019d been thinking of who the perfect person would be, someone like Kahlil Gibran, a poet with mass appeal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt became obvious that Rupi Kaur was the one.\u201d\u201cHaving multiple editions of these works and renewed publication energy behind them enlarges the market rather than cannibalizing it,\u201d Mr. Siciliano said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to breathe new life into these works.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also says some apps include risky or inappropriate content, citing Ear Doctor Clinic Kids Games, an app that \u201ctells children to use scissors to cut the hair around and inside an infected ear,\u201d the complaint said.

{"Headline": "Marketing Through Smart Speakers? Brands Don\u2019t Need to Be Asked Twice", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeading into last year\u2019s holidays, marketers at HBO were eagerly experimenting with how to use technology like augmented reality and virtual reality to promote their shows. But then, celebrating with their families across the country, they watched as everyone from children to elderly aunts unwrapped smart speakers from Google and Amazon and started barking orders.When they got back to work, the marketers had a new priority: Figure out how HBO, whose product lives on screens, could create a space for itself in the world of voice.\u201cWe saw, partly because Amazon discounted the devices so deeply, that they exploded,\u201d said Sabrina Caluori, HBO\u2019s senior vice president of digital and social marketing. \u201cVery quickly, we realized that we really needed to dig in.\u201dUnilever has created a recipes skill under its Hellmann\u2019s label, while Procter & Gamble has introduced features from Tide and Oral-B. Those using the Tide application can ask Alexa how to remove juice or grass stains from clothing, while Oral-B\u2019s offers a tooth-brushing timer.On Google Home, where the term \u201cskills\u201d is replaced by \u201cactions,\u201d Est\u00e9e Lauder has one for personalized beauty advice and Disney has some games for children.\u201cWe\u2019ve hit the point where the majority of our clients are now asking us for help with a voice strategy,\u201d said Abbey Klaassen, president in New York of the agency 360i, which works with HBO. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from an interesting kind of experiment to something they have recognized that they need to invest in to make sure they are discoverable and relevant in the next five years.\u201d\u201cThey have a vested interest in making sure brands are creating quality voice experiences and not a lot that will drive people crazy,\u201d Ms. Klaassen said.\u201cWe\u2019re used to thinking about the elements of the book that we make available for people to sample to get a sense of it,\u201d said Rebecca Ikin, a marketing director at Cornerstone, a division of the publisher. \u201cThis is taking that principle and applying it to smart speakers.\u201dLike HBO, Ms. Ikin said her team had explored the idea after seeing the boom in interest in the devices last holiday season.Ms. Caluori of HBO said creating the applications could be complex and time intensive, noting that more than 100 people worked on the \u201cWestworld\u201d skill, which was made for a niche audience. But she said less help from outside partners was likely to be needed in the future as the work became an \u201congoing evergreen capability.\u201d\"We feel like this voice-based interaction is not going away,\u201d Ms. Caluori said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting with speakers, but it\u2019ll very quickly be TVs and cars and all these other places.\u201dThe \u201cEsme & Roy\u201d skill, which was created with Sesame Workshop, showed the potential for smart speakers with children and their parents. Amazon has been seeking child-friendly voice applications, particularly now that it sells an Echo device meant for children, Ms. Caluori said. At the same time, she said, young parents such as herself are keen on smart speakers, partly because they\u2019re a screen-free alternative to tablets and phones.Once the game is opened, children can use the speaker to play along with show\u2019s two main characters. They can answer questions to \u201ctravel\u201d to places like space or underwater, and can jump around while listening to its cues.\u201cThis experience stands alone, even if you don\u2019t know the show,\u201d Ms. Caluori said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for kid-friendly skills in your home, it may be a way to introduce your children to the characters, and that then helps you potentially try out the show.\u201dDanielle Reubenstein, executive creative director in the mobile division of the ad agency Possible, said she had been urging brands to view smart speakers as a way to connect with people rather than as a means to sell products \u2014 at least for now.\u201cIt\u2019s not a super-duper e-commerce platform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having your customers interact with you in a way that\u2019s going to make them more loyal to your product.\u201dMs. Reubenstein said her firm typically got basic data on which questions to Alexa were completed or not. But once, in a meeting with Amazon, the firm briefly got a deeper look, seeing snippets of queries for one client\u2019s Alexa skill that showed how customers can still be easily frustrated when navigating a voice application.\u201cWe started seeing a lot of cuss words in the user flow,\u201d said Ms. Reubenstein, who declined to name the client. She said they were able to identify at what point most users were getting frustrated and adjusted the skill to address the issue.These are still early days for marketing on voice devices. Ms. Reubenstein compared it to when brands began making apps for mobile devices. But over time, she said, voice interactions will begin to replace many of the activities that people are conducting on screens.\u201cAll of it is really a down payment on being able to use those technologies in the future,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Tech Too Easy to Use?", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSeven years ago, a younger and more carefree Mark Zuckerberg went onstage at Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference and announced a major change to the social network\u2019s design.\u201cFrom here on out, it\u2019s a frictionless experience,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Of all the buzzwords in tech, perhaps none has been deployed with as much philosophical conviction as \u201cfrictionless.\u201d Over the past decade or so, eliminating \u201cfriction\u201d \u2014 the name given to any quality that makes a product more difficult or time-consuming to use \u2014 has become an obsession of the tech industry, accepted as gospel by many of the world\u2019s largest companies.Airbnb, Uber and hundreds of other start-ups have made billions of dollars by reducing the effort needed to rent rooms, hail taxis and complete other annoying tasks. And when a company fails, excessive friction is often cited as the reason.There is nothing wrong with making things easier, in most cases, and the history of technology is filled with examples of amazing advances brought about by reducing complexity. Not even the most hardened Luddite, I suspect, wants to go back to the days of horse-drawn carriages and hand-crank radios.Over the past several weeks, I\u2019ve spoken to more than a dozen designers, product managers and tech executives about the principles of frictionless design. Many said that while making products easier to use was usually good, there were cases where friction could be useful in preventing harm, and steering users toward healthier behavior.Bobby Goodlatte, a former Facebook designer who is now an angel investor, told me that the tech industry\u2019s culture of optimization \u201cpresumes that reducing friction is virtuous unto itself.\u201d\u201cIt leads us to ask, \u2018Can we?\u2019 \u2014 never \u2018Should we?\u2019\u201d he said.Several people praised the Time Well Spent movement spearheaded by Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, as a kind of pro-friction cohort within the tech industry. Among other things, the group has successfully pressured companies like Facebook and Apple to take steps to curb tech addiction by including features that encourage users to limit their screen time.And a few lamented that in the tech industry\u2019s race for convenience, something important had been lost.\u201cWe wanted to juice engagement and therefore made things as frictionless as possible,\u201d said Jenna Bilotta, a design manager who has worked at Google. \u201cWe made a whole world of the literal \u2018least you could do\u2019 apps, and it\u2019s trashing people\u2019s mental health.\u201dOften, invoking the concept of friction is a useful way to obscure some larger, less savory goal. For Facebook, \u201cfrictionless sharing\u201d was a thinly veiled cover for the company\u2019s true goal of getting users to post more often, and increasing the amount of data available for ad targeting. For YouTube, auto-playing videos have sharply increased view time, thereby increasing the platform\u2019s profitability. And for Amazon, tools like one-click ordering have created a stunningly efficient machine for commerce and consumption.\u201cOur current application of tech has been to take something hard and make it easy,\u201d said Harper Reed, an engineer and the chief technology officer for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.When tech companies do make their products harder to use, it\u2019s generally to secure them from hackers, spammers or other malicious actors. (Think of the security Captchas that require users to solve math problems or pick out photos of traffic lights, or the way YouTube requires new users to verify their phone numbers before uploading videos longer than 15 minutes.)More of these kinds of changes would be welcome, even if they led to a short-term hit to engagement. And there are plenty of possibilities.What if Facebook made it harder for viral misinformation to spread by adding algorithmic \u201cspeed bumps\u201d that would delay the spread of a controversial post above a certain threshold until fact checkers evaluated it?Or if YouTube gave users a choice between two videos when their video finished, instead of auto-playing the next recommendation?Or if Twitter discouraged abusive pile-ons by making it harder for people who haven\u2019t followed an account for a set number of days to reply to that account\u2019s tweets?This approach might seem overly paternalistic. But the alternative \u2014 a tech infrastructure optimized to ask as little of us as possible, with few circuit breakers to limit the impact of abuse and addiction \u2014 is frightening. After all, \u201cfriction\u201d is just another word for \u201ceffort,\u201d and it\u2019s what makes us capable of critical thought and self-reflection. Without it, we would be the blob people from \u201cWall-E,\u201d sucking down Soylent while watching Netflix on our self-driving recliners.\u201cImagine you run a social network and you\u2019re trying to aggregate all the trending stories based on what all users are clicking,\u201d Mr. Harris, the Time Well Spent founder, told me recently. \u201cWould you prefer to jack the plug into each person\u2019s reptilian brain to aggregate those stories, or would you prefer to jack the plug into their calm, reflective brain that is considering the consequences downstream?\u201dThere may even be a business case for complexity.Consider what happened to Tulerie, a New York start-up that makes a platform that allows women to share designer clothing.Tulerie\u2019s co-founder Merri Smith told me a fascinating story from the company\u2019s early days. In the beginning, Ms. Smith said, the company invited women to join via a brief Google survey, which it emailed to hundreds of prospective members.\u201cWe wanted to create as little friction as possible, while still having to vet these people,\u201d she said.But only one person filled out the survey. So Ms. Smith and her co-founder decided to try a more complicated approach. Anyone who wanted to join had to conduct a brief video call with a company employee first.Logically, the new strategy should have failed. But it was a huge hit. Prospective members flooded the invite list, filling up the company\u2019s interview schedule weeks in advance. By creating a more complex sign-up, Tulerie had signalled that its service was special and worth the effort.\u201cIt goes back to values,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cPeople perceive it as harder to get into, and they want to be a part of it.\u201dI don\u2019t want to romanticize the slow, often frustrating processes of the past. There is nothing inherently good about complexity, and the tech industry could still do a lot of good by reducing friction in systems like health care, education and financial services.But there are both philosophical and practical reasons to ask whether certain technologies should be a little less optimized for convenience. We wouldn\u2019t trust a doctor who made speed a priority over safety. Why would we trust an app that does?Advertisement"}

The rout in junk bonds makes it more expensive for financially fragile businesses to borrow. The collapse in crude oil prices discourages new investment and hiring in the oil patch, which has been a source of job growth.In that sense, the markets are both a gauge of what investors expect to happen in the economy, and a potential catalyst for their decisions. The mood in the financial markets ultimately feeds into spending by companies and consumers, and if they pull back, based on panicky ups and downs, growth could suffer.Amazon may be rushing to set up huge offices in New York, but Google seems to think that slow and steady is the best approach.\u2022 \u201cAccusations of hidden pay and lavish spending on the company dime were intertwined with a deep sense of discontent over Mr. Ghosn\u2019s long reign over the automaker.\u201d\u2022 \u201cNissan employees had groused that Nissan profits were propping up Renault, and many feared Mr. Ghosn was preparing a Renault takeover of its bigger Japanese partner.\u201d\u2022 \u201cFor months, a group of Nissan executives secretly gathered information on Mr. Ghosn, laying the groundwork for a Nov. 19 strike against the executive and a top aide, Greg Kelly.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe maneuvering allowed Japanese prosecutors to swiftly arrest both men, then raid company offices and his Tokyo apartment in the space of hours, say people familiar with the events.\u201dCentral banks already do stress tests of big financial institutions, to measure the lenders\u2019 ability to withstand major financial crises.

{"Headline": "\u2018Gremlins\u2019 (1984) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.THE star of \u201cGremlins\u201d is none of the perfectly adequate actors in the cast but the mogwai, a small, furry, fictitious creature that looks something like a cuddly teddy bear with the ears of a rabbit, a Bambilike nose, eyes as round and deep and dark as glass buttons, a sweet disposition and a physical nature more unstable than hydrogen gas.At the beginning of the film, when Rand Peltzer, an unsuccessful inventor, buys a mogwai in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown as a Christmas present for his family, he is warned to keep the creature away from direct light, never to allow it to have contact with water and, above all, never feed it after midnight. Bluebeard\u2019s instructions to his foolish wives couldn\u2019t have been any more specific.Rand returns home to Kingston Falls, U.S.A., a perfect movie set of a town, where the plastic snow never melts and where, you can be sure, they start playing Christmas carols the day after the Fourth of July. In this comically idealized setting, it\u2019s just a matter of time before each of the mogwai prohibitions has been broken, with grotesque results that nearly destroy Kingston Falls as well as the movie.\u201cGremlins,\u201d which opens today at the Warner and other theaters, was produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Joe Dante, who was responsible for \u201cIt\u2019s a Good Life,\u201d one of the better episodes in \u201cTwilight Zone - the Movie.\u201d This is pretty much the same relationship that Mr. Spielberg, usually a director (\u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d), had to \u201cPoltergeist,\u201d the classic spook movie he produced with Tobe Hooper as director.\u201cGremlins,\u201d however, has a very different character, being a wiseacre mixture of movie-buff jokes, movie genres and movie sensibilities. It\u2019s as schizoid as the mogwai, which, having been fed after midnight, suddenly reproduces itself, but not in its own sweet, cuddly image, but as dozens of small, demonic creatures - the gremlins of the title.These second-generation mogwais, which look like the imps of Hieronymous Bosch, are at first funny, having as their only goal the pursuit of mindless mischief. They\u2019re neither good nor bad, just self-absorbed. Then, however, they turn seriously mean. At which point \u201cGremlins\u201d explodes in an orgy of special effects, which should scare the wits out of very small children for whom, I assume, the movie was made.Both Mr. Dante and Chris Columbus, who wrote the screenplay, have antic senses of humor, but they are unreliable. They attack their young audience as mercilessly as the creatures attack the characters. One minute they\u2019re fondly recalling Frank Capra\u2019s sentimental classic, \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d and the next minute they\u2019re subjecting this Capraesque Smalltown, U.S.A., to a devastation that makes the original \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers\u201d look benign.I\u2019ve no idea how children will react to the sight of a Kingston Falls mom, carving knife in hand, decapitating one gremlin and shoving another into the food processor, head first. Will they laugh when Billy Peltzer, the film\u2019s idealized, intentionally dopey, 20-year-old hero, is threatened by a gremlin with a chainsaw and then stabbed by a gremlin with a spear gun? Will they cheer when Billy blows up the Kingston Falls movie theater, where the gremlins, now resembling an average kiddie matinee crowd, are exuberantly responding to \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d?\u201cGremlins\u201d is far more interested in showing off its knowledge of movie lore and making random jokes than in providing consistent entertainment.Unfortunately, it\u2019s funniest when being most nasty. The high point of the film comes when Kate, Billy\u2019s pretty girlfriend, admits why she hates Christmas. It seems that when she was a child, her dad disappeared on Christmas Eve, only to be discovered some days later, decomposing, halfway down the chimmney in his Santa Claus suit.\u201cThat,\u201d says Kate, \u201cis how I found out there is no Santa Claus.\u201d\u201cGremlins\u201d takes a fairly jokey view of all its characters, including Kingston Falls\u2019s own wicked witch, a wealthy, ferociously mean-spirited woman - nicely played by television\u2019s Polly Holliday - who refers to an impoverished widow\u2019s two small children as \u201cdeadbeats.\u201dNone of the other actors, including Hoyt Axton (Rand Peltzer), Zach Galligan (Billy) and Phoebe Cates (Kate) has a chance against the mogwai and the gremlins, made by Chris Walas. These mechanical animals aren\u2019t very lovable, but they are cleverly devised, and one knows where one stands with them.\u201cGremlins,\u201d which has been rated PG (\u201cParental Guidance Suggested\u201d), may not be ideal entertainment for younger children for the reasons described above.

{"Headline": "Lawrence Roberts, Who Helped Design Internet\u2019s Precursor, Dies at 81", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late 1966, a 29-year-old computer scientist drew a series of abstract figures on tracing paper and a quadrille pad. Some resembled a game of cat\u2019s cradle; others looked like heavenly constellations; still others like dress patterns.The cause was a heart attack, said his son Pasha.As a manager at the Pentagon\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, Dr. Roberts designed much of the Arpanet \u2014 the internet\u2019s precursor \u2014 and oversaw its implementation in 1969.Dr. Roberts was considered the decisive force behind packet switching, the technology that breaks data into discrete bundles that are then sent along various paths around a network and reassembled at their destination. He decided to use packet switching as the underlying technology of the Arpanet; it remains central to the function of the internet.And it was Dr. Roberts\u2019s decision to build a network that distributed control of the network across multiple computers. Distributed networking remains another foundation of today\u2019s internet.It was under Dr. Roberts\u2019s leadership at ARPA that the possibilities of computer networking began to grow clear to a community beyond the core of scientists who built the Arpanet.He long believed that a computer network was of little importance unless it was used in interesting ways. As early as 1968, he exhorted his colleagues to create applications for the nascent network. ARPA, for instance, was one of the largest early users of electronic mail.\u201cLarry led us to uncover potential that we never would have seen had he not pushed so hard for increased functionality,\u201d said Vinton G. Cerf, Google\u2019s chief internet evangelist and a graduate student in computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles when Dr. Roberts was overseeing the building of the Arpanet. \u201cHe pushed all of us to find ways in which we could make good on the promise of resource sharing.\u201dHe was also a serial entrepreneur and corporate executive. After leaving ARPA in 1973, Dr. Roberts founded or co-founded a half-dozen companies focused on computer networking.Lawrence Gilman Roberts was born on Dec. 21, 1937, in Westport, Conn., the youngest of three children. His parents, Elliott and Elizabeth, were both chemists who had met in the Yale University chemistry department while pursuing their doctorates.As a young child, using his father\u2019s chemistry books and chemicals, Dr. Roberts built a series of rockets and bombs. He recalled that one of his youthful experiments produced a chlorine gas byproduct, \u201cwhich put me in the hospital under an oxygen tent because I sniffed it to see what was happening,\u201d he said in an interview for this obituary in May.When he was in sixth grade, he built an elevator to ascend an oak tree in his yard. He was sitting in it one day when a connector broke. He fell to the ground and broke his neck. \u201cThey were quite used to me in the hospital,\u201d he said.But it was electronics that eventually captured his attention. \u201cI wanted something new, not old like chemistry,\u201d he said.He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from M.I.T. in 1959. That year he married June Stuller, a computer programmer. They divorced in 1974. Three subsequent marriages also ended in divorce.Initial attempts to recruit him to ARPA\u2019s Information Processing Techniques Office to oversee the technical structure of the Arpanet failed. He was reluctant to leave Lincoln Lab for a job he viewed as largely administrative. But eventually he agreed, and arrived at the Pentagon in December 1966.Stephen Crocker, a computer scientist who worked for Dr. Roberts at ARPA, said his boss\u2019s dislike of wasted time was legendary. \u201cWithin a few weeks, he had the place memorized,\u201d recalled Dr. Crocker, referring to the labyrinthine Pentagon building. \u201cAs I\u2019ve heard the story, Roberts obtained a stopwatch and began timing various routes to his frequent destinations.\u201d\u201c\u2018Larry\u2019s Route\u2019 soon became commonly known as the fastest distance between any two Pentagon points,\u201d Dr. Crocker said.Dr. Kleinrock, who had shared an office with Dr. Roberts at Lincoln Lab, said that after Dr. Roberts arrived at ARPA, he showed Dr. Kleinrock and other colleagues his sketches of the network\u2019s topology and logic. Hundreds of drawings later, he chose a distributed network, rather than a centralized or star configuration, to serve as the backbone of the Arpanet.But even as he focused on the overall architecture, he remained committed to finding practical uses for the nascent network.Email, an application that ARPA-sponsored researchers had spent a great deal of time developing, quickly became one of the most popular applications on the Arpanet. When asked about that at a technical conference in 1986, Dr. Roberts said he was not surprised.The ARPA director \u201cdecided it was a great thing, and he made everybody in ARPA use it,\u201d Dr. Roberts said. \u201cSo all these managers of ballistic missile technology, who didn\u2019t know what a computer was, had to start using electronic mail.\u201dDr. Roberts added that he had received a note years earlier from Paul Baran, another networking pioneer, warning against personal use of email.\u201cIt said, \u2018One thing you ought to watch out for is you can\u2019t send out personal message stuff, that\u2019s illegal. That\u2019s against the postal laws and you\u2019ll be in jail in no time.\u2019\u201d Mr. Baran\u2019s warning notwithstanding, there was no stopping the personal messages. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t happen to go to jail,\u201d Dr. Roberts told the audience.Dr. Roberts left ARPA in 1973 to become the founding chief executive of Telenet, a networking company that used packet switching. Seven years later, Dr. Roberts and his co-founders sold Telenet to GTE for $60 million.The start-ups that followed focused on flow control algorithms for internet traffic and did not achieve the same level of success. He ultimately failed to amass significant wealth from the internet.\u201cIt\u2019s like you created the Spider-Man character and it turned into a giant franchise, but you only got paid by the hour for drawing it,\u201d said Pasha Roberts.Yet Dr. Roberts remained philosophical about this aspect of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that it didn\u2019t benefit me,\u201d he said in the 2018 interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s interesting, and I love the knowledge I gained from building it and using it and understanding it from the beginning.\u201dThe interview took place in Dr. Roberts\u2019s modest house in Redwood City, a town in Silicon Valley, which he shared with his longtime partner, Dr. Tedde Rinker, a physician.Dr. Roberts is survived by Dr. Rinker and his son Pasha, as well as two sisters, Mary Annis Arris and Ruth Esther Bennett. A second son, Kenny, died in 2013.In 2018, the biggest problem he saw with the internet was network security.\u201cI envision someday getting software into the network that helps curb attacks, but that\u2019s going to take a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be distributed around the network in order to solve the problem. So that\u2019s the project I keep thinking about, but I don\u2019t have a solution.\u201dHe was quick to dismiss detractors who said the internet had sparked the demise of brick-and-mortar retail stores.\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful, and I think they should go out of business, because going to the store is ridiculous,\u201d he said. The doorbell rang, and Dr. Roberts excused himself to take delivery of groceries he had ordered online.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Dreaded Winter Until My Newborn Taught Me to Embrace It", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesThose long, dark, cold winter nights I had feared more than childbirth itself became something I hadn\u2019t known a night could be: a haven. A shelter.For most of my adult life, I dreaded \u2014 absolutely dreaded \u2014 winter. In that season, my own darkness multiplied and surged forth like cockroaches waiting for the lights to go out. Whatever deep-seated fears \u2014 illnesses, accidents, loved ones dying \u2014 I\u2019d managed to keep at bay in the brighter months emerged hungry and atomic-blast-proof with the 5 p.m. twilight.Sometimes, seven or eight months pregnant, I would wake in the night to use the bathroom and would peer through the slats in the blinds to the black sky outside, the stars sharp and cold through the trees. When the baby was born, those trees would be bare. When the baby was born, that blackness would be colder. I felt a terrible anticipatory loneliness in those moments. I knew what it was like to be isolated in my own head. Then my son was born, and what shocked me most \u2014 more than the surprising goriness of my body\u2019s healing, more than the strange sounds newborns make, more than the ferocity of my nursing-mother appetite \u2014 were the nights. Those long, dark, cold winter nights I had feared more than childbirth itself. They became something I hadn\u2019t known a night could be: a haven. A shelter. When our son finally fell asleep, my husband and I would go to bed ourselves, the silence of our house suddenly sacred, fragile as blown glass. And when, after an hour or two, our son would wake again and cry, I\u2019d hold him in his soft rocking chair, nurse him there in the nightlight\u2019s glow. Sometimes I\u2019d surf the internet on my phone, feeling a companionable affection for anyone posting on Facebook at 3 a.m.; sometimes I\u2019d just sit there, half in dreams. My son would fall asleep, and I\u2019d know I should try to get some more sleep myself, but often I\u2019d hold him a little longer, the heavy sleeping weight of him, the warmth of him in his soft flannel zippered pajamas against the chill of the January night. The silence a globe around us.I stopped minding when the sun dropped below the trees at 5 p.m. I was exhausted by then, and it felt right that the day should be ending. And when the full dark came and wrapped itself around our house, it felt like a cave, safe and ancient. I felt my animal self stir and settle. The night let me burrow deep in my new life. The night unthreaded me from human time, human brain. There was a baby, and there was my body, and there was food and shelter and the warmth of the other bodies in this shelter. There were cockroaches sometimes, too, but I couldn\u2019t be bothered with them, not for long. I was a bear, a bobcat, a wolf. I was large and furred. I was going on instinct. When something crawled across me, I let it, then got back to tending. I was busy with the work of winter.My anxiety didn\u2019t disappear, of course. There was an abundance of it (suffocation, choking, a new set of worries \u2014 torticollis, R.S.V., infant botulism \u2014 in which I quickly became expert), and there still is. I lose hours to it sometimes, disappear down the rabbit hole as I always have. But since my son\u2019s birth, nearly a decade ago now, I haven\u2019t once dreaded the end of Daylight Saving Time, that autumn date that confiscates 60 minutes of gold-light evening. Now when I see it approaching on the calendar, I feel a little ping of glad anticipation. These days, winter means an excuse to stay in. It means a harking back to those early weeks. It means \u2014 unbelievably \u2014 comfort. Winter is dark, but now it\u2019s a darkness I want to climb inside.One evening that first February of my son\u2019s life, it snowed, unusual for Mississippi. At 1 a.m. I held my son in his rocker. Outside, the moonlight and streetlights on the snow turned the sky a glowy gray orange. The neighborhood was silent, blanketed in its unexpected whiteness. It was the witching hour again. And I\u2019d been right: It was not a time for humans. It was a time for my son and me, two animals warm against the cold world outside.

And what does the answer say about where the two parties stand today?Contributing Opinion WriterIt\u2019s been said in recent years that the American system of government is coming to resemble a parliamentary system, characterized by political parties that operate with much stricter ideological discipline than we\u2019ve been accustomed to.With that in mind, and contemplating the Democrats\u2019 return to power in the House of Representatives, here\u2019s a little thought experiment. Suppose we did have a parliamentary system. How many political parties would we have? And what can this thought experiment tell us about the nature of our two parties and the dysfunction we see daily?For present purposes, let\u2019s just imagine that we had a pure parliamentary system in which we elected our representatives by proportional representation, so that if a minor party\u2019s candidates got 4 percent of the legislative votes, they\u2019d win 4 percent of the seats. What might our party alignment look like?A number of mainstream liberals would find themselves torn between these two parties, but they\u2019d have to choose one or the other, as there would be no room for three big parties of the left. I suspect many might go back and forth, depending on the issues of the moment and whom each party chose as its leader.One can envision maybe some other small parties \u2014 a party organized around gun control, say. But that would probably be the basic lineup on the broad left. Now, what about the right?One question here is whether the more avowedly Christian evangelical portion of this coalition would branch off and form its own party to place more emphasis on social issues. History tends to suggest, though, that the forces of the right hold together for strategic purposes, while the forces of the left do not. On the right, at least in America, they lean toward emphasizing the things they agree on, while on the left, they elevate the disagreements. (It\u2019s a long story.)As on the left, there might be a few offshoot parties. There might be a Second Amendment party; there might even be a white supremacist party, which rejected the cleansing euphemisms that most racists have learned to adopt. But these would be minuscule, rarely winning a single seat.Now, let\u2019s look back over this list. If I\u2019m right, the Democrats would split into four parties, and the Republicans into two, although the second one would be tiny. In other words: The Trump-era Republican Party already is in essence a parliamentary party. This will be especially so in the next Congress, given the retirements of some of the last Republicans who could plausibly be called moderates (Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania) and the defeat of others (Mike Coffman of Colorado).The Democrats, however, are an unruly bunch. There\u2019s a lot they agree on in terms of broad principles \u2014 doing something about climate change, raising wages, expanding health care. But boy do they disagree on how to go about doing them. Some of these fights will inevitably define the 116th Congress. Medicare for All provides a perfect example. There are going to be perhaps 235 Democrats in the new Congress, and just over half that number has co-sponsored the Medicare for All bill. The other near-half is against.Indeed, the Democrats\u2019 battles aren\u2019t even limited to being between its parliamentary factions. Ms. Pelosi has already survived two mutinies, both emanating from within Party One!The upshot of all this? Democrats had better concentrate on the things that unite them: fighting voter suppression, addressing prescription drug costs (that\u2019s small ball for those on the left, but they don\u2019t disagree), investigating the Trump administration.The Democrats will never be a party characterized by parliamentary discipline; unlike the Republicans, their constituencies are too heterogeneous. But both of their major factions owe it to their adherents, as we hurtle toward 2020, to keep the infighting to an absolute minimum.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s how to limit the snooping.You can head off much of the tracking on your own device by spending a few minutes changing settings. The information below applies primarily to people in the United States. It\u2019s difficult to know for sure whether location data companies are tracking your phone. Any app that collects location data may share your information with other companies, as long as it mentions that somewhere in its privacy policy.But the language in those policies can be dense, confusing or outright misleading. Apps that funnel location details to help hedge funds, for instance, have told users their data would be used for market analysis \u2014 or simply for \u201cbusiness purposes.\u201dThe apps most popular among data companies are those that offer services keyed to people\u2019s whereabouts \u2014 including weather, transit, travel, shopping deals and dating \u2014 because users are more likely to enable location services on them. Some apps have internal settings where you can indicate that you don\u2019t want your location used for targeted advertising or other purposes. But the easiest method is to go through your device\u2019s main privacy menu.In the device\u2019s privacy settings, apps provide brief explanations of how they will use location data. Do not rely on these descriptions to tell you whether the location data will be shared or sold. The Times found that many of these descriptions are incomplete and often don\u2019t mention that the data will be shared.If you want to disable location tracking entirely, toggle the \u201cLocation Services\" setting to off. With location services switched off entirely, you may not be able to use certain services, such as finding yourself on a map.

Any app on Android that has your permission to track your location can receive the data even when you\u2019re not using it.

{"Headline": "PowerPoint Is the Most Efficient Way for Kids to Manage Their Parents", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe most solid method for kids to achieve their goals? An awesome presentation.To convince her mother to buy some of these items, Makennah, who is 13, created an 85-slide PowerPoint presentation. Rather than just emailing the document, she delivered its contents in person, standing before her mother to make the full audiovisual pitch. \u201cI like to add music and do my own intros and stuff,\u201d Makennah said.Though some presentations are made with Google Slides or Apple\u2019s Keynote, PowerPoint also seems to be the dominant tool, creating yet another instance for young people to embrace a Microsoft product (the company also owns Minecraft and Xbox).The children say that their polished presentations serve a few purposes. They convey to parents that what is being asked for really matters. They also let them make an entire case without being interrupted by a parent\u2019s quick \u201cno.\u201d \u201cWith a PowerPoint it was a little bit more impactful because they could see the amount of effort and work I put into it instead of just my usual begging,\u201d said Lucy Frisch, 14, an equestrian from New York who made a presentation a few years ago to ask her parents to buy her a horse.She did not manage to close the deal. Still, her presentation showed to her parents that Lucy\u2019s interest in riding was not fleeting, and convinced her father that the family should commit as many resources as possible to her riding. A key strategy is to be prepared in advance with answers to your parents\u2019 objections, said Cade Collins, 14, from Maryville, Tenn.On the occasion of his brother Luke\u2019s birthday last year, Cade sat his parents in their living room, turned down the lights, streamed some soft jazz, lit a candles and dressed in a T-shirt with a picture of a puppy on it. Then he unleashed upon his parents a PowerPoint pressure-tation entitled, \u201cReasons Why We Need to get a Wing Pup.\u201d The family already had a dog, Cooper, age 10, whom the family had nicknamed \u201cthe Wing.\u201d But Luke wanted a duck-hunting dog and relatives were offering a black Labrador from a new litter.In a slide that he headlined \u201cI Know What Your Thinking,\u201d Cade wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve heard it from you mom, \u2018We would but there is just too much stress with moving houses.\u2019 Well, boy do I have an answer for you. Studies have shown that when petting a dog your body releases a number of \u2018feel good\u2019 hormones, such as serotonin, prolactin and oxytocin. There for releasing stress.\u201d (He meant \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d but that\u2019s not the point here.)\u201cCoopers years are numbered and he is slowing down, but a younger energetic presence wouldn\u2019t hurt and may improve his lifestyle,\u201d he added. (See slide four, \u201cLets Face It.\u201d)What did Mr. and Ms. Collins say? What do you think?But before Willie joined the family (they named the new dog after Willie Nelson!), the boys had to sign a contract promising that they would clean up accidents, monitor the pup\u2019s furniture-chewing and keep him fed and groomed. \u201cWe replied to the PowerPoint with our own official documents,\u201d said Ms. Collins.It\u2019s not just about getting parents to spring for new sneakers and animals. Makennah of Lubbock has also used PowerPoint for more quotidian request: to convince her mom to let her wear a little makeup. \u201cI\u2019m quick to be convinced by her,\u201d said Marla Castro, her mother. \u201cShe has me dumbfounded a lot.\u201d\u201cSure, make a PowerPoint and we\u2019ll see,\u201d her mother said.A few days later, Ms. Stopenski set up a life-size cutout of Mr. Horan and hooked her laptop to the family\u2019s living-room TV. She devoted a few slides to explaining the appeal of Mr. Horan, just in case it wasn\u2019t readily apparent to her parents: \u201cHe is 5\u20199\u201d so basically he is the perfect height for me\u201d and \u201cHe loves golf,\u201d one said. \u201cHe sings good\u201d and \u201cI like his brown hair more than his blonde hair,\u201d said another. She explained how much the travel, hotel and concert would cost and how she had budgeted to keep costs low. One of the final slides included a photograph of Mr. Horan, applauding in an audience. Ms. Stopenski\u2019s caption said, \u201cNiall is clapping in this picture because he is so impressed at how dedicated I am to him.\u201d\u201cThey said \u2018yes\u2019 right away,\u201d she said.This year she wants to go to Toronto to see Shawn Mendes. \u201cDo you want me to make a PowerPoint? Because I will,\u201d Ms. Stopenski asked her mother.\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary,\u201d her mom said.For some, the process of creating and delivering a presentation is less about dazzling parents than crystallizing for their own selves how strongly they want something. Last month, Dwayne Neff, 17, a high-school senior in Park Forest, Ill., set up a time to meet with his parents and had his PowerPoint on the TV screen when they came into the living room. He needed $250 to buy a ticket to the Travis Scott concert. Dwayne thought if he simply asked for the money, his parents would say no before he got the words out. Thanks to his slide show, Dwayne, an aspiring musical artist, was able to make his argument.Check out this excellent PowerPoint about Travis Scott.After, \u201cthey even told me that if I had just asked, they would say \u2018no\u2019 but that they would see what they could do because I put in time and effort,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t always take him seriously, because his approach to things sometimes can be somewhat colorful,\u201d Dwayne\u2019s mother, Stephanie Neff, wrote in an email.She and her husband did decide against giving the $250, but Dwayne, pumped up by his PowerPoint, sold his PlayStations and attended Mr. Scott\u2019s performance last week. \u201cIt was everything I needed to give me the inspiration to continue following my musical dreams,\u201d he said.Charlie Regan, 10, used a Google Slides presentation to be relieved of an activity. Charlie really wanted to quit soccer. So she sat her parents down and delivered an argument why she should be allowed to stop after the season\u2019s end. \u201cI knew that if I just wrote it one a regular piece of paper, I couldn\u2019t do as much as I could with a computer,\u201d said Charlie, who is in fifth grade.How to get out of sports.\u201cIt totally took us by surprise and we agreed with her reasoning,\u201d said her father, Patrick Regan.Then Charlie\u2019s older brother, Cash, who is 14 and had seen his sister\u2019s success with the soccer matter, suggested that the two of them create another presentation. This one was aimed to convince their parents to buy a house in the country.In their pitch, titled \u201cParadise,\u201d the children wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong we love summer and the things we do and the places we visit. But there are definitely room for improvement.\u201dAgainst the backdrop of stock images of log cabins and other buildings they found doing a Google image search for \u201csmall country house,\u201d the Regan kids laid out the case to splurge on a vacation home. Their reasons included, \u201cWe could go camping right outside our house\u201d and \u201cIt would be a great place to park and keep Uncle Richard\u2019s truck.\u201dBut alas.\u201cIt didn\u2019t work as well as it did with my soccer idea,\u201d Charlie said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nothing Is More American Than Chinese Food on Christmas", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJewish families and others used to flock to Chinese restaurants because that was all that was open, but now it\u2019s almost as traditional as milk and cookies for Santa.Ms. Li is the author of the novel \u201cNumber One Chinese Restaurant.\u201dWhen my mother first came to America over three decades ago, she waited tables for five years at a restaurant called Forbidden City in Ann Arbor, Mich. She quit when she became pregnant with me, but I grew up hearing stories about her time as a waitress. Stories about stingy customers and cooks she tried to avoid \u2014 and the busiest day of the year: Christmas.\u201cI always got my pick of the big party tables,\u201d she told me. \u201cEntire families, including grandparents, would come for dinner.\u201dI knew that Christmas was a busy day for Chinese restaurants, and I assumed that she hated that shift. But I was wrong.\u201cAll the customers were in happy moods,\u201d she corrected me. \u201cAnd gave us blessings.\u201dAs most Americans know: Chinese restaurants almost never close on Christmas. Early Chinese immigrants were not Christian, and losing an entire day of sales for a holiday they didn\u2019t understand did not make economic sense, especially when Chinese restaurants occupied a tenuous position in America. It\u2019s hard to imagine now, when there are over 40,000 Chinese restaurants in the United States (McDonald\u2019s, for scale, has just over 14,000 restaurants), but before Americans were crowding into Chinese restaurants for Christmas dinner, they were more interested in crowding these restaurants out.Jewish and African-Americans also patronized those early Chinese restaurants in noticeable numbers. As one newspaper from 1892 put it so delicately, \u201cWhites, blacks and Mongolians mingled without sign of prejudice.\u201dChinese restaurants used to be one of the few public places that welcomed African-American diners, according to Yong Chen\u2019s \u201cChop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America.\u201d In \u201cA Kosher Christmas,\u201d Rabbi Joshua Plaut writes that Jewish customers were welcome in Chinese restaurants because \u201cChinese owners and waiters had no history of prejudice toward Jews.\u201d It makes sense that Chinese restaurants were a destination for Jewish families on Christmas \u2014 they were among the only ones open, both literally and metaphorically.The summer before I went to graduate school, I got a job waiting tables at a bustling Chinese restaurant. Lines sometimes went out the door and parties of 10 to 15 packed my tables. The restaurant was known for its Peking duck, carved tableside and then wrapped in flour pancakes by the servers. My first week on the job, in a sweltering July, one of my co-workers caught the terrified grimace on my face and said, \u201cYou think this is bad, wait until Christmas.\u201dI didn\u2019t make it until Christmas. I barely made it until the end of July. And after I turned in my name tag, I avoided Chinese restaurants for almost a year after. My brief time as a Chinese restaurant waitress illustrated the perpetual foreignness I\u2019d always felt as a Chinese-American, the foreignness I\u2019d seen my parents, as immigrants, struggle with even decades after they\u2019d received citizenship.The customers I served saw me, and my co-workers, not so much as people as the furniture of the restaurant, and talked about us as if we couldn\u2019t hear, or understand, what they were saying. My experience as a waitress was one more glaring reminder that to be Chinese in America is to be always on the outside looking in.But the Christmas crowds now make me think of something else. Chinese food on Christmas has become, according to Rabbi Plaut, an acceptable alternative for anyone looking outside the usual holiday celebrations. Google Trends has found that more people search for \u201cChinese restaurant open\u201d during the week of Christmas than any other week of the year.It seems like proof that Chinese food and culture is finally part of mainstream America: Chinese restaurants have managed to become as culturally American as milk and cookies for Santa.I used to feel lucky to have avoided the dreaded Christmas shift, but now I wonder if I might have actually enjoyed being a part of everyone\u2019s celebration. And my mom was probably right about the tips.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are We Suddenly Surrounded by \u2018Grift\u2019?", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsThe two most jarring events in the past decade of American life both had the whiff of a grand con about them. One was the crisis of 2008, after which a lot of ordinary Americans turned their attention to the financial-services industry and discovered something that looked, on the surface, uncannily like a classic bilking: There was a lot of hard-to-follow shifting about of who owned what and who owed what to whom, and in the end a lot of people found that their retirement savings had vanished. The other was the election of Donald Trump, who has always been fairly open about his talent for old-school hucksterism. To the very end, many people were convinced his entire campaign had been a long-game self-promotional exercise \u2014 a man wandering past real estate, casinos, reality television, mail-order steaks and wealth-building seminars to arrive at right-wing politics as a high-quality grift.The grifter is a lot more entertaining, and this summer, con stories seemed to be everywhere \u2014 not because of any sudden renaissance of fraud, but because the media had tapped into a bottomless appetite for hearing about it. The blockbuster was the tale of Anna Sorokin, a.k.a. Anna Delvey, a European 20-something who managed to persuade New York socialites that she was a wealthy heiress, living out of Manhattan hotels on, reportedly, a series of forged documents and an air of general blitheness. (Both Shonda Rhimes and Lena Dunham are at work on TV adaptations.) And this was nearly nothing compared with Anthony Gignac, an orphan who spent decades impersonating a Saudi prince. According to an October story in Vanity Fair, he was exposed when, during the slow negotiation of a multimillion-dollar business deal, he raised suspicions by ordering prosciutto.The appeal of these stories is hardly mysterious. There you are, stuck at work, while others somehow declare themselves to be billionaires or airline pilots or Stanley Kubrick. We admire the gall, and often the craft \u2014 the cinematic complexity of a well-developed con, whether it involves high-wire role-playing or just chiseling petty cash out of passers-by. If you ever feel like the old-fashioned grift has gone the way of fast-talking men in hats and three-card Monte on street corners \u2014 the way of Harold Hill in \u201cThe Music Man,\u201d commencing his 1912 grift with a rousing patter song about moral decay \u2014 all you have to do is Google terms along the lines of \u201celaborate Walmart returns scheme\u201d to witness the American ingenuity still on offer. It was a treat to read the story, this summer, of how a security worker for the McDonald\u2019s Monopoly contest spent years filching winning tokens and finding co-conspirators to redeem them. We deplore this stuff, in theory, but under the right circumstances we are entranced by the audacity \u2014 at the hacker\u2019s skill of spotting the weak spots in the systems that bind the rest of us, and bluffing straight through them.This line of thinking can, pretty obviously, be a glib one; to say something like \u201ccapitalism is a grift\u201d is to express an intuition, not file a detailed indictment. Grift is capacious. In just five characters, it can casually point out the suspect mechanics and empty, grasping heart of almost any figure or phenomenon. Young people look at their paychecks and suspect that their college educations were a grift, or at least the student loans were. One Twitter skeptic smells grift in all of \u201cthe business world,\u201d another in the artificial scarcity of diamonds, another in all skin care beyond sunscreen and acne medication, another in liberal podcasts, another in \u201ceverything.\u201dThis might scan as terminally cynical, a way of sneering diffidently at, well, everything. But it\u2019s not exactly outlandish (or unpopular) for a modern person to note that many of the systems she encounters have been carefully constructed to extract maximum profits, to sustain themselves, to get what they can while the getting is good \u2014 not unusual for a modern person to suspect it would be easier to deal with an actual con artist than with Wells Fargo or a budget health-insurance company. And perhaps this is cause for despair.But over the course of the year, it has begun to feel that the energy behind calling everything a grift is the very opposite of jaded. You just need to turn your focus from the grift to the negative space around it. If huge segments of our economic activity manage to feel \u2014 aesthetically, if not legally \u2014 like fine-tuned rackets, then the segments that remain must consist of actual work with actual purpose, productive labor that requires no puffery or misdirection to sustain. This is the surprisingly wholesome, traditionalist set of values that sneering at grift inevitably pushes you toward: old-timey rectitude and integrity, honest work and firm handshakes and mutual respect. The opposite of a grift, you find, is creating things of real value, paying fair wages, asking what is right more than what is profitable. The opposite of grift is a square deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Man Who Brought Leonardo and Galileo Into the 21st Century", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileFLORENCE, Italy \u2014 Just Google, \u201c10 greatest geniuses of all times,\u201d and it is highly likely that two of the names on that list will be Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei.Now, think about what you would do if you were put in charge of bringing their legacy into the 21st century, in all its complexity, as neither man can be reduced to one simple label, say \u201cartist\u201d or \u201castronomer.\u201d Both were proverbial, intellectually omnivorous Renaissance men.Even though Professor Galluzzi, 76, has considerable hands-on experience tinkering with Leonardo and Galileo\u2019s manifold machines and instruments (from reconstructions of Leonardo\u2019s mechanical contraptions to Galileo\u2019s real-life telescopes housed in the museum\u2019s collection), one of his greatest achievements has been to cement their presence online.The two search engines will exponentially magnify the global reach of both Galileo and Leonardo, embodying one of Mr. Galluzzi\u2019s driving aims: to widen access to knowledge.\u201cThis is a patrimony that should be universally available,\u201d he said.When he was hired in 1982 as director of what was then known as the Institute and Museum of the History of Science, he inherited a staff of one and headquarters that occupied just one floor of the 11th-century Palazzo Castellani, adjacent to the Uffizi galley, one of Italy\u2019s top tourist draws. By contrast, tourists merely trickled into the science museum.Today, the Galileo Museum, as it was renamed after a 2010 restoration, has doubled its floor space, draws around 300,000 visitors a year and produces specialized multimedia exhibitions that tour the world.For Mr. Galluzzi, the dawn of the internet age brought an epiphany of sorts. \u201cCompared to the Uffizi, this little institution just couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d he said in an interview in his wood-paneled office. \u201cBut I had the impression that using these novel instruments, it was possible to create a new playing field in which we could grow.\u201dBack in the 1990s he embraced what were then unfamiliar technologies with gusto (and not without some mishaps, he acknowledged, recalling the unreliability of the earliest data storage systems). The museum was the first in Italy to have its own website, in early 1995, \u201cand not just a home page, there were contents too.\u201d Today, it has more online viewers than the Uffizi, he boasted happily.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly unique in Italy, and rare elsewhere, for a museum to have such a powerful digital presence,\u201d he said.It strives to remain current. The catalog can be downloaded in PDF format and the museum can be \u2018\u2018visited\u2019\u2019 by Google Street View, while an online virtual tour includes detailed descriptions of some 1,000 instruments. The mobile phone app does much the same, with the addition of videos on how things work.In many ways, Mr. Galluzzi and the museum were traveling in two orbits destined to cross.After high school studies in the humanities, he studied philosophy at the University of Florence under the Renaissance scholar Eugenio Garin, obtaining a degree in the history of philosophy. He was one of the first students in Italy to specialize in the history of science, a discipline that had not been formally recognized at the time. His passion for Galileo dates back to then.\u201cI received my degree in 1968, the years of student unrest, and Galileo was seen as a hero because of his battle for the autonomy of reason from the control of the church,\u201d he said.His decades-old fascination with Leonardo, on the other hand, was a matter of \u201cfate,\u201d he said. After college, he was hired as director of the Biblioteca Leonardiana, in Vinci, the artist\u2019s hometown.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gotten the job, I probably would never have become a Leonardo scholar,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I would have studied Newton, or some other thinker.\u201dIt worked out well, in the end. \u201cLeonardo is a prey that\u2019s hard to capture, but then he fascinates you and completely engages you,\u201d he said.Even as he navigated the Leonardo museum into a new era, he embarked on an academic career, teaching the history of science first at the University of Siena, then the University of Florence, interspersed with many short-term appointments at a number of universities: Harvard; Princeton; U.C.L.A.; the University of Hamburg; \u00c9cole des Haute \u00c9tudes in Paris; and the University of Toronto, to name a few.Under his guidance, the museum embarked on a new venture, pioneering the era of multimedia, interactive exhibits. Leonardo\u2019s intricate musings on a host of contraptions were a good fit for this burgeoning project, and his sketches and drawings were brought to life on computer screens to show how they operated.\u201cThe first shows were very primitive compared to what we do today, but they were an indication of the path we were taking,\u201d he said.The museum\u2019s growing reputation began attracting young engineers. Currently, it invests a third of its budget, and a third of its staff, to information technology. One staff member\u2019s sole task is guaranteeing long-term digital preservation, keeping up-to-date with new systems and moving data to new platforms when necessary.\u201cWe want to ensure that our archives will be accessible in 300 years,\u201d Mr. Galluzzi said. \u201cAt first we thought that digital would last forever, but it turns out it\u2019s much less durable than a book, which can last centuries,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh: \u201cNot to mention stone inscriptions.\u201dHis own library consists of more than 20,000 volumes, forcing him and his wife, Lynne, to maintain a large home, even after his two daughters moved out. He also collects wine, mostly French, and produces olive oil from trees in the grove of his country house near Vinci.From the start, the multimedia exhibits were crowd pleasers. \u201cEngineers of the Renaissance,\u201d toured the world\u2019s major cities, while one Leonardo show in Tokyo drew around a million people in three months, he said.\u201cAn exhibit isn\u2019t like reading a book; it has to be fun and create emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, if along with the emotions we are able to transmit a concept or two, the game becomes more interesting.\u201dFor a man who preaches the digital gospel, he still pens his scholarly writings by hand, he said, a self-described \u201chyper-corrective\u201d with an old-school approach to writing.

{"Headline": "Oath Agrees to $5 Million Settlement Over Children\u2019s Privacy Online", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOath, the owner of AOL and Yahoo, has agreed to pay about $5 million to settle charges from the New York attorney general that the media company\u2019s online advertising business was violating a federal children\u2019s privacy law.AOL, through its ad exchange, helped place targeted display ads on hundreds of websites that it knew were directed to children under 13, such as Roblox.com and Sweetyhigh.com, according to a settlement that the attorney general\u2019s office plans to announce on Tuesday. The attorney general\u2019s office said that the ads were placed by using personal data, like cookies and geolocation information, in violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which is known as Coppa.The penalty that the Verizon-owned Oath agreed to pay is the largest a company has paid for a case tied to Coppa. A spokesman for Oath, which did not admit or deny the attorney general\u2019s findings, said, \u201cWe are pleased to see this matter resolved and remain wholly committed to protecting children\u2019s privacy online.\u201d\u201cCoppa is meant to protect young children from being tracked and targeted by advertisers online,\u201d said Barbara D. Underwood, New York\u2019s attorney general. \u201cAOL flagrantly violated the law \u2014 and children\u2019s privacy \u2014 and will now pay the largest-ever penalty under Coppa.\u201dAd exchanges, which connect websites and potential advertisers through real-time bidding processes as pages load, must comply with Coppa when they know they are working with children\u2019s sites.Technically, AOL\u2019s policies prohibited the use of its display ad exchange to auction ad space on children\u2019s sites, but the company did business there anyway, according to the settlement documents, which examined AOL\u2019s practices between October 2015 and February 2017. Its auctions of ad space on those sites regularly collected personal information from users, like they would on any website, then shared that with bidders, resulting in targeted advertisements.An account manager for AOL in New York repeatedly told one client, called Playwire Media, that the company\u2019s ad exchange could be used to sell ad space while complying with Coppa, which wasn\u2019t the case, according to the settlement documents. Based on the statements, Playwire, which represented sites like Roblox.com, Neopets.com and Tweentribune.com, used the exchange to place more than a billion ads on space that was supposed to be covered by Coppa.AOL, through Advertising.com, also bought space on websites from other ad exchanges that had been flagged as Coppa-covered. However, according to the settlement, the company treated this ad space the same as it would any normal ad space, meaning that it allowed ad targeting. The company has since introduced technology that recognizes when space is deemed to be covered by Coppa and adjusts its practices accordingly, according to the settlement.Oath, as part of the settlement, said it would create a Coppa compliance program, which will be overseen by a specific executive or officer, and provide annual training on Coppa compliance to account managers and other employees that work with ads on children\u2019s sites. It will also destroy personal information that it has collected from children.Advertisement"}

They were sisters from Singapore and moved like gazelles in their getas. I wobbled behind them, and then nearly lost my footing as I took in the scene near the lantern-lit Otani River winding through the city. It was a veritable thoroughfare of yukatas and getas, in an array of colors, on visitors young and old, shuffling, striding and practically skipping through the night.People come from all over Asia and beyond to soak in Kinosaki\u2019s seven onsen, or public hot spring baths, and pretty much everyone does it walking around in a robe all day. The city is one big inn. The ryokan you stay in is your individual room and the streets are like the inn\u2019s corridors. It\u2019s all very romantic until it hails and rains.I had come to Kinosaki, on the western coast of Honshu, Japan\u2019s biggest island, though, not for dressing up, but on a kind of pilgrimage. As a Japanese friend put it to me in an email, \u201cDon\u2019t they have that Buddha that\u2019s only unveiled to the public every 33 years?\u201dBefore modern medicine, ill people would trek to Onsenji temple, pray to the spirit of Dochi Shonin, and then bathe, naked, with a wooden ladle in the hot springs. Once there, the ritual is to strip down, shower while sitting and then soak in those healing waters, surrounded by bodies of all shapes and sizes. (Onsen are divided into all-male and all-female sides.) I was struck with the ease of nudity, how young girls splashed around with their mothers and big sisters and grandmothers, and what an impact that must make on their self-image, to know that bodies are all different and we all have one. The hot spring water warmed away the foul weather.As I left, I put on my yukata, thinking of the words I\u2019d heard in the ryokan: left-side over right, \u201cO.K., O.K., O.K.,\u201d and stepped out into the thoroughfare that seemed like a reversal of time. The onsen were a little hot for me, but I could walk around in a robe forever.His name was Sushi Tiger. He was 76 and he\u2019d been studying the art of cutting raw fish for 50 years. Why didn\u2019t I come in and take a seat?Sushi Tiger, who also goes by Takashi, wrapped a twisted white bandana around his forehead as he prepared my dinner. He spoke little English and I spoke almost no Japanese, so we communicated by writing on napkins, pointing at a sign with pictures of sushi and Google Translate, which is even more hopeless at Japanese than it is at other languages. At one point he brought out a book of cartoons used for teaching English to school children and taught me a few Japanese phrases, while serving me sake. I was glad to be his only customer.I am not an adventurous eater, particularly when it comes to seafood; I was a vegetarian for a long time, in New Mexico, which has no sea. But when I set out on this 52 Places trip, I made a vow to overcome my pickiness, which meant eating a few insects and a small slice of wallaby (I still feel guilty). Japan, I thought, would really test those limits.In my Kinosaki ryokans, at lavish kaiseki dinners, the learning curve was steeper. I\u2019d sit down to a tray filled with 20 little plates and no one who spoke English to guide me through them. What order was I supposed to eat them in? Did any of them get dipped in soy sauce? So I\u2019d try first and ask questions later. It turns out I am not a fan of preserved fish eggs melded into a rectangular cake, but I\u2019m O.K. with tender fish intestines.The big reason Kinosaki still has such a thriving Asian tourism business in the winter is that snow crab season starts in November, and lasts only a few months. People come for the crab and stay for the onsen. A good crab can sell for up to $300.Before long, the 79-year-old, English-speaking owner, Yatsui Kiyoshi, emerged. When he heard I was on a long trip, he pulled out a weather-beaten Rand McNally atlas and told me he had studied nuclear physics at Cornell, and driven across the United States to spend two years in Los Alamos, N.M.My hometown.He loved the mountains and the tequila but thought it was too hot, and he missed Japan and his family. So he came back to continue a life in nuclear physics and carry out his legacy as a fifth-generation lacquerware artisan. His wife took some pictures of us, which he emailed to me with a note about what a small world it is and how wonderful it had been to find someone with connections to New York and New Mexico. Then he reminded me, for about the fifth time, not to put the chopsticks I\u2019d bought in the microwave.There\u2019s also a surprising lack of trash cans in public spaces. The local expectation is that you pack your trash, and dispose of it when you get to a place with garbage and recycling bins.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Chandigarh, IndiaA previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the Kannon, the goddess of mercy in the Buddhist tradition, as a Buddha.

{"Headline": "The Race Is On to Protect Data From the Next Leap in Computers. And China Has the Lead.", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The world\u2019s leading technology companies, from Google to Alibaba in China, are racing to build the first quantum computer, a machine that would be far more powerful than today\u2019s computers.This device could break the encryption that protects digital information, putting at risk everything from the billions of dollars spent on e-commerce to national secrets stored in government databases.An answer? Encryption that relies on the same concepts from the world of physics. Just as some scientists are working on quantum computers, others are working on quantum security techniques that could thwart the code-breaking abilities of these machines of the future.\u201cChina has a very deliberate strategy to own this technology,\u201d said Duncan Earl, a former researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who is president and chief technology officer of Qubitekk, a company that is exploring quantum encryption. \u201cIf we think we can wait five or 10 years before jumping on this technology, it is going to be too late.\u201dWith traditional computers, transistors store \u201cbits\u201d of information, and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. Those are the fundamental slices of data that tell a computer what to do.When some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold, they behave differently. That difference allows a quantum bit, or qubit, to store a combination of 1 and 0. Two qubits can hold four values at once. As the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.There is no guarantee that a viable quantum encryption network could be built over long distances. But if it does happen, China\u2019s willingness to experiment and put government, academic and commercial resources behind the effort could have a big payoff.The country has invested tens of millions of dollars building networks that can transmit data using quantum encryption. Last year, a Chinese satellite named Micius, after an ancient philosopher, managed a video call between Beijing and Vienna using quantum encryption. A dedicated quantum communication network between Beijing and Shanghai was also put into operation last year, after four years of planning and construction.For now, quantum encryption works only over a limited distance. The satellite link between Beijing and Vienna stretched this limit to a record 4,630 miles. On the ground, using optical fiber lines, the ceiling is about 150 miles.Among China\u2019s investments in quantum encryption, the Micius satellite has received the most attention. The University of Science and Technology of China, the government-backed university that helped launch Micius, led the construction of the ground network, which spans about 1,200 miles \u2014 perhaps a hint of aspirations for drastic improvement.The governments of Anhui and Shandong Provinces, through which the fiber-optic network passes, together invested $80 million in the project. Like all major infrastructure projects in China, the plans have had high-level support from the Chinese government.This main line is being extended to other cities and regions. The goal by 2030 is a Chinese-built network for sharing quantum encryption keys across the globe.Some security experts question the effectiveness of quantum encryption. Because it is so new, it has not been put through anywhere close to the rigorous testing that would give it a stamp of approval from skeptical cryptographers.But Chao-Yang Lu, a professor of physics at the University of Science and Technology of China, said the Beijing-Shanghai quantum network was a significant upgrade.With communications sent by traditional means, eavesdroppers can intercept the data stream at every point along a fiber-optic line. A government could tap that line just about anywhere. Quantum encryption cut the number of vulnerable spots in the Beijing-Shanghai line to just a few dozen across 1,200 miles, Professor Lu said.\u201cWe admit that it\u2019s an intermediate solution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the final solution. But it\u2019s already a huge improvement in terms of security.\u201dIn the United States, the government and industry have viewed quantum encryption as little more than a science experiment. Instead, researchers have focused on using ordinary mathematics to build new forms of encryption that can stand up to a quantum computer. This technology would not require new infrastructure.But now, spurred by activity in China and recent advances in quantum research, some in the United States are playing catch-up.Qubitekk, a Southern California start-up, is working to secure power grids in Tennessee using the technology. A second start-up, Quantum Xchange, is building a quantum encryption network in the Northeast, hoping to serve Wall Street banks and other businesses. Researchers at Stony Brook University on Long Island are preparing a third venture.Small start-ups like Qubitekk are unlikely to match the millions of dollars in infrastructure already created in China for quantum encryption. But many experts believe the more important work will happen in research labs, and the Department of Energy is funding a test network in Chicago that could eclipse the kind of systems deployed in China.The Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories are working with Qubitekk to secure power grids with quantum technology, and Quantum Xchange is moving equipment into 60 Hudson Street, the old Western Union telegraph hub, which now serves as an internet hub for Lower Manhattan.Quantum Xchange is building a quantum encryption link between Manhattan and Newark, with plans to connect big banks operating in the two cities. Eventually, it hopes to extend this network up and down the East Coast.At places like the University of Chicago, researchers hope to go a step further, exploring what are called quantum repeaters \u2014 devices that could extend the range of quantum encryption.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d said David Awschalom, a professor at the University of Chicago who oversees much of the university\u2019s quantum research. \u201cBut I am confident this will happen in the next couple of years.\u201dQuantum communication techniques require new hardware. This includes vast networks of fiber lines \u2014 and perhaps satellites \u2014 as well as specialized devices capable of detecting individual photons of light.As Qubitekk worked on quantum encryption networks, it could not obtain the special light detectors it needed to do the work. The start-up originally bought detectors from a small manufacturer in New Jersey, Princeton Lightwave. But in April, this lone American manufacturer handed the detector business over to a company in China, RMY, and Qubitekk\u2019s supply line ran dry.RMY has promised hardware to Qubitekk but recently told it that, because of production issues, additional detectors won\u2019t be available until March.Small companies in Europe are selling somewhat similar detectors, and labs across the globe are developing a more advanced type of hardware. But for now, supplies, particularly in the United States, are slim.Cade Metz reported from San Francisco, and Raymond Zhong from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Search for a name in Google, and you may very well find a number of data brokers offering to sell information for a couple of dollars \u2014 if not offering it up for free.The home address wasn\u2019t always such a sensitive piece of information \u2014\u00a0the once-ubiquitous phone book was considered useful, not dangerous. But times have changed, and the information provided by these new online databases aren\u2019t weaponized only by trolls, but also by stalkers, domestic abusers and criminals. Americans need more control over who knows where they and their families live. Home addresses should not be for sale without the knowledge of and the explicit, meaningful consent of those who live there. And it should be easier to remove information from these databases without having to spend hours tracking it down to every corner of the internet. An intelligent and dedicated pursuer would still be able to track down an address. In many cases, they are public records, after all. But cleaning up the search engines will slow down someone who finds and posts your address in a fit of pique. In the absence of regulation over the sale and purchase of personal data, just a little bit of friction can make a big difference for vulnerable people. Advertisement"}

Exploiting it is the hard part.\u201cWorries don\u2019t translate into solutions unless businesses devise products that emit dramatically less planet-warming greenhouse gases. The innovation is the easy part; getting people to buy it is the hard part. That requires incentives, which depend heavily on governments. Without their intervention, solar and wind power, and electric and hybrid cars would have no foothold against their fossil fuel competitors.\u201dBut he also notes that many government interventions aren\u2019t sufficiently informed by long-term thinking. Tom Linebarger, the chief executive of the engine maker Cummins, tells Mr. Ip that there\u2019s an obvious path forward. \u201cIf we want rules that are more effective, decide the end result we want and let technology compete for the best solution,\u201d he said. \u201cCarbon taxes are much better than all the other choices.\u201dThe U.S. markets were closed yesterday in honor of former President George Bush. When they reopen today, there could be bad news.A new study by UBS suggests worldwide unemployment was 5.2 percent in September. That\u2019s down from 8 percent in 2010, and the lowest level since 1980.Arend Kapteyn, UBS chief economist, said that greater labor market flexibility since the financial crisis \u2014 due to factors such as lower wages and the advent of the gig economy \u2014 had helped lower the natural rate of unemployment in many countries.The change has been particularly pronounced in Eastern Europe: Polish unemployment has fallen to 6.2 percent from 20 percent in 2002, for instance, and Croatia and Slovakia have similar stories. But unemployment has dropped in many of the largest economies too, including the U.S., Britain, Germany and Japan.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!
