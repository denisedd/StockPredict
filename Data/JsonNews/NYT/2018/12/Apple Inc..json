{"Headline": "When the Bubble Bursts, Consider the Anti-Bubble", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are nations and industries in sound economic shape that are ignored by investors because they are not all about tech. Maybe that is about to change. Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.One answer, in any transition period like this one, is to look to anti-bubbles. Bubbles are driven by hype about the hot new thing and defined by mania, including unusually heavy trading and prices rising at an unusually rapid pace and reaching a level that can\u2019t be justified by underlying growth in the economy or company. Anti-bubbles are the mirror image, taking shape in overlooked corners of the world and defined by light trading, with prices stagnating at low levels despite solid growth in the economy or company.To be clear, anti-bubbles do not include legacy companies like department stores and newspapers whose very existence has been thrown into doubt by competition from tech giants. Anti-bubbles encompass countries and companies that would seem to have bright futures but that struggle to attract the attention of investors.Historically, the biggest stock market returns came in the fastest-growing economies. But that pattern changed in recent years, as investors chased technology at the expense of everything else. The highest returns came in slow-growth countries such as Taiwan. The lowest came in fast-growing economies like the Philippines. The reason: Taiwan is a tech-driven economy, the Philippines is not.But as big tech begins to crack, that behavior is beginning to change. Stock markets from the Philippines to Indonesia have started to emerge from anti-bubbles. And in the United States, sound industries that had been left in the dust by the tech giants are starting to make a comeback among investors, too, including telecommunications, real estate and consumer staples. It is not clear where they go from here, but it is not unusual for stocks caught in an anti-bubble one decade to perform well the next.In the 1980s, Japan was widely predicted to be the next dominant economic superpower. Though it accounted for only 15 percent of global economic output, Japan was sucking in nearly half of all the money invested in stock markets worldwide. The United States, where the economy was almost twice as large and growing robustly, was struggling in vain to escape the shadow cast by Japan. It was trapped in that era\u2019s anti-bubble. By the end of the decade, however, the Japan bubble had popped and the United States was poised to take center stage. The next big bubble rose in the United States during the tech craze of the late 1990s, which generated another series of anti-bubbles, particularly in companies and countries that relied for growth on commodities like oil and iron ore. By the end of the decade, big oil companies and commodity-driven economies from Brazil to Russia, rocked by sinking prices, had fallen off the radar of global investors, and their stock prices were dragging bottom. Though the boom in this period was lifting a particularly broad segment of companies and countries, anti-bubbles were as usual forming in overlooked corners of the world. Tech firms, in particular, had been shunned since the dot-com bust, and their stocks were lagging behind the rest of the market. A decade later, dot-com survivors like Apple and Amazon were at the forefront of a new tech boom. If the mood of a bubble is manic, as overexcited investors drive daily trading volumes skyward, the mood of an anti-bubble is the opposite, marked by little trading at all. In a telling sign of the current anti-bubbles, the markets of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia together trade less than $1 billion a day, compared with about $6 billion a day for Apple alone.There are many more anti-bubbles. Poland is a high-growth economy with low debt and a small deficit that is also light on technology companies. Yet among emerging markets, Poland continues to stumble along at lows last seen in the early 1990s, when it was struggling to recover from the fall of Communism. Mexico is another economy facing no obvious threat of financial crisis. Yet money has fled its stock market, helping to drive the peso close to lows last seen during the \u201ctequila crisis\u201d of 1994.The bright side of anti-bubbles is that they are very cheap places to go on vacation. In Mexico City, travelers can get a fancy hotel room for the equivalent of $80, a fancy meal for $15.Anti-bubbles share one thing with bubbles: They don\u2019t last. Eventually, people recognize that prices are out of whack, and adjust accordingly. They go back to looking for inexpensive growth stories, and find them among the forgotten countries and companies.Bubbles are compelling drama, in which the lead characters are always racing excitedly toward a sudden fall. Much less has been written about anti-bubbles, which are in their way equally compelling tales of underdogs moving quietly toward surprising comebacks. The big book on anti-bubbles doesn\u2019t yet exist, but this would be a good moment for it to be written.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Fall for Facebook\u2019s \u2018China Argument\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerica\u2019s global dominance in technology requires fierce competition at home, not the coddling of monopolies.Mr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust.Over the last year or so, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and other American tech leaders have issued a stark warning to those who want to see more competition in the industry. It goes something like this: \u201cWe understand that we\u2019ve made mistakes. But don\u2019t you realize that if you damage us, you\u2019ll just be handing over the future to China? Unlike America, China is standing behind its tech firms, because it knows that the competition is global, and it wants to win.\u201dBut to accept this argument would be a mistake, for it betrays and ignores hard-won lessons about the folly of an industrial policy centered on \u201cnational champions,\u201d especially in the tech sector. What Facebook is really asking for is to be embraced and protected as America\u2019s very own social media monopolist, bravely doing battle overseas. But both history and basic economics suggest we do much better trusting that fierce competition at home yields stronger industries overall.That\u2019s the lesson from the history of Japanese-American tech competition. During the 1970s and into the \u201980s, it was widely believed that Japan was threatening the United States for supremacy in technology markets. The Japanese giant NEC was a serious challenger to IBM in the mainframe market; Sony was running over consumer electronics, joined by powerful firms like Panasonic and Toshiba. These companies enjoyed the support of the Japanese state, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which pursued a nationalistic industrial policy thought to be infallible.That\u2019s the risk of a governmental embrace of companies like Facebook, Apple and Google. While they may now seem as extraordinary as IBM did in the 1970s, they might not seem that way a decade from now. And if no one can imagine doing social networking better than Facebook, remember that no one dreamed that the personal computer, once little more than a toy for hobbyists, would displace the mighty mainframe.If we give these companies a pass when it comes to antitrust enforcement, allowing them to dominate their markets and buy up their competitors, America may lose what has been its signature advantage: its willingness to allow the new to replace the old, to accept rebellion and change \u2014 the industrial version of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s cycle of rebellion and the \u201cblood of patriots.\u201dAnd then, as Zuckerberg has prophesied, the future of tech may very well belong to China after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple to Add $1 Billion Campus in Austin, Tex., in Broad U.S. Hiring Push", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company, which has 90,000 workers in the United States, also plans to open 1,000-worker operations in San Diego, Seattle and Culver City, Calif., and add hundreds of employees in offices in New York, Pittsburgh and Boulder, Colo., in the next three years.\u201cApple is proud to bring new investment, jobs and opportunity to cities across the United States and to significantly deepen our quarter-century partnership with the city and people of Austin,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Apple has been criticized for years for not doing enough for the American economy because it has made most of its products in China and stashed most of its profits abroad to avoid tax payments in the United States.A provision in the code allowed for a one-time repatriation of corporate cash held abroad at a lower tax rate than what would have been paid under the previous tax plan. Apple used it to bring back $252 billion that it had stashed abroad.Mr. Trump, who had chided Apple over various issues in the past, reacted to the January announcement by praising the company while crediting his own policies for getting it to make the investments.In September, though, Mr. Trump took aim at Apple again over jobs after the company told trade officials in a letter that the administration\u2019s tariffs would affect a wide range of products.\u201cMake your products in the United States instead of China,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cStart building new plants now.\u201dNone of the new positions announced by Apple on Thursday appeared to involve manufacturing.Unlike Amazon, whose competition for a new headquarters was highly publicized, Apple has been relatively quiet about its expansion plans. The company opened its own new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., last year.The new 133-acre campus in Austin will initially employ 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support. It will ultimately have the capacity for up to 15,000 workers. Apple said it expected that its expanded presence in Austin, where it already employs 6,000 people, would make it the area\u2019s largest private employer.Apple said it had applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County. Those rebates would be in the tens of millions of dollars over 15 years, said a person familiar with the application, who declined to be named because the negotiations are private.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas hailed Apple\u2019s decision on Thursday as \u201ca testament to the high-quality work force and unmatched economic environment that Texas offers.\u201dCities and states are competing to lure high-paying tech jobs that can improve their economies and generate tax revenue.But tech companies, which rank among the world\u2019s largest by market value, carry downsides like gentrification and higher living costs that can push out longtime residents. Austin, like Seattle and the Bay Area, has experienced those effects in recent years as Apple and other technology companies expand.Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said the concentration of tech jobs in a few metropolitan areas was widening a gap between big cities and the rest of the country. He said the dynamic was contributing to the nation\u2019s political divide.\u201cThe digitalization of the economy is exaggerating the urban-rural divide,\u201d said Mr. Sundararajan, who studies the technology industry\u2019s role in the economy. \u201cThe part of the digital revolution that I have been waiting for, that I haven\u2019t seen kick in in the United States, is the large platforms enabling opportunities for individuals who may not have high-tech skills.\u201dJack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France, Not Waiting for European Union, to Tax U.S. Tech Firms as \u201919 Starts", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrance has been working with other countries on a European Union-wide digital tax on companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but some members of the bloc have balked at the proposal.On Monday, he moved up that date.\u201cThe tax will be introduced no matter what on Jan. 1, and it will be for the whole of 2019,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said. A week ago, he urged the public to \u201cfight with me\u201d on the issue in an interview on French radio, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for these companies to pay the taxes that they owe.\u201dThe tax, Mr. Le Maire said, would most likely cover not only the companies\u2019 direct sales in France, but also revenue from online marketplaces and the resale of private data. He declined to discuss other details, including the means for introducing the tax or the rate of taxation.France\u2019s decision to go its own way for now did not appear to derail the European Commission\u2019s proposal.A commission spokesman noted in a statement that \u201cabout a dozen E.U. countries already have or are considering a form of taxation of digital activities.\u201dThose countries include Britain, where officials recently unveiled a proposal to impose a 2 percent tax on revenue that social media platforms, search engines and online marketplaces earn there. Spain is introducing its own 3 percent tax on online advertising services, brokering services and the resale of personal data.But, the commission spokesman noted, \u201cthe announcement by France does make it even more urgent for the E.U. to agree on a common digital services tax.\u201dMr. Le Maire said he still hoped that a union-wide agreement could be reached by March.Amazon, Apple and Twitter declined to comment. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment, although the director general of Google France told reporters this month, \u201cGoogle will pay if a tax on revenue is put in place\u201d in France or in the European Union.Large technology companies have long avoided paying taxes comparable to other businesses in the European countries where they operate.Facebook, for instance, paid corporate taxes of \u20ac1.9 million in 2017 in France on stated revenue of \u20ac55.9 million. The company has more than 34 million users in the country, and much of its revenue was logged in Ireland. Apple paid around \u20ac19 million in 2017 taxes in France.Amazon, too, does business across the union, but has benefited by having its regional headquarters in the low-tax haven of Luxembourg. The European Commission estimates that the online retailer and other companies pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the roughly 23 percent paid by traditional businesses.The big companies are not alone in opposing the commission\u2019s digital tax proposal. European start-ups have said it would handicap an expanding tech sector in the region that has struggled to match the scale of markets in the United States and China.France and Germany responded to such concerns by narrowing the proposal to include only larger technology companies, particularly advertising-focused companies like Facebook and Google. Those changes have not mollified everyone.France\u2019s imposition of a digital tax is one front in a wider campaign in Europe to target American technology companies amid growing concerns about their power and influence in society as well as their business practices.Germany has enacted a law requiring Facebook and Twitter to remove flagged hate speech within 24 hours or face fines. France has passed rules allowing judges to order the removal of misinformation around elections.Regulators at the European Commission have also targeted Google, Apple and Amazon for antitrust violations, imposing billions of euros in fines and orders to return unpaid taxes.The French government sued Google this year for \u20ac1.12 billion in taxes it claims the company avoided paying on advertising revenue earned. A Paris court ruled that the government could not collect because Google had declared that the revenue belonged to an Irish subsidiary. The government is appealing.Amazon reached a settlement in May over a long-running dispute with French tax authorities, who had been seeking nearly \u20ac200 million euros in back taxes, interest and penalties for the 2006 to 2010 fiscal years in relation to \u201cthe allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions.\u201d The government did not disclose the size of the settlement.And last year, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Adam Satariano contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistI have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime \u2014 and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent \u2014 he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus \u2014 but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the \u201cNext America\u2019\u2019?\u201cYou know William Gibson\u2019s line, \u2018The future is already here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed\u2019? Well, the future is here, and now it\u2019s starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,\u2019\u2019 Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of \u201cIndispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,\u2019\u2019 remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. \u201cThe basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.\u2019\u2019This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass.Where do I start? A good place is with 5G \u2014 fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around \u2026 2020.Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 like deploying self-driving vehicles \u2014 requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor.As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, \u201cThink of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.\u2019\u2019It could be as revolutionary as the internet. But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides.An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently \u201cabout 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.\u2019\u2019But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be \u201ccontinuous lifelong learning\u2019\u2019 \u2014 because when the pace of change is accelerating, \u201cthe fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition.\u201dThat means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 we will need new national trampolines.We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time.Tennessee has already done that.These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services?\u201cBut that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for \u2018free\u2019 in exchange for personal data,\u201d Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. \u201cThis has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.\u2019\u2019Just one person \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain \u2014 and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros \u2014 should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look.Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump\u2019s tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We\u2019ve had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we\u2019ve never run one so huge during a boom.That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare \u2014 just when all the baby boomers are retiring.In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more \u2014 from climate change to zoning rules \u2014 and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won\u2019t let us do that again. The Next America won\u2019t wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Data Scandals Stoke Criticism That a Privacy Watchdog Too Rarely Bites", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers, consumer advocates and even former commission officials were clamoring for tough action against Facebook, arguing that it had violated an earlier F.T.C. consent decree barring it from misleading users about how their information was shared.But the enforcement official, James A. Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm \u2014 echoing Facebook\u2019s own argument \u2014 cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm\u2019s reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.Almost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country\u2019s de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.\u2019s future.\u201cThey have been asleep at the switch,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.\u201dThe agency \u2014 overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president\u2019s party \u2014 is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.\u201cIf the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,\u201d Mr. Simons said in a statement. \u201cOur investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.\u201dThe agency\u2019s defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.As the federal government\u2019s main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.But it is hampered by its relatively small size \u2014 about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency\u2019s enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn\u2019t have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.\u201cThey have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,\u201d said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.F.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as \u201cKidVid.\u201d Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.\u2019s power to issue new regulations.Even today, \u201cin just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,\u201d said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.\u201cThey think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. \u201cThey have an institutional culture of deference.\u201dNor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.(The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebook used the data.)Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.Ashkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn\u2019t see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi\u2019s data could not identify specific individuals.Ms. Ohlhausen\u2019s staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.With limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should \u201cpursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.\u201dBut that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.Two former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.In recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users\u2019 locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.Mr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm \u201chas dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.\u201dMichael LaForgia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But getting women together could be difficult since they\u2019re often not in the same city, so they developed an online site to allow them, with stylists, to choose.While rents can be high, Ms. Staple says that by employing stylists who advise customers both online and in person, they avoid paying employees who might be idle when no customers are present. As a result of this approach, the physical locations have been a boon, not a drag, on earnings, she said, although she declined to disclose any financial results. The company, she said, plans on expanding in 2019 to offer bridal gowns as well.Like Brideside, Anomalie grew out of frustration with wedding dress shopping. Ms. Means, an engineer with an M.B.A., had been working for Apple and traveling frequently to Shanghai. There, she discovered that Suzhou, China, referred to as the global wedding dress capital because of the proliferation of specialized manufacturers, was only 90 minutes away. There she designed her own gown, adding the long sleeves she had not been able to find, for her winter wedding. Her friends, as well as friends of friends, she said, wanted her help so they could do the same.She and Mr. Means, whom she met at Harvard Business School, began to think that they had a promising idea for a start-up. While neither had been interested in e-commerce, let alone women\u2019s apparel, they had a source and a potential customer base, so they cobbled together money and set to work.The process is straightforward. For brides working with Anomalie designers, the process from initial consultation to a finished dress takes a minimum of six months. Brides are encouraged to add personal, sometimes quirky, touches. While Ms. Means declined to disclose financial results, she said that approximately 75 percent of women who talk to Anomalie\u2019s in-house stylists order dresses.The couple knows that efficient manufacturing is a key to profitability. \u201cWe\u2019re finding that we have blocks that are core to every dress we make, but it\u2019s the neckline, lace and other embellishments that are added at the end that make the dresses unique.\u201d That, Ms. Means said, makes it feasible to scale because there is some repetition, even though the dresses differ.It might not seem intuitive, but when a moderately priced wedding dress frequently costs more than $1,000, renting from an e-commerce retailer fulfills the \u201csomething borrowed\u201d part of the good luck adage and saves money as well. And, especially when brides know that almost no one wears a wedding dress a second time, renting seems like a sure bet for some. Rent the Runway doesn\u2019t offer classic gowns, but rather long or short dresses that can work for less formal weddings.\u201cAt this time, we don\u2019t rent traditional bridal gowns, as we know many brides want their wedding day dresses tailored, and we don\u2019t have that option with Rent the Runway at the moment,\u201d Becky Hyman, the company\u2019s general manager of reserve who oversees the bridal selection, wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from brides that they\u2019d love to have the option to rent a wedding gown, so you never know what we will do in the future; if the demand is there, nothing is ruled out.\u201dThe company has added new services for its wedding line, like an at-home fitting with a \u201cbackup size and backup style for every look,\u201d Ms. Hyman said.The company, owned by the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, had significant debt, which inhibited its ability to change along with the current wedding market. In a court hearing, one of the lawyers representing David\u2019s, Natasha Labovitz, said, \u201cDavid\u2019s Bridal has needed to address its capital structure so it can adapt to the current market conditions and ultimately grow into new areas that match the millennial generation that is coming of age and getting married.\u201dReducing its debt through bankruptcy may help the company adjust to the new landscape. \u201cWe recognize that the bridal industry has been turned on its head,\u201d said Lori Conley, a senior vice president for merchandising, design and product development at the company.\u201cBarns are the new ballroom,\u201d she said, referring to the so-called casualization of weddings. Wedding dresses, she said, have evolved to reflect the venue for the reception as well as the increase in destination weddings.Ultimately, it\u2019s all about making wedding parties happy. At Anomalie, for example, the company offers a full refund if the bride-to-be isn\u2019t happy.As Ms. Means said, \u201cAt the end of the day, if we\u2019re not making dresses women want, we don\u2019t have a business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Court Says Apple Infringed on Qualcomm Patents", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA two-year legal battle between Apple and its chip supplier, Qualcomm, reached a new level of contention on Monday when Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered Apple to stop selling older iPhone models in China.The court ruling is the latest turn in the two companies\u2019 fight over Apple\u2019s use of Qualcomm technology in iPhones. But Apple and Qualcomm disagreed on the impact the decision will have on iPhone sales in China.Qualcomm said a Chinese court ruled on Nov. 30 that Apple had infringed on two Qualcomm patents and issued a preliminary injunction that bars Apple from selling the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X in China. The ruling did not apply to Apple\u2019s three newest iPhones: the XS, the XS Max and the XR.Apple said in a statement, however, that it continued to sell all iPhone models in China.\u201cQualcomm\u2019s effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,\u201d an Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, said. He added that in the Chinese court case, Qualcomm had challenged Apple on three patents it had never raised before, including one that had already been invalidated.Late Monday in China, Apple continued to sell four of the seven iPhone models affected by the ruling \u2014 the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus \u2014 on its Chinese website, as well as its newer models.Apple\u2019s stock price was up less than 1 percent on Monday. Qualcomm\u2019s stock rose 2.2 percent.A slowdown in iPhone sales has contributed to a roughly 25 percent slide in Apple\u2019s share price since the company last released quarterly results on Nov. 1. The ruling also adds to developments that have worsened trade tensions between the United States and China, including the recent arrest of the chief financial officer of the Chinese electronics giant Huawei.\u201cThe hits keep coming,\u201d said Tom Forte, an Apple analyst at D. A. Davidson, referring to the string of negative headlines for the company. He added that the Chinese ruling was not as worrisome as other recent news because it affected only older smartphones and could still be resolved.It is possible that Apple would be able to sell older iPhones if they were running on newer software. But Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement that the court ruling wasn\u2019t specific to the phones\u2019 software. He said Qualcomm would ask the Chinese courts to enforce the order.\u201cApple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us,\u201d he said.Qualcomm, which has long sold key communications chips to Apple but has been excluded from its latest models, has filed a series of patent suits against the smartphone giant in multiple countries. Those lawsuits came after Apple filed suit in early 2017 challenging Qualcomm\u2019s practices in licensing its patents.The ruling in China involved two Qualcomm patents. One lets consumers adjust and reformat the size and appearance of photographs. The other manages applications using a touch screen when viewing, navigating and dismissing applications, Qualcomm said.A Qualcomm spokeswoman said Apple could ask the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court to reconsider its orders within 10 days of being served with them. There is no other appeal process. Apple cannot post a bond or pay a fine and continue infringing the two patents, she said.Apple said it had filed a request for \u201creconsideration\u201d with the court on Monday, the first step in appealing the preliminary injunction.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, has said he expects that victories in its patent cases would help persuade Apple to agree to settle the legal disputes.Qualcomm is the largest supplier of modem chips that allow smartphones to communicate over cellular networks. More than half of its profits have historically come from patent license fees it charges to phone makers, which have in turn complained to regulatory authorities and sued Qualcomm.Apple sued Qualcomm in January 2017, accusing it of monopolistic practices that harm Apple and the industry. The Federal Trade Commission raised similar charges in a case filed against Qualcomm the same month. Qualcomm has insisted its practices are legal.Apple has gradually reduced its reliance on Qualcomm, turning to Intel for modem chips in its latest iPhones.News of the Chinese court\u2019s ruling emerged during a broad skirmish between China and the United States over trade. The United States has cracked down on ZTE and Huawei, two Chinese telecommunications giants, for illicit activities. And China scuttled Qualcomm\u2019s proposed acquisition of NXP, a Dutch chip maker.Some business leaders in the United States have been bracing for retribution from China after the arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in Canada, fearing that American executives in China could be harassed.The Trump administration said last week that it did not anticipate such retaliation and expressed hope that the situation, which it described as a criminal justice matter, would not derail trade talks.Alan Rappeport and Raymond Zhong contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

As one former Apple engineer put it, \"It wasn't great for business.\"Supported byIn 1988, when Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e took a close look at Apple\u2019s \u201chighly automated\u201d Macintosh factory in Fremont, Calif., what he saw was not pretty. His experience assembling a Macintosh computer display and then stuffing chips into a computer motherboard is an important part of the story behind the artful language on the iPhone box \u2014 \u201cDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.\u201dAfter Apple announced a large new campus in Austin, Tex. \u2014 creating as many as 15,000 jobs, none of them expected to be manufacturing \u2014 it\u2019s worth looking at the company\u2019s flirtation with advanced manufacturing in Silicon Valley in the 1980s. Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, had an abiding fascination with the tradition of Henry Ford and the original mass manufacturing of automobiles in Detroit, as well as the high-quality domestic manufacturing capabilities of Japanese companies like Sony. But his efforts to replicate either in California were examples of his rare failures.\u201cSteve had deep convictions about Japanese manufacturing processes,\u201d recalled Randy Battat, who joined Apple as a young electrical engineer and oversaw the introduction of some of the company\u2019s early portable computers. \u201cThe Japanese were heralded as wizards of manufacturing. The idea was to create a factory with just-in-time delivery of zero-defect parts. It wasn\u2019t great for business.\u201dWhat Mr. Gass\u00e9e found several years after Mr. Jobs was forced out of the company, was that the reality of manufacturing was different than the personal computer pioneer\u2019s original dream.Ultimately, the Macintosh factory closed in 1992, in part because it never realized the production volume that Mr. Jobs had envisioned \u2014 such sales numbers for the Mac would only come later.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a manufacturing culture,\u201d Mr. Gass\u00e9e said of the nation\u2019s high-technology heartland, \u201cmeaning the substrate, the schooling, the apprentices, the subcontractors.\u201dIn 1990, just a mile and half from where he had built the original Mac factory, he created another $10 million one to manufacture his Next Inc. personal workstation. Like the early Macintosh, however, he was never able to make flashy jet-black Next machines in quantities to support a Silicon Valley-based assembly operation.That failure taught Mr. Jobs the lesson. He returned to Apple in 1997, and the next year, he hired Tim Cook as Apple\u2019s senior vice president for worldwide operations. Mr. Cook had mastered the art of global manufacturing supply chains, first in IBM\u2019s personal computer business and then at Compaq Computer.\u201cWhen I started my career, all my flights were to Japan,\u201d said Tony Fadell, one of the hardware designers of the iPod and iPhone at Apple. \u201cThen all my flights went Korea, then Taiwan, then China.\u201dThrough the 1980s and 1990s, there were many people who predicted the manufacturing flight would mean the death of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Workers Got Paid in Company Stock. They Used It to Agitate for Change.", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley technology firms are known for giving stock to their workers, a form of compensation that often helps employees feel invested in their companies.At Amazon, more than a dozen employees who had received stock grants recently exercised their rights as shareholders. In late November and early December, they filed identical shareholder petitions asking the e-commerce giant to release a comprehensive plan addressing climate change.Their filing appears to be the first time that tech employees have led their own shareholder proposal, according to activist investors. In the proposal, which will be voted on at Amazon\u2019s annual shareholder meeting next spring, employees asked the company\u2019s board to say how it would respond to climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.\u201cWe realized we could use our position as employees and our power and our rights as shareholders to bring visibility of this issue to the board and the top leaders of this company,\u201d said Eliza Pan, a program manager who has worked at Amazon for five years and is one of the employees who signed on to the proposal.Ms. Pan, who earned Amazon shares as part of her compensation package, said workers must own at least $2,000 in stock for a year to file a shareholder proposal. \u201cWe had this power, and we wanted to leverage that power,\u201d she said.The move by Amazon\u2019s employees builds upon similar activism at Google this year. In March, its workers were part of a shareholder petition by Zevin Asset Management that sought to link executive compensation to diversity and inclusion goals. Google\u2019s employees did not directly file the proposal, but joined Zevin and presented it at the annual shareholder meeting of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.The proposal was ultimately voted down, but Pat Miguel Tomaino, the director of socially responsible investing at Zevin, said the firm planned to work with Google employees to resubmit it for the 2019 shareholder meeting.\u201cWorkers are looking at who holds power and where changes can be made,\u201d said Yana Calou, an engagement manager at Coworker.org, an organization that allows colleagues to start campaigns together. \u201cWorkers are shareholders themselves, and risks to workers and users are often risks to shareholders, so there is a natural alliance of shared interests.\u201dAmazon declined to comment on its employees\u2019 advocacy, but it said it was taking steps to address climate change.\u201cWe have set a goal to power our global infrastructure with 100 percent renewable energy and are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency innovations,\u201d said Kara Hurst, director of worldwide sustainability at Amazon. The company, based in Seattle, has installed solar energy systems at 25 of its fulfillment centers and has streamlined its packing process to reduce its use of packing materials, she added.Google declined to comment on its employees\u2019 participation in shareholder proposals.Shareholder proposals have in the past been used largely by activist investment firms and others to advocate for changes.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly unusual to see this, where employees are taking a stand in regard to the company they\u2019re working for,\u201d said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a wealth-management fund that focuses on climate issues.Tech employees, more than in many other industries, have a ready-made way to become activist shareholders because of how they are paid. Google, Facebook, Apple and tech start-ups such as Airbnb have all made stock a component of compensation. At privately held companies, tech workers often get stock options, which give them the option to buy shares at a set price. Publicly traded companies tend to grant restricted stock options that automatically transfer shares to employees over a period of time.\u201cBecause so much value is being created, or we hope is going to be created, it\u2019s appealing to employees to receive some potential part of that pop or growth in value,\u201d said Mary Russell, a lawyer and founder of Stock Option Counsel, a legal firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that advises tech employees on their compensation. \u201cThe culture of the companies is that we need to do this to incentivize people to build the value of the company.\u201dBut by paying employees this way, tech companies open themselves up to this kind of shareholder advocacy, she said. \u201cThey are setting themselves up to have quite a large group of stockholders who would of course, like any other stockholder, have the right to bring forward a shareholder proposal,\u201d Ms. Russell said.Employee shareholder proposals may ultimately not be effective since shareholder-led proposals are often shot down. And because tech founders often possess a large chunk of the shares in their companies \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and its largest shareholder, owns 16 percent of the company; the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have about 51 percent of voting shares in Alphabet \u2014 the proposals have little chance of passing without founder support.Tech employees said it was worth taking that risk. Shareholder proposals often gain attention because they are distributed to stockholders and are included in annual proxy statements, the employees say, and they give workers a way to raise their grievances directly to the board, rather than just to managers.\u201cBanding together with other shareholders amplifies my voice and makes all of our voices more powerful,\u201d said Ms. Pan of Amazon.\u201cIt\u2019s important to make change and work for change wherever you happen to be, and I happen to be an employee at Amazon,\u201d said Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer who is backing the climate change proposal and who has received Amazon shares as part of her compensation.She said it was important for employees to publicly demand a plan. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting the public, it\u2019s affecting business,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Patreon Bars Anti-Feminist for Racist Speech, Inciting Revolt", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySam Harris, the polemical atheist neuroscientist known for his popular podcast \u201cWaking Up,\u201d was making tens of thousands of dollars a month from fans who donated to him through Patreon, a crowdfunding site.That stopped this month. On Dec. 6, Patreon kicked the anti-feminist polemic Carl Benjamin, who works under the name Sargon of Akkad, off its site for using racist language on YouTube. That same week, it removed the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos a day after he opened an account.\u201cThese recent expulsions seem more readily explained by political bias,\u201d Mr. Harris wrote to his followers.The furor is a microcosm of the conflicts that are playing out across the internet as technology platforms try to limit the spread of hateful speech.But as tech platforms try to get a handle on the issue, they are stoking the ire of their content creators, many of whom brand themselves as free speech warriors. Some accuse the companies of censorship. Others say the tech sites are biased and that hate speech is an ambiguous term. Now the digital dissent is becoming increasingly widespread, upending even smaller websites.\u201cThe concept of hate speech is irreducibly subjective and vague,\u201d said Nadine Strossen, author of \u201cHate: Why We Should Resist It With Free Speech, Not Censorship.\u201dWhile the site is relatively small, with a little over 100,000 creators and two million people donating monthly to those creators, it has become the de facto paycheck for a cohort of prominent self-styled internet philosophers who eschew or have been ousted from traditional bastions like universities or magazines.Among Patreon\u2019s hodgepodge of creators is the left-leaning podcast group Chapo Trap House, which makes more than $110,000 a month from the site, according to Graphtreon, which tracks Patreon activity. Mr. Peterson, a best-selling author, earns around $66,000 a month from the site. Sex-related content creators are also getting monthly subscribers on Patreon, and a Pokemon Go community is the top earner, making up to $500,000 a month, according to Graphetreon.Patreon takes a highly personal approach to policing speech. While Google and Facebook use algorithms as a first line of defense for questionable content, Patreon has human moderators. They give warnings and reach out to talk to offenders, presenting options for \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201creform.\u201d Some activists hope this will become a model for a better and kinder internet.\u201cThere are no automated takedowns,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cAs a creator myself dealing with these big tech platforms and getting an automated takedown notice, there\u2019s no appeals process. You can\u2019t talk to a human. And I never want to do that.\u201dIf someone has breached Patreon\u2019s policy, the company contacts the offender with a specific plan, which usually involves asking for the content to be removed and for a public apology.The conversations with creators can quickly become complicated, nuanced, and, well, human, she said. Among other challenges, Patreon has to decide what qualifies as a sincere and thorough apology. Still, having human moderators has changed its users\u2019 behaviors more than simply deleting accounts would, Ms. Hart said.\u201cWe hand-hold creators, and we work with them one on one, and nearly every creator reforms \u2014 and so it\u2019s quite a successful process,\u201d she said.The work takes up a large amount of resources. Ms. Hart said around 10 percent of Patreon employees are dedicated to her team.On Dec. 6, the company told Mr. Benjamin that it would freeze his account and that he could appeal. Mr. Benjamin objected and said the video in question should not fall under Patreon\u2019s rules because it was on YouTube.For Mr. Benjamin, the timing was surprising. \u201cMy brand has been politically incorrect for years,\u201d he said in a video he later posted to his YouTube channel called \u201cThe Patreon Witch Trials.\u201dMr. Benjamin, who did not respond to requests for comment, has 870,000 subscribers on YouTube and had more than 3,000 subscribers on Patreon, from which he had been making around $12,000 a month. Many of his videos show just a static cartoon or a series of images, with his voice speaking against movements for gender equality.More recently, Mr. Benjamin has moved from the fringe toward the heart of the new right. In October, he posted an hourlong interview with Steve Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist.Mr. Benjamin did not respond to attempts to engage him in the reform process, Ms. Hart said.\u201cHis response to us when we told him about the reform process was to nitpick and say, \u2018I was being anti-Nazi,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hart said. \u201cYou cannot say those words on our platform. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re directing them at.\u201dHis removal from Patreon immediately stirred up others on the site.\u201cI think the most likely outcome, if this continues, is that all contentious speech or behavior will put the speaker or actor at risk of serious financial and social sanctions, and strip them of all defense,\u201d Mr. Peterson wrote in an email.Mr. Rubin and Mr. Peterson said they plan to start their own version of Patreon, which will be less censorious. Mr. Peterson said his Patreon subscriptions had dropped to around 7,500, from about 10,000 over the summer, according to Graphtreon.And while many internet creators argue that Silicon Valley is trying to censor free speech, what the companies are doing is legal, said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cThe First Amendment right is on the side of the company,\u201d she said.\u201cYou can use a press debacle like this to drum up your community and rile people up and get them to support a cause,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cWe welcome competition.\u201dIn his exit note from Patreon, Mr. Harris, who gathered his fan base as a pugnacious atheist and fierce critic of Islam, wrote that he wanted his business interests to be freed from the site. He singled out Ms. Hart\u2019s team.\u201cI consider it no longer tenable to expose any part of my podcast funding to the whims of Patreon\u2019s \u2018Trust and Safety\u2019 committee,\u201d Mr. Harris wrote. He added a link to his own website, where fans can enter their credit card information and choose a monthly contribution.Advertisement"}

Now these giants are increasingly outgrowing their West Coast roots.Driven by a limited pool of skilled workers and the ballooning cost of living in their home bases of Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as President Trump\u2019s shifting immigration policies, the companies are aggressively taking their talent hunt across the United States and elsewhere. And they are coalescing particularly around a handful of urban areas that are already winners in the new knowledge-based economy, including New York City, Washington, Boston and Austin, Tex.\u201cThey\u2019re expanding out,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cTech talent is in very short supply. So if these tech companies want to grow and flourish, they need to find talent in other parts of the country.\u201dThe chase for tech talent has been global for decades, and Silicon Valley\u2019s older companies have had big offices all over the world for years.

Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies three years ago, has had large outposts in Idaho and Oregon.Amazon, Apple and Google are now increasingly adopting the same strategy as they hire for growth and pursue the brightest minds in new technologies, in an effort to outmuscle one another. Over the past two years, Amazon\u2019s work force has doubled to 613,300 employees; Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, has increased its head count by 35 percent, to 94,300; and Apple has grown nearly 14 percent, to 132,000 workers.Like Cambridge, England, some cities in the United States have also become known for a particular area of tech expertise, in what has become a modern remake of the country\u2019s industrial era, when cities came to specialize in the production of cars, steel and coal.The search for talent outside Silicon Valley and Seattle has also been prompted by issues in the companies\u2019 hometowns, which have not built enough housing to keep up with their growing work forces. San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Seattle are the four most expensive major cities in the country based on home values, according to data from Zillow. The median home in San Francisco is valued at almost $1.4 million and more than $733,000 in Seattle. Questions also abound over the quality and funding of the areas\u2019 public school systems.\u201cEvery day as a C.E.O., you have employees coming to you saying, \u2018I don\u2019t make enough to buy a house for my family,\u2019 and you already feel like you are paying through the nose,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the real estate site based in Seattle. \u201cAlmost everyone is looking at other affordable places where you can open an office.\u201dThat has helped push some tech companies into building major outposts in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economics professor, said that even if H-1B workers were to come through in abundance, it would still make sense to put them in cheaper cities, like Austin. He said, \u201c$100,000 goes a lot further in Austin than in Silicon Valley.\u201dMore than 44 percent of all digital-service jobs in the United States were located in just 10 metro areas last year, including Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, as well as New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston, according to research by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 2015 to 2017, only nine metro areas increased their share of the nation\u2019s tech work force, including the West Coast tech hubs, as well as Austin and Denver.\u201cThe tech industry concentrates in very few markets,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cOur biggest concern is how do we make sure more cities, particularly midsized cities in the middle of the country, can be players in the tech economy?\u201dAmazon, which has about 45,000 people at its Seattle headquarters, has also opened 16 tech hubs in the United States. About 85 percent of those satellite employees are in six booming, highly educated urban areas \u2014 the Bay Area, Washington region, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. Each has at least 1,000 workers.(The bulk of Amazon\u2019s North American work force is made up of the more than 250,000 people who are dispersed in the company\u2019s roughly 110 warehouses around Canada and the United States and who make less money than their white-collar colleagues.)Apple, which has been criticized by President Trump for not creating more domestic jobs, said on Thursday that its plans for Austin included a new 133-acre campus that will initially have 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations and other functions. It will ultimately be able to accommodate up to 15,000 workers.Apple already has about 6,000 workers in Austin. The company said it applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County.A person familiar with Apple\u2019s decision to expand outside Cupertino, Calif., where it just opened a new $5 billion headquarters, said the move into Austin was partly driven by the extreme housing prices in the Bay Area, as well as its aim to find more talent and add more diversity and military veterans to its work force.The company added that it also planned to open 1,000-worker operations in Seattle, San Diego, and Culver City, Calif., and to add hundreds of employees in Pittsburgh, Boston, New York and Boulder, Colo., over the next three years.\u201cIn a sense, what we\u2019re seeing is tech becoming a normal industry,\u201d Mr. Glaeser said, \u201can industry that\u2019s not located in one incredibly expensive place.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco and Karen Weise from Seattle.

{"Headline": "TikTok, a Chinese Video App, Brings Fun Back to Social Media", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftAbout an hour after downloading TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, I experienced a bizarre sensation, one I haven\u2019t felt in a long time while on the internet. The knot in my chest loosened, my head felt injected with helium, and the corners of my mouth crept upward into a smile.TikTok \u2014 a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d \u2014 is a refreshing outlier in the social media universe. A so-called challenge video on TikTok, from the user @spellmantwinz, which encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song.There are no ads. There\u2019s no news, unless you count learning about viral dance crazes. There are few preening Instagram models hawking weight-loss tea, and a distinct lack of crazy uncles posting Infowars clips.Instead, TikTok \u2014 a Chinese-made app that was known as Musical.ly until ByteDance, the Chinese internet conglomerate, acquired the company in 2017 and merged it with a video app it owned \u2014 has a simple premise. Users create short videos set to music, often lip-syncing along, dancing or acting out short skits. The app contains templates and visual effects to spice up the videos. There is also a live-streaming feature that allows users to send virtual \u201cgifts\u201d to their favorite creators, which can be bought with real money. The rest works like any other social app \u2014 followers, hashtags, likes and comments.It doesn\u2019t sound like much. But, somehow, it adds up to what might well be the only truly pleasant social network in existence.I feel comfortable making that call because I go on social networks for a living, and I have spent thousands of hours wading through an unholy slurry of Twitter spammers, Instagram scammers, teenage YouTube fascists and baby boomers whose brains have been turned to pudding by too many Facebook memes.TikTok has none of that. Instead, it\u2019s that rarest of internet creatures: a place where people can let down their guards, act silly with their friends and sample the fruits of human creativity without being barraged by abusive trolls or algorithmically amplified misinformation. It\u2019s a throwback to a time before the commercialization of internet influence, when web culture consisted mainly of harmless weirdos trying to make each other laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s a safe haven for people that are seeing the world on fire and being like, \u2018I need silliness,\u2019\u201d he said.TikTok\u2019s global head of marketing, Stefan Heinrich, said in a statement that the company\u2019s mission was to \u201ccapture and present the world\u2019s creativity, knowledge and moments that matter, directly from the mobile phone.\u201dBefore I go any further, let\u2019s get one thing out of the way: If you\u2019re reading this, you are almost certainly too old to feel at home on TikTok. The company declined to provide information about its users, but judging from what\u2019s on the platform, the median TikTok user seems to hover in the midteens. TikTok is full of acne-studded faces, barely concealed tween angst and impenetrable youth-culture references. As far as I can tell, there is no way for adults to use it without feeling as if they are chaperoning a high school dance.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a really popular, cool site, but you also have the issue of kids being significantly too young for it,\u201d said James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews tech products for families. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the content on TikTok isn\u2019t O.K. for your 15-year-old. It\u2019s what happens to your 6- or 7-year-old.\u201dWhile using TikTok, I never saw examples of bullying or harassment. (Both of which are prohibited by TikTok\u2019s community guidelines, as is sexually explicit content.) There are, however, a decent number of videos featuring teenage girls dancing suggestively \u2014 which, if you are a 31-year-old newspaper columnist and not a 16-year-old boy, is fairly unsettling.A TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement that promoting safety and positivity on the platform is \u201cour top priority.\u201d She added, \u201cwe periodically add to and adjust our protective measures, policies and moderation efforts to support the well-being of our users.\u201dIs TikTok a Facebook killer? No, probably not. For all the variety in its videos, it is still a fairly limited app, with a more narrow appeal than more populist social platforms.But by purposely limiting its features, by resisting the temptation to monetize its users aggressively and by keeping trolls and bullies off its platform, TikTok has done something truly impressive \u2014 it has built a social network that is genuinely fun to use.There might be a lesson there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the F.T.C. Is Taking a New Look at Facebook Privacy ", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a yearlong string of news reports that have called Facebook\u2019s data-sharing practices into question, federal regulators are taking a hard look at how the social media company handles the personal information of its users.It is not the first time Facebook has drawn government scrutiny. About seven years ago, after charges were leveled by the Federal Trade Commission, the company made an agreement with the agency to overhaul its privacy practices. That agreement, called a consent decree, provides a road map for how the F.T.C. is likely to scrutinize Facebook over the coming months.In 2007, Facebook introduced Facebook Beacon, a program that broadcast details on users\u2019 online purchases to their friends, initially allowing users to opt out of sharing their purchases only on a case-by-case basis. At the end of 2009, a coalition of nonprofit consumer and privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook\u2019s handling of user data. In 2011, the F.T.C. filed charges against Facebook that said the company had deceived consumers about their privacy.The F.T.C.\u2019s complaint charged Facebook with a number of deceptive privacy practices. Among them:\u25a0 Facebook shared users\u2019 personal details with advertisers even though the company had promised not to do so, the agency said.\u25a0 Facebook allowed third-party apps that users had installed to have access to nearly all of their personal data \u2014 even though Facebook had stated the apps could obtain only the personal information they needed to operate, the agency said.\u25a0 The agency said Facebook claimed it certified the security practices of apps participating in its \u201cVerified Apps program,\u201d but the company did not do so.The agency ordered Facebook to put a comprehensive privacy program in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of users\u2019 information and to manage the risks of existing and new products. It also required Facebook over the next 20 years to undergo biennial audits by an independent third party to certify that the privacy program was properly protecting the information of the company\u2019s users.The voter-profiling company obtained the data from a researcher who had offered a personality survey app on Facebook. Although only about 270,000 Facebook users agreed to share their data to participate in the survey, the Facebook platform enabled the app to improperly harvest the personal details of millions of those users\u2019 friends \u2014 consumers who had not agreed to share their information with the survey app, The Times reported.Privacy experts, law professors and at least one former F.T.C. official have argued that Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the survey app from obtaining the data of users\u2019 friends violated the federal consent agreement. So did Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the app developer from sharing both users\u2019 data and the data of users\u2019 friends with Cambridge Analytica, these critics said.They said the Cambridge Analytica episode suggested that Facebook had failed to adequately conduct the risk assessments the agreement required it to do. It also failed to obtain required, explicit consent from users\u2019 friends for the sharing of their data with third parties, the privacy experts said.They also argued that Facebook had failed to operate a comprehensive privacy protection program and take reasonable precautions \u2014 steps the company was obligated to take under the consent decree.Since then, Facebook has made other admissions about privacy problems that experts said could potentially violate the consent agreement or trigger new federal charges of deceptive privacy practices.Facebook said it had developed a privacy program as required by federal regulators and it had not violated the consent decree.\u201cWe are transparent with people about how we use their information and respect people's privacy settings,\u201d Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a privacy program, which ensures we protect people's information, which we continuously evolve to address the privacy risks of our products and services.\u201dMs. Aldous said the company\u2019s privacy program involved more than three dozen control mechanisms \u2014 including a privacy governance team and security teams that \u201censure privacy risks for product launches and major changes are identified, discussed, and escalated for decisions when necessary.\u201dFacebook said it disagreed with The Times\u2019s characterization of its sharing of user data with Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, Samsung, Yahoo and other companies. The social network said device makers used information from Facebook to integrate certain Facebook features on their platforms and agreed not to use that information for their own purposes. The company also said Spotify and other third-party apps had access to users\u2019 Facebook data only after users signed in with their Facebook account in the third-party apps.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Dead Skunk\u2019 Stench From Marijuana Farms Outrages Californians", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARPINTERIA, Calif. \u2014 They call it fresh skunk, the odor cloud or sometimes just the stink.Mike Wondolowski often finds himself in the middle of it. He may be on the chaise longue on his patio, at his computer in the house, or tending to his orange and lemon trees in the garden when the powerful, nauseating stench descends on him.Mr. Wondolowski lives a half-mile away from greenhouses that were originally built to grow daisies and chrysanthemums but now house thousands of marijuana plants, part of a booming \u2014 and pungent \u2014 business seeking to cash in on recreational cannabis, which has been legal in California since January.\u201cIf someone is saying, \u2018Is it really that bad?\u2019 I\u2019ll go find a bunch of skunks and every evening I\u2019ll put them outside your window,\u201d Mr. Wondolowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s just brutal.\u201dWhen Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana in 2016, there were debates about driving under the influence and keeping it away from children. But lawmakers did not anticipate the uproar that would be generated by the funk of millions of flowering cannabis plants.As a result of the stench, residents in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, are suing to ban cannabis operations from their neighborhoods. Mendocino County, farther north, recently created zones banning cannabis cultivation \u2014 the sheriff\u2019s deputy there says the stink is the No. 1 complaint.In Santa Barbara County, cannabis growers confronting the rage of neighbors are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars installing odor-control systems that were designed for garbage dumps.The smell from commercial cannabis farms, which brings to mind a mixture of rotting lemons and sulfur, is nothing like the wafting cloud that might hover over a Phish show, pot farm detractors say.\u201cIt\u2019s as if a skunk, or multiple skunks in a family, were living under our house,\u201d said Grace Guthrie, whose home sits on the site of a former apple orchard outside the town of Sebastopol. Her neighbors grow pot commercially. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t dissipate,\u201d Ms. Guthrie said. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond anything you would imagine.\u201dWhen cannabis odors are at their peak, she and her husband, Robert, sometimes wear respirators, the kind one might put on to handle dangerous chemicals. During Labor Day weekend, relatives came to stay at the house, but cut short their visit because they couldn\u2019t stand the smell.\u201cI can\u2019t be outside more than 30 minutes,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said of peak odor times, when the cannabis buds are flowering and the wind sweeps the smell onto his property. \u201cThe windows are constantly closed. We are trapped inside. There\u2019s no escape.\u201dAfter nearly one year of recreational sales in California, much of the cannabis industry remains underground. Stung by taxes and voluminous paperwork, only around 5 percent of marijuana farmers in the state have licenses, according to Hezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association, a marijuana advocacy group. Sales of legal cannabis are expected to exceed $3 billion this year, only slightly higher than medical marijuana sales from last year. Tax revenues have been lower than expected, and only about one-fifth of California cities allow sales of recreational cannabis. The dream of a fully regulated market seems years off.The ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana passed in 2016 with a comfortable majority of 57 percent. Many of those complaining about cannabis odors say they were among those who supported it. They just don\u2019t want it stinking up their property, they say.\u201cJust because you like bacon doesn\u2019t mean you want to live next to a pig farm,\u201d said Lynda Hopkins, a member of the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors, whose office has been inundated with complaints about the smell.The odor question is also roiling local politics.The donation has not yet been made public, but is seen by some as an effort to offset the damage done by the stench. In an interview, Maureen Foley Claffey, a member of the Carpinteria School Board, said it would send a \u201cconfusing and problematic\u201d message to students to accept it. Ms. Claffey lashed out at the superintendent, Diana Rigby, for soliciting donations from the cannabis industry at a time when members of the community are battling the stink.\u201cAre we that desperate for cash that we are willing to take it from anyone without regard to the source and the message?\u201d she said. \u201cI guess money talks.\u201dMs. Rigby, the superintendent, did not return phone calls or email requesting comment.In Sonoma County, hearings on cannabis ordinances at the board of supervisors overflow with representatives from the cannabis industry, who wear green, and angry residents, who wear red.Of the more than 730 complaints Sonoma County has received about cannabis this year, around 65 percent are related to odor, according to Tim Ricard, the county\u2019s cannabis program manager.\u201cThere\u2019s been a tremendous amount of tension in the community,\u201d said Ms. Hopkins, the Sonoma supervisor. \u201cIf I had to name an ice-cream flavor for cannabis implementation it would definitely be rocky road.\u201dCannabis executives recognize that pot grows can be odorous, but say their industry is no different from others that produce smells.\u201cYou have a smell issue that sometimes can\u2019t be completely mitigated,\u201d said Dennis Hunter, a co-founder of CannaCraft, a large marijuana business based in Santa Rosa in Sonoma County. \u201cBut we have dairy farms here in the area or crush season for the vineyards \u2014 there\u2019s agricultural crops, and a lot of them have smells.\u201dBritt Christiansen, a registered nurse who lives among the dairy farms of Sonoma County, acknowledges that her neighborhood smells of manure, known locally as the Sonoma aroma.But she says she made the choice to live next to a dairy farm and prefers that smell to the odor that drifted over from the marijuana farm next door to her house.\u201cWe opened the door and the smell kicked us in the face,\u201d Ms. Christiansen said. Her neighbors banded together in October and sued the operators of the pot business; the case is ongoing.A Level 4, he said, is the equivalent of a neighbor\u2019s freshly cut grass. \u201cIt could still be a nuisance, but it wouldn\u2019t drive you away from your front porch,\u201d Mr. McGinley said.Standing next to a flowering cannabis bud, the smell would easily be a Level 7, Mr. McGinley said.The Nasal Ranger is in use in Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, but California counties and cities are still struggling with the notion that smells are subjective.Ever-Bloom in Carpinteria is one of a number of marijuana businesses that have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate the stink. Two previous systems failed, but the current one, modeled on devices used to mask the smell of garbage dumps, sprays a curtain of vapor around the perimeter of the greenhouses. The vapor, which is made up of essential oils, gives off a menthol smell resembling Bengay.Dennis Bozanich, a Santa Barbara County official charged with cannabis implementation who has become known as the cannabis czar, says the essential oil odor control has been largely successful. But not every grower can afford to install it.On weekends, Mr. Bozanich becomes a cannabis odor sleuth, riding his bicycle through Carpinteria sniffing the air for pot plants. He recently drove through the area with a reporter, rolling down the windows on a stretch of road with cannabis greenhouses. He slowed the car and puzzled over where a cannabis odor was coming from.\u201cI\u2019ve got one stinky location right here and I can\u2019t quite figure it out,\u201d he said.His description of the stink?\u201cDead skunk.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Black Mirror\u2019 Gives Power to the People", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS GATOS, Calif. \u2014 \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d the speculative fiction series that encouraged people to be wary of new technology, is now hoping they will embrace it. The Netflix show released just one episode on Friday, a narrative titled \u201cBandersnatch\u201d during which the viewer decides what will happen next.It begins like this: Should the teenage video game whiz Stefan have Sugar Puffs or Frosties for breakfast? Soon the choices become more consequential. Will Stefan work at a game company, tell his therapist about his mother, take his meds? As so often on \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d reality is up for grabs.Viewers are voting on more than who lives and dies on one program. If the response to \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is enthusiastic, Netflix will take it as a strong signal that the public is ready for interactive movies and television shows, and a new age of storytelling will commence.Not that the company needs much encouragement. It has already developed software to help organize stories that have endless permutations. It has perfected, or so it hopes, the technical ability to present these tales on multiple platforms around the world simultaneously. And it is calling for producers to submit interactive proposals in genres from horror to romantic comedy while hinting that it already has a few new shows in the works.The idea behind the interactive push is simple: Viewers will care more if they are complicit.\u201cIf bad things happen, you\u2019ll feel even more crestfallen, because you were responsible,\u201d said Todd Yellin, Netflix\u2019s vice president for product. \u201cIf the character is victorious, you\u2019ll feel even more uplifted because you made that choice.\u201dOne problem is that audiences are not clamoring for interactivity. A long time ago, drama was a live, communal experience. Now it comes over all sorts of devices, but almost always is a one-way street. Netflix has an immense hurdle to overcome.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned to press \u2018play,\u2019 drop the remote and just lean on back and let the TV wash over us,\u201d acknowledged Carla Engelbrecht, Netflix\u2019s director of product innovation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen 2-year-olds do this.\u201dGiving lots of options to the viewer while keeping the main character consistent \u201cwas a huge nut to crack,\u201d Brooker said. It was a five-week shoot for about two and a half hours of script, a much longer time than a typical episode requires.Even now, he is uncertain about what he has made.\u201cI think some people will judge it just on a narrative basis, some people will judge it as a game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us. It\u2019s down to them.\u201dJones disagreed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really designed as a game. It was designed as a cinematic experience.\u201d\u201cWith game-y elements,\u201d Brooker persisted. \u201cYou are making decisions. You are actively guiding it.\u201dWhatever its other merits, \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is definitely not funny. Those who wish to encounter it unencumbered by any prior knowledge should employ a primitive method of interactivity and avert their eyes from the next two paragraphs.The year is 1984, the setting London. Stefan (Fionn Whitehead, last seen in \u201cDunkirk\u201d) lost his mother when he was 5. He blames Dad (Craig Parkinson), who hid the boy\u2019s stuffed toy. The ensuing ruckus made Mom take a later train, which derailed.Stefan is hired by a game company. He adapts a choose-your-own-adventure story by a novelist named Jerome F. Davies, who became convinced that he was trapped in a world of multiple realities, with spectacularly unfortunate results. Stefan\u2019s life begins in some ways to mirror Davies\u2019s.Plot choices in \u201cBandersnatch\u201d come thick and fast at the bottom of the screen, with only a few seconds to click one of them. At one point, I refused to do anything, just to see what would happen. The episode went back to the beginning. It was not clear if this was a bug or I was being punished.Watching the episode, it is easy to see how interactivity could be the next step forward in entertainment. It is less easy to see how this could ever be art. It\u2019s hard to lose yourself in a story if you\u2019re constantly being pulled out of it. \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is not linear, which made it feel unresolved even when I was offered the chance after about 70 minutes to go to the credits. I took instead the option to plunge back to the story and tried to make different choices.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many endings there are,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve created here.\u201dJones, who plays the stern adult to Brooker\u2019s madcap boy genius, shot back: \u201cYes, we do!\u201dBrooker: \u201cSorry. We do.\u201d But he didn\u2019t sound convinced.(A Netflix spokeswoman later clarified that \u201cthere are five main endings with multiple variants of each.\u201d)When making the show, the creative team had endless conversations about good endings versus bad endings or premium endings or five-star endings. Said Brooker: \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 aspect where it keeps cycling around, deliberately so.\u201d It\u2019s an artist\u2019s dream: a story the audience can never escape.Interactive filmmaking is simple to mock. Are we now going to have \u201cMary Poppins\u201d where the nanny dismembers the children with a hacksaw? Few artists are in favor of letting their fans make the decisions. But the technology is perpetually enticing.In 1993, a 20-minute short called \u201cI\u2019m Your Man\u201d seemed to offer real possibilities. Viewers in a handful of specially equipped theaters used a pistol grip attached to each seat to collectively vote on dozens of scene variations.It was a prediction grounded in reality. Moviegoing was in decline, so multiplex owners were open to new approaches. A generation had grown up with a joystick in its hand and wanted to take control of its entertainment.But the whole effort fizzled. \u201cIt was classic ahead-of-its-time technology,\u201d said Bejan, who now runs experiential marketing at Microsoft.Netflix is not making any predictions. Quite the contrary.\u201cIn five years, 10 years, we\u2019ll either say, \u2018Wow, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d was a real turning point for interactive content,\u2019 or we\u2019ll be going, \u2018That was another false start,\u2019 \u201d said Yellin, the Netflix executive.Still, he has great hopes. \u201cWe have our eyes and ears wide open to the creative community \u2014 writers, producers, directors \u2014 for more ideas that would leverage this art form,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the new storytelling conventions that can be invented? We\u2019re meeting with people now.\u201dNetflix, which has 137 million worldwide subscribers, says \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is available across \u201cmost\u201d newer devices, including TVs, game consoles, web browsers and Android and iOS devices running the latest version of the Netflix app. It won\u2019t work on Chromecast, Apple TV and some legacy devices.Since \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is always full of tricks, it\u2019s perhaps inevitable that \u201cBandersnatch\u201d undermines the whole notion of interactivity. The viewer is asked whether a murder should be committed, and if the answer is yes, there is a further decision: Bury the body or chop it up? It\u2019s not much of a choice, which is of course the joke.\u201cI\u2019m not in control!\u201d Stefan rages to his therapist. One path the viewer can take develops into a mocking plug for Netflix, which did not exist in 1984. This is about the fourth meta level \u201cBandersnatch\u201d ascends, or descends, to.\u201cYou think you\u2019re choosing your ending, but are you?\u201d said Russell McLean, a \u201cBandersnatch\u201d producer. \u201c\u2018Black Mirror\u2019 is choosing your ending.\u201dBejan, the interactive pioneer, had no knowledge of the existence of \u201cBandersnatch\u201d when he was interviewed. But he said interactive filmmaking was less about the audience\u2019s choices than it seemed.\u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of media the filmmaker creates, which he slices and dices to give the illusion of control while at the same time guiding the viewer through the underlying blueprint,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more megalomaniacal than linear filmmaking.\u201dWhich brings us to the data, where every story in tech ends up. Interactive filmmakers will take your preferences \u2014 I really want this character to commit murder, and that one can kill himself \u2014 and convert them into numbers that will guide the creation of new shows you will be programmed to find irresistible.\u201cWe\u2019ll see what resonates with audiences and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d Netflix\u2019s Yellin said.What Netflix is really building is a voting machine. It\u2019s simple to see how technology like this could be used during, for instance, debates by presidential candidates. Viewers would react to promises being made, with their reactions immediately relayed to the candidates.\u201cBlack Mirror\u201d anticipated this sort of possibility in its very first episode. In 2011, \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d posed the question, What if a British politician were forced to follow the whims of the public in real time? He would end up having sex with a pig on live television, of course.\u201cWhatever path you take, there\u2019s darkness ahead,\u201d observed David Slade, who directed both \u201cMetalhead\u201d and \u201cBandersnatch.\u201dThat is pretty much Brooker\u2019s life philosophy. He began as a game reviewer, then became a TV critic, then a critic on TV. \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d \u2014 named after the shiny objects on our desks, walls and all too often in our hands \u2014 anticipated the tech backlash.As Jones explained to Brooker: \u201cYou are naturally suspicious and paranoid and neurotic.\u201d\u201cI worry about things, basically,\u201d he said.He is trying to dial back on technology. This is not easy or perhaps even desirable, because his confrontations with tech feed the show. That is one reason he got an Amazon Echo: research.\u201cQuite quickly my children, 4 and 6, starting talking to it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my kids walked into the room and called me Alexa. \u2018Alexa \u2014 oh, Daddy, where are my shoes?\u2019 I thought, \u2018I have to kill that device.\u2019\u201d\u201cHow would Alexa know where his shoes are?\u201d Jones asked.\u201cAlexa probably does know where his [expletive] shoes are,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cThat\u2019s the tragedy of it.\u201dNow that we\u2019re all suspicious and paranoid and neurotic, at least about technology, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is in flux. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more optimistic episodes and stories, rather than just dystopian and negative ones,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cWe want to keep the show interesting for us.\u201d He and Jones were, however, extremely hazy on when the next episodes would arrive. \u201cBandersnatch\u201d consumed all their attention for a year.One thing is clear, though. The new episodes won\u2019t be interactive. Asked if he had any advice for someone who wanted to try the format, Brooker said in a joking-but-not-really tone: \u201cRun away. It\u2019s harder than you think.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Rebuked for Failing to Disclose Data-Sharing Deals", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook and some of the other largest technology firms in the world faced sharp criticism on Wednesday for failing to disclose the extent of the social network\u2019s data-sharing deals, many of which went back to the company\u2019s early years.Lawmakers in the United States and Britain on Wednesday called for greater oversight of Facebook, the world\u2019s dominant social media platform. But critics also focused on statements that Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had made in recent months while defending the company.Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, said the revelations made him question Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision making. \u201cI know he\u2019s smart, but sometimes I think he\u2019s got no sense,\u201d Mr. Kennedy told Fox News, adding that the disclosures were cause to consider stricter privacy laws. \u201cCongress is going to have to regulate them and stop this, and I hate to do it, but by God I will if they can\u2019t clean up their act.\u201dFacebook officials said the deals did not violate user privacy \u2014 or a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred it from sharing data without permission \u2014 because the companies were acting on Facebook\u2019s behalf.In a post published on Facebook on Tuesday, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, the company\u2019s director of developer platforms and programs, defended the partnerships, saying the company entered into the agreements to let users interact with Facebook friends across devices and popular websites.\u201cNone of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people\u2019s permission,\u201d Mr. Papamiltiadis wrote, asserting that most partners did not have to seek consent before obtaining users\u2019 data because they were serving as extensions of Facebook.But he also acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in managing some of the deals. \u201cWe recognize that we\u2019ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information,\u201d he wrote.Facebook was already dealing with fallout from reports that a political consulting company, Cambridge Analytica, obtained the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users. Cambridge used the information to build tools later deployed in President Trump\u2019s election campaign. The F.T.C. launched an inquiry into Facebook\u2019s practices after the data leak became public, and the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating the social network.News of the deals on Wednesday further roiled the technology industry as policymakers and privacy advocates directed anger at Facebook\u2019s leaders and its partners.Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, attacked Mr. Zuckerberg for not disclosing the full scope of the agreements during a Senate hearing in the spring, when Mr. Zuckerberg assured officials that users had complete control of their data.\u201cMark Zuckerberg had a lot of chutzpah telling Congress that Americans could control their data, when seemingly every other week Facebook faces a new privacy scandal for abusing our personal information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat, called for the F.T.C. to police the company more aggressively. \u201cFacebook\u2019s seemingly unrestrained sharing of user data is the privacy equivalent of the BP oil spill,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal wrote on Twitter. \u201cOngoing, uncontained & toxic. We will be paying the price for decades.\u201dDamian Collins, a British lawmaker whose parliamentary committee is investigating online disinformation, said Facebook officials should answer for why they had not been more forthcoming. \u201cI feel that we have been given misleading responses by the company when we have asked these questions during previous evidence sessions.\u201dAnd Barbara Underwood, the New York attorney general, said her office would examine the deals as part of a continuing investigation into Facebook. \u201cThe news that Facebook struck data-sharing partnerships with other corporations reflects the many unanswered questions to which New Yorkers deserve clear answers,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Ms. Underwood\u2019s office.Facebook has sought to contain the damage in part by winding down many of its data-sharing partnerships. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had brought more than 60 of its agreements to a close.But deals with two giants of the technology world \u2014 Amazon and Apple \u2014 remain in place. Facebook officials said the deals must continue because of contracts the social network signed with the companies.Records obtained by The Times showed that the social network granted Apple devices broad access to people\u2019s personal data, even when users had disabled sharing. Facebook gave Amazon access users\u2019 email addresses without permission, among other things, the records revealed.An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. An Apple spokesman said that the company stopped integrating Facebook into its operating systems earlier this year, but that the access continued to accommodate users of older systems.In addition to those partnerships, Facebook will continue allowing special access for Tobii Technology, a company that makes devices allowing people with neuromuscular diseases to use the social network, a Facebook spokeswoman said.Facebook also had a deal to share the data of users\u2019 friends with Microsoft, and agreements that gave Spotify and Netflix full access to users\u2019 private messages. Users were especially incensed at the Spotify and Netflix deals, which appeared to go far beyond what the companies required for their integrations.Spotify\u2019s Facebook feature, still active, allowed users to share music with friends; Netflix\u2019s integration, discontinued in 2015, let users share movie and TV recommendations. A Netflix spokesman on Wednesday said the company did not view personal messages for any other reason.\u201cThe total lack of respect for user wishes is the infinitely repeating scandal of 2018,\u201d she added.An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement made to Fox News about Facebook. The statement was made by Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, not Senator Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Cashless Economy Shuts Out the Poor", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityThere are various arguments to be made against cashless businesses \u2014 the inconvenience falling to people too scattered to leave the house with a wallet being merely one of them. The strongest objection relates to the ways in which rejecting physical currency plays out as a bias toward the poor, advancing segregation in retail environments.According to government data, close to 7 percent of American households have no one in them with a checking or savings account, while an additional 19 percent are considered \u201cunderbanked,\u201d meaning that they rely on products or services outside the conventional financial system. These include money orders and payday and pawnshop loans. The majority of people who fall into these categories are nonwhite.\u201cIt is bad enough that the poor are already so stigmatized, and now we are stigmatizing them even further for the way they consume goods and services,\u201d Mr. Torres told me. \u201cI talk a lot about effective discrimination. But this amounts to intentional discrimination, because these businesses that don\u2019t accept cash know exactly who they are keeping out.\u201dProspect Street in Brooklyn, the heart of a recently manufactured neighborhood known as Dumbo Heights, is as good a place as any to observe the pretenses and contradictions of contemporary capitalism. A stretch of formerly industrial buildings, owned in part by the Kushner Companies, houses the corporate offices of Etsy, the tech-enabled craft empire, and an outpost of WeWork, where the kegs are flowing and the toil of office life has been reimagined as a party.WorkOf, a store absorbing the surrounding mood and showcasing handmade furniture and vases and key chains and lighting fixtures, all from independent designers does not, it turns out, extend its branding in intimacy to accepting cash.Neither does Bluestone Lane, with its live performances and hygge feel and turmeric sweet-potato-hummus toast, or the place next door, Mulberry & Vine, another health-food franchise. Here the motto is \u201cLive Dirty, Eat Clean,\u2019\u2019 which seems to sum up rather efficiently the prevailing ethics of the current moment: \u201cPlunder and pillage all you want, just stay away from trans fats and farm-raised salmon.\u201dWhen I visited the outpost in Brooklyn the other day, everyone behind the counter was black and everyone in front of it was white. But presumably, eating there would help make the world a better place because my fork would be recycled and the charred avocado I had eaten was dressed with non-GMO canola oil.The increasing movement away from cash, which businesses often justify as a defense against crime, even if urban crime rates in many cities are at historic lows, comes with other consequences, many of them negative.It is easier to spend more than you intend when you are paying for your lunch with a credit card, to get the fizzy grapefruit drink when, really, you\u2019d be fine with water. When cash is renounced you carry less of it, or maybe even none of it. And so you are not as prone to certain spontaneous acts of generosity \u2014 to put a few dollars in a tip jar where workers are underpaid or give money to a homeless person on a cold night on your way home from work.Forcing people to use credit cards also forces them into compromising their privacy while paradoxically making everyday exchanges feel more impersonal. Businesses see this as efficiency, and efficiency is profit. And as the recent revelations from Facebook suggest, what else matters?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Credit Cards Are Used to Finance Mass Shootings", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "Massacres are frequently carried out by killers using military-grade equipment that\u2019s easier to obtain when buying on credit.Two days before Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, he went on Google and typed \u201cCredit card unusual spending.\u201d Mr. Mateen had opened six new credit card accounts \u2014 including a Mastercard, an American Express card and three Visa cards \u2014 over the previous eight months. Twelve days before the shooting, he began a $26,532 buying spree: a Sig Sauer MCX .223-caliber rifle, a Glock 17 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, several large magazines, thousands of rounds of ammunition and a $7,500 ring for his wife that he bought on a jewelry store card. His average spending before that, on his only card, was $1,500 a month.His web browsing history chronicled his anxiety: \u201cCredit card reports all three bureaus,\u201d \u201cFBI,\u201d and \u201cWhy banks stop your purchases.\u201d He needn\u2019t have worried. None of the banks, credit-card network operators or payment processors alerted law enforcement officials about the purchases he thought were so suspicious.Mass shootings routinely set off a national debate on guns, usually focused on regulating firearms and on troubled youths. Little attention is paid to the financial industry that has become an instrumental, if unwitting, enabler of carnage. A New York Times examination of mass shootings since the Virginia Tech attack in 2007 reveals how credit cards have become a crucial part of the planning of these massacres. There have been 13 shootings that killed 10 or more people in the last decade, and in at least eight of them, the killers financed their attacks using credit cards. Some used credit to acquire firearms they could not otherwise have afforded. Those eight shootings killed 217 people. The investigations undertaken in their aftermath uncovered a rich trove of information about the killers\u2019 spending. There were plenty of red flags, if only someone were able to look for them, law enforcement experts say.\u201cBanks will complain this is the government\u2019s job and it\u2019s not our job, but you know what? They are the only ones with the ability to do this,\u201d said Kevin Sullivan, a former New York Police fraud investigator who consults with banks as president of the Anti-Money Laundering Training Academy. After the shooting last February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and staff members were killed, this column suggested that financial firms had an opportunity to help reduce violence by pushing for more responsible practices by the gun industry. As a result, some banks ended their relationships with gunmakers and some investors pushed manufacturers for more transparency. Financial firms have so far resisted changing the way they deal with the sale of guns.Banks and credit-card networks say it is not their responsibility to create systems to track gun purchases that would allow them to report suspicious patterns.\u201cWe do not believe Visa should be in the position of setting restrictions on the sale of lawful goods or services,\u201d said Amanda Pires, a Visa spokeswoman. \u201cOur role in commerce is to efficiently process, protect and settle all legal payments. Asking Visa or other payment networks to arbitrate what legal goods can be purchased sets a dangerous precedent.\u201dA spokesman for Mastercard echoed that sentiment, emphasizing its protection of \u201ccardholders\u2019 independence\u201d and the \u201cprivacy of their own purchasing decisions.\u201d But the financial industry is uniquely positioned to see, if it chose to do so, a potential killer\u2019s behavior in a way that retailers, law enforcement officials, concerned family members or mental health professionals cannot.

They Can Use It With Gun Makers.Citigroup Acted. Now, Two New Ideas on How Banks Can Limit Gun Sales.When it comes to certain crimes, banks are on the front lines. They crunch transaction data to protect their customers from fraudulent purchases \u2014 often identifying stolen credit cards within seconds \u2014 and to detect money laundering, funding of terrorist organizations and other crimes. A labyrinth of rules prevents banks and credit-card networks \u2014 many of which also handle debit card transactions \u2014 from seeing exactly what customers are buying. Retailers have historically resisted providing item-by-item information \u2014 known as SKU-level data, a reference to the stock-keeping unit number of an item \u2014 for fear that banks would sell that information or use it to steer customers to rival merchants. In the case of gun purchases, even the nature of the retailer can be obscure: The Merchant Category Code, which identifies the type of store that sold an item, is the same for gun shops and sporting goods stores.But retailers have the ability to send far more detailed transaction information. A feature known as a \u201cboxcar\u201d allows retailers to tag transactions with extra data. It is often used by online retailers to send the bank details about consumer behavior, such as the device used to make a purchase and the location of the buyer.If banks required retailers to transmit details on sales of guns and ammunition, they would be able to make more informed decisions about transactions.\u201cThey can fine-tune their own systems, because in these cases the suspicious purchasing patterns could have been picked up on and quite frankly should have been picked up on,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, the Anti-Money Laundering Training Academy president.Banks could also add information about gun sales to the infrastructure they already use to help the government investigate other criminal activity.\u201cWe need to step back and think about what tools we use to combat terrorism and money-laundering and think about the financial rules associated with the Patriot Act,\u201d said John Streur, chief executive of Calvert Investments, a mutual fund firm that is an advocate for responsible investing. \u201cIn a very real sense, I think these mass shootings are terrorism.\u201dThe shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas last year was described as the worst mass murder on American soil since the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The gunman, Stephen Paddock, killed 58 people and injured more than 800.When his body was found on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, the police noticed four credit cards scattered across the kitchenette countertop next to his hotel key card.Unlike most other mass killers, Mr. Paddock was wealthy. He spent over $600,000 at casinos in the two years leading up to the massacre, and paid over $170,000 to credit card companies. Law enforcement officials saw the full picture of his gun purchases only after they talked to the banks, but they wish they could have connected the dots in advance.\u201cThey have all the infrastructure in place,\u201d said Joseph Moreno, a former federal counterterrorism prosecutor and a staff member of the F.B.I.\u2019s 9/11 Review Commission who is now a partner at Cadwalader. \u201cA.T.F. is already involved in S.A.R.s task forces,\u201d he said, referring to suspicious-activity reports. \u201cIt would just be tweaking it to consider firearm-related information.\u201d Over the last several months, I have spoken to senior executives at the country\u2019s largest banks and credit card companies who were taken aback when I presented them with the list of shootings that involved their cards: Virginia Tech in 2007, Binghamton in 2009, Fort Hood in 2009, Aurora in 2012, San Bernardino in 2015, Orlando in 2016, Sutherland Springs in 2017 and Las Vegas in 2017. That list is based on interviews and hundreds of documents including police reports and credit card receipts. It may actually underreport the use of credit cards in shootings: In some cases the payment method could not be learned.While some executives expressed grief and were open to discussing possible solutions, virtually none were willing to speak about them on the record for fear of upsetting gun-rights advocates and politicians invoking the Second Amendment. Some raised the prospect that by trying to help they would be held responsible if the system failed. Others made a slippery-slope argument: If they were to police gun sales, should they do the same for alcohol in an effort to prevent drunk-driving deaths? After the school shooting in Parkland, Citibank and Bank of America said they would no longer finance or advise gun manufacturers, while investment firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the retirement fund for public employees in California, said they would demand more information from the gunmakers they invested in.Several payment systems \u2014 including PayPal, Square and Apple Pay \u2014 already had established rules that ban the sale of guns and gun-related items using their systems.But no bank has instituted a ban or committed to tracking gun purchases.John Shrewsberry, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo \u2014 which counts the National Rifle Association as a client \u2014 has dismissed the notion that banks should regulate the use of its credit cards for gun purchases.\u201cThe best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process,\u201d he said in April on a conference call with investors.The bill was directed at banks that changed their policies regarding guns.  \u201cOur friends at Citigroup and Bank of America apparently aren\u2019t busy enough with their banking business; they have decided that they are going to set policy for the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Kennedy wrote on Twitter.And a policy expert at the American Civil Liberties Union recently expressed concern about how efforts to prevent mass shootings could infringe on individual rights.\u201cThe implication of expecting the government to detect and prevent every mass shooting is believing the government should play an enormously intrusive role in American life,\u201d Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst at the A.C.L.U. Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, wrote in July.Not all the concerns involve privacy or politics. Some are practical.George Brauchler, the district attorney who oversaw the investigation of Mr. Holmes after the Aurora shooting, said the deluge of data the police receive already presents challenge.\u201cTo some extent we are looking for a needle in a haystack and that haystack keeps getting bigger and bigger,\u201d he said. The data could inform old-fashioned police work that might or might not lead to something more, he said.\u201cDo I wish someone from law enforcement had been able to go to his door and knock on his door and figure out a way to talk their way into it or to freak him out?\" he said of Mr. Holmes. \u201cYeah, absolutely.\u201d Jared L. Loughner had the Chase Visa he used to buy a 9-millimeter Glock handgun in the pocket of his jeans when he shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords in the head outside a Tucson supermarket on Jan. 8, 2011. She survived, but six people died. \u201cThere are a lot of steps that credit card companies can take that could prevent some of the tragic gun violence in the country,\u201d said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cFor companies to say they can\u2019t solve the entire problem and therefore shouldn\u2019t take any steps is just blindly ignoring what they can contribute to the solution.\u201dElected officials could force the financial system to act.In 29 states, consumers cannot use credit cards to buy lottery tickets because legislators don\u2019t want consumers racking up debt gambling. And under the Gun Control Act of 1968, firearms dealers must report if someone buys two or more handguns in a span of five business days.That requirement can be evaded simply by buying at more than one store, but a system involving the banks and credit card networks could have the opportunity to flag the purchases.Mr. Sanfeliz\u2019s father, Carlos, was surprised to learn that the same industry that once employed his son had unwittingly bankrolled other shootings.\u201cSomething needs to be done to prevent more attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI live with this torment every day of my life.\u201dOlivia Carville contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "For AT&T, Balancing Change and Preservation Under the Same Broken Pediment", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookSometimes the city works.There was a plan, which provoked protests. The Landmarks Commission, with unusual readiness, swooped in. The new plan is better.The tale argues for the whole messy, infuriating way New York occasionally stumbles toward progress.Snohetta\u2019s big move in the first go around, visually speaking, was swapping out the lower portion of the building\u2019s masonry facade for a diaphanous curtain wall. With its Apple store vibe, the fluted glass scrim exposed the building\u2019s supporting steel structure and allowed light into a grand but gloomy second-floor sky lobby.In the case of AT&T, even Johnson conceded, as long ago as 1994, that the building had problems. Talking about the public loggias and rear arcade, he acknowledged \u201cthe area at the base wasn\u2019t used and became cold and unfriendly.\u201d But Snohetta\u2019s initial scheme undid the formal logic of how the mass of the granite facade is poised on its monumental base of big-footed columns.The glass interrupted the tower\u2019s pulled-taffy proportions, and spoiled what was even more distinctive than the broken pediment: the supersized Italianate portico, facing Madison Avenue, with its semicircular arches and big, quasi-ecclesiastical rose window. Years ago, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown famously described functional structures dressed up with signs or ornaments as \u201cdecorated sheds.\u201d AT&T was one of Johnson\u2019s decorated sheds, its brawny granite skin wrapped around a basically conventional steel frame.Snohetta\u2019s glass wall, in effect, dressed the shed in drag. Picture LeBron James in uniform. Now picture LeBron James in uniform but wearing ballet slippers and an ankle-length, see-through plastic apron.The architects\u2019 proposal, to its credit, also eradicated the clumsy 1990s-era ground-floor renovations by Gwathmey Siegel, which had made everything worse. Those renovations enclosed Johnson and Burgee\u2019s open-air loggias with retail spaces. They made the pedestrian plaza in the back even drearier. Snohetta imagined a tree-filled public garden going back there, stripping away the hulking four-story annex that long served as a de facto indoctrination center for Sony customers, adding a grassy berm and leafy nooks with plenty of seating.But it was the change to the facade that roused picketers along Madison Avenue to tote \u201cHands Off My Johnson\u201d signs and appeal to the Landmarks Commission. Protesters were doubly enraged after Olayan went ahead and demolished the lobby anyway, to add new elevators.That was an underhanded move. Even so, the anger of the protests came as a surprise to some of those for whom the armoire-shaped tower had long been an object of, if not disdain, ambivalence.As the critic Justin Davidson put it, Johnson\u2019s design for AT&T \u201cdeliberately made it hard to distinguish between true grandeur and mock grandiloquence.\u201d The building was at once a one-liner and one-of-a-kind. Detractors talked about the broken pediment on the city skyline as if it were the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d another mid-80s confectionary menace.But suddenly, young architects and preservationists, in particular, saw its defacement not as a strategy for resuscitating a dead building but as yet another assault on an increasingly vulnerable and admirable era in 20th century architecture. That revisionism extended to the work of Brutalists like Paul Rudolph, whose concrete behemoths, publicly reviled, had also come to be seen afresh by a generation of designers and design lovers.I have always loved Rudolph\u2019s works, despite their practical problems. I never loved the AT&T building, although it became part of the mental furniture of the skyline and then, incrementally, began to stand out by contrast with so many new glass towers. It had also become a fixture in classes about late 20th century architecture, a textbook example of Post-Modernism, parable of the star architect, catnip on Instagram.And its chutzpah provided a timely antidote to the polite, public-spirited, retro-modernism that is now architecture\u2019s default mode. Love it or hate it, 550 Madison was the opposite of polite.So it was good news when officials designated the exterior of the tower a city landmark in July. Preservation shouldn\u2019t be a popularity contest, after all. At the same time, buildings need to remain viable for the sake of their owners, occupants and neighborhood. The trick is balancing the two.On Tuesday evening, Nick Anderson, project manager from Snohetta, presented the firm\u2019s new strategy to the community board members. It leaves Madison Avenue\u2019s facade along with the north and south sides of the building completely intact \u2014 in total, 94 percent of the exterior, Mr. Anderson said, won\u2019t be touched.What will go are Gwathmey Siegel\u2019s ugly tinted bay windows, with their obtrusive, heavy mullions. They\u2019re going to be replaced with clear glazing, discreetly recessed to give visual prominence to the building\u2019s columns and the vertical voids between them.In the back, seven new windows will be added to bring daylight into the sky lobby from the west. Another, tall, arched window will also be inserted between the new elevators in the lobby to open a vista straight from Madison Avenue through to the garden. There were grumblings on the community board about the lobby\u2019s demolition and whether the transparency of the arched window betrayed the sepulchral spirit of the original building.It does, but in the end the subcommittee endorsed the window and moved on to the proposed garden. With the elimination of the annex, and the return of the rear bays of the loggias to their original open-air configurations, the garden will become a new public park the size of the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s sculpture garden, an indisputable upgrade. A slender, Y-shaped canopy will replace the half-barrel glass vault and mess of catwalks that now obscure the sky. Seasonal plantings will be conceived around a series of \u201coutdoor rooms,\u201d Mr. Anderson explained, whose \u201cPlatonic geometries\u201d of circles and half-moons allude to the arches and round window on the facade and to other works by Johnson.\u201cNot being too hung up on beauty is what makes life here possible, even thrilling,\u201d was Muschamp\u2019s response. He embraced the building\u2019s outsider taste.Johnson was the ultimate insider. That said, 550 Madison raises a similar point. The city\u2019s beauty derives from its cacophony of tastes and cultures, its tolerance. We don\u2019t have to find every building we preserve beautiful. But we do need an occasional building like 550 Madison to remind us of who we are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cut One Year Later: What Happened?", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany corporations made good on promises to raise wages and pay bonuses. But others announced layoffs, even as the $1.5 trillion tax cut added billions to their bottom lines.The fawning faded quickly. Analysts noted that the handouts to workers amounted to a relatively small share of the roughly $200 billion in federal income taxes that corporations avoided thanks to the cuts. Wages across the economy ticked up, but not by nearly as much as some Republicans had promised when they voted for the law. Capital investment surged at the start of the year, but the rate of growth fell sharply in the third quarter. Some workers did reap rewards from the law, as many companies followed through on \u2014 and even exceeded \u2014 their promises to raise wages and pay bonuses. Yet other firms have announced layoffs, despite reporting higher profits and billions of dollars in tax savings. While the long-term effects remain to be seen, the evidence so far does not suggest the sustained investment and productivity growth boosts that Republicans and supply-side economists predicted. Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, are cutting their growth forecasts for 2019, in part because of the waning effect of the tax cuts. Here\u2019s a look at what companies promised and what has come to pass as we head into Year Two of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Corporate earnings over the last several quarters show why companies were such enthusiastic cheerleaders of the tax cuts. By cutting the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent, the law has reduced the effective tax rate that many companies pay.\u201cThis tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs,\u201d Randall Stephenson, the chairman and chief executive of AT&T, said last year, as the company announced plans to award worker bonuses and increase capital spending. Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told workers in a memo last year that the new law would reduce the bank\u2019s tax rate, and that \u201cin the spirit of shared success, we intend to pass some of those benefits along immediately\u201d to workers.Job creation accelerated across the economy this year, compared to 2017, including at several large companies that celebrated the tax cuts by expanding hiring plans. But strong growth has not spared the jobs of thousands of American workers at large companies where executives have cited automation, outsourcing and product-line restructuring to explain why they reduced employment in a year when tax cuts raised their profit margins. Walmart increased its starting wage to $11 an hour, gave bonuses of up to $1,000 each for associates and expanded some worker benefits like parental leave. The wage increase amounted to $300 million more than the company had planned before the cuts. Its employment levels have not changed over the year.AT&T handed out $200 million in worker bonuses and contributed $800 million to its employee and retiree medical trust fund. It increased its dividend for the 35th straight year. It also appears to be shedding employees. Officials at the Communications Workers of America, the union that represents AT&T workers, say the company has cut more than 10,000 union jobs this year, accelerating its pace of cuts from last year. Verizon has paid down corporate debt by $4.2 billion this year, as it said it would after the tax law passed, and granted employees 50 shares of Verizon stock, a move worth more than $400 million.White House officials predict that investment growth will bounce back next year, driving further productivity gains and lifting wages for workers, based in part on the high levels of planned investment that many business surveys continue to forecast. \u201cWhat we expect to see from the second part of the tax bill, which is the lower cost to capital and the higher investment, is just higher wage growth that\u2019s sustained,\u201d Kevin A. Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, recently told reporters.That favor has receded. In December, SurveyMonkey found, 47 percent of Americans approved of the law, while 46 percent disapproved. Republicans still praise the law and its benefits to businesses in floor speeches and news releases, but they did not make it a dominant campaign issue in November\u2019s midterm elections. Support for the law, odd as it may seem, has fallen slightly from the peak among Republicans \u2014 and risen slightly among Democrats. Overall economic confidence was higher in the 2018 surveys than in 2017, but \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we can attribute that to the tax reform passage,\u201d said Laura Wronksi, one of the SurveyMonkey pollsters. She noted that Republicans have grown more economically optimistic even as their support for the law has fallen.Mr. Hassett said \u2014 as most economists have long predicted \u2014 that he did not expect to see this year\u2019s wave of bonus announcements repeated next year. Few companies have followed Bank of America in announcing another batch of them.But companies are still talking about the law \u2014 at least to shareholders. An analysis of earnings calls by Hamilton Place Strategies found that in the third quarter of this year, large companies discussed tax reform more than any policy topic, including the tariffs that have dominated headlines and market anxiety for the past several months.

{"Headline": "How Much Could the 1MDB Scandal Cost Goldman Sachs?", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA huge fraud at a Malaysian investment fund has cast a harsh light on Goldman Sachs. But how much could the scandal cost the firm?The affair appears to have taken its toll on Goldman\u2019s stock. Its shares are down 20 percent since the Justice Department\u2019s charges were revealed. By comparison, bank stocks as a whole are down 6 percent, and shares of Morgan Stanley, Goldman\u2019s rival, have fallen nearly 10 percent.The ultimate size of the legal hit may largely depend on whether the Department of Justice and others can demonstrate that Goldman\u2019s controls were inadequate and that wrongdoing could take place more easily in its environment. Regulators such as the Federal Reserve and the New York State Department of Financial Services may also decide to penalize Goldman.Malaysia\u2019s government set up a fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, in 2009. Goldman arranged three bond deals for the fund in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion. Federal prosecutors say more than $2.7 billion of that sum was misappropriated.Tim Leissner, a senior Goldman banker until 2016, pleaded guilty in August to taking part in bribery and money laundering schemes. The government has charged another former Goldman banker, Roger Ng, with conspiring to launder money and pay bribes. Mr. Ng was recently arrested by the Malaysian authorities, and the Justice Department intends to extradite him to the United States.Prosecutors have also brought charges against Jho Low, a Malaysian financier who served as an intermediary for Goldman in its dealings with Malaysian officials and 1MDB. According to the government, Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng conspired with Mr. Low to hide his involvement with the fund.Cooperating with law enforcement can help reduce penalties. Several analysts expect the government to force Goldman to disgorge the roughly $600 million it earned arranging the bond deals. The question is whether Goldman will also have to pay that amount, or twice the sum, to the government as a penalty.Goldman has shared 1MDB-related communications between its employees and others with prosecutors, according to a person briefed on the case. But the importance of such information to the Justice Department is not known.Goldman has publicly sought to portray the fraud as the work of a few employees who took significant steps to conceal the wrongdoing.\u201cThese are guys who evaded our safeguards, and lie, stuff like that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said in early November. \u201cSomebody\u2019s going to use phones away from us, and personal this and personal that,\u201d he added, referring to personal devices.But the government documents suggest prosecutors might not be convinced that just a few employees were involved or that there weren\u2019t weaknesses in Goldman\u2019s compliance program.In the charges against Mr. Low, prosecutors said, referring to Goldman: \u201cThe business culture at U.S. Financial Institution #1, particularly in Southeast Asia, was highly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions.\u201d And in Mr. Leissner\u2019s charging document, prosecutors contended that \u201cother employees and agents\u201d of Goldman, and not just Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng, had known about promises to pay bribes to secure 1MDB business.And in his plea hearing, Mr. Leissner told the court that his efforts to conceal facts from the bank\u2019s compliance and legal employees were \u201cvery much in the culture of Goldman Sachs.\u201dBut Mr. Leissner did not expand on his assertion about Goldman\u2019s culture in the redacted court transcript containing that remark. And it\u2019s important that the government has not charged Mr. Vella.If prosecutors charge no one from Goldman besides Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng, the bank\u2019s \u201ca couple of bad apples\u201d defense may gain ground.The degree of punishment exacted by the Justice Department could influence other lawsuits against Goldman Sachs. Take the possibility that the government and Goldman enter into a deferred prosecution agreement. Under such an agreement, the Justice Department files charges against a firm but asks that they be postponed while the firm take steps to address prosecutors\u2019 concerns. In Goldman\u2019s case, it might have to agree to revamp parts of its compliance program.Particularly crucial in deferred prosecution agreements is the \u201cstatement of facts,\u201d which describes the criminal activity and contains detailed evidence of wrongdoing. If Goldman ended up agreeing to a deferred prosecution agreement, the statement of facts could bolster lawsuits brought by two government investment funds from Abu Dhabi that played a role in 1MDB bond deals, said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and a DealBook columnist.\u201cWe are in the process of assessing the details of allegations and fully expect to contest the claim vigorously,\u201d Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said in an email, referring to the Abu Dhabi lawsuit.Of course, Goldman\u2019s lawyers can be expected to push for a nonprosecution agreement instead. The statement of facts with such an agreement would most likely be softer.Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Facebook Raised a Privacy Wall, It Carved an Opening for Tech Giants", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "Internal documents show that the social network gave Microsoft, Amazon, Spotify and others far greater access to people\u2019s data than it has disclosed.Supported byFor years, Facebook gave some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies more intrusive access to users\u2019 personal data than it has disclosed, effectively exempting those business partners from its usual privacy rules, according to internal records and interviews.The special arrangements are detailed in hundreds of pages of Facebook documents obtained by The New York Times. The records, generated in 2017 by the company\u2019s internal system for tracking partnerships, provide the most complete picture yet of the social network\u2019s data-sharing practices. They also underscore how personal data has become the most prized commodity of the digital age, traded on a vast scale by some of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley and beyond.The exchange was intended to benefit everyone. Pushing for explosive growth, Facebook got more users, lifting its advertising revenue. Partner companies acquired features to make their products more attractive. Facebook users connected with friends across different devices and websites. But Facebook also assumed extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2 billion users \u2014 control it has wielded with little transparency or outside oversight.Facebook allowed Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users\u2019 friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users\u2019 private messages.The social network permitted Amazon to obtain users\u2019 names and contact information through their friends, and it let Yahoo view streams of friends\u2019 posts as recently as this summer, despite public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years earlier.But the documents, as well as interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its corporate partners, reveal that Facebook allowed certain companies access to data despite those protections. They also raise questions about whether Facebook ran afoul of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred the social network from sharing user data without explicit permission.In all, the deals described in the documents benefited more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, including online retailers and entertainment sites, but also automakers and media organizations. Their applications sought the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, the records show. The deals, the oldest of which date to 2010, were all active in 2017. Some were still in effect this year.In an interview, Steve Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s director of privacy and public policy, said none of the partnerships violated users\u2019 privacy or the F.T.C. agreement. Contracts required the companies to abide by Facebook policies, he added.Still, Facebook executives have acknowledged missteps over the past year. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201d He said that the partnerships were \u201cone area of focus\u201d and that Facebook was in the process of winding many of them down.Facebook has found no evidence of abuse by its partners, a spokeswoman said. Some of the largest partners, including Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo, said they had used the data appropriately, but declined to discuss the sharing deals in detail. Facebook did say that it had mismanaged some of its partnerships, allowing certain companies\u2019 access to continue long after they had shut down the features that required the data.Data privacy experts disputed Facebook\u2019s assertion that most partnerships were exempted from the regulatory requirements, expressing skepticism that businesses as varied as device makers, retailers and search companies would be viewed alike by the agency. \u201cThe only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth into an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist at the F.T.C.Mr. Soltani and three former employees of the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection division, which brought the case that led to the consent decree, said in interviews that its data-sharing deals had probably violated the agreement.\u201cThis is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u201d said David Vladeck, who formerly ran the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u201dFacebook\u2019s stock price has fallen, and a group of shareholders has called for Mr. Zuckerberg to step aside as chairman. Shareholders also have filed a lawsuit alleging that executives failed to impose effective privacy safeguards. Angry users started a #DeleteFacebook movement.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is legitimate to enter into data-sharing partnerships where there is not prior informed consent from the user,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook. \u201cNo one should trust Facebook until they change their business model.\u201dPersonal data is the oil of the 21st century, a resource worth billions to those who can most effectively extract and refine it. American companies alone are expected to spend close to $20 billion by the end of 2018 to acquire and process consumer data, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Few companies have better data than Facebook and its rival, Google, whose popular products give them an intimate view into the daily lives of billions of people \u2014 and allow them to dominate the digital advertising market.Facebook has never sold its user data, fearful of user backlash and wary of handing would-be competitors a way to duplicate its most prized asset. Instead, internal documents show, it did the next best thing: granting other companies access to parts of the social network in ways that advanced its own interests.Facebook began forming data partnerships when it was still a relatively young company. Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to weave Facebook\u2019s services into other sites and platforms, believing it would stave off obsolescence and insulate Facebook from competition. Every corporate partner that integrated Facebook data into its online products helped drive the platform\u2019s expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue. At the same time, Facebook got critical data back from its partners.The partnerships were so important that decisions about forming them were vetted at high levels, sometimes by Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, Facebook officials said. While many of the partnerships were announced publicly, the details of the sharing arrangements typically were confidential.By 2013, Facebook had entered into more such partnerships than its midlevel employees could easily track, according to interviews with two former employees. (Like the more than 30 other former employees interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or still maintained relationships with top Facebook officials.)So they built a tool that did the technical work of turning special access on and off and also kept records on what are known internally as \u201ccapabilities\u201d \u2014 the special privileges enabling companies to obtain data, in some cases without asking permission.The Times reviewed more than 270 pages of reports generated by the system \u2014 records that reflect just a portion of Facebook\u2019s wide-ranging deals. Among the revelations was that Facebook obtained data from multiple partners for a controversial friend-suggestion tool called \u201cPeople You May Know.\u201dFacebook, in turn, used contact lists from the partners, including Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei \u2014 which has been flagged as a security threat by American intelligence officials \u2014 to gain deeper insight into people\u2019s relationships and suggest more connections, the records show.Some of the access deals described in the documents were limited to sharing non-identifying information with research firms or enabling game makers to accommodate huge numbers of players. These raised no privacy concerns. But agreements with about a dozen companies did. Some enabled partners to see users\u2019 contact information through their friends \u2014 even after the social network, responding to complaints, said in 2014 that it was stripping all applications of that power.As of 2017, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon and others could obtain users\u2019 email addresses through their friends.Facebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users\u2019 private messages, and to see all participants on a thread \u2014 privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems, the records show. Facebook acknowledged that it did not consider any of those three companies to be service providers. Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix said those companies were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them. A spokesman for Netflix said Wednesday that it had used the access only to enable customers to recommend TV shows and movies to their friends.\u201cBeyond these recommendations, we never accessed anyone\u2019s personal messages and would never do that,\u201d he said.Spotify, which could view messages of more than 70 million users a month, still offers the option to share music through Facebook Messenger. But Netflix and the Canadian bank no longer needed access to messages because they had deactivated features that incorporated it.These were not the only companies that had special access longer than they needed it. Yahoo, The Times and others could still get Facebook users\u2019 personal information in 2017.Yahoo could view real-time feeds of friends\u2019 posts for a feature that the company had ended in 2012. A Yahoo spokesman declined to discuss the partnership in detail but said the company did not use the information for advertising. The Times \u2014 one of nine media companies named in the documents \u2014 had access to users\u2019 friend lists for an article-sharing application it had discontinued in 2011. A spokeswoman for the news organization said it was not obtaining any data.Facebook empowered Apple to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were asking for data. Apple devices also had access to the contact numbers and calendar entries of people who had changed their account settings to disable all sharing, the records show.Apple officials said they were not aware that Facebook had granted its devices any special access. They added that any shared data remained on the devices and was not available to anyone other than the users.Facebook officials said the company had disclosed its sharing deals in its privacy policy since 2010. But the language in the policy about its service providers does not specify what data Facebook shares, and with which companies. Mr. Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s privacy director, also said its partners were subject to \u201crigorous controls.\u201dPam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit privacy research group, said that Facebook would have little power over what happens to users\u2019 information after sharing it broadly. \u201cIt travels,\u201d Ms. Dixon said. \u201cIt could be customized. It could be fed into an algorithm and decisions could be made about you based on that data.\u201dBesides Facebook, the F.T.C. has consent agreements with Google and Twitter stemming from alleged privacy violations.Facebook\u2019s agreement with regulators is a result of the company\u2019s early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, it changed the privacy settings of the 400 million people then using the service, making some of their information accessible to all of the internet. Then it shared that information, including users\u2019 locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.Facebook called this \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.The F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.Under the decree, the social network introduced a \u201ccomprehensive privacy program\u201d charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.But the privacy program faced some internal resistance from the start, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s efforts. Some engineers and executives, they said, considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews \u2014 numbering about a dozen people by 2016 \u2014 was moved around within Facebook\u2019s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.Critically, many of Facebook\u2019s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.Facebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \u201cdepended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\u201dIn 2014, Facebook ended instant personalization and walled off access to friends\u2019 information. But in a previously unreported agreement, the social network\u2019s engineers continued allowing Bing; Pandora, the music streaming service; and Rotten Tomatoes, the movie and television review site, access to much of the data they had gotten for the discontinued feature. Bing had access to the information through last year, the records show, and the two other companies did as of late summer, according to tests by The Times.Facebook officials said the data sharing did not violate users\u2019 privacy because it allowed access only to public data \u2014 though that included data that the social network had made public in 2009. They added that the social network made a mistake in allowing the access to continue for the three companies, but declined to elaborate. Spokeswomen for Pandora and Rotten Tomatoes said the businesses were not aware of any special access.Facebook also declined to discuss the other capabilities Bing was given, including the ability to see all users\u2019 friends.Microsoft officials said that Bing was using the data to build profiles of Facebook users on Microsoft servers. They declined to provide details, other than to say the information was used in \u201cfeature development\u201d and not for advertising. Microsoft has since deleted the data, the officials said.For some advocates, the torrent of user data flowing out of Facebook has called into question not only Facebook\u2019s compliance with the F.T.C. agreement, but also the agency\u2019s approach to privacy regulation.\u201cThere has been an endless barrage of how Facebook has ignored users\u2019 privacy settings, and we truly believed that in 2011 we had solved this problem,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an online privacy group that filed one of the first complaints about Facebook with federal regulators. \u201cWe brought Facebook under the regulatory authority of the F.T.C. after a tremendous amount of work. The F.T.C. has failed to act.\u201dAccording to Facebook, most of its data partnerships fall under an exemption to the F.T.C. agreement. The company argues that the partner companies are service providers \u2014 companies that use the data only \u201cfor and at the direction of\u201d Facebook and function as an extension of the social network.But Mr. Vladeck and other former F.T.C. officials said that Facebook was interpreting the exemption too broadly. They said the provision was intended to allow Facebook to perform the same everyday functions as other companies, such as sending and receiving information over the internet or processing credit card transactions, without violating the consent decree.When The Times reported last summer on the partnerships with device makers, Facebook used the term \u201cintegration partners\u201d to describe BlackBerry, Huawei and other manufacturers that pulled Facebook data to provide social-media-style features on smartphones. All such integration partners, Facebook asserted, were covered by the service provider exemption.Since then, as the social network has disclosed its data sharing deals with other kinds of businesses \u2014 including internet companies such as Yahoo \u2014 Facebook has labeled them integration partners, too.Facebook even recategorized one company, the Russian search giant Yandex, as an integration partner.Facebook records show Yandex had access in 2017 to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs even after the social network stopped sharing them with other applications, citing privacy risks. A spokeswoman for Yandex, which was accused last year by Ukraine\u2019s security service of funneling its user data to the Kremlin, said the company was unaware of the access and did not know why Facebook had allowed it to continue. She added that the Ukrainian allegations \u201chave no merit.\u201dIn October, Facebook said Yandex was not an integration partner. But in early December, as The Times was preparing to publish this article, Facebook told congressional lawmakers that it was.An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the commission agreed with Facebook\u2019s interpretation of the service provider exception, which is likely to figure in the F.T.C.\u2019s ongoing Facebook investigation. She also declined to say whether the commission had ever received a complete list of partners that Facebook considered service providers.The first assessment, sent to the F.T.C. in 2013, found only \u201climited\u201d evidence that Facebook had monitored those partners\u2019 use of data. The finding was redacted from a public copy of the assessment, which gave Facebook\u2019s privacy program a passing grade over all.Mr. Wyden and other critics have questioned whether the assessments \u2014 in which the F.T.C. essentially outsources much of its day-to-day oversight to companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2014 are effective. As with other businesses under consent agreements with the F.T.C., Facebook pays for and largely dictated the scope of its assessments, which are limited mostly to documenting that Facebook has conducted the internal privacy reviews it claims it had.How closely Facebook monitored its data partners is uncertain. Most of Facebook\u2019s partners declined to discuss what kind of reviews or audits Facebook subjected them to. Two former Facebook partners, whose deals with the social network dated to 2010, said they could find no evidence that Facebook had ever audited them. One was BlackBerry. The other was Yandex.Facebook officials said that while the social network audited partners only rarely, it managed them closely.\u201cThese were high-touch relationships,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Yahoo ended a feature on its website that incorporated Facebook user data. The feature was discontinued in 2012, not 2011.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting. Research was contributed by Grace Ashford, Susan C.

{"Headline": "A Toaster on Wheels to Deliver Groceries? Self-Driving Tech Tests Practical Uses", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Last Thursday morning in the desert town of Scottsdale, Ariz., a tiny robotic car turned onto a neighborhood street and pulled up to a home with a Spanish-tiled roof and synthetic grass in the front yard.Not even half the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, the toylike vehicle had no driver and no passengers. Instead, it held six bags of groceries from the Fry\u2019s Food Store down the road. One observer oohed and aahed over how cute the car seemed.\u201cThe more people work on urban self-driving, the more they realize what a long road it is,\u201d he said.Nuro was founded in 2016 by Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, two key engineers from Google\u2019s self-driving project, which eventually morphed into the Waymo autonomous business. (Both have the same parent company, Alphabet.) Nuro, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., and has raised $92 million in funding, decided to focus on creating tiny self-driving cars \u2014 they measure 104 inches long by 43 inches wide by 70 inches high \u2014 that would solely make local deliveries.Mr. Ferguson said there was an opportunity to automate all the trips that Americans make to local stores for goods and services \u2014 like buying groceries and picking up laundry \u2014 citing statistics that these errands account for a significant portion of all car journeys.\u201cIf we can reduce the cost of these deliveries and get them to you faster than you could make the trip yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cthere would be no reason for you to get in the car.\u201dWhile that endgame is nowhere close to reality, Mr. Ferguson said it was closer than autonomous passenger services. That\u2019s because Nuro does not have to worry about the comfort and safety of anyone in the vehicle. And by making the delivery automobiles much smaller than a regular car, it can also increase the margin of error on the roads.\u201cThere is a qualitative difference when you don\u2019t have to worry about passengers,\u201d he said.The trouble is that when testing this technology, Nuro cannot put someone in the mini-vehicle who can take over in case of emergency. So the start-up began by tests in full-size cars. It is now confident enough in its technology to put its tiny vehicles on public roads.Mr. Ferguson, who often refers to Nuro\u2019s mini cars as rolling toasters, acknowledged that the idea can seem \u201cweird.\u201d But, he said, he ultimately sees them as a safer way of getting autonomous technology rolling.Last Thursday, the Nuro cars looked even odder on second glance \u2014 because they were being trailed by regular-size vehicles. A dark Toyota Prius with a small wireless antenna perched on its rooftop was following just behind the self-driving robots. This was what the company calls a shadow car, which ferries technicians who can remotely take control of the robotic vehicle if anything goes wrong.Nuro declined to discuss its financial arrangement with Fry\u2019s. It said that a delivery today using its mini autonomous vehicles costs $6. Once it removes most of the human labor from deliveries, Mr. Ferguson said, the company can reduce the cost further and eventually serve people that cannot afford deliveries today.Even so, it was unclear how much demand there would be for the service. Joe Schott, 60, who saw the tiny Nuro car pass his bicycle on a recent afternoon, said it was ideal for his sister, who is disabled. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for her to get groceries in and out of her car,\u201d he said.But Keri Diggins, 45, who shops at Fry\u2019s and teaches sociology at a local college, questioned how much the service would suit people who are elderly or physically impaired.\u201cA car can\u2019t take the food to your doorstep,\u201d she said.When one of Nuro\u2019s cars pulled up to the curb in Scottsdale last week, I noticed it had small motorcycle rearview mirrors on it, even though the mirrors serve no practical purpose. Federal regulations for low-speed vehicles require the use of rearview mirrors, Mr. Ferguson said.\u201cIt\u2019s easier for us just to put them on than to try to get exemptions,\u201d he said.To see how well the cars worked, I walked up to the vehicle and punched a PIN code into a small digital touch pad. The doors opened upward, revealing two compartments filled with grocery bags.As I leaned forward to grab them, I hit my head on the open door. Then, reaching for the other bags, I hit my head again.It was a moment that showed how difficult it can be to design machines that interact with humans. In creating its robot, Nuro had not provided as much headroom as it should have \u2014 and people behave in inexplicable ways.\u201cWe\u2019ll take the blame for the first one,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said with a smile. \u201cThe second one is on you.\u201dIn a newer design, he added, the doors will open higher, so tall people will not hit their heads.Advertisement"}

But at the same time, society\u2019s resistance to large corporations grew, and more companies rediscovered the advantages of focus and of decentralization. Let\u2019s take a closer look.As a result, the work of health care companies in the United States is being reshuffled and remixed, but the results are as yet uncertain. We don\u2019t know if Amazon will indeed disrupt the industry, or if the likes of CVS-Aetna can revamp it from within. Even though judges have waved through big mergers, the real jury \u2014 that is, patients and consumers \u2014 is still out.Other merger news this year suggests that more large firms may be encountering dis-economies of scale.These not-quite-merger deals fly under the radar.

{"Headline": "You Should Have the Right to Sue Apple", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Apple v. Pepper, the Supreme Court will decide whether iPhone App Store customers are entitled to make their case against the tech giant.Ms. Slaughter is a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.Some app buyers allege that the App Store is an illegal monopoly and that Apple forces them to pay higher prices for apps than they would have paid in a competitive market. The question before the Supreme Court is not whether Apple has engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of the law. Instead, this case is about whether app buyers are entitled to present the facts of their case to a court \u2014 and the decision will have consequences for the ability of all Americans to hold corporations accountable for illegal monopolistic conduct.The Justice Department supported Apple\u2019s reasoning before the court. I sit on the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is jointly responsible, with the Justice Department, for enforcement of antitrust laws, and I strongly disagree with our sister agency\u2019s position. Apple users can buy apps only through Apple\u2019s App Store. They must deal directly with Apple as a distributor of iPhone apps rather than with the individual app developers. That is why the lower court decided that consumers are indeed \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d and eligible to sue under the antitrust laws.Putting aside the merits of the underlying antitrust claim, this case comes down to first principles. Should the consumers who are potential victims of alleged antitrust violations be allowed to make their case before a judge or jury? Should citizens play a role as a meaningful check against anticompetitive corporate conduct? I believe the answer is yes. America is grappling with serious questions about the levels of concentration and competition in our economy, and the Supreme Court should reinforce rather than constrict the ability of consumers to seek justice for illegal abuses of market power.For people who have been victims of anticompetitive corporate conduct, private lawsuits are the primary means for getting compensation. A 2013 study found that 60 of the largest successful private antitrust cases from 1990 to 2011 resulted in at least $33 billion in compensation to victims. Private enforcement also bolsters the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s efforts to stop anticompetitive conduct \u2014 for example, in the pharmaceutical industry.A Supreme Court decision that treats iPhone app buyers as too far removed from Apple to bring a federal antitrust suit against the company would undermine Congress\u2019 intent to permit any victim of antitrust violations to seek justice. Worse, it would give a free pass for antitrust law violations in cases in which consumers are the victims with the greatest incentive to go to court. App developers, who Apple claims are the \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d of their app services, may not be inclined to bring an antitrust case against their business partner. Apple is the gatekeeper to the apps\u2019 millions of target customers.The case before the court is not simply about one company or one group of consumers. It is about the right of citizens to hold corporate monopoly power in check in industries across our economy.Rebecca Kelly Slaughter is a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Emails Show Its Real Mission: Making Money and Crushing Competition", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftThat gift was 250 pages\u2019 worth of internal emails, in which Facebook\u2019s executives are shown discussing ways to undermine their competitors, obscure their collection of user data and \u2014 above all \u2014 ensure that their products kept growing.But the internal emails, a rare glimpse into Facebook\u2019s inner workings, show that the image the company promoted for years \u2014 as an idealistic enterprise more dedicated to \u201cbringing the world closer together\u201d than increasing its own bottom line \u2014 was a carefully cultivated smoke screen.These emails reveal that in the formative years of Facebook\u2019s growth, the company\u2019s executives were ruthless and unsparing in their ambition to collect more data from users, extract concessions from developers and stamp out possible competitors.\u201cIt shows the degree to which the company knowingly and intentionally prioritized growth at all costs,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a privacy researcher and former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission.Here are four revelations from the emails that detail Facebook\u2019s aggressive quest for growth:1. The company engineered ways to collect Android users\u2019 data without alerting them.In February 2015, Facebook had a privacy dilemma.But there was a problem: Android\u2019s privacy policies meant that Facebook would need to ask users to opt in to having this data collected. Facebook\u2019s executives worried that asking users for this data could bring a public backlash.\u201cThis is a pretty high risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,\u201d one executive, Michael LeBeau, wrote.He outlined the nightmare scenario: \u201cScreenshot of the scary Android permissions screen becomes a meme (as it has in the past), propagates around the web, it gets press attention, and enterprising journalists dig into what exactly the new update is requesting, then write stories about \u2018Facebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways.\u2019\u201dUltimately, Facebook found a workaround. Yul Kwon, the head of Facebook\u2019s privacy program, wrote in an email that the growth team had found that if Facebook\u2019s upgraded app asked only to read Android users\u2019 call logs, and not request other types of data from them, users would not be shown a permission pop-up.\u201cBased on their initial testing, it seems that this would allow us to upgrade users without subjecting them to an Android permissions dialog at all,\u201d Mr. Kwon wrote.2. Mark Zuckerberg personally approved cutting off a competitor\u2019s data access.In January 2013, one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s lieutenants emailed him with news about Twitter, one of Facebook\u2019s biggest competitors. The company had introduced a video-sharing service called Vine, which allowed users to create and post six-second video clips.When new users signed up for Vine, they were given the option of following their Facebook friends \u2014 a feature enabled through Facebook\u2019s application program interface, or API. This feature was widely used, and had become a valuable tool for new apps to accelerate user growth. But in Vine\u2019s case, Facebook played hardball.\u201cUnless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today,\u201d wrote the lieutenant, Justin Osofsky, now a Facebook vice president.Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, replied: \u201cYup, go for it.\u201dOn Wednesday, Rus Yusupov, one of Vine\u2019s co-founders, said on Twitter, \u201cI remember that day like it was yesterday.\u201dFacebook\u2019s decision to shut off Vine\u2019s API access proved fateful. Months later, Instagram released its own short-form video feature, which many saw as a further attempt by Facebook to hobble Vine\u2019s growth. Vine shut down in 2016, after stagnant growth and heavy competition led many of its stars and users to go elsewhere.3. Facebook used a privacy app to collect usage data about its competitors.According to the emails released on Wednesday, Facebook executives received reports about the performance of rival apps, using data obtained through Onavo.Sometimes, those reports revealed up-and-coming competitors. One report included in the email cache, dated April 2013, said that WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app, was gaining steam. According to Onavo\u2019s proprietary data, WhatsApp was being used to send 8.2 billion messages a day, whereas Facebook\u2019s own mobile app was sending just 3.5 billion messages daily.4. Facebook executives wanted more social sharing, as long as it happened on Facebook.In November 2012, Mr. Zuckerberg sent a lengthy note to several top executives called \u201cPlatform Model Thoughts.\u201d It outlined how intensely he wanted Facebook to be the center of everyone\u2019s social life online.The email addressed a debate that was raging inside Facebook at the time, about whether outside app developers should have to pay to connect their apps to Facebook\u2019s developer platform. Mr. Zuckerberg said that he was leaning away from a charge-for-access model, and toward what he called \u201cfull reciprocity\u201d \u2014 giving third-party developers the ability to connect their apps to Facebook free, in exchange for those apps\u2019 giving data back to Facebook, and making it easy for users to post their activity from those services on their Facebook timelines.By giving away access, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Facebook could entice more developers to build on its platform. And by requiring app developers to send data back to Facebook, it could use those apps to increase the value of its own network. He wrote that social apps \u201cmay be good for the world but it\u2019s not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook.\u201dFacebook later put in place a version of this \u201creciprocity rule\u201d that required developers to make it possible for users of their apps to post their activity to Facebook, but did not require them to send usage data back to Facebook. (Not coincidentally, this \u201creciprocity rule\u201d explains why for several years, it was virtually impossible to go on Facebook without seeing dozens of updates about what your friends were watching on Hulu or listening to on Spotify.)But back in 2012, the company\u2019s worry was not about data misuse. Instead, the company was chiefly concerned with how to use those developers\u2019 apps to spur its own growth.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, wrote back to concur with Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s approach to data reciprocity.\u201cI think the observation that we are trying to maximize sharing on Facebook, not just sharing in the world, is a critical one,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}

Mr. Pichai came across as evasive and unwilling to acknowledge the legitimate concerns about Google\u2019s business practices.At holiday parties and informal discussions in Washington, the conversation often turned to big tech and privacy. There seemed to be a growing wariness among lawmakers, regulators and aides about data collection and the unrelenting push by companies to gather more information about us.While many expressed concern about the bigness of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, there wasn\u2019t a consensus on how to deal with them. A federal privacy law with real teeth seemed uncertain, and not many folks expected antitrust regulation even in the face of European action.All the while, tech companies continue to sell the message that they are job creators and engines of economic growth.\u25a0 An argument often made against antitrust action is that the technology industry is dynamic, and that today\u2019s dominant predator can become tomorrow\u2019s prey.

The internet company\u2019s push into one of Manhattan\u2019s most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of New York\u2019s biggest occupants of office space, allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than 14,000 over the next decade.\u201cLaw, medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at New York University who studies the city\u2019s economy.The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John\u2019s Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet.Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.Other big tech companies quickly followed. Amazon and Facebook each now have more than 2,000 employees in New York, while Apple and Salesforce each employ more than 1,000. LinkedIn has a large office in the Empire State Building, and IBM chose New York as the base for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Since 2009, jobs in tech and advertising in New York have increased 31 percent to 360,600, while financial-services jobs in the city increased about 12 percent to 475,500, according to an analysis of federal data by Ken McCarthy, principal economist at the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. By contrast, the education and health sectors employ about one million people in New York, while the hospitality industry employs 465,800, according to his analysis.Mr. McCarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer, meaning any bank employee is counted as finance. But New York\u2019s traditional industries \u2014 banking, retailing and consulting \u2014 have also added thousands of tech jobs. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers, including many in new fields like data science, blockchain and machine learning.And New York\u2019s tech sector is accelerating. Over the past year, the share of New York postings on the job site Indeed increased nearly 13 percent for tech jobs and just 2 percent for finance and accounting jobs. About 5 percent of all New York jobs posted on Indeed are now tech related, the site said, compared with 3 percent for finance and accounting.That growth has made San Francisco, which is a gateway to Silicon Valley, a sort of sister city to New York. As a result, the air route between them is one of the nation\u2019s most competitive and heavily trafficked.\u201cThere is more economic connectivity between New York and San Francisco than between New York and any of the declining upstate cities,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Google has expanded quietly and has not asked for public subsidies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government,\u201d William Floyd, Google\u2019s head of external affairs in New York said this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it by the dint our own work.\u201dAnd some in Manhattan are wary that Google and other businesses will begin to spread into historic neighborhoods.\u201cMy concern is that with Google\u2019s concentration in that area, it\u2019s going to pull in even more intense pressure for office development, particularly tech office development, in adjacent neighborhoods like the Village and East Village, where we are seeing it happen already,\u201d said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.Mr. Berman said he did not oppose Google\u2019s expansion in Hudson Square, which in the past decade has transformed into a commercial district, with many of its lofts and factories converted to offices for more than 1,000 companies, many in technology, advertising and media. Today, more than 50,000 people work in the neighborhood, and thousands more have made their home there following a 2013 city rezoning that allowed residential development.But Mr. Berman said the growing demand for offices has led to the demolition of historic buildings, pushed out longtime businesses and residents, and resulted in modern office towers that are out of character with the rest of the neighborhood.Chelsea has also witnessed rapid development over the past decade as it has mostly shed its working class roots and identity as a hub of gay night life. It still maintains large public housing projects, but is dotted with art galleries, new condominiums and expensive restaurants.In response, Google invested in local nonprofit organizations and said it would pay for a ferry stop at Pier 57, where it is renting office space, earning some plaudits from local elected officials.\u201cIn terms of buying the new buildings, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not chasing anyone out,\u201d said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been awfully good neighbors in Chelsea.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting from New York, and Ed Shanahan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Homegrown Chips Threaten Silicon Valley Giant Intel", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips.Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world.Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker.Intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends, from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence, as influence over chip designs has been shifting to Amazon, Apple and Google, which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry.The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn\u2019t had much competition in the server market in recent years. The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options.Intel acknowledges that companies like Amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier. \u201cI am not unaware of the dynamic,\u201d Lisa Spelman, an Intel vice president, said. \u201cOur goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire.\u201dAbout 35 percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about 10 companies, including large internet companies like Amazon and a handful of telecommunication firms, said Shane Rau, a chip analyst with the research firm IDC. That just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for Intel.\u201cEach one of these companies is so large, they represent a market unto themselves,\u201d Mr. Rau said.Apple beat the other tech giants to this cost-saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom-built chip for the iPhone. Google and Microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.Amazon has upped the ante. In 2015, it spent a reported $350 million to acquire a chip maker, Annapurna Labs, which helped build the new central processing unit, or C.P.U.A C.P.U. \u2014 the centerpiece of a computer\u2019s operations \u2014 is the sort of chip that Intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers. Building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. It is a big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks.\u201cThe belief was that you needed some magic to build a processor, particularly a server processor,\u201d said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the chip start-up Cerebras and a former executive at the chip maker AMD. \u201cYou had to be Intel or AMD \u2014 and that was about it.\u201dAmazon executives believe the chip, which was designed to be more energy efficient, will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers. It said it was offering a cloud-computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip. The cost of the service could be 45 percent lower than other options.And when Amazon buys chips from other companies, a homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices. \u201cThey can now say to Intel, \u2018We will just move the workloads to other chips,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feldman said.Though it is still enormously difficult, building a chip is easier than it used to be. Amazon licensed much of the technology from ARM, the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips. It made the chip through TSMC, a Taiwanese company.For Intel, Amazon\u2019s move into C.P.U.s is a strike at a longtime strength. Intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market a decade ago, a significant missed opportunity. The tech industry shifted, and Intel didn\u2019t shift with it.But Intel has a 96.6 percent share of server chip sales, according to IDC. It was 98.6 percent until its longtime competitor, AMD, which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about a decade, recently re-entered the market.Intel\u2019s profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry. But the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker\u2019s dependence on servers. Intel\u2019s data center group, which sells both server and A.I. chips, pulled in $6.1 billion, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The group now accounts for more than 30 percent of Intel\u2019s revenue.As the chip market has changed, Intel has tried to diversify. In recent years, it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones, cars and data centers.Through their fast-growing cloud computing services, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks. Going to a cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back-room computer systems \u2014 the tech experts do it for them.It is a lucrative business. Amazon Web Services brings in nearly $27 billion a year, and it accounts for 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s profits.Inside these cloud operations, the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built. They are designing much of their own hardware, from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers. Facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers.Amazon\u2019s new chip is running only a small fraction of the software across the company\u2019s online empire. But that is expected to expand.\u201cWe will look back at this as a watershed moment,\u201d said Mr. Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nashville\u2019s Star Rises as Midsize Cities Break Into Winners and Losers", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNashville and others are thriving thanks to a mix of luck, astute political choices and well-timed investments, while cities like Birmingham, Ala., fall behind.NASHVILLE \u2014 Forty years ago, Nashville and Birmingham, Ala., were peers. Two hundred miles apart, the cities anchored metropolitan areas of just under one million people each and had a similar number of jobs paying similar wages.Not anymore. The population of the Nashville area has roughly doubled, and young people have flocked there, drawn by high-paying jobs as much as its hip \u201cMusic City\u201d reputation. Last month, the city won an important consolation prize in the competition for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters: an operations center that will eventually employ 5,000 people at salaries averaging $150,000 a year.Birmingham, by comparison, has steadily lost population, and while its suburbs have expanded, their growth has lagged the Nashville area\u2019s. Once-narrow gaps in education and income have widened, and important employers like SouthTrust and Saks have moved their headquarters. Birmingham tried to lure Amazon, too, but all it is getting from the online retail giant is a warehouse and a distribution center where many jobs will pay about $15 an hour.Nashville and the other Amazon also-rans, like Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis, are thriving because of a combination of luck, astute political choices and well-timed investments. At the same time, Birmingham and cities like it, including Providence, R.I., and Rochester, are falling further behind.Last week, for example, Apple said it would invest $1 billion in Austin, Tex., and could eventually employ 15,000 people in the area, up from 6,000 now. Like Nashville, Austin is a booming state capital with a prominent university and it has a lively music scene.Nashville started with advantages. But local leaders also made some smart decisions like merging the city and county government in the 1960s, allowing Nashville and its suburbs to work together rather than at cross-purposes. And in the 1990s, when many downtowns across the county were struggling, the city built a convention center, a hockey arena and a new home for the Country Music Hall of Fame.By contrast, economic misfortune and poor choices have hobbled Birmingham. Once a center of steel production, the city suffered when that industry declined in the 1980s because of foreign competition and corporate bankruptcies. Local leaders tried to pivot by luring banks and insurers, but that bet soured during the financial crisis, and the city hasn\u2019t recovered the jobs it lost then.\u201cA place like Birmingham hasn\u2019t fallen off the map, but it\u2019s been bypassed by these places that have moved into this more clearly defined second tier,\u201d said Adam Kamins, an economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s treading water, and treading water tends to not be enough.\u201dAsk Ralph Schulz, president of Nashville\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, why this city has done so well and he begins with the Civil War. Nashville surrendered early, allowing it to avoid the destruction that befell many Southern cities. Union troops used the city as a logistics hub, which laid the groundwork for its postwar economy.Nashville stood apart in other ways, too. The city was less dependent on manufacturing, in part because being Tennessee\u2019s capital brought lucrative \u2014 and relatively recession-proof \u2014 public investments. Its colleges and universities, anchored by Vanderbilt University, earned it a reputation as the \u201cAthens of the South.\u201dThe music business, which grew out of a 19th-century publishing industry, gave the city an international reputation, while the growth of Hospital Corporation of America in the 20th century turned the city into a health care hub.As a result, Nashville had a diversified economy and an educated work force that left it well positioned for the 21st century. But success wasn\u2019t inevitable. As recently as the 1990s, the city was portrayed as a backwater on the variety show \u201cHee Haw.\u201dRonald L. Samuels, a local banker and civic leader, recalled being asked about Graceland \u2014 which is in Memphis \u2014 when visiting New York with the Chamber of Commerce in the 1980s.\u201cWe had to answer the \u2018Where\u2019s Nashville?\u2019 question many times,\u201d Mr. Samuels said.Beginning in the early 1990s, though, political, business and nonprofit leaders tried to promote Nashville. State and local leaders adopted a regional approach to economic development to recruit companies such as Bridgestone, Nissan and UBS. Tennessee overhauled its community college system and work force development efforts to align better with the jobs being created.Starting under Mayor Phil Bredesen, who later became Tennessee\u2019s governor, the city invested in big projects that helped revive downtown, a key part of the city\u2019s success.Economists disagree about what policies are most effective at helping cities grow \u2014 or if policies matter much. Some, such as Michael Porter of Harvard and Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, have emphasized the importance of cultivating a \u201ccreative class\u201d of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. Others, such as Jan Rivkin of Harvard, stress the importance of civic leadership. Pretty much everyone agrees that having an elite university is a big advantage.Whatever the exact ingredients, Nashville hit on a winning recipe. The urban renewal that began under Mr. Bredesen turned into a boom after the Great Recession, which, thanks to Nashville\u2019s diverse mix of industries, was comparatively mild here. The Gulch, a former rail yard and industrial district, was transformed into a vibrant neighborhood full of hip bars, luxury condominiums and boutique hotels.Tourism took off, thanks in part to the ABC television country-music drama \u201cNashville.\u201d Some of those tourists stuck around: The number of college graduates younger than 35 nearly doubled over a decade, to 155,000 by 2017.Employers soon followed. Among them are Eventbrite, a San Francisco tech company, and EY, the accounting firm, which last month announced plans to open an office downtown for 600 workers. AllianceBernstein, an investment company, decided in May to move its headquarters to Nashville, from New York, in part because of the big-city-worthy cultural amenities and the small-city cost of living.The company has been flooded with calls from finance industry workers interested in moving to Nashville, said Karl Sprules, an AllianceBernstein executive who is helping lead the transition.In recent decades, the most successful cities have achieved a kind of economic gravity drawing the best jobs and most talented workers. That\u2019s why few economists were surprised when Amazon chose New York and the Washington area for its big expansion.But the effect isn\u2019t limited to a few urban giants. Mark Muro, who researches cities for the Brookings Institution, likened it to a fractal pattern: Look past the top cities and there is another layer of inequality. \u201cNashville is not a superstar, but it\u2019s at the top end of this next echelon,\u201d Mr. Muro said.The success of the superstars and the substars like Nashville has come at the expense of Birmingham and other smaller cities.Birmingham\u2019s great boom arrived a century before Nashville\u2019s, when the region\u2019s iron and mineral deposits helped it become one of the nation\u2019s largest steel producers. But as the steel industry declined across the country, Birmingham struggled to find a replacement.But Birmingham also has some significant assets. It has a research university, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with a top-flight medical school and hospital. Research conducted at the university has helped fuel a budding start-up scene, and an affiliated incubator in a former Sears store, Innovation Depot, is home to more than 100 new companies.Last year, the city elected a young mayor, Randall Woodfin, who has put economic development at the center of his agenda. He has created a Neighborhood Revitalization Fund to fix up homes and demolish dilapidated structures, and wants to use business tax incentives to help lift wages, not just create jobs.\u201cAs a midsize city, we have to be very intentional about diversifying our economy,\u201d Mr. Woodfin said. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting on Amazon or some other company to come in and save Birmingham.\u201dThe question for city leaders is whether they can overcome the economic forces driving inequality among cities.Birmingham\u2019s work force is also less educated than the work forces in other cities of comparable size, and its schools aren\u2019t training workers with the skills they need, the report concluded.Mr. Woodfin faces another challenge: Instead of collaborating, cities and towns in the area often compete against one another. Birmingham proper accounts for just a third of the population of Jefferson County, with cities frequently offering multimillion-dollar tax incentives to lure businesses across town lines.Mr. Sher would like Birmingham to follow Nashville in merging the city and county governments. He noted that Louisville, Ky., saw substantial growth after it did that in 2003.But even as some look to Nashville as an example, they want to avoid repeating its mistakes. Nashville\u2019s boom has brought congestion and soaring housing costs, making the city unaffordable for many longtime residents, particularly African-Americans.\u201cWhat is the policy, other than growth?\u201d asked Paulette Coleman, a local affordable-housing activist. \u201cIf economic growth is only benefiting a small percentage, you just keep getting these widening disparities.\u201dThose concerns raise questions about Nashville\u2019s future. The city has thrived in part by being an affordable alternative to New York and Atlanta. It may soon have to compete with them directly by trying to become a superstar in its own right.In Birmingham, Mayor Woodfin said the city must follow a different path.\u201cI am 100 percent convinced we do not have to be the next Nashville or the next Austin or the next Charlotte,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be the best Birmingham.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Tech Too Easy to Use?", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSeven years ago, a younger and more carefree Mark Zuckerberg went onstage at Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference and announced a major change to the social network\u2019s design.\u201cFrom here on out, it\u2019s a frictionless experience,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Of all the buzzwords in tech, perhaps none has been deployed with as much philosophical conviction as \u201cfrictionless.\u201d Over the past decade or so, eliminating \u201cfriction\u201d \u2014 the name given to any quality that makes a product more difficult or time-consuming to use \u2014 has become an obsession of the tech industry, accepted as gospel by many of the world\u2019s largest companies.Airbnb, Uber and hundreds of other start-ups have made billions of dollars by reducing the effort needed to rent rooms, hail taxis and complete other annoying tasks. And when a company fails, excessive friction is often cited as the reason.There is nothing wrong with making things easier, in most cases, and the history of technology is filled with examples of amazing advances brought about by reducing complexity. Not even the most hardened Luddite, I suspect, wants to go back to the days of horse-drawn carriages and hand-crank radios.Over the past several weeks, I\u2019ve spoken to more than a dozen designers, product managers and tech executives about the principles of frictionless design. Many said that while making products easier to use was usually good, there were cases where friction could be useful in preventing harm, and steering users toward healthier behavior.Bobby Goodlatte, a former Facebook designer who is now an angel investor, told me that the tech industry\u2019s culture of optimization \u201cpresumes that reducing friction is virtuous unto itself.\u201d\u201cIt leads us to ask, \u2018Can we?\u2019 \u2014 never \u2018Should we?\u2019\u201d he said.Several people praised the Time Well Spent movement spearheaded by Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, as a kind of pro-friction cohort within the tech industry. Among other things, the group has successfully pressured companies like Facebook and Apple to take steps to curb tech addiction by including features that encourage users to limit their screen time.And a few lamented that in the tech industry\u2019s race for convenience, something important had been lost.\u201cWe wanted to juice engagement and therefore made things as frictionless as possible,\u201d said Jenna Bilotta, a design manager who has worked at Google. \u201cWe made a whole world of the literal \u2018least you could do\u2019 apps, and it\u2019s trashing people\u2019s mental health.\u201dOften, invoking the concept of friction is a useful way to obscure some larger, less savory goal. For Facebook, \u201cfrictionless sharing\u201d was a thinly veiled cover for the company\u2019s true goal of getting users to post more often, and increasing the amount of data available for ad targeting. For YouTube, auto-playing videos have sharply increased view time, thereby increasing the platform\u2019s profitability. And for Amazon, tools like one-click ordering have created a stunningly efficient machine for commerce and consumption.\u201cOur current application of tech has been to take something hard and make it easy,\u201d said Harper Reed, an engineer and the chief technology officer for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.When tech companies do make their products harder to use, it\u2019s generally to secure them from hackers, spammers or other malicious actors. (Think of the security Captchas that require users to solve math problems or pick out photos of traffic lights, or the way YouTube requires new users to verify their phone numbers before uploading videos longer than 15 minutes.)More of these kinds of changes would be welcome, even if they led to a short-term hit to engagement. And there are plenty of possibilities.What if Facebook made it harder for viral misinformation to spread by adding algorithmic \u201cspeed bumps\u201d that would delay the spread of a controversial post above a certain threshold until fact checkers evaluated it?Or if YouTube gave users a choice between two videos when their video finished, instead of auto-playing the next recommendation?Or if Twitter discouraged abusive pile-ons by making it harder for people who haven\u2019t followed an account for a set number of days to reply to that account\u2019s tweets?This approach might seem overly paternalistic. But the alternative \u2014 a tech infrastructure optimized to ask as little of us as possible, with few circuit breakers to limit the impact of abuse and addiction \u2014 is frightening. After all, \u201cfriction\u201d is just another word for \u201ceffort,\u201d and it\u2019s what makes us capable of critical thought and self-reflection. Without it, we would be the blob people from \u201cWall-E,\u201d sucking down Soylent while watching Netflix on our self-driving recliners.\u201cImagine you run a social network and you\u2019re trying to aggregate all the trending stories based on what all users are clicking,\u201d Mr. Harris, the Time Well Spent founder, told me recently. \u201cWould you prefer to jack the plug into each person\u2019s reptilian brain to aggregate those stories, or would you prefer to jack the plug into their calm, reflective brain that is considering the consequences downstream?\u201dThere may even be a business case for complexity.Consider what happened to Tulerie, a New York start-up that makes a platform that allows women to share designer clothing.Tulerie\u2019s co-founder Merri Smith told me a fascinating story from the company\u2019s early days. In the beginning, Ms. Smith said, the company invited women to join via a brief Google survey, which it emailed to hundreds of prospective members.\u201cWe wanted to create as little friction as possible, while still having to vet these people,\u201d she said.But only one person filled out the survey. So Ms. Smith and her co-founder decided to try a more complicated approach. Anyone who wanted to join had to conduct a brief video call with a company employee first.Logically, the new strategy should have failed. But it was a huge hit. Prospective members flooded the invite list, filling up the company\u2019s interview schedule weeks in advance. By creating a more complex sign-up, Tulerie had signalled that its service was special and worth the effort.\u201cIt goes back to values,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cPeople perceive it as harder to get into, and they want to be a part of it.\u201dI don\u2019t want to romanticize the slow, often frustrating processes of the past. There is nothing inherently good about complexity, and the tech industry could still do a lot of good by reducing friction in systems like health care, education and financial services.But there are both philosophical and practical reasons to ask whether certain technologies should be a little less optimized for convenience. We wouldn\u2019t trust a doctor who made speed a priority over safety. Why would we trust an app that does?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Will Update iPhones in China to Avoid a Ban on Sales", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple and its longtime chip supplier, Qualcomm, have been fighting in court over Apple\u2019s use of Qualcomm\u2019s technology. On Nov. 30, a Chinese court ruled Apple must immediately stop selling seven older iPhone models in China because it infringed on two Qualcomm patents.But Apple has not stopped selling those iPhones there. The company has argued the phones are not subject to the ruling because they are running new software that was not discussed at trial.On Friday, Apple said in a statement that it would update its iPhones in China early next week \u201cto address any possible concern about our compliance with the order.\u201d Apple said its update would change the iPhones\u2019 software so it did not infringe on Qualcomm patents, which relate to switching between apps and changing the size and appearance of photographs.Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement that Apple was already violating the court\u2019s order.\u201cThey are legally obligated to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of the devices identified in the orders and to prove compliance in court,\u201d he said. Qualcomm this week asked Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court to enforce its injunction.Apple also asked the court to reconsider its ruling. The company told the court it made about $13.3 billion on iPhone sales in China in the first quarter of 2018, meaning it would lose millions of dollars a day if it had to stop selling certain phones in the country.The court\u2019s preliminary injunction barred Apple from selling the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X in China. The ruling did not apply to Apple\u2019s three newest iPhones: the XS, the XS Max and the XR.A lawyer for Qualcomm in China told the Financial Times this week that the company would also seek bans on sales of Apple\u2019s newest iPhones, claiming they were also infringing Qualcomm\u2019s patents.Advertisement"}
