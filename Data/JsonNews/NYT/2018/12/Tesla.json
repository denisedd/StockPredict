We would play for hours.\u201d\u201cThis was a passion project,\u201d Mr. Bachrach said, \u201cthat turned into a significant business for us.\u201d\u201cIn the past, we thought games were more disposable entertainment,\u201d said Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst for NPD, a market research company. \u201cThere is a lot of intrinsic value that old games can provide.\u201dOne in five new consoles sold in the United States this year has been a retro plug-and-play device, Mr. Piscatella said, contributing to the overall growth in the video game industry. Sales of hardware, software and accessories in the United States reached $14.6 billion in 2017, an 11 percent increase over 2016, according to NPD.\u201cEverything in gaming has gotten so complicated and tech heavy,\u201d Mr. Piscatella said. \u201cHere\u2019s this $80 device that you can plug into a TV and go.\u201dFor players looking to play the games on a modern device, Nintendo offered 20 classic games to subscribers of its Nintendo Switch Online network, a premium service that went live in September, and has plans to add more.\u201cPeople remember the colors and shape of the console and the feel of the controllers from their childhood, and they have a visceral reaction when they first fire up their favorite NES or Super NES games,\u201d said Reginald Fils-Aim\u00e9, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like watching a classic movie versus a remake or a colorized version,\u201d Mr. Lempel said. \u201cThis is the way you remember those games.\u201dSmaller companies are having success licensing games and repackaging them with new hardware. AtGames, a manufacturer in Taiwan, has sold titles from developers like Activision, Atari and Bandai Namco for more than a decade through its Flashback series, which packages games on replicas of the once popular Atari 2600 and Sega Genesis consoles.AtGames\u2019 latest offering, Blast, is a pared-down version with fewer games, a small controller and a dongle that plugs into an HDMI port on a TV. This new product allows the company to move into a lower price point, said PK Hsiung, the company\u2019s chief executive. Nintendo and PlayStation aim for typical technology retailers, he said, but 80 percent of AtGames\u2019 sales come from retailers like CVS, Kroger, Walgreens and Bed Bath & Beyond.\u201cThey are not competing with us,\u201d Mr. Hsiung said of his bigger rivals. \u201cThey are helping us by making retro games mainstream.\u201dThe influx of games and new consoles is starting to make analysts like Mr. Piscatella of NPD wonder how much longer the sales growth can last. Nintendo dominates sales, but it has not announced plans to release other classic consoles. Other publishers may face difficulties, Mr. Piscatella added, like finding the right fit for their games or securing licenses.Rather than license their games to other companies, some video game publishers are releasing them on their own. After finding a hit with a retro Crash Bandicoot package last year, Activision remastered a trilogy of games featuring Spyro the Dragon.\u201cIt\u2019s probably better to say we remade these games,\u201d said Steve Young, executive vice president and chief revenue officer at Activision. Because of advances in the processing power of consoles, studios are able to rebuild games from the ground up with high-definition graphics, he said.Even the music was updated. The publisher invited Stewart Copeland, the former drummer for the Police and the composer of the original Spyro series\u2019 soundtrack, to create a new main theme for the remastered version.Other publishers are reaching deals with accessory makers like Retro-Bit. The company\u2019s Super Retro-Cade console features more than 90 titles from publishers like Capcom, Data East, Irem and Technos.\u201cThis console brings a lot of games released out of Japan that were never released in the U.S.,\u201d said Richard Igros, the marketing manager for Innex, the distributor of Retro-Bit products. The company also repackages hard-to-find classic games on cartridges made for older consoles.One of their biggest sellers, for instance, is a collection that includes an obscure title, Magic Drop. \u201cIt\u2019s not a well-known game,\u201d Mr. Igros admits, \u201cbut it has a cult following.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Computers Used to Be Built in the U.S. It Was a Mess.", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "Past TenseSteve Jobs tried to create a manufacturing culture in Silicon Valley. As one former Apple engineer put it, \"It wasn't great for business.\"Supported byIn 1988, when Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e took a close look at Apple\u2019s \u201chighly automated\u201d Macintosh factory in Fremont, Calif., what he saw was not pretty. His experience assembling a Macintosh computer display and then stuffing chips into a computer motherboard is an important part of the story behind the artful language on the iPhone box \u2014 \u201cDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.\u201dAfter Apple announced a large new campus in Austin, Tex. \u2014 creating as many as 15,000 jobs, none of them expected to be manufacturing \u2014 it\u2019s worth looking at the company\u2019s flirtation with advanced manufacturing in Silicon Valley in the 1980s. Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, had an abiding fascination with the tradition of Henry Ford and the original mass manufacturing of automobiles in Detroit, as well as the high-quality domestic manufacturing capabilities of Japanese companies like Sony. But his efforts to replicate either in California were examples of his rare failures.\u201cSteve had deep convictions about Japanese manufacturing processes,\u201d recalled Randy Battat, who joined Apple as a young electrical engineer and oversaw the introduction of some of the company\u2019s early portable computers. \u201cThe Japanese were heralded as wizards of manufacturing. The idea was to create a factory with just-in-time delivery of zero-defect parts. It wasn\u2019t great for business.\u201dWhat Mr. Gass\u00e9e found several years after Mr. Jobs was forced out of the company, was that the reality of manufacturing was different than the personal computer pioneer\u2019s original dream.Ultimately, the Macintosh factory closed in 1992, in part because it never realized the production volume that Mr. Jobs had envisioned \u2014 such sales numbers for the Mac would only come later.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a manufacturing culture,\u201d Mr. Gass\u00e9e said of the nation\u2019s high-technology heartland, \u201cmeaning the substrate, the schooling, the apprentices, the subcontractors.\u201dIn 1990, just a mile and half from where he had built the original Mac factory, he created another $10 million one to manufacture his Next Inc. personal workstation. Like the early Macintosh, however, he was never able to make flashy jet-black Next machines in quantities to support a Silicon Valley-based assembly operation.That failure taught Mr. Jobs the lesson. He returned to Apple in 1997, and the next year, he hired Tim Cook as Apple\u2019s senior vice president for worldwide operations. Mr. Cook had mastered the art of global manufacturing supply chains, first in IBM\u2019s personal computer business and then at Compaq Computer.\u201cWhen I started my career, all my flights were to Japan,\u201d said Tony Fadell, one of the hardware designers of the iPod and iPhone at Apple. \u201cThen all my flights went Korea, then Taiwan, then China.\u201dThrough the 1980s and 1990s, there were many people who predicted the manufacturing flight would mean the death of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Will Slash Car Tariffs, Trump Says in a (Vague) Tweet", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a late-night Twitter post on Sunday, Mr. Trump said that China had agreed to make a small but politically significant concession to the United States: It would drop tariffs on imports of American-made cars.China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%.\u201cChina has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S.,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCurrently the tariff is 40%.\u201dThe disclosure took trade watchers and auto industry figures in both countries by surprise. The issue of auto tariffs had not appeared in either government\u2019s public statement after the temporary trade-war truce.It was unclear what China had agreed to do, if it had agreed to do anything at all. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry referred questions to the Commerce Ministry. That ministry was silent, and its weekly news conference is not until Thursday. American officials were unavailable for comment.The confusion is perhaps inevitable. Chinese leaders hoard information as a way of bolstering their political power. Add to that Mr. Trump\u2019s predilection for trying to summarize complex issues in Twitter posts of a few words, and the potential for confusion can grow quickly.China does not import many cars from the United States. American imports are roughly 1 percent of the market, or about $10.5 billion worth. While Chinese drivers love to buy Chevrolets and Fords, those vehicles are generally made in Chinese factories through joint ventures between local and American carmakers.Mr. Trump targeted Chinese-made cars when he issued his first tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese-made goods, marking the opening salvo of the trade war. China retaliated by raising tariffs on American-made cars to 40 percent, compared with 15 percent on cars from everywhere else.Still, it was far from clear that was the case, and industry experts said the president\u2019s Twitter post seemed to leave open a variety of interpretations.One possibility is that Mr. Trump was mistakenly referring to China\u2019s move this summer to reduce tariffs on auto imports from everywhere to 15 percent from 25 percent. China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs brought the rate on American-made cars up to 40 percent.Another possibility is that a deal on cars was part of a larger agreement alluded to in vague statements the United States issued on Saturday night, when the truce was first announced. The Trump administration said China had agreed to purchase \u201cagricultural, energy, industrial and other product from the United States.\u201d As a practical matter, China would have to lower its tariffs on American-made goods or those purchases would be more expensive.But that would be politically sensitive in China because the Buenos Aires accord allows the United States to keep its tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese-made goods, though Washington agreed to postpone a Jan. 1 increase in tariff rates.If cuts in tariffs on American-made cars are in the works, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be German. BMW and Mercedes-Benz both produce sport utility vehicles in the United States and export them all over the world, including a combined total of roughly 180,000 a year to China. That is still a tiny share of China\u2019s auto market, which reached 24.7 million cars sold last year.American brands in China usually have a local flavor. General Motors ships almost no American-built vehicles to China. Fiat Chrysler ships some Jeep Grand Cherokees but has a huge new factory in southern China to build most other Jeeps. Ford ships a few Lincolns but is shifting production of these models for the Chinese market to factories in China. Tesla ships electric cars to China from the United States but is preparing to build its own factory in Shanghai.Any reduction in tariffs \u201cis very good news for some niche products,\u201d said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm. \u201cThe international giants have already localized most of their mass production cars.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Scrambles to Sell Cars Before a Tax Break Fades", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year, Mitch Mallin bought a metallic blue Tesla Model 3 sedan equipped with heated seats and a bevy of other options, all for $56,000 \u2014 twice as much as he had ever paid for a car before.The final cost will be lowered by a $7,500 federal tax credit, a bonus available to buyers of electric vehicles.Mr. Mallin, a retired actuary from Farmington Hills, Mich., said he probably would have bought the car even without the tax credit because he wanted to \u201cparticipate in the movement\u201d to fight global warming and drive zero-emission cars.Still, the credit \u201cwas factored in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a rebate.\u201dBut not for much longer. Under federal rules, the full tax credit is available only on the first 200,000 cars that a manufacturer sells in the United States; two quarters later, the credit is reduced. Tesla reached that threshold in July. As a result, the credit available to Tesla buyers will fall to $3,750 for cars delivered on or after Jan. 1, then will be halved again on July 1 and go away completely in 2020.The phaseout could hurt Tesla\u2019s ability to reach a broader group of car buyers. The company\u2019s lineup starts at nearly $50,000, before incentives, for the Model 3 and climbs to $140,000 for a top-of-the-line Model X sport utility vehicle. Tesla has long promised an entry-level Model 3 that would cost $35,000, but the company has acknowledged that it could not sell that car profitably right now.\u201cHow many buyers are there out for a $60,000 car?\u201d asked Karl Brauer, executive publisher of the auto information providers Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThere\u2019s always the possibility Tesla is going to hit the saturation point.\u201dIn the last month, Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have been scrambling to sell as many cars as possible before the end of the year.Last week, Mr. Musk went even further by pledging to reimburse customers if delivery problems caused them to get a tax credit of $3,750 instead of $7,500.The company\u2019s sales centers have been telling prospective customers that the company has hundreds of Model 3s in inventory around the country and can deliver cars to buyers within 48 hours in many cases. Its Indianapolis showroom, because it is close to a large inventory lot, has been offering same-day deliveries to walk-in customers.Some analysts said they doubted that the halving of the tax credit alone would slow sales next year. Many of the company\u2019s customers are well-off professionals, dedicated environmentalists or devoted believers in Tesla who would most likely be unfazed by the loss of tax credits.\u201cI think there\u2019s still so many people who want to buy a Model 3 and are willing to pay a lot of money for it,\u201d said David Whiston, an auto analyst at Morningstar. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it.\u201dDespite protracted manufacturing glitches \u2014 customers had to wait several weeks to take delivery of a Model 3 \u2014 and the legal troubles of Mr. Musk, Tesla had a breakout year in sales. In the first three quarters of 2018, the company delivered more than 154,000 cars, including 82,000 Model 3 sedans. In all of 2017, the company sold just 101,000 cars.The surge in Model 3 production and sales helped drive Tesla to a third-quarter profit of $312 million, its first quarterly profit in two years and its largest ever.Dr. Peter Bankoff, an anesthesiologist with homes in Arizona and Colorado, took delivery in August of a silver, all-wheel-drive Model 3 that cost $65,000. He reserved the car in March 2016 and was so eager to get it, he didn\u2019t think much about the tax credit.\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll use the credit, but after waiting two and a half years for the car, I was going to buy it no matter what,\u201d Dr. Bankoff said. He\u2019s enthralled by the car, too. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fun you can have with your clothes on,\u201d he said.That Tesla has so many customers willing to pay full price for a Model 3 is a reflection of the strength of the company\u2019s brand and its success in drawing luxury car buyers. In the first nine months of the year, Tesla reported sales that exceeded those of more established brands like Volvo, Acura, Infiniti, Lincoln and Cadillac, and trailed only Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Lexus.Dr. Rob Frank, a plastic surgeon from Oak Park, Ill., had been driving an Acura TL until the end of October, when his Model 3 arrived. While he loves the car\u2019s acceleration, he said, it wasn\u2019t just technology that drew him in.\u201cI like Elon\u2019s vision for the company,\u201d Dr. Frank said. \u201cI like what he\u2019s trying to do.\u201d The tax credit, he added, had no impact on his buying decision.Tesla isn\u2019t the only automaker dealing with a tax-credit phaseout. General Motors is expected to pass the 200,000 sales mark as early as this month. The credit is available now on the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid, and the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. In the first 11 months of 2018, G.M. sold more than 32,000 Volts and Bolts.The market for electric cars will soon become much bigger as manufacturers like Audi and Mercedes-Benz begin selling new models that will be eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit for some time. In the first half of 2019, Audi is expected to begin offering the E-Tron, a battery-powered S.U.V. that would be a direct competitor of the Model X. The E-Tron is expected to have a starting price of about $75,000.Mercedes-Benz is expected to introduce a small electric sedan next year to compete with the Model 3.Knowing that it could be harder to sell its cars in 2019, Tesla appears to be doing everything it can to close sales before the end of the year.The company is making available for sale vehicles that have been used as demonstration models, and others that had been assigned to customers who are planning to take delivery after the first of the year. Since October, Tesla has also allowed customers who buy without a test drive three days to return the car for a full refund, a step that makes it less risky to buy a Tesla sight unseen \u2014 something Mr. Mallin, the retired actuary, did.\u201cI hadn\u2019t even sat in one before I bought mine,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The stench was very bad, stronger than a skunk.\u201dThe Uppals are among hundreds of people across California who have showed up at town hall meetings, petitioned city councils and hired lawyers to fight an unanticipated consequence of marijuana legalization: the stink from pot farms across the state.Those affected by the smell say it is much more potent than the pot cloud above a Grateful Dead concert or the medicinal smell of a cannabis dispensary.In the case of the Uppal family, the cannabis was being grown in greenhouses nestled in the vineyard several hundred feet away. One member of the Uppal family with muscular dystrophy, Jiwan, had trouble breathing and was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital.\u201cThe smell was so bad we couldn\u2019t even go outside,\u201d Ms. Uppal said.The smell stretched to the nearby Old Adobe Elementary Charter School, where children playing outside asked what the odor was, according to the school\u2019s principal, Jeff Williamson.\u201cSome parents were really upset about it,\u201d Mr. Williamson said.With three other families in the neighborhood, the Uppals sued the pot grower, Carlos Zambrano, who was found to be operating without a license, according to the Uppals\u2019 lawyer, Kevin Block.The Uppals and their neighbors sued in federal court under the RICO Act \u2014 the decades-old law designed to prosecute organized crime \u2014 to stop the cannabis operation and recover $60,000 they paid in legal fees so far. The court will hear a motion to dismiss the case on Thursday.Under a settlement agreement with the county, the grower was ordered to pay more than $400,000 in fines and back taxes. But the settlement came with a twist that puzzled the Uppals: He was allowed to harvest and sell his crop in part so that he could pay the fines.\u201cI told my husband, \u2018We are in the wrong business,\u2019\u201d Ms. Uppal said.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Satellites are shrinking in size and expanding in ambition. Made smaller, the craft are less expensive and more accessible to a wider group of interests, and they enable, among other advances, the ability to observe Earth\u2019s environment more completely and regularly than ever before. For years, space was dominated by just two nations, the United States and the Soviet Union. Their designs were big: Rockets grew taller than 20-story apartment buildings. Satellites expanded to the size of city buses. Spy satellites unfurled antennas nearly as large as football fields.\u201cIt\u2019s been really great,\u201d said Brent Freeze, an aerospace specialist who advises the 160 students. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to get smart young people to talk to each other and work together.\u201d To be sure, huge satellites still regularly fly into orbit, especially ones devoted to espionage and national security. These gargantuan craft are made by some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, and the costs can run to billions of dollars \u2014 creating an incentive to keep making them big, aerospace critics say.\u201cThere was a feeling for a long time that space was a mature field,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s gone away now.\u201dMany of the new craft do traditional jobs on the cheap, such as assessing crops, mapping cities, relaying signals and managing natural resources. Wall Street analysts use the new flows of information to better assess futures markets. Companies such as Planet Labs want to make Earth observation less about spying than about helping scientists and the public better track environmental change, in an effort to improve management and remediation.\u201cIt\u2019s the first of its kind,\u201d said Payam Banazadeh, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOut of a tiny box comes a humongous structure.\u201dNot every space mission can use tiny satellites. Miniaturization may not work for orbiting telescopes used in astronomy, nor for high-powered satellites that beam television signals to rooftop antennas and home viewers.But the appeal of miniaturization is likely to grow: a large mission becomes less vulnerable to total failure if it can be subdivided into many tiny parts. \u201cYou add robustness,\u201d said Dr. McDowell, the Harvard astronomer. \u201cThat\u2019s been talked about for a long time, but now it\u2019s happening.\u201dWith the California fires now under control, Planet Labs is looking for new situations that could benefit from eyes on high.\u201cWe\u2019re space geeks,\u201d Mr. Marshall, the company\u2019s head, conceded.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Showtime for Elon Musk\u2019s Boring Co., With a Long Way to Go", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAWTHORNE, Calif. \u2014 Fed up with Southern California vehicle snarls, Elon Musk set out to solve the persistent urban irritant: the traffic. But rather than build atop the highway system, where his Tesla cars travel, or in the sky, home to his SpaceX rockets, he sought an answer under his feet: tunnels.\u201cI said, \u2018What if we go down instead of up?\u2019\u201d Mr. Musk told Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles during a recent public discussion. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in L.A. now since 2002. Traffic has gone from bad to horrific back to bad.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk unveiled the first mile-long stretch of his underground vision of a transit system in Hawthorne, a suburb of 90,000 people about 15 miles southwest of Los Angeles. It is the home of both SpaceX and his tunneling enterprise, called the Boring Company.But the promotional event, which attracted hundreds of people who lined up to see the tunnel, fell short of earlier promises of a system that could transport up to 16 people at a time in electric-powered pods. Mr. Musk said he had abandoned that concept in favor of a system using more conventional passenger vehicles.\u201cSo what we believe we have here is a real solution to the traffic problem we have on earth,\u201d Mr. Musk told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s much more like an underground highway.\u201dAngie Reyes English, a former member of the Hawthorne City Council, was among the first visitors to go through the tunnel. She said she had voted for the project and was glad to see the result.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bumpy,\u201d Ms. English said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to be improved. It\u2019s a test tunnel. I think it was cleverly done.\u201dThe entrance to the tunnel sits across the street from the SpaceX headquarters and the Hawthorne Municipal Airport, next to a single-family residence and behind some storefront-style buildings.Test rides on Tuesday featured Tesla Model X electric cars that were lowered on a circular panel to a lighted pathway several stories underground that is wide enough for a single vehicle. The concrete walls are painted white, with a single fluorescent bar on the ceiling that lights up blue or green throughout the tunnel\u2019s length.A pair of clamps attached to the Tesla\u2019s front wheels keeps the car on the track as the vehicle moves under its own power. The company says speeds of 150 miles per hour will be possible, though the test run was far slower.Until now, the company has used standard tunneling equipment, but it expects to roll out newly engineered technology as its efforts continue. Mr. Musk said about $10 million was spent on the first mile of the system, which took about a year to complete, largely because of hurdles with permits and licenses.But costs are likely to rise. Subway tunneling elsewhere in the world can cost $1 billion a mile or more; Mr. Musk has said that figure must be reduced by a factor of 10 to make his system viable on a larger scale.Even then, the Hawthorne tunnel is at best a proof of concept. To make such a system extensive enough to serve one of the world\u2019s biggest metropolitan areas, with private funding, seems a herculean proposition.One hurdle may be to convince urban planners that it is a practical way of easing the traffic crush.\u201cI like technology,\u201d James E. Moore, director of the transportation engineering program at the University of Southern California, said this week. \u201cI admire Elon Musk. So I want to say, \u2018Yes, this is a good idea,\u2019 but I really can\u2019t.\u201dMr. Moore said solving traffic problems did not require building anything new. He said the more important consideration was how to better manage what we already have, \u201cbefore we look up or down, before I look at either one.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve never built our way out of congestion,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cI think there are cheaper ways to provide better transportation for large numbers of people.\u201d For example, Mr. Moore said managing highway traffic with tolls or other economic policies could help reduce congestion.During his public conversation with Mr. Musk last month, Mr. Garcetti noted that many of \u201cthe folks who make tunnels\u201d were skeptical of Mr. Musk\u2019s plans, but he added: \u201cThis is much larger than a tunnel. You\u2019re talking about a transportation system.\u201dThe tunnel was first expected to be more of a mass-transit system, but that prospect seems gone with the decision not to use the 16-passenger pods.The system that Mr. Musk proposes for Los Angeles, called a loop, is distinct from the transportation mode known as a hyperloop \u2014 something he and others are also developing. The hyperloop uses a vacuum to reduce friction to achieve speeds up to 600 m.p.h., while the loop does not require that technology because it is designed for slower speeds and shorter distances.\u201cThe loop is a step toward hyperloop,\u201d Mr. Musk said.Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group is also developing a hyperloop, called Virgin Hyperloop One. The venture has built a test track in the Nevada desert and is in talks to build a line connecting Kansas City and St. Louis.Mr. Musk said his concepts had attracted significant attention from cities across the country, and he defended tunneling against criticism that it might be disruptive to neighborhoods. \u201cYou cannot see, hear or feel tunnel construction,\u201d Mr. Musk said.The Boring Company is still determining what its fares will be but says they will be comparable to those in other mass-transit systems, or cheaper. Mr. Musk said passengers not riding in their own cars might be transported in vehicles owned by the Boring Company for about $1 per ride.\u201cIf it\u2019s our capital, if it\u2019s public capital, I wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Moore said of Mr. Musk\u2019s loop project. \u201cBut he should feel free to risk all of the capital he can assemble.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As New York City mayor, Bill DeBlasio, put it, at the end of the day, 25,000 jobs are going somewhere. Why shouldn\u2019t the city have them?In leaving metropolitan New York for Charlotte, Honeywell cited the ability to recruit talent, which is, oddly enough, the same reason Amazon cited to choose metropolitan New York, in the form of Queens, for its HQ2. That, and as much as $3 billion in incentives.Of course it will, until a better offer comes along. And that\u2019s exactly the problem with our corporate welfare system. Companies like G.M. know that if they dangle a new plant like a piece of meat \u2014 perhaps the one that will make autonomous vehicles \u2014 the political and economic development dogs will come running. And they will always find lawmakers ready to provide tax breaks with a wispy hope that they will make everyone\u2019s life better. Like G.M., they\u2019ll behave as if the Lordstown plant never existed. And soon, it might not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Electric Vehicles Are Gathering Speed in Latin America", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo fight global warming and air pollution, cities across the region are taking advantage of innovations in urban transportation. Ms. Viscidi and Mr. Edwards are specialist in energy and climate change.But several factors are impeding the progress of EVs in Latin America, including upfront costs that are hefty for developing countries, subsidized fossil fuels, a lack of vehicle fuel efficiency standards, insufficient charging infrastructure, and bidding processes to procure new buses, which prioritize least cost options disqualifying cleaner technologies with higher upfront costs. To overcome these barriers, governments need to strengthen financial incentives and standards favoring clean technologies, expand programs for electrifying high-use vehicles, develop electric mobility strategies and goals, and create public-private partnerships.Governments have attempted to counter high price tags with both financial and nonfinancial incentives. In 2017, the Colombian government eliminated import tariffs for up to 1,500 E.V.s per year through 2019. By 2023, the annual quota will increase to 3,000. In July, Colombia\u2019s stock of E.V.s surpassed 1000 units \u2014 in 2012, just 33 were sold.Local and national governments should also incorporate electric mobility into long-term energy and transportation planning. Electric mobility strategies can provide clarity to markets and direction for public policy. Building on the region\u2019s first law to incentivize E.V.s in Costa Rica, which entered into force in January, President Carlos Alvarado has announced that by 2021 his administration will launch a plan to establish a fossil fuel-free transportation system.Finally, partnerships involving city governments and private utilities, automakers, bus companies and local businesses have also accelerated the adoption of E.V.s across Latin America and should serve as models. Last year, Mexico had some 1,500 publicly accessible chargers, most of which were installed by Tesla through deals with shopping centers and hotels. Low-interest loans from multilateral development banks are also enabling cities to make the large upfront payments for electric buses.E.V.s alone are not a silver bullet. Addressing urban transportation challenges requires a multifaceted approach that should include improvements to public transportation, stricter fuel efficiency and fuel quality standards for all vehicles, and the expansion of nonmotorized transport including walking and biking. But as the only zero-emissions vehicles, E.V.s will play a vital role in meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.After decades in which the world\u2019s transportation system has scarcely changed, urban mobility appears on the cusp of rapid transformation. As the world embraces this transition, Latin America is also getting on board.Lisa Viscidi is director of the Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries Program at the Inter-American Dialogue.

All of you are running wild in the offices, sighing loudly and cutting fingernails and getting naked together. Trying to make sense of it all with personality tests (that are probably going to be used to build a consumer profile that tracks us from cradle to prison to the grave) is both gross and a waste of money. But as long as we keep sleeping with inappropriate people in the office, I can see why companies grasp at these sad straws. Just lie! Everyone else does.I keep doing big sighs that are causing people to think I\u2019m having a meltdown. How do I stop?Charisma is all in the unintended details: where you think your pants should be belted, how you snuffle constantly, how you chew gum at your desk with your mouth open, how you make eye contact, how you scream-sneeze and also your awful aggressive sighing. Like almost all of us who aren\u2019t robots, I do many nasty off-putting things in the office. I stare into space when I\u2019m thinking and people imagine I\u2019m looking at some monster coming up behind them. Also, I swear quietly to myself as I type. But loud office-sighers are especially unattractive co-workers because they vent emotions into the office, and those of us who are hypersensitive feel compelled to ask what\u2019s wrong, or we worry that the annual holiday layoffs are imminent. (They are!) You must replace this habit with drinking water or snapping a rubber band on your wrist or perhaps expectorating into a nearby spittoon. The level of fake office-based civility (actually, docility) that your workplace has inculcated is next level! Men going around willy-nilly doing gnarly home grooming tasks? It\u2019s notable that you see speaking to your manager as the only choice here. Anywhere normal, people would bring this up to a colleague. Email is fine: \u201cHey, Jeff, please do not trim your nails in the office.\u201dI had a secret relationship with a guy twice my age, and on top of that, he is a manager at my company. We dated for about two months, and everything seemed to be going great until one day he called it off because of the age difference, etc., and offered to be friends. We haven\u2019t spoken since, and there is tension at the workplace (at least I can feel it). We don\u2019t even look at each other. Should I get a new job, or try to deal with the awkwardness?I don\u2019t work in an office. I am a blue-collar schmo. However, often in my work I serve many people who work in offices, on floors, in big buildings. I hear them talk about their \u201cwork group\u201d before raving about their new \u201cTesla\u201d or some other nonsense I have no comprehension of.

How do I deal with dozens and dozens of rich, vapid and condescending office workers daily? Good Lord, PLEASE, how?We fully tend to over-serve the \u201cglued-to-the-email-machine\u201d work force, though I\u2019ve been heartened that we get letters from diverse workplace types. But yes: Office workers are incredibly hierarchy conscious and hierarchy anxious and are frequently dreadful to people who are different. (I write this column on a commuter train, and just now watched a middle-aged white woman get on and stand over an elementary school-age black boy until he gave up his seat \u2014 even though there were scads of empty seats all around us. Unreal.) People enact aggression and discomfort and hostility and bias constantly.The other problem here is just how captured and enraptured we become by being what we spend. Polo shirts, cars, houses, children, purebred dogs, washing machines, golf clubs, boats. These are things we buy as a shortcut to an identity. Then we bond about it, standing divided against richer and poorer. We have to pretend that everything is fine.Someone should confront the rich, vapid and condescending every day as they ignore the homeless people all around them. Put up signs about where they can give away their money! Or do what I do and aggressively harangue people about remembering you in their will. (Everyone thinks I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m not.)

{"Headline": "James Dyson: \u2018The Public Wants to Buy Strange Things\u2019 ", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "corner officeHe made billions selling vacuums. Now he is backing Brexit, building an electric car \u2014\u00a0and making antiquated comments on \u2018racial differences.\u2019Supported byJames Dyson is unapologetically British.The product of the English boarding school system, Mr. Dyson found his calling as an industrial designer and built one of the most successful private companies in the United Kingdom by selling his distinctive vacuums. He was knighted in 2007, served as the provost of the Royal College of Art in London and is one of the country\u2019s richest men. Yet in a globalized economy, Mr. Dyson remains intently focused on what he believes is Britain\u2019s exceptional place in the world. He wistfully refers to the British Empire, and unlike most in the business community, is in favor of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, believing Brexit will make the country stronger economically and culturally.In this interview, Mr. Dyson expressed antiquated and at times offensive views on \u201cracial differences\u201d and Japanese culture. He also referred to growth markets in Asia as the \u201cFar East.\u201d When asked to clarify his remarks, Mr. Dyson declined to comment further. (Read a portion of his comments on Japan below.)Mr. Dyson discovered his passion for design at an early age, and eventually began work on his signature product, the bagless vacuum cleaner. It took several years, but he brought the product to market, founding Dyson Ltd. in 1991. Soon, Dyson was expanding internationally and developing new products, including washing machines, fans, heaters, air purifiers, hand dryers and hair dryers. It is now at work on an electric car.This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in New York. What was your childhood like? My father died when I was quite young. He was a teacher at a boarding school, but he didn\u2019t have life insurance, so the school allowed my brother and I to continue there. Boarding is pretty harsh stuff. You\u2019re sent away for 14 weeks, and your parents could visit you one Saturday a term, and that was it. \u201cFeelings\u201d is a word I didn\u2019t know until I was about 50.How did you get interested in design? I did art at boarding school, which I really enjoyed. So I decided to go to art school in London. That\u2019s where I discovered design and thought, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to be doing. I want to be designing and creating things.\u201d I started off with architecture, and then I discovered Buckminster Fuller, the great American inventor, entrepreneur. And suddenly, the thing that was interesting me the most was the thing I always thought was incredibly boring, which is engineering.What was your first job? When I was in college, I went to this industrialist at an engineering company. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you some design jobs.\u201d He had this idea for this high-speed landing craft for the military and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you design that?\u201d I knew nothing about boats, though I didn\u2019t dare say it, but it sounded fun. So we built a prototype, and then the chairman of the company said, \u201cWell you better start selling it.\u201dI looked at him slightly blankly and said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t I have to do some market research?\u201d And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother. It\u2019s a good product. Anyway, you\u2019re the engineer, you know every nut and bolt of the thing.\u201d And you sold them? I didn\u2019t look like a business man or anything. I had flowing trousers, long hair, flowered shirts. But I set up the company and manufacturing, and I sold them for five years. We sold them to militaries all over the world, to oil companies, construction companies, smugglers bringing American cigarettes into Italy.Smugglers? He came in a leather jacket and paid cash. I asked him what he was going to do, and I didn\u2019t think smuggling cigarettes was particularly naughty. The point is, here\u2019s this longhaired art student in the mid-\u201960s, getting asked to design something he knew nothing about. Then he\u2019s told to set up a company, which he knew nothing about. That\u2019s what I do today with my people. I try to recruit everybody as a graduate, because they have no baggage, they have enthusiasm and curiosity. I think experience can be fine in certain situations and with certain companies. But when you\u2019re doing something very different, it\u2019s often best done by people who have done nothing before.How did you come up with the idea for the vacuum?I decided to pick a modest product and do a completely different version and see what happened. But the retailers weren\u2019t interested, because they said it was too different and they said they didn\u2019t have space for a different thing made by a nobody. So I decided to advertise in newspapers. And what I learned is that the public wants to buy strange things, as long as there\u2019s purpose to them. As long as they can see what\u2019s new and different about it, they\u2019ll buy them. And what was so different about your vacuums? I saw the problem, and I saw a possible solution, which was the huge cyclones outside cement plants and timber yards that collect dust all day long. So I started building various versions of that technology. As it happens, it didn\u2019t work. I had to spend four or five years coming up with different types of cyclonic separation devices in order to make it work.It took a lot of empirical work. I had to build the prototypes, one or two a day, which sounds tedious, but actually it was fascinating. I\u2019m still doing it today. It always is a wonderful adventure of excitement and disappointment. Almost everything you do is a failure, until you get the one success that works.How did you pay for all that research and development before you had a product to sell? I was borrowing it all from the bank. Going deeper and deeper into debt. By the time I launched the vacuum cleaner, I was two million pounds in debt. I think the bank got in a bit deeper than they intended to, but I had an interesting bank manager. I asked him why he lent me the money, and he said, \u201cI went home to my wife and said, \u2018What do you think about vacuum bags and vacuum cleaners?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Dreadful, dreadful.\u2019\u201dOnce you gained traction in the U.K., how did you expand into the United States? A junior buyer at Best Buy took our vacuum cleaner home and used it for three weeks and came back to her boss and said, \u201cThis actually is a really good vacuum. It doesn\u2019t make a mess.\u201d And he said, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s give it a go in 50 shops.\u201d It sold well, and then everybody else wanted it. It was just one brave junior buyer, convincing her manager.When we met earlier in the year, you told me something about Japan.Whenever we went there, we thought you had to learn to behave like a Japanese person, you know, bowing. What I quickly learned is that\u2019s not what they wanted from us at all. They wanted our eccentricity and difference. So, I carried on being an Englishman.What are you working on now? I\u2019ve been working on an electric car. We bought an old World War II airfield, so we\u2019ve got a place to do it. Tesla proved that people want electric cars, though I don\u2019t think governments have realized it yet. People are trying to ignore pollution and the damage that pollution does. Apart from that, the electric car is a much nicer and easier car to own. You don\u2019t have to go to gas stations, which aren\u2019t very nice.I don\u2019t really look at markets at all. Otherwise, I would have never gone into hand drying. When we have technology we feel could do something interesting, we go into that field. It\u2019s entirely technology- and product-led. It\u2019s not led by market size. Hand dryers are not a sexy business, but we had the technology which did it better, and it happens to be a perfectly reasonable business. It\u2019s not like computers or mobile phones, but we wanted to do it and we enjoyed it. We still enjoy it. I choose unpopular fields to go into, because they\u2019re more interesting. I want to play the bassoon, please. Playing the guitar is much more sexy, but the bassoon is more interesting.I think we should be independent. Europe has become more and more of a unified society where all the laws are made in Brussels. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ever been right for Britain.Britain has always been a globally facing country, with our empire, if I dare mention that, covering half the globe. We have a pioneering and global outlook. There\u2019s no room for us in Europe.All cars coming into England from America have a 10 percent duty on them, and most of that goes to Brussels. Europe is a protectionist setup designed to keep competitors out. It\u2019s not a good thing to be in. We believe in free trade. And if any bankers are leaving London, it\u2019s got nothing to do with Brexit. It was the right decision for Britain.An earlier version of this article said incorrectly that Mr. Dyson referred to China as the \"Far East.\" He used the term to refer to Asia more broadly. Also, a question preceding an exchange on Japan has been expanded to give more context to Mr. Dyson's response.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Intermission for the Large Hadron Collider", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "MEYRIN, Switzerland \u2014 There is silence on the subatomic firing range.A quarter-century ago, the physicists of CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, bet their careers and their political capital on the biggest and most expensive science experiment ever built, the Large Hadron Collider.The collider is a kind of microscope that works by flinging subatomic particles around a 17-mile electromagnetic racetrack beneath the French-Swiss countryside, smashing them together 600 million times a second and sifting through the debris for new particles and forces of nature. The instrument is also a time machine, providing a glimpse of the physics that prevailed in the early moments of the universe and laid the foundation for the cosmos as we see it today.The collider will continue smashing particles and expectations for another 20 years. But first, an intermission. On December 3rd, the particle beams stopped humming. The giant magnets that guide the whizzing protons sighed and released their grip. The underground detectors that ring the tunnel stood down from their watch.Over the next two years, during the first of what will be a series of shutdowns, engineers will upgrade the collider to make its beams more intense and its instruments more sensitive and discerning. And theoretical physicists will pause to make sense of the tantalizing, bewildering mysteries that the Large Hadron Collider has generated so far.The collider gets its mojo from Einstein\u2019s dictum that mass and energy are the same. The more energy that the collider can produce, the more massive are the particles created by the collisions. With every increase in the energy of their collider, CERN physicists are able to edge farther and farther back in time, closer to the physics of the Big Bang, when the universe was much hotter than today.Inside CERN\u2019s subterranean ring, some 10,000 superconducting electromagnets, powered by a small city\u2019s worth of electricity, guide two beams of protons in opposite directions around the tunnel at 99.99999 percent of the speed of light, or an energy of 7 trillion electron volts. Those protons make the 17-mile circuit 11,000 times a second. (In physics, mass and energy are both expressed in terms of units called electron volts. A single proton, the building block of ordinary atoms, weighs about a billion electron volts.)The protons enter the collider as atoms in a puff of hydrogen gas squirted from a bottle. As the atoms travel, electrical fields strip them of electrons, leaving bare, positively charged protons. These are sped up by a series of increasingly larger and more energetic electromagnets, until they are ready to enter the main ring of the collider.When protons finally enter the main ring, they have been boosted into flying bombs of primordial energy, primed to smash apart \u2014 and recombine \u2014 when they strike their opposite numbers head-on, coming from the other direction.The protons circulate inside vacuum pipes \u2013 one running clockwise, the other counterclockwise \u2013 and these are surrounded by superconducting electromagnets strung together around the tunnel like sausages. To generate enough force to bend the speeding protons, the magnets must be uncommonly strong: 8.3 Tesla, or more than a hundred thousand times stronger than Earth\u2019s magnetic field \u2014 and more than strong enough to wreck a fancy Swiss watch.Such a field in turn requires an electrical current of 12,000 amperes. That\u2019s only feasible if the magnets are superconducting, meaning that electricity flows without expensive resistance. For that to happen, the magnets must be supercold;  they are bathed in 150 tons of superfluid helium at a temperature of 1.9 Kelvin, making the Large Hadron Collider literally one of the coldest places in the universe.If things go wrong down here, they can go very wrong. In 2008, as the collider was still being tuned up, the link between a pair of magnets exploded, delaying operations for almost two years.The energy stored in the magnetic fields is equivalent to a fully loaded jumbo jet going 500 miles per hour; if a magnet loses its cool and heats up, all that energy must go someplace. And the proton beam itself can cut through many feet of steel.The beams cross at four points around the racetrack.At each juncture, gigantic detectors \u2014 underground mountains of electronics, cables, computers, pipes, magnets and even more magnets \u2014 have been erected. The two biggest and most expensive experiments, CMS (the Compact Muon Solenoid) and Atlas (A Toroidal L.H.C. Apparatus) sit, respectively, at the noon and 6 o\u2019clock positions of the circular track.Wrapped around them, like the layers of an onion, are instruments designed to measure every last spark of energy or matter that might spew from the collision. Silicon detectors track the paths of lightweight, charged particles such as electrons. Scintillation crystals capture the energies of gamma rays. Chambers of electrified gas track more far-flung particles. And powerful magnets bend the paths of these particles so that their charges and masses can be determined.The proton beams cross 40 million times per second in each of the four detectors, resulting in about a billion actual collisions every second.Why is there something instead of nothing in the universe?Answering that question is the mission of the detector known as LHCb, which sits at about 4 o\u2019clock on the collider dial. The \u201cb\u201d stands for beauty \u2014 and for the B meson, a subatomic particle that is crucial to the experiment.When matter is created \u2014 in a collider, in the Big Bang \u2014 equal amounts of matter and its opposite, antimatter, should be formed, according to the laws of physics As We Know Them. When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other, producing energy.By that logic, when matter and antimatter formed in the Big Bang, they should have cancelled out each other, leaving behind an empty universe. But it\u2019s not empty: We are here, and our antimatter is not.Why not? Physicists suspect that some subtle imbalance between matter and antimatter is responsible. The LHCb experiment looks for that imbalance in the behavior of B mesons, which are often sprayed from the proton collisions.B mesons have an exotic property: They flicker back and forth between being matter and antimatter. Sensors record their passage through the LHCb room, seeking differences between the particles and their antimatter twins. Any discrepancy between the two could be a clue to why matter flourished billions of years ago and antimatter perished.At about 8 o\u2019clock on the collider dial is Alice, another detector with a special purpose. It, too, is fixed on the distant past: the brief moment a couple of microseconds after the Big Bang, before the first protons and neutrons congealed out of a \u201cprimordial soup\u201d of quarks and gluons.Alice\u2019s job is to study tiny droplets of that distant past that are created when the collider bangs together lead ions instead of protons. Researchers expected this material, known in the lingo as a quark-gluon plasma, to behave like a gas, but it turns out to behave more like a liquid.The collider\u2019s enormous detectors are like 100 megapixel cameras that take 40 million pictures a second. Most of the data from that deluge is immediately thrown away. Triggers, programmed to pick out events that physicists thought might be interesting, save only about a thousand collision events per second. Even still, an enormous pool of data winds up in the CERN computer banks.According to the casino rules of modern quantum physics, anything that can happen will happen eventually. Before a single proton is fired through the collider, computers have calculated all the possible outcomes of a collision according to known physics. Any unexpected bump in the real data at some energy could be a signal of unknown physics, a new particle.That was how the Higgs was discovered, emerging from the statistical noise in the autumn of 2011. Only one of every 10 billion collisions creates a Higgs boson. The Higgs vanishes instantly and can\u2019t be observed directly, but it decays into fragments that can be measured and identified.What eventually stood out from the data was evidence for a particle that weighs all by itself as much as an iodine atom: a flake of an invisible force field that permeates space like molasses, impeding motion and assigning mass to objects that pass through it.And so in 2012, after half a century and billions of dollars, thousands of physicists toasted over champagne. Peter Higgs, for whom the elusive boson was named, shared the Nobel prize with Fran\u00e7ois Englert, who had independently predicted the particle\u2019s existence.The current shutdown is the first of a pair of billion-dollar upgrades intended to boost the productivity of the Large Hadron Collider tenfold by the end of the decade.The first shutdown will last for two years, until 2021; during that time, engineers will improve the series of smaller racetracks that speed up protons and inject them into the main collider. The collider then will run for two years and shut down again, in 2024, for two more years, so that engineers can install new magnets to intensify the proton beams and collisions.Reincarnated in 2026 as the High Luminosity L.H.C., the collider is scheduled to run for another decade, until 2035 or so, which means its career probing the edge of human knowledge is still beginning. Judging by the collider\u2019s productivity, measured in terms of trillions of subatomic smashups, more than 95 percent of its scientific potential lies ahead.Both the Atlas and CMS experiments will receive major upgrades during the next two shutdowns, including new silicon trackers, to replace the olds ones burned out by radiation.To keep up with the increased collision rate, both Atlas and CMS have had to upgrade the finicky trigger systems that decide which collision events to keep and study. Currently, of a billion events per second, they can keep 1,500; the upgrade will raise that figure to 10,000.And what a flow of collisions it will be. Physicists measure the productivity, or luminosity, of their colliders in terms of collisions. It took about 3,000 trillion collisions to confirm the Higgs boson. As of the December shutdown the collider had logged about 20,000 trillion collisions. But those were, and are, early days.By 2037, the Large Hadron Collider should have produced roughly 4 million trillion primordial fireballs, bristling with who knows what. The whole universe is still up for grabs.Discovering the Higgs was an auspicious start. But the champagne came with a mystery.Over the last century, physicists have learned to explain some of the grandest and subtlest phenomena in nature \u2014 the arc of a rainbow, the scent of a gardenia, the twitch of a cat\u2019s whiskers \u2014 as a handful of elementary particles interacting through four basic forces, playing a game of catch with force-carrying particles called bosons according to a set of equations called the Standard Model.But why these particles and these forces? Why is the universe made of matter but not antimatter? What happens at the center of a black hole, or happened at the first instant of the Big Bang? If the Higgs boson determines the masses of particles, what determines the mass of the Higgs?Who, in other words, watches the watchman?The Standard Model, for all its brilliance and elegance, does not say. Particles that might answer these questions have not shown up yet in the collider. Fabiola Gianotti, the director-general of CERN, expressed surprise. \u201cI would have expected new physics to manifest itself at the energy scale of the Large Hadron Collider,\u201d she said.Some physicists have responded by speculating about multiple universes and other exotic phenomena. Some clues, Dr. Gianotti said, might come from studying the new particle on the block, the Higgs.\u201cWe physicists are happy when we understand things, but we are even happier when we don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd today we know that we don\u2019t understand everything. We know that we are missing something important and fundamental. And this is very exciting.\u201dHumans soon must decide which machines, if any, will be built to augment or replace the Large Hadron Collider. That collider had a \u201ckiller app\u201d of sorts: it was designed to achieve an energy at which, according to the prediction of the Standard Model, the Higgs or something like it would become evident and provide an explanation for particle masses.But the Standard Model doesn\u2019t predict a new keystone particle in the next higher energy range. Luckily, nobody believes the Standard Model is the last word about the universe, but as the machines increase in energy, particle physicists will be shooting in the dark.For a long time, the leading candidate for Next Big Physics Machine has been the International Linear Collider, which would fire electrons and their antimatter opposites, positrons, at each other. The collisions would produce showers of Higgs bosons. The experiment would be built in Japan, if it is built at all, but Japan has yet to commit to hosting the project, which would require them to pay for about half of the $5.5 billion cost.In the meantime, Europe has convened meetings and workshops to decide on a plan for the future of particle physics there. \u201cIf there is no word from Japan by the end of the year, then the I.L.C. will not figure in the next five-year plan for Europe,\u201d Lyn Evans, a CERN physicist who was in charge of building the Large Hadron Collider, said in an email.CERN has proposed its own version of a linear collider, the Compact Linear Collider, that could be scaled up gradually from Higgs bosons to higher energies. Also being considered is a humongous collider, 100 kilometers around, that would lie under Lake Geneva and would reach energies of 100 trillion electron volts \u2014 seven times the power of the Large Hadron Collider.And in November the Chinese Academy of Sciences released the design for a next-generation collider of similar size, called the Circular Electron Positron Collider. The machine could be the precursor for a still more powerful machine that has been dubbed the Great Collider. Politics and economics, as well as physics, will decide which, if any, of these machines will see a shovel.\u201cIf we want a new machine, nothing is possible before 2035,\u201d Frederick Bordry, CERN\u2019s director of accelerators, said of European plans. Building such a machine is a true human adventure, he said: \u201cTwenty-five years to build and another 25 to operate.\u201dNoting that he himself is 64, he added, \u201cI\u2019m working for the young people.\u201dWritten by Dennis Overbye.360\u00b0 photographs by Evan Grothjan.Produced by Jonathan Corum, Evan Grothjan, Jon Huang, Yuliya Parshina-Kottas and Karthik Patanjali.

That\u2019s down from 8 percent in 2010, and the lowest level since 1980.Arend Kapteyn, UBS chief economist, said that greater labor market flexibility since the financial crisis \u2014 due to factors such as lower wages and the advent of the gig economy \u2014 had helped lower the natural rate of unemployment in many countries.The change has been particularly pronounced in Eastern Europe: Polish unemployment has fallen to 6.2 percent from 20 percent in 2002, for instance, and Croatia and Slovakia have similar stories. But unemployment has dropped in many of the largest economies too, including the U.S., Britain, Germany and Japan.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!
