{"Headline": "Wall St. Rises in Day of Unsteady Trading as Global Markets Drop", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street fought its way back from early losses on Monday, as another volatile day of trading highlighted investors\u2019 unease about the global economy and corporate profits.After slipping by nearly 2 percent in the morning, the S&P 500 finished the day 0.2 percent higher. Markets in Europe and Asia, however, ended Monday in the red.Among other technology stocks, Microsoft shares climbed 2.6 percent and Facebook rose more than 3 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 0.7 percent.Worries about global economic growth, trade and the strength of corporate America have been battering stocks. While that\u2019s cause for concern, it is important to put slides like this in context.Volatility has tormented stock investors in recent days, as they assess the impact of a trade war that is grinding on and has the potential to slow the global economy. Market watchers cautioned against reading too much into the upturn on Monday.\u201cThe tendency is to look at days like today as a major trend shift,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm. \u201cUsually, going forward, they don\u2019t really add up or amount to much.\u201dOne trigger for the early decline on Monday was the news that Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, facing a certain defeat in Parliament, would seek to delay the vote on a deal for her nation\u2019s exit from the European Union. British lawmakers had been expected to vote on the plan on Tuesday.In London, the FTSE 100 dropped about 0.8 percent. The pound also fell against the dollar, hitting its lowest level since April 2017.Economic data released on Monday also provided investors with more evidence of a slowdown among export-based economies. Figures from Japan showed that the country\u2019s economy shrank more in the third quarter than initially reported, and data from China revealed a sharp slowdown in trade last month.Energy producers, meanwhile, tumbled along with crude oil prices. Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.4 percent. Financial stocks also fared poorly.In a sign that investors were less worried about the situation, semiconductor companies, which rely on supply chains in Asia and have become a barometer of investor sentiment about United States-China relations, rose on Monday. Advanced Micro Devices, for example, rose 2.7 percent.But China is just one of several worries investors are fixated on. Others are rising interest rates and already sluggish sectors of the American economy, like housing and autos.\u201cInvestors are focused on a lot of these walls of worry that are out there,\u201d said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis. \u201cUntil we get some clarity on some of those, the market\u2019s going to continue to struggle.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress May Have Fallen for Facebook\u2019s Trap, but You Don\u2019t Have To", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has always sold data to advertisers, and it probably always will. Mr. Kosinski is an assistant professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.As a data scientist, I am shocked that anyone continues to believe this claim. Each time you click on a Facebook ad, Facebook sells data on you to that advertiser. This is such a basic property of online targeted advertising that it would be impossible to avoid, even if Facebook somehow wanted to.Or even better, let Mr. Zuckerberg explain, as he did to the Senate in April: \u201cWhat we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach, and then we do the placement. So, if an advertiser comes to us and says, \u2018All right, I am a ski shop and I want to sell skis to women\u2019 \u2026 we can show the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.\u201d Let\u2019s take a closer look at Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ski shop example. The ski shop pays Facebook to show a targeted ad to women and sends the women to the ski shop\u2019s website if the women click on the ad. Mr. Zuckerberg describes this process as showing \u201cthe ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser.\u201d But this isn\u2019t true: If a ski shop pays Facebook to show an ad only to women, then Facebook automatically reveals to the ski shop that all people who clicked on the link must be women. And in practice, the advertisers make requests that are much more nuanced. They may ask Facebook to show their ad to \u201cliberal Latina women without college education who live in San Antonio and recently got married.\u201d And then they might place a separate ad that is shown only to \u201cconservative African-American women with college educations who live in Austin and are single.\u201d When you click on an ad and are sent to an advertiser\u2019s website, the advertiser knows which ad you saw and thus which bucket you fall in.Facebook has a lot of data on their users and is eager to monetize it. The advertisers are encouraged to selectively target people according to a mind-boggling range of personal characteristics. Some, such as age, gender or location, are not overly intimate. Others, such as your political views, family size, education, occupation, marital status or interest in a gay dating app, are highly personal. But Facebook is extremely clever at dodging this issue. When the company argues that it is not selling data, but rather selling targeted advertising, it\u2019s luring you into a semantic trap, encouraging you to imagine that the only way of selling data is to send advertisers a file filled with user information. Congress may have fallen for this trap set up by Mr. Zuckerberg, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. The fact that your data is not disclosed in an Excel spreadsheet but through a click on a targeted ad is irrelevant. Data still changes hands and goes to the advertiser. Facebook's claiming that it is not selling user data is like a bar\u2019s giving away a free martini with every $12 bag of peanuts and then claiming that it\u2019s not selling drinks. Rich user data is Facebook\u2019s most prized possession, and the company sure isn\u2019t throwing it in for free.Importantly, this problem is not limited to Facebook. Other Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon, have similar ad platforms. If a platform can be used to target specific users, then it reveals those users\u2019 data. The advertiser could easily create its own data file based on this information, or merge the information with any other data it has on a customer.To address this problem, we need to offer users both transparency and control. Before being directed to an advertiser\u2019s site, users should be told which of their traits were used in targeting them. They should also be warned that, if they continue, these traits will be revealed to the advertiser.Facebook cannot be trusted to fix this problem itself. Would you trust Big Tobacco\u2019s claims about lung cancer? What about Big Sugar\u2019s claims about obesity? Then why would you believe what Big Tech has to say about data privacy? Markets, including the market for consumer data, do not work efficiently when a company like Facebook is allowed to abuse its market position to ignore its users\u2019 rights, needs and wishes. Policymakers have no choice but to step in, restore the balance of power and protect citizens\u2019 privacy.Michal Kosinski is an assistant professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.

{"Headline": "A.I. as Talent Scout: Unorthodox Hires, and Maybe Lower Pay", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that piqued his interest.It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 featured the term \u201cdata science\u201d nowhere.Instead, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold\u2019s software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model.The idea is not to focus on job titles, but \u201cwhat skills they have,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou\u2019re really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it.\u201dThe power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market \u2014 not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract.Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers \u2014 even for hard-to-fill roles \u2014 whom they might not otherwise have come across.And while that could also help some candidates, there\u2019s a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring.\u201cYou get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,\u201d Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have to compete for them as much.\u201dFor years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions.While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates.But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don\u2019t explicitly appear on a candidate\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9.To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn\u2019t list the skill on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.By performing a similar exercise across an entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the company\u2019s software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales).Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn.Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance \u2014 say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft.Intuit did not respond to a request for comment.The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner.\u201cThe tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,\u201d Ms. Villanueva said. \u201cWe keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit.\u201dIn the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold\u2019s software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master\u2019s degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in data science.\u201cWe have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou can predict what they\u2019re likely to do next very easily.\u201d He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data.Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster.Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence.\u201cWe surface people we think would be good draft picks,\u201d rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. \u201cThis person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you.\u201dMr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates.In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly.Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master\u2019s degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages.\u201cThat could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don\u2019t need anything special here,\u201d Mr. Horton said.Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point \u2014 call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren\u2019t compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism.If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height.The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players \u2014 the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs \u2014 not the general population.Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee.But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting.Google says it uses machines to take a second look at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles.The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can\u2019t claim. \u201cWe now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,\u201d he said.Cade Metz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Oak View Group and Swift\u2019s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.Only a couple of states have laws restricting the use of facial recognition, and California is not among them.

Here was the untimely death of a relatively private background figure that came to be noted in a vastly public way.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018The recording of deaths is not a popularity contest, of course. We who report that most basic piece of news, a death, do so without much concern for ratings (though we\u2019re pleased when what we publish finds readers).

It goes something like this: \u201cWe understand that we\u2019ve made mistakes. But don\u2019t you realize that if you damage us, you\u2019ll just be handing over the future to China? Unlike America, China is standing behind its tech firms, because it knows that the competition is global, and it wants to win.\u201dBut to accept this argument would be a mistake, for it betrays and ignores hard-won lessons about the folly of an industrial policy centered on \u201cnational champions,\u201d especially in the tech sector. What Facebook is really asking for is to be embraced and protected as America\u2019s very own social media monopolist, bravely doing battle overseas. But both history and basic economics suggest we do much better trusting that fierce competition at home yields stronger industries overall.That\u2019s the lesson from the history of Japanese-American tech competition. During the 1970s and into the \u201980s, it was widely believed that Japan was threatening the United States for supremacy in technology markets. The Japanese giant NEC was a serious challenger to IBM in the mainframe market; Sony was running over consumer electronics, joined by powerful firms like Panasonic and Toshiba. These companies enjoyed the support of the Japanese state, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which pursued a nationalistic industrial policy thought to be infallible.That\u2019s the risk of a governmental embrace of companies like Facebook, Apple and Google. While they may now seem as extraordinary as IBM did in the 1970s, they might not seem that way a decade from now. And if no one can imagine doing social networking better than Facebook, remember that no one dreamed that the personal computer, once little more than a toy for hobbyists, would displace the mighty mainframe.If we give these companies a pass when it comes to antitrust enforcement, allowing them to dominate their markets and buy up their competitors, America may lose what has been its signature advantage: its willingness to allow the new to replace the old, to accept rebellion and change \u2014 the industrial version of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s cycle of rebellion and the \u201cblood of patriots.\u201dAnd then, as Zuckerberg has prophesied, the future of tech may very well belong to China after all.Advertisement"}

Here is your book, the one your thousands of letters have asked us to publish. It has taken us years to do, checking and rechecking countless recipes to bring you only the best, only the interesting, only the perfect.Now 80, Dr. Knuth usually dresses like the youthful geek he was when he embarked on this odyssey: long-sleeved T-shirt under a short-sleeved T-shirt, with jeans, at least at this time of year. In those early days, he worked close to the machine, writing \u201cin the raw,\u201d tinkering with the zeros and ones. \u201cKnuth made it clear that the system could actually be understood all the way down to the machine code level,\u201d said Dr. Norvig. Nowadays, of course, with algorithms masterminding (and undermining) our very existence, the average programmer no longer has time to manipulate the binary muck, and works instead with hierarchies of abstraction, layers upon layers of code \u2014 and often with chains of code borrowed from code libraries. But an elite class of engineers occasionally still does the deep dive.\u201cHere at Google, sometimes we just throw stuff together,\u201d Dr. Norvig said, during a meeting of the Google Trips team, in Mountain View, Calif. \u201cBut other times, if you\u2019re serving billions of users, it\u2019s important to do that efficiently. A 10-per-cent improvement in efficiency can work out to billions of dollars, and in order to get that last level of efficiency, you have to understand what\u2019s going on all the way down.\u201d Or, as Andrei Broder, a distinguished scientist at Google and one of Dr. Knuth\u2019s former graduate students, explained during the meeting: \u201cWe want to have some theoretical basis for what we\u2019re doing. We don\u2019t want a frivolous or sloppy or second-rate algorithm. We don\u2019t want some other algorithmist to say, \u2018You guys are morons.\u2019\u201d Dr. Knuth\u2019s exacting standards, literary and otherwise, may explain why his life\u2019s work is nowhere near done. He has a wager with Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google and a former student (to use the term loosely), over whether Mr. Brin will finish his Ph.D. before Dr. Knuth concludes his opus.During summer vacations, Dr. Knuth made more money than professors earned in a year by writing compilers. A compiler is like a translator, converting a high-level programming language (resembling algebra) to a lower-level one (sometimes arcane binary) and, ideally, improving it in the process. In computer science, \u201coptimization\u201d is truly an art, and this is articulated in another Knuthian proverb: \u201cPremature optimization is the root of all evil.\u201dEventually Dr. Knuth became a compiler himself, inadvertently founding a new field that he came to call the \u201canalysis of algorithms.\u201d A publisher hired him to write a book about compilers, but it evolved into a book collecting everything he knew about how to write for computers \u2014 a book about algorithms. When Dr. Knuth started out, he intended to write a single work. Soon after, computer science underwent its Big Bang, so he reimagined and recast the project in seven volumes. Now he metes out sub-volumes, called fascicles. The next installation, \u201cVolume 4, Fascicle 5,\u201d covering, among other things, \u201cbacktracking\u201d and \u201cdancing links,\u201d was meant to be published in time for Christmas. It is delayed until next April because he keeps finding more and more irresistible problems that he wants to present.In order to optimize his chances of getting to the end, Dr. Knuth has long guarded his time. He retired at 55, restricted his public engagements and quit email (officially, at least). Andrei Broder recalled that time management was his professor\u2019s defining characteristic even in the early 1980s. This decade-long detour took place back in the age when computers were shared among users and ran faster at night while most humans slept. So Dr. Knuth switched day into night, shifted his schedule by 12 hours and mapped his student appointments to Fridays from 8 p.m. to midnight. Dr. Broder recalled, \u201cWhen I told my girlfriend that we can\u2019t do anything Friday night because Friday night at 10 I have to meet with my adviser, she thought, \u2018This is something that is so stupid it must be true.\u2019\u201dWhen Knuth chooses to be physically present, however, he is 100-per-cent there in the moment. \u201cIt just makes you happy to be around him,\u201d said Jennifer Chayes, a managing director of Microsoft Research. \u201cHe\u2019s a maximum in the community. If you had an optimization function that was in some way a combination of warmth and depth, Don would be it.\u201dOf course, all the algorithmic rigmarole is also causing real-world problems. Algorithms written by humans \u2014 tackling harder and harder problems, but producing code embedded with bugs and biases \u2014 are troubling enough. More worrisome, perhaps, are the algorithms that are not written by humans, algorithms written by the machine, as it learns. All the more so if you\u2019re an algorithm versed in Knuth. \u201cToday, programmers use stuff that Knuth, and others, have done as components of their algorithms, and then they combine that together with all the other stuff they need,\u201d said Google\u2019s Dr. Norvig. \u201cWith A.I., we have the same thing. It\u2019s just that the combining-together part will be done automatically, based on the data, rather than based on a programmer\u2019s work. You want A.I. to be able to combine components to get a good answer based on the data. But you have to decide what those components are. It could happen that each component is a page or chapter out of Knuth, because that\u2019s the best possible way to do some task.\u201dLucky, then, Dr. Knuth keeps at it. He figures it will take another 25 years to finish \u201cThe Art of Computer Programming,\u201d although that time frame has been a constant since about 1980. Might the algorithm-writing algorithms get their own chapter, or maybe a page in the epilogue? \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d said Dr. Knuth.\u201cI am worried that algorithms are getting too prominent in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cIt started out that computer scientists were worried nobody was listening to us. Now I\u2019m worried that too many people are listening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistI have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime \u2014 and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent \u2014 he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus \u2014 but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the \u201cNext America\u2019\u2019?\u201cYou know William Gibson\u2019s line, \u2018The future is already here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed\u2019? Well, the future is here, and now it\u2019s starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,\u2019\u2019 Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of \u201cIndispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,\u2019\u2019 remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. \u201cThe basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.\u2019\u2019This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass.Where do I start? A good place is with 5G \u2014 fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around \u2026 2020.Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 like deploying self-driving vehicles \u2014 requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor.As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, \u201cThink of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.\u2019\u2019It could be as revolutionary as the internet. But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides.An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently \u201cabout 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.\u2019\u2019But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be \u201ccontinuous lifelong learning\u2019\u2019 \u2014 because when the pace of change is accelerating, \u201cthe fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition.\u201dThat means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 we will need new national trampolines.We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time.Tennessee has already done that.These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services?\u201cBut that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for \u2018free\u2019 in exchange for personal data,\u201d Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. \u201cThis has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.\u2019\u2019Just one person \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain \u2014 and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros \u2014 should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look.Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump\u2019s tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We\u2019ve had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we\u2019ve never run one so huge during a boom.That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare \u2014 just when all the baby boomers are retiring.In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more \u2014 from climate change to zoning rules \u2014 and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won\u2019t let us do that again. The Next America won\u2019t wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Ways Facebook Shared Your Data", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Facebook gave many large technology companies special access to users\u2019 information. Here\u2019s how it worked.Yahoo said people who opted in to its new features would see their Facebook friends and the articles those friends had read, in a \u201cfacebar\u201d at the top of the Yahoo News site. To accomplish such sharing, the Netflix application had to be able to send Facebook messages. But Netflix was given the ability not only to send private messages but also to read, write and delete them, and to see all participants on a thread. A Netflix spokesman said the company was not aware it had been granted such broad powers and had used the access only for messages sent by the recommendation feature.Netflix deactivated the feature about a year after it was introduced, but documents show that the company still had access to users\u2019 messages in 2017. Spotify, which continues to offer its own similar recommendation feature, also said it was unaware of the special access.Beginning in 2010, if people visited one of those partner sites while logged in to Facebook, a blue bar on the screen would let them know the site was receiving their Facebook data to personalize what they saw. For example, people might see what movies their friends liked, or get tailored search results based on preferences gleaned from Facebook.Facebook eventually wound down instant personalization, but it continued to allow some sites, including Bing and Rotten Tomatoes, access to much of the same data they had been getting for the discontinued feature.The internal documents shed light on a Facebook feature called \u201cPeople You May Know,\u201d a friend-suggestion tool that has long confused and unsettled users. In some deals, Facebook shared information with other companies and in turn received people\u2019s contact details \u2014 data Facebook used to develop complex friend network models and suggest more connections, the documents show. The partners that fed information to the tool included Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei.The tool incorporated Facebook friend lists and allowed people to share articles and make recommendations to other readers. The feature was shut down in 2011, but The Times continued to have access to friend lists until 2017. The Times spokeswoman said they were unaware of the continued access and were not receiving any data for the feature from Facebook.Advertisement"}

Chinese Censors Had Their Own Answer.", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Artificial intelligence bots. 3-D printed human organs. Genomic sequencing.These might seem to be natural topics of interest in a country determined to be the world\u2019s leader in science and technology. But in China, where censors are known to take a heavy hand, several artworks that look closely at these breakthroughs have been deemed taboo by local cultural officials.As a result, some of the show\u2019s curators and the affected artists have been left guessing as to why the works were banned. Their conclusion? The works were perhaps too timely, too relevant and therefore too discomforting for Chinese officials.But in China, where officials are often incentivized to err on the side of caution and prioritize social stability above all else, stirring up public debate with hard-hitting questions about ethics is not always a welcome endeavor.Huang Yaqun, the deputy director of academic affairs at the Guangdong Museum of Art, a state-backed museum and the host of the triennial, said that the decision to cut the works was based in part on their \u201cincompatibility with the Guangdong people\u2019s taste and cultural habits.\u201dThough some were caught off-guard by the last-minute decision to pull works from the triennial, such setbacks are a frequent occurrence for many in China\u2019s art circles when dealing with the country\u2019s often unpredictable censorship review process.Contrary to the notion of China\u2019s censorship apparatus as an all-powerful monolith, the effort to get an exhibition past cultural officials is often a constant negotiation and balancing act that can depend on factors including which authorities are in charge and what the local situation is. Exhibition organizers are often forced to come up with clever strategies to circumvent or assuage censors by, for example, showing a work without explanatory text or putting age restrictions on access to a show.Still, Mr. Kaayk, who said he had spent months preparing \u201cThe Modular Body\u201d for the show, only to find out at the last minute that it had been banned, said in an email that he felt \u201cvery frustrated.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t contemporary art meant to raise questions, and start discussions about important subjects in actuality and those of our near future?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat are China\u2019s reasons for organizing all these big expensive \u2018contemporary art\u2019 manifestations if these questions, the core of contemporary art, freedom of speech, freedom of mind, are ignored and undermined?\u201dZoe Mou contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Workers Got Paid in Company Stock. They Used It to Agitate for Change.", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley technology firms are known for giving stock to their workers, a form of compensation that often helps employees feel invested in their companies.At Amazon, more than a dozen employees who had received stock grants recently exercised their rights as shareholders. In late November and early December, they filed identical shareholder petitions asking the e-commerce giant to release a comprehensive plan addressing climate change.Their filing appears to be the first time that tech employees have led their own shareholder proposal, according to activist investors. In the proposal, which will be voted on at Amazon\u2019s annual shareholder meeting next spring, employees asked the company\u2019s board to say how it would respond to climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.\u201cWe realized we could use our position as employees and our power and our rights as shareholders to bring visibility of this issue to the board and the top leaders of this company,\u201d said Eliza Pan, a program manager who has worked at Amazon for five years and is one of the employees who signed on to the proposal.Ms. Pan, who earned Amazon shares as part of her compensation package, said workers must own at least $2,000 in stock for a year to file a shareholder proposal. \u201cWe had this power, and we wanted to leverage that power,\u201d she said.The move by Amazon\u2019s employees builds upon similar activism at Google this year. In March, its workers were part of a shareholder petition by Zevin Asset Management that sought to link executive compensation to diversity and inclusion goals. Google\u2019s employees did not directly file the proposal, but joined Zevin and presented it at the annual shareholder meeting of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.The proposal was ultimately voted down, but Pat Miguel Tomaino, the director of socially responsible investing at Zevin, said the firm planned to work with Google employees to resubmit it for the 2019 shareholder meeting.\u201cWorkers are looking at who holds power and where changes can be made,\u201d said Yana Calou, an engagement manager at Coworker.org, an organization that allows colleagues to start campaigns together. \u201cWorkers are shareholders themselves, and risks to workers and users are often risks to shareholders, so there is a natural alliance of shared interests.\u201dAmazon declined to comment on its employees\u2019 advocacy, but it said it was taking steps to address climate change.\u201cWe have set a goal to power our global infrastructure with 100 percent renewable energy and are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency innovations,\u201d said Kara Hurst, director of worldwide sustainability at Amazon. The company, based in Seattle, has installed solar energy systems at 25 of its fulfillment centers and has streamlined its packing process to reduce its use of packing materials, she added.Google declined to comment on its employees\u2019 participation in shareholder proposals.Shareholder proposals have in the past been used largely by activist investment firms and others to advocate for changes.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly unusual to see this, where employees are taking a stand in regard to the company they\u2019re working for,\u201d said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a wealth-management fund that focuses on climate issues.Tech employees, more than in many other industries, have a ready-made way to become activist shareholders because of how they are paid. Google, Facebook, Apple and tech start-ups such as Airbnb have all made stock a component of compensation. At privately held companies, tech workers often get stock options, which give them the option to buy shares at a set price. Publicly traded companies tend to grant restricted stock options that automatically transfer shares to employees over a period of time.\u201cBecause so much value is being created, or we hope is going to be created, it\u2019s appealing to employees to receive some potential part of that pop or growth in value,\u201d said Mary Russell, a lawyer and founder of Stock Option Counsel, a legal firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that advises tech employees on their compensation. \u201cThe culture of the companies is that we need to do this to incentivize people to build the value of the company.\u201dBut by paying employees this way, tech companies open themselves up to this kind of shareholder advocacy, she said. \u201cThey are setting themselves up to have quite a large group of stockholders who would of course, like any other stockholder, have the right to bring forward a shareholder proposal,\u201d Ms. Russell said.Employee shareholder proposals may ultimately not be effective since shareholder-led proposals are often shot down. And because tech founders often possess a large chunk of the shares in their companies \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and its largest shareholder, owns 16 percent of the company; the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have about 51 percent of voting shares in Alphabet \u2014 the proposals have little chance of passing without founder support.Tech employees said it was worth taking that risk. Shareholder proposals often gain attention because they are distributed to stockholders and are included in annual proxy statements, the employees say, and they give workers a way to raise their grievances directly to the board, rather than just to managers.\u201cBanding together with other shareholders amplifies my voice and makes all of our voices more powerful,\u201d said Ms. Pan of Amazon.\u201cIt\u2019s important to make change and work for change wherever you happen to be, and I happen to be an employee at Amazon,\u201d said Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer who is backing the climate change proposal and who has received Amazon shares as part of her compensation.She said it was important for employees to publicly demand a plan. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting the public, it\u2019s affecting business,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Hearing to Preview Democrats\u2019 Strategy on Big Tech", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats and Google executives worked arm in arm for years, particularly during the Obama administration. But when Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, testifies before Congress on Tuesday, some of the toughest questioning is likely to come from Democrats.The hearing will provide an early glimpse of how Democrats plan to approach Silicon Valley giants in the coming year as they assume control of the House of Representatives. And the testimony from Mr. Pichai, who is appearing before lawmakers after initially resisting, may provide clues about how he and the company will approach them.Democratic lawmakers, angry about Russian misinformation online during the 2016 campaign and concerned about the expanding influence of tech\u2019s biggest companies, are expected to target the industry in the next Congress. Some have already raised concerns about potential antitrust and privacy violations, showing more willingness than Republicans to regulate an industry viewed as an engine of economic growth.Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, have warned that Amazon and other tech giants aren\u2019t paying fair wages. Two other Democrats, Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have called for privacy and online ad legislation, saying big tech companies can\u2019t be trusted to regulate themselves.Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cWe need to restore competition and protect our rights online.\u201d He added: \u201cThe promise of an open internet is fundamentally threatened by the ability of a few powerful gatekeepers to bully competitors, cripple innovation and exploit consumers. This must be a top priority going forward.\u201dThe concerns are aimed broadly across the tech industry. On Tuesday, however, they will focus on Google, as Mr. Pichai will be alone in testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.Republicans have accused Google, Twitter and Facebook of secretly placing conservative voices lower in news feed and search rankings. President Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, have joined the chorus of critics, saying that the liberal views of Silicon Valley leaders and employees have led them to program their services to limit conservative voices.\u201cRecent reports suggest Google might not be wielding its vast power impartially,\u201d said the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, who called on Mr. Pichai to meet with members during his September visit. \u201cIts business practices may have been affected by political bias.\u201dSome Democrats warned that Republicans could focus too much on the accusations of anti-conservative bias, arguing that it would distract from more pressing issues like misinformation and the handling of user data.\u201cThe public has voiced grave concerns about privacy, discrimination, lack of diversity and incivility online,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cUnfortunately, House Republicans are instead choosing to use their final days in the majority to peddle conspiracy theories about conservative bias.\u201dThe prospect of legislation to rein in tech remains slim, because Republicans still control the Senate and have shown no signs of wanting to add regulations. But the harsh criticism from Democrats has put the companies in a defensive crouch.\u201cThe internet companies\u2019 blue wall of protection in Washington seems to be crumbling,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen & Company. \u201cDemocrats now see political gain in taking on tech.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Pichai participated in a White House business round table that included Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella; Oracle\u2019s co-chief executive Safra Catz; Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf; and others.While Mr. Trump made a brief appearance, his daughter and special adviser, Ivanka Trump, represented the White House. She was joined by some administration tech advisers. The topics of discussion included artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation 5G wireless networks.Democratic and Republican lawmakers are also expected to press him on Google\u2019s possible plans for re-entering China, a market the company left in 2010 over concerns about censorship and government hacking.Mr. Pichai has kept a relatively low profile since becoming Google\u2019s chief in 2015. A soft-spoken engineer who grew up in Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company and is seen as more at home dealing with products and technology than with policy and politics. But like other technology chief executives facing questions about the societal impact of their products and the policies of their companies, Mr. Pichai is being forced to take a more active role in Washington.Mr. Pichai\u2019s political donations also mirror Google\u2019s attempts to foster better relationships with Republicans. After donating mostly to Democratic candidates since 2008, Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in Silicon Valley, adopted a more bipartisan approach to his donations. In 2017, he donated nearly $34,000 to both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Fall Back Into Negative Territory for 2018 as Economic Uncertainty Grips Investors", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street dropped again Friday, pushing the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year, as investors continued to fixate on how much the economy and corporate profits could slow next year.Until recently, the American stock market had been something of a standout performer among global markets. The S&P 500 was up 9.6 percent for the year well into September. But over the last few months those gains have disappeared as investors began to assess the potential fallout from a trade war between the United States and China and, rising interest rates.\u201cEssentially there is a scare in the market about the future growth prospects of the global economy,\u201d said Hari Srinivasan, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, an asset management firm.While the market initially rose slightly, those gains evaporated as the issue of a trade war resurfaced later Friday morning. Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, said on CNN that the United States would increase tariffs on Chinese imports if the two countries could not reach an agreement on trade by the end of a 90-day negotiating period. President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed on Saturday to the standstill on new tariffs, but confusion about the nature of the agreement has only added to recent volatility in the stock markets based on widespread expectation that the American economy will likely slow next year.The arrest could mark a risky new phase for many big technology firms, which depend on networks of factories and subcontractors in Asia and have bet on strong demand from Chinese consumers to fuel future growth.Shares of these companies fared particularly poorly on Friday. Companies that make networking equipment and cellphones in China were also sharply lower. The semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices fell more than 8 percent, while Apple was down more than 3 percent. Microsoft and Amazon both fell more than 4 percent. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell more than 3 percent.Industrial stocks also saw significant losses Friday, with the S&P 500 industrial sector dropping 2.6 percent. Large exporters Boeing and Caterpillar, which ship large amounts of goods to China, fell 2.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.\u201cIt is a slowdown and it is making investors nervous, and it could possibly slow down further,\u201d said Stephen Gallagher, director of research at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in New York. \u201cAnd the risks are pointed to the downside with the trade tensions just continuing to build.\u201dBut softer market sentiment soon touched the oil markets, where crude prices moderated their gains. After gaining more than 5 percent earlier in the day, Brent crude oil rose 2 percent, to $61.57 a barrel. West Texas crude, the American benchmark, rose 1.9 percent, to $52.48.The S&P 500 energy sector declined by 0.6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Digital Divide Is Wider Than We Think, Study Says", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFerry County in northeastern Washington spans more than 2,200 square miles of mostly forestland, rivers and lakes. And according to the Federal Communications Commission, everyone in the sprawling county has access to broadband internet.But that is not the reality experienced by the roughly 7,500 residents of this county, which is rich in natural beauty but internet-poor.The county seat, Republic, has basic broadband service, supplied by a community cable TV company owned by residents. But go beyond the cluster of blocks in the small town, and the high-speed service drops off quickly. People routinely drive into town to use Wi-Fi in the public library and other spots for software updates, online shopping or schoolwork, said Elbert Koontz, Republic\u2019s mayor.\u201cWe don\u2019t really have broadband coverage across the county,\u201d Mr. Koontz said. \u201cWe\u2019re out in the woods.\u201dA new study by Microsoft researchers casts a light on the actual use of high-speed internet across the country, and the picture it presents is very different from the F.C.C. numbers. Their analysis, presented at a Microsoft event on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., suggests that the speedy access is much more limited than the F.C.C. data shows.Over all, Microsoft concluded that 162.8 million people do not use the internet at broadband speeds, while the F.C.C. says broadband is not available to 24.7 million Americans. The discrepancy is particularly stark in rural areas. In Ferry County, for example, Microsoft estimates that only 2 percent of people use broadband service, versus the 100 percent the federal government says have access to the service.Accurate measurements on the reach of broadband matter because the government\u2019s statistics are used to guide policy and channel federal funding for underserved areas.Telecommunications experts and some politicians have pointed to the shortcomings of the official F.C.C. statistics for years. Last year, the agency began a formal review, still in progress, of how to improve its broadband measurements.\u201cMaintaining updated and accurate data about broadband deployment is critical to bridging the digital divide,\u201d Ajit Pai, the commission chairman, said at the time. \u201cSo we\u2019re teeing up ideas for collecting more granular and standardized data.\u201dThe Microsoft researchers shared their analysis with F.C.C. officials. The agency declined to comment on the findings.The issue with the current F.C.C. statistics, experts say, is that they rely on simplistic surveys of internet service providers that inherently overstate coverage. For example, if one business in an area has broadband service, then the entire area is typically considered to have broadband service available.The Microsoft researchers instead looked at the internet speeds of people using the company\u2019s software and services, like Office software, Windows updates, Bing searches and maps, and Xbox game play. The Microsoft data is much more detailed than the official government statistics, said John Kahan, Microsoft\u2019s chief data analytics officer for external affairs.Microsoft plans to put the national comparisons, as well as state and county data, on a website this month.The Microsoft analysis also includes county unemployment data, which points to the strong correlation between joblessness and low rates of broadband use. The unemployment rate in Ferry County, for example, is 11 percent, more than twice the statewide rate.\u201cThe worst place to be is in a place where there is no access to the technology everyone else is benefiting from,\u201d said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft.Expanding broadband also benefits Microsoft and other tech companies because it enlarges the market for their products and services. And like others, Microsoft is promoting a potential solution.The technology is promising, experts say, but one tool among a handful needed to bring broadband connectivity to rural America. Other tools include fiber networks, satellite coverage and high-speed mobile service.A key challenge is bringing down the cost of devices that use white-space technology. In mid-2017, they cost $800, but are now just $300, Microsoft says. The goal is to get the price to $100.Last year, Microsoft announced plans to work with internet providers and hardware firms to propel the adoption of white-space technology. To date, the company says, it has deals in 13 states to bring broadband to over a million people in rural areas.Microsoft on Tuesday said its Airband initiative planned to reach three million rural residents by July 2022, a million more than its target announced last year.Microsoft is urging the government to keep the white-space broadcast spectrum open for public use. It is also pushing to get a larger portion of the more than $4 billion a year that the F.C.C. and the Agriculture Department spend in grants and subsidies to bring broadband to rural areas.Microsoft competitors and critics say one of the wealthiest companies in the world is lobbying for an advantage and government money. Broadcasters also worry the white-space technology could interfere with local television service.\u201cBroadcasters have always supported rural broadband deployment,\u201d said Dennis Wharton, executive vice president for communications at the National Association of Broadcasters. \u201cBut we\u2019re skeptical whether Microsoft can deliver that service without significant interference and disruption to local television signals in smaller markets.\u201dIn Ferry County, a white-space broadband effort will begin next year. Declaration Networks, a company that focuses on bringing broadband to rural areas, has just received a commitment for money from the F.C.C. for the project.\u201cFerry County has a lot of needs, and we\u2019re going to try address that,\u201d said Bob Nichols, chief executive of Declaration Networks, which is based in Vienna, Va.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

They came up with a device that slips inside a bag, backpack or suitcase and keeps track of items using radio-frequency identification technology. If a wallet is not returned to the bag, the device sends a cellphone alert. If the cellphone is missing, the device beeps.The school\u2019s graduates and researchers have parlayed their ideas, skills and ambition into more than 50 start-up companies that have raised a total of $60 million from investors and created about 200 jobs. One start-up, Nanit, sells a smart baby monitor online and in stores, while three others have been acquired by companies, including one by Adobe.So far, 534 of the school\u2019s graduates \u2014 of whom, more than 60 percent remain in the city \u2014 have been hired by Google, Bloomberg, Microsoft and other technology companies.\u201cIt really sends a message to the broader tech industry and also the whole world that New York City is serious about tech,\u201d said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech: NYC, a nonprofit industry group.Citywide, the technology industry employs more than 320,000 people, according to Tech: NYC. Many work in what Ms. Samuels calls an expanding \u201cecosystem\u201d of more than 7,000 small start-up companies. New York\u2019s ascendance as a technology hub was reaffirmed by Google\u2019s announcement on Monday that it would create a $1 billion campus in the West Village that would allow the company to double the size of its 7,000 employee work force in the city.Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, won $100 million and a spot on Roosevelt Island.\u201cThey\u2019re a very prestigious institution that is free-riding off the backs of a working population to function in an environment that they really are not adequately paying for,\u201d said Joyce Short, a writer and longtime resident.All the money and attention showered on Cornell Tech has, at times, overshadowed other schools. New York University, which also took part in the 2010 competition, is creating a $380-million tech hub for emerging media, technology and the arts in the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority. Across the street, its Tandon School of Engineering runs several incubators for start-ups.Josh Hartmann, a former chief technology officer for Travelocity and Amplify who now teaches at Cornell Tech, said technology-focused schools are an integral part of what he called a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d that drives the city\u2019s tech industry. The schools attract faculty members and support research, both of which draw more students. The students increase and diversify the talent pool, which in turn brings more companies.On a recent evening, students were huddled together in \u201cthe collaboratory\u201d \u2014 Cornell Tech\u2019s version of a library with tables and smart boards. Downstairs, the school\u2019s \u201cstudio_code:\u201d displayed seven principles for innovation, including \u201cBuild Things That Matter\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Jerk.\u201dEvery student is assigned to a team that works with more than 50 companies, including Amazon and Samsung, on real-life problems that begin with, \u201cHow might we \u2026\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said that part of the challenge is learning to work together across different backgrounds, interests and programs.In the spring, students team up on their own to develop start-ups and then present them to parents, technology leaders and investors. Last May, four teams were chosen from dozens of entrants. Each team received a $100,000 award, including office space, to pursue its start-up.Ms. Le Cam, 24, who studied computer science, wrote the app for the device, which keeps track of every item marked by a chip-implanted sticker. The prototype started out shaped like an egg, but testers gave that a thumbs down because it would not fit in small bags. It was flattened, and took on a pocket shape.But Cornell Tech\u2019s entrepreneurial culture is contagious, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in an environment where everyone is thinking about it,\u201d Ms. Moldavskaya said.The school\u2019s operating budget is $50 million annually and is covered partly through student tuition, which starts at $54,584 a year and increases to $102,652 for a master\u2019s in business administration. The school has also raised $815 million in private donations, including $350 million from Atlantic Philanthropies, whose founder is a Cornell graduate, and $100 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies.Jay Jacobson, 82, a retired lawyer who lives on Roosevelt Island, recently worked with Cornell Tech students to address a daily problem for older people: how to carry a shopping bag when holding onto a walker? They came up with a 3-D-printed hinge to attach to a walker.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m part of their community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a delight to have them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the Downtown Brooklyn building where New York University\u2019s new tech hub is located.

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would Seattle Drink Coffee From Its Stanley Cup?", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro HockeySEATTLE \u2014 Bustling, bruising, big-time hockey in this foggy, tech-loving, latte-sipping city?When you think of professional sports in Seattle, Pete Carroll, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks may come to mind. Or maybe your memory drifts to Ken Griffey Jr. batting for the Mariners.Perhaps, as so many people in this town do, you remember ghosts of the N.B.A.: Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Downtown Freddie Brown. But the SuperSonics have been gone for a decade. In 2008, they shuffled off, ignominiously, to Oklahoma City to be reborn as the Thunder.You want to talk about ghosts? The illustrious, if little-known, Seattle Metropolitans were the first American hockey team to hoist the Stanley Cup. But that was in 1917. Hockey, at its highest level, hasn\u2019t been played here for nearly a century.This once brawling seaport has changed a lot since then.When the N.H.L. announced last week that Seattle would get the league\u2019s 32nd franchise, it stuck its fork into an organic salad and popped the top on a craft beer.Seattle\u2019s new hockey team does not have a name yet, but it has deep-pocketed owners who plan to complete a lavish, privately funded, $850 million upgrade of the Sonics\u2019 downtown stadium, Key Arena, in order to begin playing in it in the fall of 2021.Will these hyped early days translate into long-term success?\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Tim Pipes, one of the most passionate grass-roots hockey supporters in town. \u201cAll of the elements are here. The whole area is ripe for the greatest game going.\u201dPipes, who grew up in Toronto rooting for the Maple Leafs, is owner and impresario at the Angry Beaver, a cozy, no-frills watering hole north of downtown with a distinctly Canadian atmosphere and a billing as Seattle\u2019s only full-fledged hockey bar.Like many other tried-and-true puck heads here, Pipes, 56, sandy-haired and enthusiastic, is part hockey evangelist and part historian of the sport in his adopted city. Over the years, he said, with nothing more to root for but local minor league and junior teams, the game in Seattle has developed a deeply dedicated following.\u201cComing from Toronto, I really found hockey to be a very quirky thing here,\u201d Pipes told me. His bar was dense with the smell of poutine. Patrons were drinking Molson and watching N.H.L. games on big-screen TVs. \u201cBut quirky \u2014 that\u2019s good. Hockey is an unusual sport. There\u2019s nothing like it. The speed. The power. And it\u2019s a ballet on ice.\u201cSure,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u201cit\u2019s not as popular in the U.S. as a sport like football, but just like with pro soccer and our Sounders, where they have huge crowds all the time, a sport as exciting and niche as hockey seems like a natural fit in a place like this.\u201dSeattle has long been a city that prides itself on idiosyncrasies.Huge corporations like Boeing, Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks took root here, of all places, in this drizzly Northwest corner of the continental United States. Few cities have such a dense array of nooks and crannies, of tree-lined lakes and narrow waterways, of tucked-away neighborhoods and quiet cafes.One of Seattle\u2019s most popular annual parades snakes by a 16-foot statue of Vladimir Lenin and features throngs of nude bicyclists. One of the most beloved works of public art is a massive sculpture of a craggy troll who sits in the shadows beneath an old bridge.The city gave birth to grunge rock music in the 1990s. But many people forget that well before then, Seattle had a flourishing African-American jazz scene, where Ray Charles, Ernestine Anderson and Quincy Jones developed their chops. Jimi Hendrix grew up here.Quirky? Bruce Lee honed his martial art in the same neighborhood.New, cool and different have always had a home in Seattle \u2014 so long as new and cool and different were great.Still, as I moved about the city after the N.H.L. announcement, it was hard to gauge much general excitement for Seattle\u2019s new hockey team. That was hardly surprising. Seattle\u2019s culture is politely understated, and opening day is three years off.But at the Angry Beaver, on a weekend night, I could feel enormous energy. Most patrons were watching the Boston Bruins play the Toronto Maple Leafs.\u201cThe Bruins are my favorite team, but the N.H.L. in Seattle is something I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life,\u201d said Jim Cockrill, a heavy equipment operator wearing a No. 37 Bruins jersey.Cockrill faithfully attended minor league hockey games as a boy, hoping against hope that the N.H.L. would one day come to town. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone here will say the same.\u201dCockrill was something of an anomaly at the bar: a native of the area. Surrounding him were other Bruins fans \u2014 most of them from Boston or other parts of the East Coast. Across from him were Toronto supporters. All but a few were from Toronto or points far beyond the state of Washington.\u201cThe transplants,\u201d Pipes called them, before proudly noting that he had come to Seattle to be a rock musician, so he was one of them. \u201cThe transplants bring the love of hockey that they learned in places like Boston, New York or Canada. They\u2019re so passionate about the sport!\u201cNow they\u2019re going to be falling in love with a new team.\u201dHis saloon hummed. Clusters of men and women, eyes on the television sets, shouted, cursed and laughed. \u201cAh, my beloved Red Wings,\u201d said Raoul Beacom, 62. He spoke wistfully of growing up in the Midwest and going to Red Wings games with his father. \u201cYou know, I will always back Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the memories of youth.\u201cBut now I\u2019ll have someone new to root for. Seattle has the longest-suffering fans in hockey. It\u2019s been 101 years since the Metropolitans won the Stanley Cup. After all these years, the game will be back.\u201dHockey in Seattle?You bet. And I\u2019ll have a cappuccino.Advertisement"}

At what point is control lost and the creations take over? How about now? Contributing Opinion Writer Try to imagine the last 11 minutes of Lion Air Flight 610 in October. The plane is a new machine, Boeing\u2019s sleek and intelligent 737 Max 8, fitted with an advanced electronic brain. After takeoff, this cyberpilot senses that something is wrong with the angle of ascent and starts to force the jetliner down.A tug of war follows between men and computer, at 450 miles an hour \u2014 the human pilots trying to right the downward plunge, the automatic pilot taking it back from them. The bot wins. The jetliner crashes into the Java Sea. All 189 onboard are killed.And here\u2019s the most agonizing part: The killer was supposed to save lives. It was a smart computer designed to protect a gravity-defiance machine from error. It lacks judgment and intuition, precisely because those human traits can sometimes be fatal in guiding an aerodynamic tube through the sky.But it\u2019s not too much of a reach to see Flight 610 as representative of the hinge in history we\u2019ve arrived at \u2014 with the bots, the artificial intelligence and the social media algorithms now shaping the fate of humanity at a startling pace.Like the correction system in the 737, these inventions are designed to make life easier and safer \u2014 or at least more profitable for the owners. And they do, for the most part. The overall idea is to outsource certain human functions, the drudgery and things prone to faulty judgment, while retaining master control. The question is: At what point is control lost and the creations take over? How about now?It was exactly 200 years ago that Mary Shelley published a story of a monster who is still very much with us. Her book \u201cFrankenstein\u201d is about the consequences of man playing God. You can see permutations of the monster, a not-unsympathetic patchwork of human parts, in characters like Dolores, the host who rebels in the television series \u201cWestworld.\u201dShelley\u2019s concerns were raised at the peak of the Industrial Revolution, when the Western world was transformed from sleepy agricultural societies into a frenetic age of factories, machines and overcrowded cities. All the helpful inventions also produced mass dislocation, life-killing pollution, child labor and \u2014 as per the invention of the cotton gin in the American South \u2014 an expansion of human enslavement.Today we are close to creating a human brain inside a computer \u2014 an entirely new species. In his book \u201cSapiens,\u201d Yuval Noah Harari takes us through a mostly upbeat tour of humanity since the cognitive revolution of 70,000 years ago. At the end of the book \u2014 our time \u2014 he warns about the new being, the cyborg now taking shape in a lab near you.The C.E.O. of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, hit a similar cautionary note at the company\u2019s recent annual shareholder meeting. Big Tech, he said, should be asking \u201cnot what computers can do, but what they should do.\u201dIt\u2019s the \u201ccan do\u201d part that should scare you. Facebook, once all puppies, baby pictures and high school reunion updates, is a monster of misinformation. And Facebook\u2019s creator is more clueless than Dr. Frankenstein about the dangers of what he has unleashed on the world.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., has glibly assured us that building advanced artificial intelligence systems will root out the hate speech, lies and propaganda passed among the two billion active users of Facebook. But fake news \u2014 whether gossip shared by family members or the toxic kind spread by Russians in basements \u2014 is the mother\u2019s milk of Facebook. The A.I. may only make it easier for mass manipulation. In that sense, Facebook is headed for its own crash into the sea.It\u2019s not Luddite to see the be-careful-what-you-wish-for lesson from Mary Shelley\u2019s era to our own, at the cusp of an age of technological totalitarianism. Nor is it Luddite to ask for more screening, more ethical considerations, more projections of what can go wrong, as we surrender judgment, reason and oversight to our soulless creations.As haunting as those final moments inside the cockpit of Flight 610 were, it\u2019s equally haunting to grasp the full meaning of what happened: The system overrode the humans and killed everyone. Our invention. Our folly.Advertisement"}

Now these giants are increasingly outgrowing their West Coast roots.Driven by a limited pool of skilled workers and the ballooning cost of living in their home bases of Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as President Trump\u2019s shifting immigration policies, the companies are aggressively taking their talent hunt across the United States and elsewhere. And they are coalescing particularly around a handful of urban areas that are already winners in the new knowledge-based economy, including New York City, Washington, Boston and Austin, Tex.\u201cThey\u2019re expanding out,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cTech talent is in very short supply. So if these tech companies want to grow and flourish, they need to find talent in other parts of the country.\u201dThe chase for tech talent has been global for decades, and Silicon Valley\u2019s older companies have had big offices all over the world for years. Intel, for example, has far more employees in Oregon than it does in California. Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies three years ago, has had large outposts in Idaho and Oregon.Amazon, Apple and Google are now increasingly adopting the same strategy as they hire for growth and pursue the brightest minds in new technologies, in an effort to outmuscle one another. Over the past two years, Amazon\u2019s work force has doubled to 613,300 employees; Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, has increased its head count by 35 percent, to 94,300; and Apple has grown nearly 14 percent, to 132,000 workers.Like Cambridge, England, some cities in the United States have also become known for a particular area of tech expertise, in what has become a modern remake of the country\u2019s industrial era, when cities came to specialize in the production of cars, steel and coal.The search for talent outside Silicon Valley and Seattle has also been prompted by issues in the companies\u2019 hometowns, which have not built enough housing to keep up with their growing work forces. San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Seattle are the four most expensive major cities in the country based on home values, according to data from Zillow. The median home in San Francisco is valued at almost $1.4 million and more than $733,000 in Seattle. Questions also abound over the quality and funding of the areas\u2019 public school systems.\u201cEvery day as a C.E.O., you have employees coming to you saying, \u2018I don\u2019t make enough to buy a house for my family,\u2019 and you already feel like you are paying through the nose,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the real estate site based in Seattle. \u201cAlmost everyone is looking at other affordable places where you can open an office.\u201dThat has helped push some tech companies into building major outposts in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economics professor, said that even if H-1B workers were to come through in abundance, it would still make sense to put them in cheaper cities, like Austin. He said, \u201c$100,000 goes a lot further in Austin than in Silicon Valley.\u201dMore than 44 percent of all digital-service jobs in the United States were located in just 10 metro areas last year, including Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, as well as New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston, according to research by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 2015 to 2017, only nine metro areas increased their share of the nation\u2019s tech work force, including the West Coast tech hubs, as well as Austin and Denver.\u201cThe tech industry concentrates in very few markets,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cOur biggest concern is how do we make sure more cities, particularly midsized cities in the middle of the country, can be players in the tech economy?\u201dAmazon, which has about 45,000 people at its Seattle headquarters, has also opened 16 tech hubs in the United States. About 85 percent of those satellite employees are in six booming, highly educated urban areas \u2014 the Bay Area, Washington region, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. Each has at least 1,000 workers.(The bulk of Amazon\u2019s North American work force is made up of the more than 250,000 people who are dispersed in the company\u2019s roughly 110 warehouses around Canada and the United States and who make less money than their white-collar colleagues.)Apple, which has been criticized by President Trump for not creating more domestic jobs, said on Thursday that its plans for Austin included a new 133-acre campus that will initially have 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations and other functions. It will ultimately be able to accommodate up to 15,000 workers.Apple already has about 6,000 workers in Austin. The company said it applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County.A person familiar with Apple\u2019s decision to expand outside Cupertino, Calif., where it just opened a new $5 billion headquarters, said the move into Austin was partly driven by the extreme housing prices in the Bay Area, as well as its aim to find more talent and add more diversity and military veterans to its work force.The company added that it also planned to open 1,000-worker operations in Seattle, San Diego, and Culver City, Calif., and to add hundreds of employees in Pittsburgh, Boston, New York and Boulder, Colo., over the next three years.\u201cIn a sense, what we\u2019re seeing is tech becoming a normal industry,\u201d Mr. Glaeser said, \u201can industry that\u2019s not located in one incredibly expensive place.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco and Karen Weise from Seattle.

{"Headline": "Why the F.T.C. Is Taking a New Look at Facebook Privacy ", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a yearlong string of news reports that have called Facebook\u2019s data-sharing practices into question, federal regulators are taking a hard look at how the social media company handles the personal information of its users.It is not the first time Facebook has drawn government scrutiny. About seven years ago, after charges were leveled by the Federal Trade Commission, the company made an agreement with the agency to overhaul its privacy practices. That agreement, called a consent decree, provides a road map for how the F.T.C. is likely to scrutinize Facebook over the coming months.In 2007, Facebook introduced Facebook Beacon, a program that broadcast details on users\u2019 online purchases to their friends, initially allowing users to opt out of sharing their purchases only on a case-by-case basis. At the end of 2009, a coalition of nonprofit consumer and privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook\u2019s handling of user data. In 2011, the F.T.C. filed charges against Facebook that said the company had deceived consumers about their privacy.The F.T.C.\u2019s complaint charged Facebook with a number of deceptive privacy practices. Among them:\u25a0 Facebook shared users\u2019 personal details with advertisers even though the company had promised not to do so, the agency said.\u25a0 Facebook allowed third-party apps that users had installed to have access to nearly all of their personal data \u2014 even though Facebook had stated the apps could obtain only the personal information they needed to operate, the agency said.\u25a0 The agency said Facebook claimed it certified the security practices of apps participating in its \u201cVerified Apps program,\u201d but the company did not do so.The agency ordered Facebook to put a comprehensive privacy program in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of users\u2019 information and to manage the risks of existing and new products. It also required Facebook over the next 20 years to undergo biennial audits by an independent third party to certify that the privacy program was properly protecting the information of the company\u2019s users.The voter-profiling company obtained the data from a researcher who had offered a personality survey app on Facebook. Although only about 270,000 Facebook users agreed to share their data to participate in the survey, the Facebook platform enabled the app to improperly harvest the personal details of millions of those users\u2019 friends \u2014 consumers who had not agreed to share their information with the survey app, The Times reported.Privacy experts, law professors and at least one former F.T.C. official have argued that Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the survey app from obtaining the data of users\u2019 friends violated the federal consent agreement. So did Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the app developer from sharing both users\u2019 data and the data of users\u2019 friends with Cambridge Analytica, these critics said.They said the Cambridge Analytica episode suggested that Facebook had failed to adequately conduct the risk assessments the agreement required it to do. It also failed to obtain required, explicit consent from users\u2019 friends for the sharing of their data with third parties, the privacy experts said.They also argued that Facebook had failed to operate a comprehensive privacy protection program and take reasonable precautions \u2014 steps the company was obligated to take under the consent decree.Since then, Facebook has made other admissions about privacy problems that experts said could potentially violate the consent agreement or trigger new federal charges of deceptive privacy practices.Facebook said it had developed a privacy program as required by federal regulators and it had not violated the consent decree.\u201cWe are transparent with people about how we use their information and respect people's privacy settings,\u201d Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a privacy program, which ensures we protect people's information, which we continuously evolve to address the privacy risks of our products and services.\u201dMs. Aldous said the company\u2019s privacy program involved more than three dozen control mechanisms \u2014 including a privacy governance team and security teams that \u201censure privacy risks for product launches and major changes are identified, discussed, and escalated for decisions when necessary.\u201dFacebook said it disagreed with The Times\u2019s characterization of its sharing of user data with Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, Samsung, Yahoo and other companies. The social network said device makers used information from Facebook to integrate certain Facebook features on their platforms and agreed not to use that information for their own purposes. The company also said Spotify and other third-party apps had access to users\u2019 Facebook data only after users signed in with their Facebook account in the third-party apps.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Data Sharing and Privacy Rules: 5 Takeaways From Our Investigation", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are five takeaways from our investigation.\u201cWe don\u2019t sell data to anyone,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder, told Congress during a hearing in April. His pledge \u2014 that the torrent of data Facebook collects from its 2.2 billion users will always remain safely in Facebook\u2019s hands \u2014 has been a cornerstone of the company\u2019s defensive strategy this year, as lawmakers, regulators and activists have pummeled the social network over a series of privacy breaches and public relations blunders.While it is true that Facebook hasn't sold users\u2019 data, for years it has struck deals to share the information with dozens of Silicon Valley companies. These partners were given more intrusive access to user data than Facebook has ever disclosed. In turn, the deals helped Facebook bring in new users, encourage them to use the social network more often, and drive up advertising revenue.Internal documents obtained by The Times show that Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, but also automakers, media organizations (including The Times) and others. While Facebook users can control what data they share with most of the thousands of apps on Facebook\u2019s platform, some companies had access to users\u2019 data even if they had disabled all sharing. Many of the partners\u2019 applications never even appeared in Facebook\u2019s user application settings. According to Facebook, each of the outside companies acted as an extension of the social network. Any information a user shared with friends on Facebook, the company argues, could be shared with these partner companies without additional consent.The data partnerships date to 2010, at the start of a period of headlong growth and expansion for Facebook. Within a few years, the social network had struck so many of these deals that Facebook employees built a tool to track the different types of access the partners had.Despite this, Facebook appears not to have kept close tabs on how its users\u2019 data flowed out into the world. A Russian social media company, Yandex, that has been accused of having overly close ties to the Kremlin, still had access to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs for years after Facebook had cut off other applications from the data, citing security concerns.Likewise, Facebook gave Yahoo the ability to display a Facebook user\u2019s news feed \u2014 including friends\u2019 posts \u2014 on the search company\u2019s home page. Yahoo got rid of the feature in 2012. But as of last year, it still had access to data for close to 100,000 people a month. Under the terms of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Facebook was required to strengthen privacy safeguards and disclose data practices more thoroughly. The company hired an independent firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to formally assess its privacy procedures and report back to the F.T.C. every two years.Facebook maintains that the partnerships are covered by an exemption to the consent decree. A spokeswoman for the F.T.C., which last spring opened a new investigation into Facebook, declined to say whether the commission agreed.Advertisement"}

Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d to promote entrepreneurship across the United States and seed investments in cities often overlooked by venture capital funds. In doing so, the two men have recruited a list of who\u2019s who in business, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Charles and David Koch of Koch Industries, to be part of their investment fund.The fund is part of a larger movement to reimagine company towns, and a challenge for venture capital funds to look beyond California, New York and Massachusetts \u2014 the three states that receive 75 percent of venture capital in the United States.\u201cIt takes a set of ingredients, including a comfort with new ideas and diversity,\u201d said Walter Isaacson, the authorized biographer of \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d and a history professor. \u201cIt takes a willingness to take risks and even to fail at times.\u201dThat is the magic of her city, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said in conversation with Mr. Isaacson and Mr. Case at the Cities for Tomorrow conference. The city reimagined itself from the 1962 World\u2019s Fair and is the home of Amazon, Nordstrom, Microsoft, Starbucks and Costco \u2014 what Ms. Durkan called \u201csmall mom-and-pop companies that stay below the radar until they\u2019re not.\u201dBut on the conference stage, the discussion shifted from the benefits of rising cities to the reality of one rising sector.\u201cEven in the successful cities, the success masks this other part of the city that hasn\u2019t risen,\u201d Ms. Durkan said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen that in Seattle, with the huge growth of tech and the new economy, but it masks some real displacement, some real lack of opportunity.\u201dThe elephant in the room was Amazon. Two-hundred-thirty-eight cities across North America applied to be home for the company\u2019s next headquarters, and last month Amazon selected Long Island City, Queens, and Crystal City, Va., for HQ2.Mr. Case pointed to the other 236 cities as ones with real opportunities also awaiting them. Those are the cities that can really rise, he said.\u201cMy hope is that the 236 that lost, if they take half of the energy they put into rallying their community, driving collaboration, and half of the dollars they were putting on the table to lure them, and refocus that on their start-up community, they might create the next Amazon,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The S&P 500 health care sector fell 3.4 percent, making it the worst performing part of the market.

Ms. Fowler is an editor in the Opinion section.If you thought 2018 was a bad year for tech, 2019 might turn out to be even worse. This year was filled with revelations about privacy, security and cyberwarfare. Next year, the consequences of those revelations will unfold. And we should be very worried about what the future holds. Privacy Is DeadAnd perhaps worse is what the future holds. We most likely aren\u2019t aware of all the companies that hold our personal data and what they are doing with it: the social media companies that know us as well as our friends do, the financial technology companies that sell our bank account transaction data, the messaging apps that hold our private photos and texts.Many of us will delete apps. We will disable as much tracking as we can on our phones. We will delete our Facebook accounts. We will delete our social media histories and old emails and text messages. But it won\u2019t be enough because most people will not care: The trade-off between privacy and convenience will be worth it to them, because the loss of their privacy will have little to no impact on their day-to-day life. Most people will read (or perhaps ignore) the news stories about every new privacy scandal, and they will then go back to their phones. The End of SecurityIt\u2019s not clear that these breaches were a result of poor security practices or corporate negligence. The truth is \u2014 and I say this as someone who has worked in Silicon Valley as an engineer \u2014 the security teams and security practices at Google and Facebook are among the best in the world. It\u2019s not clear that stronger punishments or more regulation will fix the problem or prevent these kinds of data breaches from happening.There\u2019s a lot at stake.

{"Headline": "\u2018Black Mirror\u2019 Gives Power to the People", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS GATOS, Calif. \u2014 \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d the speculative fiction series that encouraged people to be wary of new technology, is now hoping they will embrace it. The Netflix show released just one episode on Friday, a narrative titled \u201cBandersnatch\u201d during which the viewer decides what will happen next.It begins like this: Should the teenage video game whiz Stefan have Sugar Puffs or Frosties for breakfast? Soon the choices become more consequential. Will Stefan work at a game company, tell his therapist about his mother, take his meds? As so often on \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d reality is up for grabs.Viewers are voting on more than who lives and dies on one program. If the response to \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is enthusiastic, Netflix will take it as a strong signal that the public is ready for interactive movies and television shows, and a new age of storytelling will commence.Not that the company needs much encouragement. It has already developed software to help organize stories that have endless permutations. It has perfected, or so it hopes, the technical ability to present these tales on multiple platforms around the world simultaneously. And it is calling for producers to submit interactive proposals in genres from horror to romantic comedy while hinting that it already has a few new shows in the works.The idea behind the interactive push is simple: Viewers will care more if they are complicit.\u201cIf bad things happen, you\u2019ll feel even more crestfallen, because you were responsible,\u201d said Todd Yellin, Netflix\u2019s vice president for product. \u201cIf the character is victorious, you\u2019ll feel even more uplifted because you made that choice.\u201dOne problem is that audiences are not clamoring for interactivity. A long time ago, drama was a live, communal experience. Now it comes over all sorts of devices, but almost always is a one-way street. Netflix has an immense hurdle to overcome.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned to press \u2018play,\u2019 drop the remote and just lean on back and let the TV wash over us,\u201d acknowledged Carla Engelbrecht, Netflix\u2019s director of product innovation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen 2-year-olds do this.\u201dGiving lots of options to the viewer while keeping the main character consistent \u201cwas a huge nut to crack,\u201d Brooker said. It was a five-week shoot for about two and a half hours of script, a much longer time than a typical episode requires.Even now, he is uncertain about what he has made.\u201cI think some people will judge it just on a narrative basis, some people will judge it as a game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us. It\u2019s down to them.\u201dJones disagreed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really designed as a game. It was designed as a cinematic experience.\u201d\u201cWith game-y elements,\u201d Brooker persisted. \u201cYou are making decisions. You are actively guiding it.\u201dWhatever its other merits, \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is definitely not funny. Those who wish to encounter it unencumbered by any prior knowledge should employ a primitive method of interactivity and avert their eyes from the next two paragraphs.The year is 1984, the setting London. Stefan (Fionn Whitehead, last seen in \u201cDunkirk\u201d) lost his mother when he was 5. He blames Dad (Craig Parkinson), who hid the boy\u2019s stuffed toy. The ensuing ruckus made Mom take a later train, which derailed.Stefan is hired by a game company. He adapts a choose-your-own-adventure story by a novelist named Jerome F. Davies, who became convinced that he was trapped in a world of multiple realities, with spectacularly unfortunate results. Stefan\u2019s life begins in some ways to mirror Davies\u2019s.Plot choices in \u201cBandersnatch\u201d come thick and fast at the bottom of the screen, with only a few seconds to click one of them. At one point, I refused to do anything, just to see what would happen. The episode went back to the beginning. It was not clear if this was a bug or I was being punished.Watching the episode, it is easy to see how interactivity could be the next step forward in entertainment. It is less easy to see how this could ever be art. It\u2019s hard to lose yourself in a story if you\u2019re constantly being pulled out of it. \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is not linear, which made it feel unresolved even when I was offered the chance after about 70 minutes to go to the credits. I took instead the option to plunge back to the story and tried to make different choices.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many endings there are,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve created here.\u201dJones, who plays the stern adult to Brooker\u2019s madcap boy genius, shot back: \u201cYes, we do!\u201dBrooker: \u201cSorry. We do.\u201d But he didn\u2019t sound convinced.(A Netflix spokeswoman later clarified that \u201cthere are five main endings with multiple variants of each.\u201d)When making the show, the creative team had endless conversations about good endings versus bad endings or premium endings or five-star endings. Said Brooker: \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 aspect where it keeps cycling around, deliberately so.\u201d It\u2019s an artist\u2019s dream: a story the audience can never escape.Interactive filmmaking is simple to mock. Are we now going to have \u201cMary Poppins\u201d where the nanny dismembers the children with a hacksaw? Few artists are in favor of letting their fans make the decisions. But the technology is perpetually enticing.In 1993, a 20-minute short called \u201cI\u2019m Your Man\u201d seemed to offer real possibilities. Viewers in a handful of specially equipped theaters used a pistol grip attached to each seat to collectively vote on dozens of scene variations.It was a prediction grounded in reality. Moviegoing was in decline, so multiplex owners were open to new approaches. A generation had grown up with a joystick in its hand and wanted to take control of its entertainment.But the whole effort fizzled. \u201cIt was classic ahead-of-its-time technology,\u201d said Bejan, who now runs experiential marketing at Microsoft.Netflix is not making any predictions. Quite the contrary.\u201cIn five years, 10 years, we\u2019ll either say, \u2018Wow, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d was a real turning point for interactive content,\u2019 or we\u2019ll be going, \u2018That was another false start,\u2019 \u201d said Yellin, the Netflix executive.Still, he has great hopes. \u201cWe have our eyes and ears wide open to the creative community \u2014 writers, producers, directors \u2014 for more ideas that would leverage this art form,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the new storytelling conventions that can be invented? We\u2019re meeting with people now.\u201dNetflix, which has 137 million worldwide subscribers, says \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is available across \u201cmost\u201d newer devices, including TVs, game consoles, web browsers and Android and iOS devices running the latest version of the Netflix app. It won\u2019t work on Chromecast, Apple TV and some legacy devices.Since \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is always full of tricks, it\u2019s perhaps inevitable that \u201cBandersnatch\u201d undermines the whole notion of interactivity. The viewer is asked whether a murder should be committed, and if the answer is yes, there is a further decision: Bury the body or chop it up? It\u2019s not much of a choice, which is of course the joke.\u201cI\u2019m not in control!\u201d Stefan rages to his therapist. One path the viewer can take develops into a mocking plug for Netflix, which did not exist in 1984.

But he said interactive filmmaking was less about the audience\u2019s choices than it seemed.\u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of media the filmmaker creates, which he slices and dices to give the illusion of control while at the same time guiding the viewer through the underlying blueprint,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more megalomaniacal than linear filmmaking.\u201dWhich brings us to the data, where every story in tech ends up. Interactive filmmakers will take your preferences \u2014 I really want this character to commit murder, and that one can kill himself \u2014 and convert them into numbers that will guide the creation of new shows you will be programmed to find irresistible.\u201cWe\u2019ll see what resonates with audiences and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d Netflix\u2019s Yellin said.What Netflix is really building is a voting machine. It\u2019s simple to see how technology like this could be used during, for instance, debates by presidential candidates. Viewers would react to promises being made, with their reactions immediately relayed to the candidates.\u201cBlack Mirror\u201d anticipated this sort of possibility in its very first episode. In 2011, \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d posed the question, What if a British politician were forced to follow the whims of the public in real time? He would end up having sex with a pig on live television, of course.\u201cWhatever path you take, there\u2019s darkness ahead,\u201d observed David Slade, who directed both \u201cMetalhead\u201d and \u201cBandersnatch.\u201dThat is pretty much Brooker\u2019s life philosophy. He began as a game reviewer, then became a TV critic, then a critic on TV. \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d \u2014 named after the shiny objects on our desks, walls and all too often in our hands \u2014 anticipated the tech backlash.As Jones explained to Brooker: \u201cYou are naturally suspicious and paranoid and neurotic.\u201d\u201cI worry about things, basically,\u201d he said.He is trying to dial back on technology. This is not easy or perhaps even desirable, because his confrontations with tech feed the show. That is one reason he got an Amazon Echo: research.\u201cQuite quickly my children, 4 and 6, starting talking to it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my kids walked into the room and called me Alexa. \u2018Alexa \u2014 oh, Daddy, where are my shoes?\u2019 I thought, \u2018I have to kill that device.\u2019\u201d\u201cHow would Alexa know where his shoes are?\u201d Jones asked.\u201cAlexa probably does know where his [expletive] shoes are,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cThat\u2019s the tragedy of it.\u201dNow that we\u2019re all suspicious and paranoid and neurotic, at least about technology, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is in flux. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more optimistic episodes and stories, rather than just dystopian and negative ones,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cWe want to keep the show interesting for us.\u201d He and Jones were, however, extremely hazy on when the next episodes would arrive. \u201cBandersnatch\u201d consumed all their attention for a year.One thing is clear, though. The new episodes won\u2019t be interactive. Asked if he had any advice for someone who wanted to try the format, Brooker said in a joking-but-not-really tone: \u201cRun away.

{"Headline": "Facebook Rebuked for Failing to Disclose Data-Sharing Deals", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook and some of the other largest technology firms in the world faced sharp criticism on Wednesday for failing to disclose the extent of the social network\u2019s data-sharing deals, many of which went back to the company\u2019s early years.Lawmakers in the United States and Britain on Wednesday called for greater oversight of Facebook, the world\u2019s dominant social media platform. But critics also focused on statements that Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had made in recent months while defending the company.Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, said the revelations made him question Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision making. \u201cI know he\u2019s smart, but sometimes I think he\u2019s got no sense,\u201d Mr. Kennedy told Fox News, adding that the disclosures were cause to consider stricter privacy laws. \u201cCongress is going to have to regulate them and stop this, and I hate to do it, but by God I will if they can\u2019t clean up their act.\u201dFacebook officials said the deals did not violate user privacy \u2014 or a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred it from sharing data without permission \u2014 because the companies were acting on Facebook\u2019s behalf.In a post published on Facebook on Tuesday, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, the company\u2019s director of developer platforms and programs, defended the partnerships, saying the company entered into the agreements to let users interact with Facebook friends across devices and popular websites.\u201cNone of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people\u2019s permission,\u201d Mr. Papamiltiadis wrote, asserting that most partners did not have to seek consent before obtaining users\u2019 data because they were serving as extensions of Facebook.But he also acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in managing some of the deals. \u201cWe recognize that we\u2019ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information,\u201d he wrote.Facebook was already dealing with fallout from reports that a political consulting company, Cambridge Analytica, obtained the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users. Cambridge used the information to build tools later deployed in President Trump\u2019s election campaign. The F.T.C. launched an inquiry into Facebook\u2019s practices after the data leak became public, and the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating the social network.News of the deals on Wednesday further roiled the technology industry as policymakers and privacy advocates directed anger at Facebook\u2019s leaders and its partners.Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, attacked Mr. Zuckerberg for not disclosing the full scope of the agreements during a Senate hearing in the spring, when Mr. Zuckerberg assured officials that users had complete control of their data.\u201cMark Zuckerberg had a lot of chutzpah telling Congress that Americans could control their data, when seemingly every other week Facebook faces a new privacy scandal for abusing our personal information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat, called for the F.T.C. to police the company more aggressively. \u201cFacebook\u2019s seemingly unrestrained sharing of user data is the privacy equivalent of the BP oil spill,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal wrote on Twitter. \u201cOngoing, uncontained & toxic. We will be paying the price for decades.\u201dDamian Collins, a British lawmaker whose parliamentary committee is investigating online disinformation, said Facebook officials should answer for why they had not been more forthcoming. \u201cI feel that we have been given misleading responses by the company when we have asked these questions during previous evidence sessions.\u201dAnd Barbara Underwood, the New York attorney general, said her office would examine the deals as part of a continuing investigation into Facebook. \u201cThe news that Facebook struck data-sharing partnerships with other corporations reflects the many unanswered questions to which New Yorkers deserve clear answers,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Ms. Underwood\u2019s office.Facebook has sought to contain the damage in part by winding down many of its data-sharing partnerships. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had brought more than 60 of its agreements to a close.But deals with two giants of the technology world \u2014 Amazon and Apple \u2014 remain in place. Facebook officials said the deals must continue because of contracts the social network signed with the companies.Records obtained by The Times showed that the social network granted Apple devices broad access to people\u2019s personal data, even when users had disabled sharing. Facebook gave Amazon access users\u2019 email addresses without permission, among other things, the records revealed.An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. An Apple spokesman said that the company stopped integrating Facebook into its operating systems earlier this year, but that the access continued to accommodate users of older systems.In addition to those partnerships, Facebook will continue allowing special access for Tobii Technology, a company that makes devices allowing people with neuromuscular diseases to use the social network, a Facebook spokeswoman said.Facebook also had a deal to share the data of users\u2019 friends with Microsoft, and agreements that gave Spotify and Netflix full access to users\u2019 private messages. Users were especially incensed at the Spotify and Netflix deals, which appeared to go far beyond what the companies required for their integrations.Spotify\u2019s Facebook feature, still active, allowed users to share music with friends; Netflix\u2019s integration, discontinued in 2015, let users share movie and TV recommendations. A Netflix spokesman on Wednesday said the company did not view personal messages for any other reason.\u201cThe total lack of respect for user wishes is the infinitely repeating scandal of 2018,\u201d she added.An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement made to Fox News about Facebook. The statement was made by Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, not Senator Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Look at Competition in Business Urges Us to Think Small", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesWu, a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, argues that the M&A arcana that lawyers and economists haggle over have effects that spill far beyond their rarefied areas of expertise. \u201cExtreme economic concentration yields gross inequality and material suffering, feeding an appetite for nationalistic and extremist leadership,\u201d he writes, by way of introduction and warning. \u201cThe road to fascism and dictatorship is paved with failures of economic policy to serve the needs of the general public.\u201dUnlike Wu\u2019s previous books, \u201cThe Master Switch\u201d (2010) and \u201cThe Attention Merchants\u201d (2016), \u201cThe Curse of Bigness\u201d is skinny, more of a dip with a snorkel than a deep dive. But the pithiness of this new volume is ideally suited to its subject. Wu doesn\u2019t want to get into all the intricacies of antitrust law; if anything, an enormous book on the problem of enormity would only fool us into believing that the subject is more impenetrable than it really is \u2014 and stoke the confusion and apathy that have allowed decades of corporate consolidation to flourish in the first place.Wu\u2019s point is simple. Giant corporations, seeking to protect their advantage, try to turn their outsize economic power into political power. So to break their grip on American democracy, the government needs to break them up in turn. That this proposal might sound outrageously radical to certain ears is, Wu says, just one sign of how unprepared we are for our current moment. To show how busting up big businesses into smaller parts was once a veritable American tradition, he charts how antitrust law emerged in response to the grotesque inequality of the 19th-century Gilded Age.When the Sherman Antitrust Act was signed into law in 1890, it had unanimous support in the House, though the language it deployed was both sweeping and severe, stating bluntly that \u201cevery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize\u201d any area of business \u201cshall be deemed guilty of a felony.\u201dEnforcing the law turned out to be another matter. A decade later, J .P. Morgan \u2014 \u201chistory\u2019s greatest monopolizer,\u201d as Wu calls him \u2014 created the behemoth U. S. Steel by merging hundreds of smaller firms, even buying out his fellow tycoon Andrew Carnegie in 1901 for an exorbitant sum ($480 million back then) that would make Carnegie the richest man in the world.Wu is an able guide through the history \u2014 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s campaign against \u201cbad trusts\u201d all the way to the expansive bloat of AT&T and Microsoft\u2019s competition-crushing ambitions of more recent memory \u2014 but it\u2019s on the level of ideas that his book comes into its own. Similar to the tech moguls of today, the monopolists of a century ago \u201cliked to portray themselves as part of a progressive movement, striving toward a better age,\u201d Wu writes, even if the endgame they were pursuing \u2014 essentially \u201cpure economic autocracy\u201d \u2014 was a direct rebuke to the foundational values of the republic.But then competition can feel menacing \u2014 a grueling free-for-all that anyone with grand ambitions in business would prefer to do without. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel said as much in the pages of The Wall Street Journal in 2014, in an article with the piquant title \u201cCompetition Is for Losers.\u201d \u201cCapitalism and competition are opposites,\u201d Thiel declared. \u201cOnly one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.\u201dWu, who advised the Federal Trade Commission on competition issues during the Obama administration, doesn\u2019t buy all the piety; nor should he or anyone have to, he says. Trying to distinguish between gigantic corporations that bring value to consumers from gigantic corporations that don\u2019t is ultimately a mug\u2019s game. Competition is a process, and the process should be protected; to fixate too much on the other stuff is to expect the legal system to make distinctions it isn\u2019t equipped to make \u2014 pushing up the standard of proof and allowing enforcement to go slack.Against Bork\u2019s strictly minimalist idea, Wu advances another, more complex one, which was proposed in the early 20th century by the lawyer and eventual Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. Worrying about the tendency of giant corporations to \u201cexterminate\u201d the competition in their inexorable march toward domination, Brandeis believed that the economy, and the businesses that are part of it, needed to operate at a human scale.\u201cWhat Brandeis really cared about was the economic conditions under which life is lived,\u201d Wu writes, \u201cand the effects of the economy on one\u2019s character and on the nation\u2019s soul.\u201d It\u2019s a big idea for a little book, but Wu knows how to keep everything concise and contained. \u201cThe Curse of Bigness\u201d moves nimbly through the thicket, embracing the boons of being small.Advertisement"}

That was the first time that had happened in 75 years.

The indecision reflects the different pressures facing the oil industry:\u2022 On one hand, the world is widely viewed as having an oil glut substantial enough to justify a cut in production, a move that would prop up prices.\u2022 But President Trump is pressing OPEC, and Saudi Arabia in particular, to maintain production levels to keep prices down for American consumers.Oil prices tumbled amid the failure to strike a deal.

{"Headline": "Can the U.S. Stop China From Controlling the Next Internet Age?", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech executives worry China will turn to tit-for-tat arrests of Americans in response to the detention of Meng Wanzhou. And the worries don\u2019t stop there. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Imagine, if you will (and you should), a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing.\u201cIt\u2019s worrisome, because it\u2019s an escalation we did not need,\u201d one executive said, referring to the already tense trade talks between the two countries. \u201cWhat China will do, given all the existing tensions, is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201dNo one I spoke to would talk on the record, out of fear of antagonizing either side and also because no one knows exactly what is happening. But many expressed worry about the possibility of tit-for-tat arrests. While everyone focuses on the drama of the arrest \u2014 Ms. Meng was grabbed while changing planes at the airport \u2014 and its effect on the trade talks and stock prices, to my mind there is a much more important fight brewing, and it is about tech hegemony. Specifically, who will control the next internet age, and by whose rules will it be run?Until recently, that answer was clearly the United States, from which the Internet sprang, wiring the world together and, in the process, resulting in the greatest creation of power and wealth in history. While China has always had a strong technology sector, in recent years it has significantly escalated its investment, expertise and innovation, with major support from the government.That hand-in-glove relationship creates obvious issues, and the Trump administration is right to stop pretending that China does not present a threat both from security and innovation perspectives.But the high-profile arrest of Ms. Meng underscored a new and disturbing spiraling in the already complex relationship the tech industry has with China and the Trump administration.The Justice Department had been investigating Huawei on suspicion of having violated sanctions against exporting American technologies to Iran, and the arrest of Ms. Meng appears to be part of that effort. Since Huawei has become a global powerhouse in smartphones and equipment for the mobile networks, it\u2019s no surprise that scrutiny about whose interests it is serving would increase. The company\u2019s founder, and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which had long set off warning bells among American intelligence officials about Huawei\u2019s ties with the Chinese government. All this makes the move against Ms. Meng look like a particularly bold one and a message to China that the United States has come to play. The government has a lot to be concerned about. As critical 5G \u2014 fifth generation \u2014 wireless networks roll out over the world, many are being deployed by Huawei. These are the networks that will usher in the next age of innovation, and the idea of China \u2014 which pretty much exemplifies the surveillance economy \u2014 dominating that age is troubling.But I am perplexed about why the Trump administration has been such an embarrassment when it comes to the kind of actual leadership and vision needed to keep the United States at the forefront of the tech race. Our government\u2019s commitment to investment in what\u2019s coming next is the best counterpart to vigilance against competitors like China. Instead, we are seeing a loud but decidedly empty effort to promote the idea that tech manufacturing should return to the United States (it won\u2019t) and a very weak commitment to bringing qualified tech and science minds into the centers of power (a good pick for the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy has yet to be confirmed after being nominated this year).From where I sit, the sentiment in Silicon Valley seems to be: Good for the government for being tough on Chinese companies when they break the rules \u2014 that rule-breaking having been a longtime complaint of companies like Cisco and Apple. Vigilance is key, of course, but everyone would feel a lot more confident if the government was also focused on investing more in American innovation and if the crackdown looked less chaotic.Which is why you can imagine a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing. And our government should, too.Advertisement"}

Is this the indulgence of an oddball founder, or a better way to run an I.T. company?Epic Systems is a health care services provider with $2.7 billion in annual revenue. Its mathematician chief executive, Judy Faulkner, is a billionaire recluse who hosts P.T. Barnum-esque gatherings for clients. Those clients \u2014 big hospitals and health systems around the United States and more than a dozen overseas markets \u2014 are served by customer-service representatives known as BFFs. Every month, employees are compelled to gather in a subterranean chamber for two-and-a-half-hour staff meetings that have been likened to a megachurch experience.

Yet most people outside of the Madison environs, I\u2019d be confident to say, have never heard of the company.I certainly hadn\u2019t. I cover Wall Street, not health care or technology, and when I came across the privately held Epic this year I was consumed with questions. Who was this publicity-shy yet spectacle-loving C.E.O., and how did her theme-park sensibility coexist with the mundanity of health care billing protocols? Was Epic\u2019s odd culture a magnet for talent and clients, or was it an indulgence that kept the company from growing even bigger? In August, I traveled to Wisconsin to see what this 1,100-acre Midwestern behemoth might be hiding.When I arrived in Epic\u2019s hometown, Verona, two beaming receptionists at the Fairfield Inn tried to offer me something called the \u201cEpic discount.\u201d When I said I couldn\u2019t accept anything of value from the company, they clarified that the special rate was a gesture of gratefulness from the hotel, on account of the huge proportion of guests who come to do business with Epic. It is by far the dominant player in Verona, where the population of 10,600 is comparable to the company\u2019s head count of 9,800.Epic\u2019s headquarters were a short drive away, down a meandering road through countryside dotted with Queen Anne\u2019s lace and farm equipment. I drove past a giant Tin Man, the first indication of the campus\u2019s fairy-tale aesthetic, and into guest parking, in one of the campus\u2019s few aboveground lots.The design theme was childish even by the standards of technology start-ups, where ball pits and scooters are common. I paused at the Cavey Den, a hollowed-out treehouse with stumps for seats and children\u2019s books, then rocked on a rocking horse and ate a cookie from a jar, wondering what time was set aside for naps. There was a long series of clay slabs with handprint impressions from longtime employees, and walls and walls of art sourced from Wisconsin-area artists: a dragon perched in an iron bird cage; expanses of blue and purple stained glass; a clock featuring manicured poodles and Cupid; an old-timey circus ad painted on canvas.The diversions went beyond art. At the Black Dragon cafe, which was next to an informal band-practice area, a sandwich board advertised oatmeal for 75 cents and bacon for $1. Along the Indiana Jones tunnel, decorated with vines and a golden idol, the sound of dripping water and roaring animals played in a constant loop. A conference room named after a Star Wars planet was reached via a rickety swinging bridge. All around me, young workers in shorts and band T-shirts hurried past. (The company\u2019s dress code is that when visitors are on campus, wear clothes.)The next morning, I woke up feeling off: a throat infection I\u2019d been treating with antibiotics seemed to be getting worse. Verona, while long on breweries, day cares, artisanal pizza and jumbo mortgages, lacks an urgent-care clinic, so I drove into nearby west Madison for some attention.The clinic I found was, naturally, running on an Epic system that logged me in, took my information and tracked my health statistics. The nurse\u2019s assistant who saw me had visited Epic during her training, as do many medical professionals who work with its technology as part of their jobs.Once you know what Epic does in health care, you see it everywhere. When I left the urgent-care center, diagnosed with a gnarly case of strep, the summary printout I was given was branded on one corner with Epic\u2019s insignia.The next day, back at company headquarters, I sat in one of the less Montessori-style conference rooms with Steve Dickmann, 72, the chief administrative officer. He became animated when explaining some of the more functional, less fantastical features of the space. \u201cThe whole campus is designed to promote productivity, creativity, comfort,\u201d he said.There was a philosophy behind everything. All employees have offices, because studies show that workers in open floor plans get interrupted frequently. Stairs promote socialization, but buildings can\u2019t be more than three stories, because workers are reluctant to climb more than a flight or two. Every conference room must have windows so that visitors don\u2019t feel hemmed in during days and days of training.The overriding mission, Mr. Dickmann said, was to ensure the safety of patients at facilities that use Epic software. If health care programmers make mistakes, he said, \u201cbad things can happen.\u201dEpic\u2019s coders often leave campus to embed in operating and recovery rooms, where they watch nurses ripping the tops off blood bags and surgeons opening up people\u2019s chest cavities. It\u2019s an experience that young engineers are unlikely to get at, say, Facebook or Snap, working on algorithms that tailor ads to demographic groups or insert rainbow vomit into photographs.Programmers regularly faint at the sight of beating hearts, scalpels and bodily fluids. \u201cThere were people that would pass out in the hallway\u201d of hospitals, said Aaron Webb, who worked at Epic for 10 years as a software developer. He watched \u201chundreds\u201d of surgeries, often with his team in tow, before moving to Seattle, where he now works for a business that matches companies with storage space. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t understand what your users are going through, you\u2019re not going to design a good system.\u201dEpic works its more than 5,000 programmers hard. Middle-of-the-night technical crises, stress-related illness and employees weeping from exhaustion in airport lounges are not uncommon, say former employees. Long hours are expected. One piece of company lore has it that during a construction project, Ms. Faulkner questioned a plan to install motion-activated light switches, noting that employees might be sitting still at their desks for such long stretches that they\u2019d frequently find themselves in the dark. (The sensors were installed, and she was proved correct.)This combination of chaotic, stressful client visits and isolating, mundane office work might explain the company\u2019s Disney dimension. Epic is a place where wedding music plays on a campuswide public-announcement system when new clients are signed. Dry-cleaning services are found at the \u201cNew York Sock Exchange.\u201d Employees can hurtle down an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d slide into a room with miniature furniture. They are encouraged to visit a conference room encased by waterfalls and a shark pond when in need of inspiration. (The shark is fake.) Internal awards for outstanding work are named after Jack Bauer and MacGyver.A few hours after my sit-down with Mr. Dickmann, I was granted an audience with Ms. Faulkner herself. We met in her personal conference room, a place of warm earth tones, steaming hot tea and personal memorabilia, including a copy of the prayer \u201cDesiderata\u201d with faux-burned margins mounted on a wall. \u201cI think we save many, many, many lives a year,\u201d she told me.Born in 1943, Ms. Faulkner said she taught herself to code in a week, using a Fortran textbook, during her undergraduate years at Dickinson College. As a graduate student in computer science at the University of Wisconsin, she conceived a prototype for Epic while sitting in her living room one day in the mid-1970s.\u201cThe sun was shining, I was disattentive, I was just sitting there and suddenly it all came to me: Here\u2019s how you build it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I remember running into the kitchen, grabbing a pad of paper and just writing code, code, code, code,\u201d she said. While she went on to teach computer science for a period, she kept coming back to the idea, and in 1979, in a Madison basement, she founded what would become Epic: a start-up called Human Services Computing. Today, some of Epic\u2019s foundational programming still bears Ms. Faulkner\u2019s initials.Ms. Faulkner is now 75, and over the last four years, the company she built has grown an average of 14 percent a year, according to revenue figures it shared with The Times. She has instructed her heirs (she has three children) and stock-holding employees, who together constitute a majority of the company\u2019s equity holders, that they must always vote their shares in favor of keeping Epic private. They must also ensure that Epic is run by an executive who already works for the company, and that that person is a software developer.That decision-making may not occur for a while. It\u2019s \u201cmore likely that I\u2019d die than that I\u2019d retire,\u201d she said.\u201cI look at our financial information maybe for a minute a month,\u201d she said.One criticism that has dogged Epic is that its software sometimes won\u2019t connect with that of competitors, meaning that patient information can\u2019t move around as seamlessly as it should. The company has chipped away at the problem in recent years, but much remains to be done.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the lack of effort, it\u2019s the lack of standards,\u201d said Jim Turnbull, the chief information officer for the University of Utah system and a longtime Epic client. \u201cUntil the federal government and all the vendors recognize that we have too many standards, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be possible to completely interoperate,\u201d he said, using the industry term for connectivity.The day after meeting with Ms. Faulkner, I took a final tour of Epic with its head of media relations, Meghan Roh, who was hired in 2017 as the first person ever to occupy that position. We went down a slide connecting the ground floor of a building called Heaven, with a white interior, to a lower level with an elevator whose floors were marked Devil, Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub and Mephistopheles. (When you press a button, you hear audio of an imaginary demon saying, \u201cPlease come in. It\u2019s nice and toasty in here.\u201d)Underground is also where you\u2019ll find Epic\u2019s auditorium. Built partly to preserve the sightlines on campus and minimize water and waste runoff, the gathering place hosts the Verona high school\u2019s annual graduation ceremony as well as Epic\u2019s monthly staff meetings, at which attendance is required. On the way in, employees are served popcorn and coffee, an homage to an earlier point when the company used movie theaters for large meetings, and shown a reel of pictures of recent staff weddings, newborn babies and beloved pets. Then they hear presentations on new products and priorities, matters of company philosophy, and new \u201carmies\u201d being formed for employees to brainstorm software-based solutions to epidemics like the opioid crisis and maternal morbidity.Workers who fully commit to Epic \u2014 who survive the long hours and grisly sights \u2014 are treated to a remarkable perk. After five years, they get a sabbatical, including round-trip airfare for two to travel somewhere they\u2019ve never been for a month, plus a per diem for meals and lodging. (They get another sabbatical after 10 years, 15, and so on.)Epic is constantly scanning the undergraduate ranks for new hires. Rather than sticking to engineer incubator schools like M.I.T. or Stanford, it scouts institutions like Carleton College in Minnesota and Clemson University in South Carolina. Candidates take online tests to gauge their problem-solving skills and, if they pass muster, are whisked to Madison for an on-campus interview and tour of the area.Once on board, employees take a multiweek training course that includes basic business etiquette as well as Epic-specific skill building. Officials preach a flat structure in which it\u2019s never O.K. to turn down colleagues for help. They also teach a tactic called \u201cbadgering\u201d \u2014 remember, it\u2019s Wisconsin \u2014 or the art of being persistent but not maddening.Epic\u2019s broad recruiting strategy and perks help draw people in, but over time, it\u2019s the cultures of both Wisconsin and Epic that help keep people there.\u201cThe only reason I left Epic was so that my family could move out West,\u201d said Mr. Webb, the former Epic programmer. \u201cEvery day was different. And it was fun. And just being able to go see the impact you were having, that was really, really cool.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how patients' medical records are handled. They are accessed by software that runs on Epic servers; they are not stored on Epic servers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seattle Is Awarded an N.H.L. Expansion Team", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe National Hockey League\u2019s board of governors has unanimously approved a new franchise in Seattle, putting the league\u2019s 32nd team in one of the country\u2019s wealthiest and fastest-growing cities.Commissioner Gary Bettman said after the vote that the new franchise had the \u201cthree pillars\u201d for success in the league: \u201cTerrific and committed ownership, a thriving market and a state of the art venue.\u201dThe team hoped to start play one season earlier, but Bettman said \u201cthe certainty over the construction timeline, or the lack of certainty, led us to believe that making the start of the 2021 season would be speculative at best and unlikely at worst.\u201dSeattle adds another team to the Western Conference, which will now have the same number of clubs \u2014 16 \u2014 as the Eastern Conference. Seattle\u2019s team also will have an instant rivalry with the Vancouver Canucks, who play about three hours by car to the north. To make room for Seattle, the Arizona Coyotes will move from the Pacific Division to the Central Division.Investors in Seattle had sought a new N.B.A. team to replace the SuperSonics, who moved to Oklahoma City after the 2008 season. Plans to build a new arena in Seattle fell apart repeatedly. Instead, the city landed a hockey team in part because its City Council in September approved a $700 million plan to refurbish KeyArena, just north of downtown.Tod Leiweke, the team\u2019s president, said the team would break ground on the arena, which will have 17,000 seats, on Wednesday.\u201cIt will be one of the finest arenas in the world,\u201d he said.Enthusiasm is running high. Well before the league made clear it would put a team in Seattle, more than 33,000 fans placed deposits for season tickets, leading the ownership group to create a waiting list.The effort to get an N.H.L. team has gone on several years, though the league insisted Seattle would not be considered until it had a viable arena.The N.H.L. is attracted to Seattle\u2019s growing stature. The region is home to corporate giants like Amazon and Microsoft, and the Pacific Northwest is a relatively untapped area for the N.H.L.The Seattle Metropolitans, founded by Frank and Lester Patrick, played in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. At the time, the winner of the P.C.H.A. played the winner of the National Hockey Association, the precursor to the N.H.L., for the Stanley Cup. In 1917, the Metropolitans beat the Montreal Canadiens in a best-of-five series.The Metropolitans again played for the Cup in 1919 and 1920 before folding in 1924.Since then, Seattle has had multiple minor league and junior hockey teams, including the Thunderbirds of Western Hockey League, who play in Kent, Wash.Seattle was awarded an N.H.L. franchise in 1974, but the offer was rescinded because the ownership group ran into financial troubles. Another bid fell through in 1990.Now that the N.H.L. has awarded Seattle a team, the ownership group must start work on the redevelopment of the arena, open a practice facility and hire front-office employees and a coach. A team nickname must be chosen, and tickets sold.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take our time,\u201d Tod Leiweke said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to listen to our fans and do it right.\u201dThe league will hold an expansion draft in June 2021, and the rules will be the same as those for the draft for the Vegas Golden Knights. The Knights will not lose a player in the upcoming expansion draft.Bettman said Tuesday that \u201cwe\u2019re not looking right now and I think for the foreseeable future any further at any further expansion.\u201d That could keep Quebec City, which has been angling for a team, out of the league, at least for now.Victor Mather contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hiring People With Disabilities Is Good Business", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydisabilityMicrosoft, Bank of America and CVS are just a few big companies that profit from their proactive employment practices. Mr. Kennedy is a disability rights lawyer and a state senator in Connecticut. For years, companies have maintained low expectations about hiring people with disabilities. Most of these companies believed that employees with disabilities could not perform well in the workplace and that actively hiring them would drag company performance and profits down. Thankfully, over time, many employers have come to understand that these perceptions are untrue. And new research strongly suggests that the opposite \u2014 that hiring people with disabilities is good for business. A recent study has shown, for the first time, that companies that championed people with disabilities actually outperformed others \u2014 driving profitability and shareholder returns. Revenues were 28 percent higher, net income 200 percent higher, and profit margins 30 percent higher. Companies that improved internal practices for disability inclusion were also four times more likely to see higher total shareholder returns.What exactly are these exemplary companies doing?Well, Bank of America brought together 300 people with intellectual disabilities to create a support services team to manage fulfillment services and external client engagement. Microsoft built a successful disability hiring program specifically for people on the autism spectrum. The program, designed to attract talent, is a multiday, hands-on academy that gives candidates an opportunity to meet hiring managers and learn about the company as an employer of choice. And CVS Health refocused its training programs to capitalize on characteristics \u2014 creativity, problem-solving ability and loyalty \u2014 that people with disabilities often demonstrate.The new research identifies five common denominators among such organizations. First, they hire people with disabilities, ensuring that they\u2019re represented in the workplace. Second, they carry out practices that encourage and advance those employees. Third, they provide accessible tools and technologies, paired with a formal accommodations program. Fourth, they generate awareness through recruitment efforts, disability education programs and grass-roots-led initiatives. Fifth, they create empowering environments through mentoring and coaching initiatives.I lost my leg to bone cancer at age 12. Since then, I have fought, as a citizen, attorney and legislator, for the civil rights of people with disabilities. All of us deserve to be valued equally and provided the opportunity to participate fully in our society.I was brought up in the disability rights movement. My uncle, President John F. Kennedy, left an important legacy on this front. Influenced by his experiences with his sister, Rosemary, President Kennedy witnessed firsthand how differently she was treated \u2014 how often she was ignored and excluded. He became the first president to make equality and social justice for people with disabilities a priority for his administration.The last law that he signed before he died was the Community Mental Health Act, which called for an end to \u201ccustodial isolation\u201d and created America\u2019s network of community mental health centers. Congress has since passed more than 120 laws expanding disability rights, forever changing public attitudes.But it was only when I went to college in the 1970s that I came of age politically and really thought about the issue of disability rights. It happened after I heard Judith Heumann, a disability rights advocate who contracted polio as an infant, give a speech and call disability a civil rights issue. I\u2019d never heard that comparison before. I realized that millions of disabled people were unjustly being left out of daily life. Ms. Heumann inspired me to become an advocate myself.I committed myself to this cause because of people like Joseph Pabin. He graduated from college with a degree in computer science and a 3.5 grade point average, an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that easily got him in the door for job interviews. But once he showed up, interviewers noticed his speech impediment and told him they doubted he could successfully interact with customers. Mr. Pabin looked for a full-time job for three years without finding one, and his self-esteem plummeted. Ultimately, he contacted Bender Consulting Services, a career placement company that recruits, screens and hires people with disabilities for professional positions with private sector and government employers. Highmark offered him a full-time position in information technology. He has thrived at the company, working directly with customers, for four years now.As we head into the new year, it\u2019s important to recognize how far we\u2019ve come. Twenty-eight years ago, the Americans With Disabilities Act was passed, prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities. I still remember standing alongside my father in the Rose Garden watching President George H.W. Bush sign the bill into law, forever engraving it into his legacy.But when it comes to employment, a cornerstone of the American dream, we have failed to live up to the promise of this historic law. Many employers have yet to recognize that people with disabilities can contribute economically if sought out and accommodated. Americans with disabilities \u2014 a population of 50 million people, more than one in every five \u2014 still face numerous challenges in entering and participating in the work force.The United States labor market is at its strongest in decades, and possibly ever. But all too many people with disabilities remain without jobs. The Accenture analysis reveals this inspiring statistic: Hiring only 1 percent of the 10.7 million people with disabilities has the potential to boost the G.D.P. by an estimated $25 billion.As a New Year\u2019s resolution for corporate America, it\u2019s hard to do better than to pledge to hire people with disabilities. Yes, we can do it because it always feels good to do what\u2019s right. But now it turns out that reaching this next frontier for corporate social responsibility is also good business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall St. Tumbles, Bothered by the Fed and Government Shutdown Fears", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks tumbled yet again on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve pushed forward with another interest-rate increase and offered few signs that it would sharply slow the pace of monetary tightening as many had hoped.The S&P 500-stock index declined 1.6 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial index fell 2 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.6 percent, pushing it 19.5 percent below its late-August peak. A decline of 20 percent marks the start of a bear market.On its own, the broader S&P 500 is down more than 15 percent from its peak, close to entering a bear market and ending the long bull rally that began in early 2009.\u201cThere\u2019s just a constant selling pressure,\u201d said Paul Hickey, a founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, a financial market research firm in Harrison, N.Y. \u201cIt\u2019s just any excuse is an excuse to sell.\u201dOn Thursday, investors had their pick of excuses.Tensions between the United States and China flared as the Justice Department unveiled new indictments of Chinese nationals accused of hacking government and corporate targets on behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies.Shares of technology companies, increasingly the epicenter of the confrontation between China and the United States over trade, security and technology, fell sharply. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft were all down more than 2 percent.Elsewhere, President Trump again raised the specter of a federal government shutdown if he didn\u2019t receive funding for his promised border wall.And crude oil extended its slump, sending energy stocks sharply lower. The S&P energy sector led the declines in the S&P 500, with the energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron dropping 3.1 percent and 2.7 percent.American benchmark crude oil prices tumbled 4 percent more, pushing the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude to nearly $46 a barrel.Initially, the sharp slump in crude oil prices \u2014 they\u2019re down more than 23 percent this year \u2014 was seen as a result of a global supply glut that was expected to be transitory. But as the sell-off has persisted, the decline has raised questions among investors about the strength of global demand and economic health.\u201cWhen prices move in a sustained way it\u2019s telling you something about demand,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, an economic consulting firm.Asian markets followed Wall Street lower in Friday morning trading, with Japan\u2019s 1.8 percent drop leading the way. Futures markets, however, suggested Wall Street could open higher on Friday.The global economy does appear to be slowing. Official figures in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, show it is growing at its slowest pace in a decade. The world\u2019s No. 3 and 4 economies, Japan and Germany, both contracted during the third quarter.At the same time, the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States, had one of its strongest years of economic growth since 2005. That was due in part to a jolt of fiscal stimulus in the form of a deep cut to corporate tax rates.But for financial markets, the books are already closed on 2018. And asset prices are painting a much more dour picture of the economic outlook.The S&P 500 is now down nearly 16 percent from its Sept. 20 peak, as investors have grown increasingly uncertain about the outlook for the economy and corporate profits.Many had hoped that the right mutterings from the Federal Reserve as part of Wednesday\u2019s decision on interest rates could offer a lifeline to a market rally that began in the economic wreckage of the financial crisis in March 2009.By some measures, that bull market is the longest on record, having pulled the stock market up more than 250 percent.\u201cEverything points to the Fed needing to stop,\u201d said Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at the brokerage and investment banking firm Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. \u201cAnd until they do, it\u2019s kind of hard to put a floor under stocks.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Facebook Raised a Privacy Wall, It Carved an Opening for Tech Giants", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "Internal documents show that the social network gave Microsoft, Amazon, Spotify and others far greater access to people\u2019s data than it has disclosed.Supported byFor years, Facebook gave some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies more intrusive access to users\u2019 personal data than it has disclosed, effectively exempting those business partners from its usual privacy rules, according to internal records and interviews.The special arrangements are detailed in hundreds of pages of Facebook documents obtained by The New York Times. The records, generated in 2017 by the company\u2019s internal system for tracking partnerships, provide the most complete picture yet of the social network\u2019s data-sharing practices. They also underscore how personal data has become the most prized commodity of the digital age, traded on a vast scale by some of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley and beyond.The exchange was intended to benefit everyone. Pushing for explosive growth, Facebook got more users, lifting its advertising revenue. Partner companies acquired features to make their products more attractive. Facebook users connected with friends across different devices and websites. But Facebook also assumed extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2 billion users \u2014 control it has wielded with little transparency or outside oversight.Facebook allowed Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users\u2019 friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users\u2019 private messages.The social network permitted Amazon to obtain users\u2019 names and contact information through their friends, and it let Yahoo view streams of friends\u2019 posts as recently as this summer, despite public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years earlier.But the documents, as well as interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its corporate partners, reveal that Facebook allowed certain companies access to data despite those protections. They also raise questions about whether Facebook ran afoul of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred the social network from sharing user data without explicit permission.In all, the deals described in the documents benefited more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, including online retailers and entertainment sites, but also automakers and media organizations. Their applications sought the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, the records show. The deals, the oldest of which date to 2010, were all active in 2017. Some were still in effect this year.In an interview, Steve Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s director of privacy and public policy, said none of the partnerships violated users\u2019 privacy or the F.T.C. agreement. Contracts required the companies to abide by Facebook policies, he added.Still, Facebook executives have acknowledged missteps over the past year. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201d He said that the partnerships were \u201cone area of focus\u201d and that Facebook was in the process of winding many of them down.Facebook has found no evidence of abuse by its partners, a spokeswoman said. Some of the largest partners, including Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo, said they had used the data appropriately, but declined to discuss the sharing deals in detail. Facebook did say that it had mismanaged some of its partnerships, allowing certain companies\u2019 access to continue long after they had shut down the features that required the data.Data privacy experts disputed Facebook\u2019s assertion that most partnerships were exempted from the regulatory requirements, expressing skepticism that businesses as varied as device makers, retailers and search companies would be viewed alike by the agency. \u201cThe only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth into an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist at the F.T.C.Mr. Soltani and three former employees of the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection division, which brought the case that led to the consent decree, said in interviews that its data-sharing deals had probably violated the agreement.\u201cThis is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u201d said David Vladeck, who formerly ran the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u201dFacebook\u2019s stock price has fallen, and a group of shareholders has called for Mr. Zuckerberg to step aside as chairman. Shareholders also have filed a lawsuit alleging that executives failed to impose effective privacy safeguards. Angry users started a #DeleteFacebook movement.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is legitimate to enter into data-sharing partnerships where there is not prior informed consent from the user,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook. \u201cNo one should trust Facebook until they change their business model.\u201dPersonal data is the oil of the 21st century, a resource worth billions to those who can most effectively extract and refine it. American companies alone are expected to spend close to $20 billion by the end of 2018 to acquire and process consumer data, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Few companies have better data than Facebook and its rival, Google, whose popular products give them an intimate view into the daily lives of billions of people \u2014 and allow them to dominate the digital advertising market.Facebook has never sold its user data, fearful of user backlash and wary of handing would-be competitors a way to duplicate its most prized asset. Instead, internal documents show, it did the next best thing: granting other companies access to parts of the social network in ways that advanced its own interests.Facebook began forming data partnerships when it was still a relatively young company. Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to weave Facebook\u2019s services into other sites and platforms, believing it would stave off obsolescence and insulate Facebook from competition. Every corporate partner that integrated Facebook data into its online products helped drive the platform\u2019s expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue. At the same time, Facebook got critical data back from its partners.The partnerships were so important that decisions about forming them were vetted at high levels, sometimes by Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, Facebook officials said. While many of the partnerships were announced publicly, the details of the sharing arrangements typically were confidential.By 2013, Facebook had entered into more such partnerships than its midlevel employees could easily track, according to interviews with two former employees. (Like the more than 30 other former employees interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or still maintained relationships with top Facebook officials.)So they built a tool that did the technical work of turning special access on and off and also kept records on what are known internally as \u201ccapabilities\u201d \u2014 the special privileges enabling companies to obtain data, in some cases without asking permission.The Times reviewed more than 270 pages of reports generated by the system \u2014 records that reflect just a portion of Facebook\u2019s wide-ranging deals. Among the revelations was that Facebook obtained data from multiple partners for a controversial friend-suggestion tool called \u201cPeople You May Know.\u201dFacebook, in turn, used contact lists from the partners, including Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei \u2014 which has been flagged as a security threat by American intelligence officials \u2014 to gain deeper insight into people\u2019s relationships and suggest more connections, the records show.Some of the access deals described in the documents were limited to sharing non-identifying information with research firms or enabling game makers to accommodate huge numbers of players. These raised no privacy concerns. But agreements with about a dozen companies did. Some enabled partners to see users\u2019 contact information through their friends \u2014 even after the social network, responding to complaints, said in 2014 that it was stripping all applications of that power.As of 2017, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon and others could obtain users\u2019 email addresses through their friends.Facebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users\u2019 private messages, and to see all participants on a thread \u2014 privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems, the records show. Facebook acknowledged that it did not consider any of those three companies to be service providers. Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix said those companies were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them. A spokesman for Netflix said Wednesday that it had used the access only to enable customers to recommend TV shows and movies to their friends.\u201cBeyond these recommendations, we never accessed anyone\u2019s personal messages and would never do that,\u201d he said.Spotify, which could view messages of more than 70 million users a month, still offers the option to share music through Facebook Messenger. But Netflix and the Canadian bank no longer needed access to messages because they had deactivated features that incorporated it.These were not the only companies that had special access longer than they needed it. Yahoo, The Times and others could still get Facebook users\u2019 personal information in 2017.Yahoo could view real-time feeds of friends\u2019 posts for a feature that the company had ended in 2012. A Yahoo spokesman declined to discuss the partnership in detail but said the company did not use the information for advertising. The Times \u2014 one of nine media companies named in the documents \u2014 had access to users\u2019 friend lists for an article-sharing application it had discontinued in 2011. A spokeswoman for the news organization said it was not obtaining any data.Facebook empowered Apple to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were asking for data. Apple devices also had access to the contact numbers and calendar entries of people who had changed their account settings to disable all sharing, the records show.Apple officials said they were not aware that Facebook had granted its devices any special access. They added that any shared data remained on the devices and was not available to anyone other than the users.Facebook officials said the company had disclosed its sharing deals in its privacy policy since 2010. But the language in the policy about its service providers does not specify what data Facebook shares, and with which companies. Mr. Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s privacy director, also said its partners were subject to \u201crigorous controls.\u201dPam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit privacy research group, said that Facebook would have little power over what happens to users\u2019 information after sharing it broadly. \u201cIt travels,\u201d Ms. Dixon said. \u201cIt could be customized. It could be fed into an algorithm and decisions could be made about you based on that data.\u201dBesides Facebook, the F.T.C. has consent agreements with Google and Twitter stemming from alleged privacy violations.Facebook\u2019s agreement with regulators is a result of the company\u2019s early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, it changed the privacy settings of the 400 million people then using the service, making some of their information accessible to all of the internet. Then it shared that information, including users\u2019 locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.Facebook called this \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.The F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.Under the decree, the social network introduced a \u201ccomprehensive privacy program\u201d charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.But the privacy program faced some internal resistance from the start, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s efforts. Some engineers and executives, they said, considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews \u2014 numbering about a dozen people by 2016 \u2014 was moved around within Facebook\u2019s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.Critically, many of Facebook\u2019s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.Facebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \u201cdepended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\u201dIn 2014, Facebook ended instant personalization and walled off access to friends\u2019 information. But in a previously unreported agreement, the social network\u2019s engineers continued allowing Bing; Pandora, the music streaming service; and Rotten Tomatoes, the movie and television review site, access to much of the data they had gotten for the discontinued feature. Bing had access to the information through last year, the records show, and the two other companies did as of late summer, according to tests by The Times.Facebook officials said the data sharing did not violate users\u2019 privacy because it allowed access only to public data \u2014 though that included data that the social network had made public in 2009. They added that the social network made a mistake in allowing the access to continue for the three companies, but declined to elaborate. Spokeswomen for Pandora and Rotten Tomatoes said the businesses were not aware of any special access.Facebook also declined to discuss the other capabilities Bing was given, including the ability to see all users\u2019 friends.Microsoft officials said that Bing was using the data to build profiles of Facebook users on Microsoft servers. They declined to provide details, other than to say the information was used in \u201cfeature development\u201d and not for advertising. Microsoft has since deleted the data, the officials said.For some advocates, the torrent of user data flowing out of Facebook has called into question not only Facebook\u2019s compliance with the F.T.C. agreement, but also the agency\u2019s approach to privacy regulation.\u201cThere has been an endless barrage of how Facebook has ignored users\u2019 privacy settings, and we truly believed that in 2011 we had solved this problem,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an online privacy group that filed one of the first complaints about Facebook with federal regulators. \u201cWe brought Facebook under the regulatory authority of the F.T.C. after a tremendous amount of work. The F.T.C. has failed to act.\u201dAccording to Facebook, most of its data partnerships fall under an exemption to the F.T.C. agreement. The company argues that the partner companies are service providers \u2014 companies that use the data only \u201cfor and at the direction of\u201d Facebook and function as an extension of the social network.But Mr. Vladeck and other former F.T.C. officials said that Facebook was interpreting the exemption too broadly. They said the provision was intended to allow Facebook to perform the same everyday functions as other companies, such as sending and receiving information over the internet or processing credit card transactions, without violating the consent decree.When The Times reported last summer on the partnerships with device makers, Facebook used the term \u201cintegration partners\u201d to describe BlackBerry, Huawei and other manufacturers that pulled Facebook data to provide social-media-style features on smartphones. All such integration partners, Facebook asserted, were covered by the service provider exemption.Since then, as the social network has disclosed its data sharing deals with other kinds of businesses \u2014 including internet companies such as Yahoo \u2014 Facebook has labeled them integration partners, too.Facebook even recategorized one company, the Russian search giant Yandex, as an integration partner.Facebook records show Yandex had access in 2017 to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs even after the social network stopped sharing them with other applications, citing privacy risks. A spokeswoman for Yandex, which was accused last year by Ukraine\u2019s security service of funneling its user data to the Kremlin, said the company was unaware of the access and did not know why Facebook had allowed it to continue. She added that the Ukrainian allegations \u201chave no merit.\u201dIn October, Facebook said Yandex was not an integration partner. But in early December, as The Times was preparing to publish this article, Facebook told congressional lawmakers that it was.An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the commission agreed with Facebook\u2019s interpretation of the service provider exception, which is likely to figure in the F.T.C.\u2019s ongoing Facebook investigation. She also declined to say whether the commission had ever received a complete list of partners that Facebook considered service providers.The first assessment, sent to the F.T.C. in 2013, found only \u201climited\u201d evidence that Facebook had monitored those partners\u2019 use of data. The finding was redacted from a public copy of the assessment, which gave Facebook\u2019s privacy program a passing grade over all.Mr. Wyden and other critics have questioned whether the assessments \u2014 in which the F.T.C. essentially outsources much of its day-to-day oversight to companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2014 are effective. As with other businesses under consent agreements with the F.T.C., Facebook pays for and largely dictated the scope of its assessments, which are limited mostly to documenting that Facebook has conducted the internal privacy reviews it claims it had.How closely Facebook monitored its data partners is uncertain. Most of Facebook\u2019s partners declined to discuss what kind of reviews or audits Facebook subjected them to. Two former Facebook partners, whose deals with the social network dated to 2010, said they could find no evidence that Facebook had ever audited them. One was BlackBerry. The other was Yandex.Facebook officials said that while the social network audited partners only rarely, it managed them closely.\u201cThese were high-touch relationships,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Yahoo ended a feature on its website that incorporated Facebook user data. The feature was discontinued in 2012, not 2011.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting. Research was contributed by Grace Ashford, Susan C.

Washington Responded.", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYe Jianming courted the Biden family and networked with former United States security officials. Today, his empire is crashing down in court.He struck billions of dollars\u2019 worth of deals in Russia, Eastern Europe and Africa. He sought business with war-torn places like Chad and with international pariahs like North Korea.Ye Jianming, a fast-rising Chinese oil tycoon, ventured to places only the most politically connected Chinese companies dared to go. But what he wanted was access to the corridors of power in Washington \u2014 and he set out to get it.China\u2019s rise in political power and wealth has created a new generation of business tycoons whose clout and cash can open doors. Former Washington officials, many with access to the White House and to American military and intelligence institutions, have proven to be eager to help.But the fall of Ye Jianming shows that China\u2019s lack of openness can make it difficult to know who, exactly, is sitting on the Chinese side of the table. On the American side, some don\u2019t ask enough questions \u2014 or never asked any at all. It\u2019s a relationship that is all the more fraught given the trade tensions between the two countries, which were recently heightened by the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive on the request of American prosecutors.Many who met Mr. Ye believed he was the grandson of a famous Chinese military leader; people in his hometown say he comes from a family of boatmen. Many believed he had access to untold wealth; now, it appears his empire was built on a mountain of debt. Many believed his company must have deep connections and business savvy to be so successful; the Chinese state news media have accused him of bribery.\u201cIn China, if you can provide proof of association with a high-level official, you are assumed to be powerful,\u201d said Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China.Mr. Ye grew up in a city called Jian\u2019ou, a poor but lush region of bamboo groves and rice plantations in the southern province of Fujian. A three-tiered, newly refurbished shrine to the Ye family stands among plain concrete buildings and more dilapidated wooden houses. His father and grandfather ferried people and goods along the region\u2019s inland waterways, locals said. Mr. Ye worked a series of odd jobs before buying a small piston factory that supplied the military, his introduction to the People\u2019s Liberation Army.As the company prospered, Mr. Ye moved its headquarters to Shanghai, where he built a corporate campus modeled on Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party\u2019s leadership compound in Beijing. Adorned with Chinese art, calligraphy and stately furniture, the company\u2019s campus was dotted with villas for executives and a building to host officials and foreign dignitaries.\u201cHe had this aura of being a rich investor, and he built up his social network,\u201d said Martin Hala, an academic based in Prague who tracked the company\u2019s networking efforts in the Czech Republic. \u201cIt\u2019s been clear for some time that this is not just a Chinese commercial company, that they had some intelligence ties,\u201d Mr. Hala added. \u201cPeople from the U.S. intelligence agencies should have known something was going on.\u201dYe Jianming\u2019s early efforts to break into the Washington power broker scene didn\u2019t always pan out.Later, Mr. Inman said, CEFC officials called him and said they were considering acquiring oil fields in Syria. Could he help them persuade the American military not to bomb them? Again, he said no.\u201cThey were looking to do business deals in the energy space and they were looking for connections to help them do that,\u201d said Mr. Inman, who said he kept American officials apprised of his communications with CEFC. To build influence, Mr. Ye turned to Vuk Jeremic, a Serbian diplomat and former president of the United Nations General Assembly whom CEFC hired as a consultant, and Mr. Ho, a former Hong Kong official. CEFC also donated at least $350,000 to the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, a politically connected think tank, according to court testimony. The think tank counts Robert C. McFarlane, the Reagan-era national security adviser, as its president and Mr. Woolsey, a Clinton-era C.I.A. director, as its co-chairman. In an emailed statement, Mr. McFarlane said his encounters with CEFC were related to research on American dependence on foreign oil. \u201cI have never had any organic or contractual relationship with CEFC,\u201d he said. Mr. Woolsey didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs said in a statement that it \u201chas had no contact with CEFC or any of its officials for more than a year, nor have we accepted further contributions.\u201dCEFC also organized forums in Hong Kong and Washington that brought together retired American and Chinese military officers, among other events. All the while it continued to network.\u201cThey kept coming back and saying, \u2018Can we organize contacts?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pyntikov said.It is unclear whether Hunter Biden struck any business deals with CEFC or Mr. Ye. Through his attorney, Hunter Biden declined to comment.CEFC also tried to bring prominent Republicans into its orbit in anticipation that they might take control of the White House after the 2016 election. In a 2014 memo after the November midterm elections that year, CEFC outlined a plan for reaching out to top Republicans and politically connected people. The company should begin making that outreach \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d it said, in order to form a \u201crelationship and friend base.\u201dJames Biden, a financier and brother of the former vice president, was in a hotel lobby in November 2017 when he got a surprise call on his cellphone. The call was from Patrick Ho, Mr. Ye\u2019s lieutenant. Mr. Ho, 69, was in trouble.Mr. Ye has not been charged with wrongdoing in the United States, but the legal actions there began a series of events that led to his downfall. They have also changed the narrative of Mr. Ye and CEFC, as court documents and other new information portray a bumbling company with much less political heft than it appeared.During Mr. Ho\u2019s trial, federal prosecutors said that he bribed officials in Chad and Uganda and tried to make CEFC a middleman with Iran to avoid oil sanctions. They also said CEFC was involved in the unseemly business of attempting to deal arms in conflict zones. Prosecutors said some of the meetings to further the bribery schemes took place in a $5 million apartment CEFC had bought on the 78th floor of the Trump World Tower at United Nations Plaza.David Zornow, one of CEFC\u2019s lawyers at Skadden Arps in New York, declined to comment. Edward Kim, a lawyer for Mr. Ho, declined to comment.Mr. Ye\u2019s problems could get still worse. In October, China Central Television, the official government broadcaster, accused Mr. Ye of bribing a provincial party boss to help CEFC secure the money to make bigger and more high-profile deals.In Washington, many of Mr. Ye\u2019s new acquaintances ultimately came to naught.In a brief interview, James Biden said he had been surprised by Mr. Ho\u2019s call. He said he believed it had been meant for Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son. James Biden said he had passed on his nephew\u2019s contact information. \u201cThere is nothing else I have to say,\u201d James Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be dragged into this anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Oil Industry\u2019s Covert Campaign to Rewrite American Car Emissions Rules", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it turns out that there was a hidden beneficiary of the plan that was pushing for the changes all along: the nation\u2019s oil industry.The campaign\u2019s main argument for significantly easing fuel efficiency standards \u2014 that the United States is so awash in oil it no longer needs to worry about energy conservation \u2014 clashed with decades of federal energy and environmental policy.The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world\u2019s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales.Gary R. Heminger, Marathon\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the company supported \u201csound fuel economy standards\u201d and wanted to \u201chelp ensure they are achievable and based on existing technology.\u201d He added, \u201cWe appreciate the administration\u2019s willingness to conduct a thorough review in order to ensure future standards are achievable and will actually benefit American consumers.\u201dA spokesman for Koch Industries, the energy conglomerate led by Mr. Koch, said the company had \u201ca long, consistent track record of opposing all forms of corporate welfare, including all subsidies, mandates and other handouts that rig the system.\u201dThe standards that the Trump administration seeks to weaken required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of new cars, SUVs and pickup trucks by 2025. Instead, the Trump plan would freeze the standards at 2020 levels. Carmakers, for their part, had sought more flexibility in meeting the original 2025 standards, not a categorical rollback.The energy industry\u2019s efforts also help explain the Trump administration\u2019s confrontational stance toward California, which, under federal law, has a unique authority to write its own clean-air rules and to mandate more zero-emissions vehicles.California has pledged to stick to the stricter standards, together with 13 other states that follow its lead. But President Trump\u2019s plan challenges California\u2019s rule-writing power, setting up a legal battle that threatens to split the American auto market in two. \u201cHowever, you have another side who doesn\u2019t want to pivot away\u201d from the stricter rules, Mr. Heminger said. \u201cSo we have a lot of work to do to keep this momentum going.\u201d\u201cOur CEO, Gary Heminger, would be very glad for an opportunity to visit with the Administrator,\u201d a Marathon lobbyist wrote in an email to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team on May 8, 2017. \u201cI believe this would be a constructive dialogue.\u201d The E.P.A. helps oversee fuel economy rules along with the Transportation Department.A Marathon spokesman, Chuck Rice, said Mr. Heminger did not discuss auto-efficiency rollbacks with Mr. Pruitt. An E.P.A. official did not respond to a question about whether the auto rules were discussed.Mr. Rice of Marathon said the company did not write the letter, and the company declined to say who did. It did not offer an explanation for Mr. Birsic\u2019s digital fingerprint on the document file.Representatives from the three state delegations either declined to comment or did not respond to requests. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, criticized the industry\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt appears as though oil interests are cynically trying to gin up support in Congress for the weakest possible standards to ensure that cars and SUVs have to rely on even more oil,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this attempt is successful, the outcome will be a blow to the auto industry, consumers, and our environment.\u201dMore than 3,300 of the 12,000 public comments that D.O.T. has made public contain language identical to that petition, an analysis of the files showed.Derrick Morgan, a senior vice president at AFPM, said the group \u201cregularly works with policymakers, coalition groups and individuals to promote shared goals,\u201d and also will \u201clead and join groups like Energy4US.\u201dThe Department of Transportation said it was \u201cgenerally aware\u201d that there were groups urging the public to make comments through online campaigns, but said it does not regulate them.In Dearborn, Mich., at a September meeting on the Trump fuel-efficiency rollbacks, Annie Patnaude of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-funded group, spoke in favor. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction to protect consumers and workers against government mandates that would limit choice,\u201d she said. But Americans for Prosperity said fights like these get to the heart of its free-market philosophy. \u201cWe believe in a level playing field so all Americans have the equal opportunity to succeed,\u201d said Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the group, in a statement. The organization will keep fighting \u201cmandates that unfairly pick winners and losers in any industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a relic,\u201d the memo said, particularly at a time when the United States was \u201cpoised to become the largest oil producer in the world.\u201d Emails obtained by the Times show that Marathon has been working with members of the legislative exchange council to build support for the Trump fuel-efficiency rollback in state legislatures and to denounce California\u2019s power to write its own rules for cars. The emails were made public under Wisconsin\u2019s open records law to Documented, a watchdog group that tracks corporate influence in public policy. California\u2019s special authority could effectively split the American auto market in two, since 13 other states \u2014 representing roughly 35 percent of nationwide car sales \u2014 have agreed to follow California\u2019s stricter rules. That means automakers might find themselves making cars to two competing standards.\u201cWho should decide what cars and trucks consumers should buy, consumers themselves or unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento, California or Washington, D.C.?\u201d the memo sent by Marathon said.In a statement, Bill Meierling of the legislative exchange council said that mandating fuel economy was a rule that \u201cmany state legislators believe doesn\u2019t make sense for working Americans.\u201d Just days after the emails between Marathon and the Wisconsin lawmaker, some 1,500 state legislators and other officials from across the country gathered in New Orleans to cheer on Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation, at the legislative exchange council\u2019s annual convention. Marathon sponsored the event.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Corporate Donors Behind a Republican Power Grab", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalgreens and other major companies are key supporters of the Wisconsin legislators now trying to undermine democracy.Opinion ColumnistWalgreens portrays itself as the friendly neighborhood drugstore. It gives flu shots to children, helps communities after storms, donates to charity \u2014 and makes feel-good advertisements trumpeting its various good deeds.But Walgreens also has a tougher side, one you won\u2019t see in those ads. To protect a tax break, the company has allied itself with Wisconsin\u2019s brutally partisan Republican Party. That party is now in the midst of a power grab, stripping authority from Wisconsin\u2019s governor and attorney general solely because Republicans lost those offices last month. The power grab comes after years of extreme gerrymandering, which lets Republicans dominate the legislature despite Wisconsin being a closely divided state.The story of Walgreens and Wisconsin has its roots in a decade-old court case.In 2008, the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of an aggressive tax strategy by the company, in a case known as Walgreens v. City of Madison. When calculating the property taxes it owed, Walgreens used an artificially low valuation of its stores. It did not pay taxes based on the actual value of those stores, as reflected by their purchase price and rent. Instead, it took into account the value of vacant stores nearby.A few weeks later, Walgreens donated $1,000 to Vos. Over the summer, it donated another $6,000 to the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate. A couple of weeks before Election Day, the company gave $1,000 to Fitzgerald. These donations weren\u2019t simply a matter of spreading money around. Walgreens did not donate to state-level Democrats this year, as it has in the past.\u201cIt would be healthier for companies to spend a little more time thinking about the meaning of these donations,\u201d as Judd Legum, author of the political newsletter Popular Information, told me. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s all transactional.\u201d In recent months, Legum\u2019s reporting has caused Facebook, Google, Walmart, Major League Baseball and others to ask for the return of donations to politicians whose values the companies were not comfortable defending.So far, Walgreens has not been willing to do the same in Wisconsin. I asked the company last week what it thought about the recent events in Wisconsin, and it ducked the question. But Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman, told me the company was \u201cin the process of evaluating\u201d the situation.The silence of major companies is disappointing because they could actually make a difference. Republican politicians care about the opinions of their corporate backers.I realize that being able to operate in a well-functioning democracy doesn\u2019t bring the same obvious bottom-line benefits as, say, a tax break. But our corporate leaders are making a big mistake if they decide that democracy doesn\u2019t matter.Advertisement"}

The resulting image quality may not be as good as with a hardware scanner, but apps are inexpensive and you spare fragile prints from bright light.Now it\u2019s time to whip out the toolbox:For scratches rips and tears in the photograph, look for the program\u2019s \u201chealing brush,\u201d \u201cspot fix\u201d or \u201cclone stamp\u201d tool, which typically copies nearby pixels to cover up the damage. Use the tool to click or swipe over the blemishes.Click the automatic \u201cenhance\u201d button \u2014 or drag onscreen sliders to make manual adjustments to a photo\u2019s contrast and color balance.Use the program\u2019s cropping tool to slice away cluttered backgrounds and frayed edges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Homegrown Chips Threaten Silicon Valley Giant Intel", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips.Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world.Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker.Intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends, from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence, as influence over chip designs has been shifting to Amazon, Apple and Google, which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry.The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn\u2019t had much competition in the server market in recent years. The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options.Intel acknowledges that companies like Amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier. \u201cI am not unaware of the dynamic,\u201d Lisa Spelman, an Intel vice president, said. \u201cOur goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire.\u201dAbout 35 percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about 10 companies, including large internet companies like Amazon and a handful of telecommunication firms, said Shane Rau, a chip analyst with the research firm IDC. That just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for Intel.\u201cEach one of these companies is so large, they represent a market unto themselves,\u201d Mr. Rau said.Apple beat the other tech giants to this cost-saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom-built chip for the iPhone. Google and Microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.Amazon has upped the ante. In 2015, it spent a reported $350 million to acquire a chip maker, Annapurna Labs, which helped build the new central processing unit, or C.P.U.A C.P.U. \u2014 the centerpiece of a computer\u2019s operations \u2014 is the sort of chip that Intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers. Building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. It is a big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks.\u201cThe belief was that you needed some magic to build a processor, particularly a server processor,\u201d said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the chip start-up Cerebras and a former executive at the chip maker AMD. \u201cYou had to be Intel or AMD \u2014 and that was about it.\u201dAmazon executives believe the chip, which was designed to be more energy efficient, will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers. It said it was offering a cloud-computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip. The cost of the service could be 45 percent lower than other options.And when Amazon buys chips from other companies, a homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices. \u201cThey can now say to Intel, \u2018We will just move the workloads to other chips,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feldman said.Though it is still enormously difficult, building a chip is easier than it used to be. Amazon licensed much of the technology from ARM, the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips. It made the chip through TSMC, a Taiwanese company.For Intel, Amazon\u2019s move into C.P.U.s is a strike at a longtime strength. Intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market a decade ago, a significant missed opportunity. The tech industry shifted, and Intel didn\u2019t shift with it.But Intel has a 96.6 percent share of server chip sales, according to IDC. It was 98.6 percent until its longtime competitor, AMD, which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about a decade, recently re-entered the market.Intel\u2019s profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry. But the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker\u2019s dependence on servers. Intel\u2019s data center group, which sells both server and A.I. chips, pulled in $6.1 billion, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The group now accounts for more than 30 percent of Intel\u2019s revenue.As the chip market has changed, Intel has tried to diversify. In recent years, it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones, cars and data centers.Through their fast-growing cloud computing services, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks. Going to a cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back-room computer systems \u2014 the tech experts do it for them.It is a lucrative business. Amazon Web Services brings in nearly $27 billion a year, and it accounts for 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s profits.Inside these cloud operations, the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built. They are designing much of their own hardware, from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers. Facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers.Amazon\u2019s new chip is running only a small fraction of the software across the company\u2019s online empire. But that is expected to expand.\u201cWe will look back at this as a watershed moment,\u201d said Mr. Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "PowerPoint Is the Most Efficient Way for Kids to Manage Their Parents", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe most solid method for kids to achieve their goals? An awesome presentation.To convince her mother to buy some of these items, Makennah, who is 13, created an 85-slide PowerPoint presentation. Rather than just emailing the document, she delivered its contents in person, standing before her mother to make the full audiovisual pitch. \u201cI like to add music and do my own intros and stuff,\u201d Makennah said.Though some presentations are made with Google Slides or Apple\u2019s Keynote, PowerPoint also seems to be the dominant tool, creating yet another instance for young people to embrace a Microsoft product (the company also owns Minecraft and Xbox).The children say that their polished presentations serve a few purposes. They convey to parents that what is being asked for really matters. They also let them make an entire case without being interrupted by a parent\u2019s quick \u201cno.\u201d \u201cWith a PowerPoint it was a little bit more impactful because they could see the amount of effort and work I put into it instead of just my usual begging,\u201d said Lucy Frisch, 14, an equestrian from New York who made a presentation a few years ago to ask her parents to buy her a horse.She did not manage to close the deal. Still, her presentation showed to her parents that Lucy\u2019s interest in riding was not fleeting, and convinced her father that the family should commit as many resources as possible to her riding. A key strategy is to be prepared in advance with answers to your parents\u2019 objections, said Cade Collins, 14, from Maryville, Tenn.On the occasion of his brother Luke\u2019s birthday last year, Cade sat his parents in their living room, turned down the lights, streamed some soft jazz, lit a candles and dressed in a T-shirt with a picture of a puppy on it. Then he unleashed upon his parents a PowerPoint pressure-tation entitled, \u201cReasons Why We Need to get a Wing Pup.\u201d The family already had a dog, Cooper, age 10, whom the family had nicknamed \u201cthe Wing.\u201d But Luke wanted a duck-hunting dog and relatives were offering a black Labrador from a new litter.In a slide that he headlined \u201cI Know What Your Thinking,\u201d Cade wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve heard it from you mom, \u2018We would but there is just too much stress with moving houses.\u2019 Well, boy do I have an answer for you. Studies have shown that when petting a dog your body releases a number of \u2018feel good\u2019 hormones, such as serotonin, prolactin and oxytocin. There for releasing stress.\u201d (He meant \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d but that\u2019s not the point here.)\u201cCoopers years are numbered and he is slowing down, but a younger energetic presence wouldn\u2019t hurt and may improve his lifestyle,\u201d he added. (See slide four, \u201cLets Face It.\u201d)What did Mr. and Ms. Collins say? What do you think?But before Willie joined the family (they named the new dog after Willie Nelson!), the boys had to sign a contract promising that they would clean up accidents, monitor the pup\u2019s furniture-chewing and keep him fed and groomed. \u201cWe replied to the PowerPoint with our own official documents,\u201d said Ms. Collins.It\u2019s not just about getting parents to spring for new sneakers and animals. Makennah of Lubbock has also used PowerPoint for more quotidian request: to convince her mom to let her wear a little makeup. \u201cI\u2019m quick to be convinced by her,\u201d said Marla Castro, her mother. \u201cShe has me dumbfounded a lot.\u201d\u201cSure, make a PowerPoint and we\u2019ll see,\u201d her mother said.A few days later, Ms. Stopenski set up a life-size cutout of Mr. Horan and hooked her laptop to the family\u2019s living-room TV. She devoted a few slides to explaining the appeal of Mr. Horan, just in case it wasn\u2019t readily apparent to her parents: \u201cHe is 5\u20199\u201d so basically he is the perfect height for me\u201d and \u201cHe loves golf,\u201d one said. \u201cHe sings good\u201d and \u201cI like his brown hair more than his blonde hair,\u201d said another. She explained how much the travel, hotel and concert would cost and how she had budgeted to keep costs low. One of the final slides included a photograph of Mr. Horan, applauding in an audience. Ms. Stopenski\u2019s caption said, \u201cNiall is clapping in this picture because he is so impressed at how dedicated I am to him.\u201d\u201cThey said \u2018yes\u2019 right away,\u201d she said.This year she wants to go to Toronto to see Shawn Mendes. \u201cDo you want me to make a PowerPoint? Because I will,\u201d Ms. Stopenski asked her mother.\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary,\u201d her mom said.For some, the process of creating and delivering a presentation is less about dazzling parents than crystallizing for their own selves how strongly they want something. Last month, Dwayne Neff, 17, a high-school senior in Park Forest, Ill., set up a time to meet with his parents and had his PowerPoint on the TV screen when they came into the living room. He needed $250 to buy a ticket to the Travis Scott concert. Dwayne thought if he simply asked for the money, his parents would say no before he got the words out. Thanks to his slide show, Dwayne, an aspiring musical artist, was able to make his argument.Check out this excellent PowerPoint about Travis Scott.After, \u201cthey even told me that if I had just asked, they would say \u2018no\u2019 but that they would see what they could do because I put in time and effort,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t always take him seriously, because his approach to things sometimes can be somewhat colorful,\u201d Dwayne\u2019s mother, Stephanie Neff, wrote in an email.She and her husband did decide against giving the $250, but Dwayne, pumped up by his PowerPoint, sold his PlayStations and attended Mr. Scott\u2019s performance last week. \u201cIt was everything I needed to give me the inspiration to continue following my musical dreams,\u201d he said.Charlie Regan, 10, used a Google Slides presentation to be relieved of an activity. Charlie really wanted to quit soccer. So she sat her parents down and delivered an argument why she should be allowed to stop after the season\u2019s end. \u201cI knew that if I just wrote it one a regular piece of paper, I couldn\u2019t do as much as I could with a computer,\u201d said Charlie, who is in fifth grade.How to get out of sports.\u201cIt totally took us by surprise and we agreed with her reasoning,\u201d said her father, Patrick Regan.Then Charlie\u2019s older brother, Cash, who is 14 and had seen his sister\u2019s success with the soccer matter, suggested that the two of them create another presentation. This one was aimed to convince their parents to buy a house in the country.In their pitch, titled \u201cParadise,\u201d the children wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong we love summer and the things we do and the places we visit. But there are definitely room for improvement.\u201dAgainst the backdrop of stock images of log cabins and other buildings they found doing a Google image search for \u201csmall country house,\u201d the Regan kids laid out the case to splurge on a vacation home. Their reasons included, \u201cWe could go camping right outside our house\u201d and \u201cIt would be a great place to park and keep Uncle Richard\u2019s truck.\u201dBut alas.\u201cIt didn\u2019t work as well as it did with my soccer idea,\u201d Charlie said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Overlooked in Atlanta, Black Female Artists Try Miami", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAngela Davis Johnson got a similar response when she showed curators her paintings, which almost always feature black women and fabrics to pay homage to her seamstress mother. One, \u201cAn open mouth creek,\u201d depicts a black girl with sad eyes and blue hair whose mouth is shut \u2014 though she looks like she wants to talk. It\u2019s a piece that speaks to the silencing of black women throughout history. Ms. Johnson has been told that her work is too political and that she should stay away from race-related issues if she wants to be commercially viable.\u201cI was told once to focus on black women in a church setting because that is what buyers love,\u201d Ms. Davis Johnson recalled.In Atlanta, she pointed out, emerging female artists are often funneled into \u201centry-level shows that aren\u2019t really curated.\u201d\u201cThey have to wait a longer time than their peers,\u201d she said, \u201cso they\u2019re usually older when they hit their stride and I don\u2019t think it has to be that way.\u201dWith sponsorships and crowd funding support, the group headed to Miami. In addition to Ms. Johnson and Ms. Kisa, it included the painters Ariel Dannielle, Ebony Black and Sachi Rome; the multimedia artists Christa David and Shon Pittman; the graphic artists Ayanna Smith and Jasmine Nicole Williams; and the photographer Evelyn Qui\u00f1ones. Their work would be on display on video screens at PAMM during Art Basel.The artists spoke of limited access to the city\u2019s cultural gatekeepers, who are mostly white. In addition, many black women who are the primary breadwinners for their families cannot afford the studio fees, ranging up to $1,000 per month, that would grant them access to a peer network.An artist herself, Ms. LaTrice, 29, understands their struggles. Born in Chattanooga, Tenn., she moved to New York and then to Atlanta after earning her master\u2019s degree in women\u2019s history from Sarah Lawrence College. She had no network or connections before she formed TILA. Today her studio trains women how to write a strong artist statement, develop a CV and shoot their work professionally, not just on an iPhone. Her studio is a resource \u201cso they don\u2019t feel alone,\u201d she said.Ms. Kisa, 50, a full-time artist with a home studio, wistfully recalled the 1990s as a golden age, with the arrival of the National Black Arts Festival drawing talent from all over the world to sell their work. \u201cTo be able to walk down the aisle and see work that I saw on \u2018The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u2019 or \u2018The Steve Harvey Show\u2019 \u2014 that show was more than a market, it was a cultural experience,\u201d Ms. Kisa said. She added that day care centers brought children to the fair to see the work of the artists \u2014 and \u201cthey\u2019d go, \u2018Girls can draw?\u2019\u201dWhen the predominantly white-owned galleries in the upscale Buckhead district did show the work of black artists, \u201cthey might have one male and one female,\u201d Ms. Kisa said \u2014 something, artists point out, that hasn\u2019t changed much. A handful of black-owned galleries opened to meet the demand of clients looking for African-American artists, but many went out of business after the financial crisis in 2008. And so artists like Ms. Kisa have sought alternative venues, traveling to Jazz Fest in New Orleans to find buyers, but watching the cost of a booth, lodging and transportation slash profits.Even if Ms. Kisa finds representation by a top-tier gallery in Atlanta, the standard commission is 50 percent, and her prices are not currently high enough to justify splitting profits with the gallery.Mr. Avery said that he didn\u2019t mind work that deals with difficult subjects like race, but said that for the first 25 years of his career, African-American artists brought work to him that reinforced stereotypes. \u201cEvery painter was doing black men with big lips blowing trumpets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were doing it to appeal to what they thought was the art buyer.\u201d He added, \u201cYou have someone come along like Fabiola or Michi Meko, and they\u2019re having some of the same conversation about race, but from a different perspective.\u201dArnika Dawkins, one of the city\u2019s few black female gallery owners, said that she did not show any of the kind of work that Mr. Avery described. She opened her gallery in a predominantly African-American, middle-class neighborhood in southwestern Atlanta in 2012 and exhibits fine art photography on subjects related to African-American history and current events.But the stereotype conundrum is familiar to Brenda Fannin, who opened her Buckhead gallery four years ago after leaving a successful executive career at Verizon and Microsoft. The work she shows by artists of color is mostly abstract. \u201cAm I being embraced by black collectors? No,\u201d Ms. Fannin said, adding that her taste is not what they expect. On the other hand, she says, white art collectors are not willing to buy from a black gallery owner either. \u201cWe fear what we don\u2019t know,\u201d she added.Ms. Qui\u00f1ones, 47, who is Afro-Latina, said she had grappled with isolation since she moved here from New York. \u201cThere have been times when people will say to me \u2018you\u2019re black\u2019 and another person will say \u2018she\u2019s not black, she speaks Spanish,\u2019 and they only consider black to be African-American, but black is worldwide.\u201dHer work focuses on people who are ignored. One photo, of a homeless woman on Peachtree Street, is now a part of Fulton County\u2019s permanent collection, but translating those wins into a living hasn\u2019t happened yet (she has a day job as a graphic designer). Finding a peer network seemed impossible until she joined Sistagraphy, a collective of black women photographers.In Miami, at the brunch at PAMM, 250 black women artists gathered, and Ms. Qui\u00f1ones watched her work streaming on a video screen. She described the experience as \u201cempowering and inspiring,\u201d and connected with artists she had long admired, including the multimedia artist Firelei B\u00e1ez, from the Dominican Republic.\u201cThe most valuable thing has been bonding with other women artists,\u201d Ms. Qui\u00f1ones said. \u201cThis experience has given me the confidence to experiment more and work on the ideas that I have been holding onto into my head.\u201dSo, did an appearance at Art Basel Miami Beach propel any of their careers? It\u2019s too soon to tell.For Ms. Davis Johnson, 37, the trip to Miami offered exposure to a global audience.\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to go to Art Basel for years but there\u2019s always been a barrier, whether it\u2019s with my children or finances,\u201d said Ms. Johnson, who is a single mother to a 6-year-old and 4-year-old. She calls her children \u201cmuseum babies\u201d and brought them to the fair with her.She found the streets of Miami draped with art by people from all around the world, and explained that just being in that creative space could make all the difference for her career trajectory.\u201cTo see a room full of black women who are not only saying that they\u2019re artists, but they\u2019re living it \u2014 people I admired for so long \u2014 it was perfection,\u201d Ms. Davis Johnson said. \u201cPeople were talking about motherhood, being an art professional and the dedication it takes. I feel my craft, how I approach work, has shifted because of the works that I\u2019ve seen.\u201dBeyond the brunch, going with the group to Miami empowered her to claim a seat at the international art table, despite the barriers.Advertisement"}
