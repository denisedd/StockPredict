{"Headline": "A Short History of Political Red Faces Over Workers Without Green Cards", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are a few other cases that made national headlines.Though the Mexican-American labor activist Cesar Chavez testified against Ms. Ba\u00f1uelos on Capitol Hill, her nomination survived, and she went on to serve for about two years. Senators believed that she did not know about the undocumented workers and that the raid had been instigated to embarrass the White House.Ms. Ba\u00f1uelos, who was born in Arizona and had helped establish the first Latino-owned bank in California, had been deported as a child, when the government sent her family and more than a million other people of Mexican descent to Mexico because of job scarcity in the United States during the Great Depression.In late 1992 and early 1993, President Bill Clinton looked to make history by naming the nation\u2019s first female attorney general to his cabinet. He eventually accomplished that with Janet Reno, but only after his first two nominees for the post were forced to withdraw.Zo\u00eb Baird, a corporate lawyer in Connecticut, was found to have hired two undocumented Peruvian immigrants as a babysitter and a driver \u2014 and to have knowingly neglected to pay the required taxes for household employees. She had informed Mr. Clinton\u2019s transition team about the employees, but the president-elect nominated her anyway, and dropped her only after public outrage mounted.Mr. Clinton\u2019s next choice then fell victim to the charged political environment. Judge Kimba M. Wood, a Federal District Court judge in New York, had employed an undocumented Trinidadian as a babysitter in 1986, shortly before a federal law took effect making it illegal to hire an undocumented immigrant. The babysitter became a legal resident in 1987.Even though there was no evidence that Judge Wood had done anything illegal, the White House asked her to withdraw her name because they feared another public backlash like the one against Ms. Baird.Mr. Clinton\u2019s third choice, Ms. Reno, had no such difficulty, and served in the cabinet throughout his presidency.When Mitt Romney ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, he accused one of his opponents, Rudy Giuliani, of running a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants while he was mayor of New York. But Mr. Giuliani had a comeback ready: He accused Mr. Romney of running a \u201csanctuary mansion.\u201dThe Boston Globe had just revealed that Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, had carried on using a landscaping service at his house in Belmont, Mass., after the newspaper had reported finding undocumented Guatemalans among its employees \u2014 and that, a year later, the company was still using undocumented workers.Mr. Romney, who fired the service after the second report, did not win the nomination in 2008, but he did in 2012, losing to President Barack Obama in the general election. In November he was elected to a Senate seat in Utah.When Meg Whitman spent $140 million of her own money to run for governor of California as a Republican in 2010, she tried to thread a political needle, and be seen by conservatives as tough on illegal immigration without alienating independents and Latino voters.Then it emerged that Ms. Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, had employed an undocumented housekeeper for nearly a decade, before firing her in 2009.Ms. Whitman went down to defeat by a wide margin; shortly afterward, she agreed to pay $5,500 to settle a claim brought by the housekeeper, Nicandra D\u00edaz Santill\u00e1n, that Ms. Whitman and her husband had shortchanged her on wages.Another California Republican, Gov. Pete Wilson, ran successfully for re-election in 1994 promising to deny state benefits to undocumented immigrants. The next year, he was forced to acknowledge employing one as a maid in his home. Mr. Wilson also acknowledged failing to pay Social Security taxes on the maid\u2019s wages. Mr. Wilson eventually paid an estimated $3,000 in back taxes and penalties, and his ex-wife later took responsibility for the omission.Ms. Whitman and Mr. Wilson each said that had they known the workers were not in the country legally, they would not have hired them.The candidates of both major parties in California\u2019s 1994 Senate race acknowledged employing immigrants who were not legally cleared to work.Michael Huffington, the Republican, admitted that he had broken the law when his family employed a nanny who was originally from Mexico. The situation with Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat, was a bit more complicated.Ms. Feinstein had employed a Guatemalan housekeeper who entered the country legally in 1979 with a permit to work at the Guatemalan consulate in San Francisco. She went to work for Ms. Feinstein, the mayor at the time, after the permit expired. Hiring an undocumented immigrant was not illegal under federal law until 1986.An immediate uproar from Senate Democrats and progressive groups greeted Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination of Andrew Puzder, a restaurant-chain executive, to be secretary of labor. Mr. Puzder had criticized overtime rules championed by the Obama administration and opposed raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.Even so, his selection did not appear to stall until he acknowledged that he and his wife had employed an immigrant housekeeper for a few years who was not legally permitted to work.Mr. Puzder immediately fired the woman and paid back taxes owed on her wages. He said the couple had not known she was undocumented, and that he would help her gain legal status.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

The penalties could include a fine along with up to 10 years of imprisonment for Ms. Ressa. They have denied the charges.The government prepared a warrant for Ms. Ressa\u2019s arrest to coincide with her return to the Philippines on Sunday evening after a weekslong trip abroad that included appearances at several high-profile journalism awards ceremonies. In Washington, Ms. Ressa received the 2018 Knight International Journalism award. In New York, she was given the Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists.\u201cI\u2019m going to hold my government accountable for publicly calling me a criminal,\u201d Ms. Ressa said in a brief conversation with a group of reporters who greeted her arrival at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila late Sunday. \u201cI am not a criminal.\u201dOn Monday morning, Ms. Ressa arrived at the Pasig Regional Trial Court in Manila and provided head shots for the court and had her fingerprints taken. Her legal team filed a motion for Ms. Ressa to be set free on bail and paid 60,000 pesos, or about $1,100, to secure her release, her lawyer said by phone.It is the latest in a series of crackdowns on the news media by the Duterte government. Mr. Duterte is one of a growing group of political strongmen who rode to power in recent years on a wave of populism in their countries and in the process tightened their grip on power. When challenged by the news media, these leaders have often turned on reporters, accusing them of being dishonest and manufacturing \u201cfake news.\u201dHe has threatened several times to block the license renewal for ABS-CBN, the largest broadcast network in the Philippines. He has called reporters \u201cspies\u201d and \u201csons of bitches\u201d and made thinly veiled death threats, warning reporters that they are \u201cnot exempted from assassination.\u201dRappler, founded in 2012 as a scrappy investigative and entertainment outlet, has been a main target of his verbal abuse. Its star political reporter, Pia Ranada, in particular has been singled out. At one news conference, Mr. Duterte warned her not to go to his hometown, Davao, where he was once mayor, because \u201csomething bad will happen to you.\u201dEarlier this year, Ms. Ranada was stripped of the press pass that allows her to cover Malaca\u00f1ang Palace, the Philippine equivalent to the White House. Rappler reporters have been barred from covering any official presidential events. Such treatment has alarmed media groups.\u201cMore than his inability to tolerate dissent, Duterte\u2019s relentless persecution of the media appears to be part of the increasingly authoritarian direction his presidency has taken,\u201d the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said in a statement on Sunday night.This year, Rappler became an official fact checker for Facebook, which has called the Philippines \u201cPatient Zero\u201d in the battle over misinformation.The charges treat Rappler as though it were a \u201cdealer in securities\u201d and not a news organization, Ms. Ressa said, adding that Rappler has paid the right taxes required of a news organization in the Philippines.Francis Lim, a lawyer for Ms. Ressa, said Monday in a statement sent by text message, \u201cThe police can no longer arrest her, as the court just approved the cash bail that she has posted for her liberty during the pendency of the case.\u201dRisa Hontiveros, an opposition senator, called the case an attempt to \u201cmuzzle the media into fear.\u201d\u201cIn his attempt to be a full-fledged authoritarian, President Duterte wants to control the free flow of information and neutralize a potential channel of criticism,\u201d Ms. Hontiveros said in an emailed statement.Speaking on Sunday night from the airport, Ms. Ressa said that her arrest would not silence her.\u201cI have been a journalist my entire life,\u201d she said. \u201cI will continue to hold the government accountable.\u201dJason Gutierrez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Supported byMr. Beasley was raised in Lynchburg, Va., and members of his family still own a farm a couple of hours south, in Valentines, Va., where the crop has been grown. \u201cThere\u2019s a story here that I think talks about migration, geography and ancestry,\u201d said Mr. Beasley, who pointed out that he is very likely the descendant of slaves. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a Conceptual work,\u201d he added. Christopher Y. Lew, the Whitney curator who organized the show, said: \u201cKevin has taken the history of the gin and tweaked it. He\u2019s making history malleable. We can grapple with our past instead of being burdened by it.\u201dThe show is revving up the artist\u2019s career, too. At 33, Mr. Beasley is quite young to get the museum\u2019s eighth-floor space all to himself, and he is making the most of it.Microphones hooked up to the motor and connected to a synthesizer and a mixer will allow him to enhance and manipulate the machine\u2019s eerie whirring and clicking, and to turn it into an electronic symphony of sorts. A few days before the show opened, Mr. Beasley worked inside the vitrine at the Whitney, painstakingly fine-tuning the microphones and at one point splaying himself over the motor to get the positioning right.The results will be heard only in a discrete listening room: The sound is separated from the performance space, much as Eli Whitney\u2019s invention separated cotton fibers from their seeds, performing the task at a greater speed than the human hand. Benches will encourage people to linger. Underneath them will be amplification equipment known as \u201cbutt kickers.\u201d (The vibrations created are intense enough to border on a massage.)\u201cI used to D.J. at terrible Yale parties,\u201d Mr. Beasley said, recalling his nights in graduate school. While he spoke, he fiddled with the dozens of knobs on the control panel as multicolored lights blinked.\u201cAs a viewer, you can\u2019t be passive with his work,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cHe wants you to participate.\u201dDuring the visit, he picked cotton for the first time, as it hadn\u2019t been planted there before, and was surprised to find \u201cit\u2019s really pleasurable,\u201d he said. \u201cA very sensual thing.\u201d But it also shook him to think of his ancestors and others who were enslaved to provide ever more material for gins to process.Cotton\u2019s ubiquity today kept the memory fresh. \u201cYou\u2019ve had this emotional experience, and you look down and you\u2019ve got a really nice cotton shirt on,\u201d Mr. Beasley said. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing.\u201d\u201cI was, like, how do I process this?\u201d Mr. Beasley recalled. The internet provided a path. On eBay he came across an ad for a cotton gin motor that was used on a cotton farm from 1940 to 1973. The motor operated throughout significant events in 20th-century American history, including World War II, Vietnam and the civil rights movement.\u201cI knew he was white,\u201d Mr. Beasley said of the farmer. \u201cIt was a little risky. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going to happen. But he was so generous, and it felt like he had never had someone come and say, \u2018Just tell me everything.\u2019\u201d Not only did the farmer give his life story and details of the machine\u2019s history, but he also said he could remember the way the motor sounded decades ago, \u201cbut he had no language to describe the noise,\u201d Mr. Beasley recalled.That visit informed his slab sculptures \u2014 \u201cThe Reunion, \u201cCampus\u201d and \u201cThe Acquisition,\u201d all from 2018 \u2014 which have crusty surfaces, making them seem as if they had been somehow excavated after being preserved in amber.The objects embedded include a computer, a Yale sweatshirt, blackface clown masks and a pair of overalls. The back of each sculpture is a field of dyed, resin-covered cotton bunches. For the works, Mr. Beasley ordered five bales of cotton, weighing some 2,500 pounds.His family\u2019s reaction to the project so far has been \u201csupportive,\u201d Mr. Beasley said. \u201cThey are moved by the fact that I am bringing this up, in my own way.\u201dWhen the show opens, the gin motor is likely to grab visitors\u2019 attention. Mr. Beasley compared it both to a patient undergoing an operation and to a singer performing. The motor is rich in metaphor, and he said he felt a certain vulnerability in displaying it, after having it all to himself.\u201cThat\u2019s an artist life \u2014 there\u2019s the decision to make the work, but then the decision to share it,\u201d said Mr. Beasley, now still and reflective and no longer furiously shifting gears. \u201cIt\u2019s now accompanied with someone else\u2019s experience. For me, that\u2019s a struggle.\u201dKevin Beasley: A view of a landscapeDec. 15 through March 10 at the Whitney Museum of American Art; 212-570-3600, whitney.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Passion, Romance and Yearning: Photos of People Kissing", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensFrom simple pecks to full-on makeout sessions, a new compilation of photographs reveals how couples have kissed in front of the camera since the late-Victorian era.Two pairs of sweaty palms and eyes shut tight. Two mouths slightly opened. And, sometimes, two hearts racing from a mixture of yearning and excitement.\u201cWhen you look at a found photograph, you\u2019re activating a story,\u201d Ms. Levine said, \u201cso when I started to notice how many pictures we had of people kissing in our archive, it seemed like a real jumping-off point for discussion, for examination.\u201dKissing is a common gesture. We see it in movies and on social media posts. But the act became something worthy of memorializing among everyday people just a little over a century ago, Ms. Levine and Ms. Ramey wrote with Peter L. Stein in the book\u2019s introductory essay. Photographs and postcards from the late 19th and early 20th centuries show an awkward and unnatural formality \u2014 despite the moment\u2019s intimacy \u2014 thanks to subjects \u201ckeeping stock-still for the duration of an exposure,\u201d they wrote. The accompanying text for many of the images reflects conservative sensibilities of the time: \u201cKeeping healthy,\u201d reads one postcard from 1911 of a man in a suit and white gloves planting one on a woman with her eyes slightly opened; another co-opts a lusty smooch to warn viewers of the perils of infidelity.The seemingly endless supply of photos in the archive enabled Ms. Levine and Ms. Ramey to pick out themes and to show changing mores surrounding kissing and romance over the years.\u201cYou watch our photographic literacy develop as the years go by, and there are different things in different eras that are interesting,\u201d Ms. Levine said, \u201cso it\u2019s an important part of story to try to tell that story through shifting ideas and trends.\u201dPhotographs of tender moments between same-sex couples became more common in their collection as the years passed by, including one of two women embracing the kitsch of the Kiss-O-Meter. Meanwhile, snapshots from the 1950s capture the rise of youthful rebellion: passionate yet candid make-out sessions, on picnic blankets with hair tossed and bodies intertwined, and near snowy banks during a nightly outing, with a young couple paying no attention to their friends\u2019 reactions.Kissing, as these photos show, doesn\u2019t always require baring one\u2019s soul. Interspersed between amorous moments are more dramatic and humorous demonstrations. Adults coax toddlers to imitate them, while giggling childhood friends peck one another\u2019s cheeks. And it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask whether it was a sense of devotion or a desire to perform for the camera that inspired a man to stretch his torso across the floor to reach his partner\u2019s lips.Since the majority of couples in the collection are anonymous, many of these images can also serve as ways for us to reflect on our own experiences of kissing. For some, a pair\u2019s steamy embrace on a loveseat may bring back memories of the exhilarating nervousness that gives way to ecstasy. Others, meanwhile, might feel uncomfortable about how they may have once looked as ridiculous as the man in swim trunks thrusting out his tongue as he goes in for a French kiss.\u201cYou start to put yourself in the photograph and wonder all these questions for which there\u2019s no answers,\u201d Ms. Levine said. \u201cYou\u2019re supplying all the answers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Women Have to Play Catch-Up in Retirement Savings", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Lindsay Corner, 25, saving for retirement has a greater urgency than for many of her peers.\u201cNone of my girlfriends talk about it, but I feel fairly confident about managing money and finances,\u201d Ms. Corner said. \u201cI learned about it from my parents and, in college, I studied accounting and finance and took a personal finance class.\u201dMs. Corner, a senior tax analyst from Durham, N.C., began setting aside funds as soon as she graduated in the spring of 2015. \u201cMy first employer offered a 401(k) retirement plan and matched 3 percent of my contribution. I contributed 15 percent of my salary,\u201d she said.She has since increased that amount to 18 percent. \u201cRetirement does not seem like too far away to be saving for,\u201d Ms. Corner said. \u201cI can see why people my age might have that perception, but for me that wasn\u2019t the case. Taking these classes in school really opened my eyes up to it. We would see examples: If you save this much now, this is how much it\u2019s going to be worth later, and you would be, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I would be crazy not to start to save early.\u2019\u201dSaving is a habit for Ms. Corner. \u201cI don\u2019t see the money that goes into my 401(k) account, so it\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even miss it.\u201d\u201cSixty-one percent of women would rather talk about their own death than money,\u201d said Maddy Dychtwald, co-founder of Age Wave. \u201cAnd only 46 percent of millennial women say they are confident in investing.\u201dThat\u2019s a problem when you consider the future for many women. Women typically live longer than men \u2014 81 years versus 76 years \u2014 according to statistics from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. By age 85, women outnumber men by 2 to 1 and a majority of centenarians are women, according to the Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study. This means that women are more likely to be on their own financially as they age.An early start to retirement savings can help change that crystal ball for younger women today, but for many women in their 20s, debt can be a stumbling block to savings.The pay gap, however, is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to the significance of increasing the savings of millennial women. An average woman spends 44 percent of her adult life out of the work force compared with 28 percent for a man, according to the Age Wave calculation.When a woman reaches retirement age, she\u2019ll have earned a cumulative $1,055,000 less than a man who has stayed continuously in the work force, because of the accumulated lifelong pay gap and work force interruptions to care for children, aging parents or a spouse, according to the Age Wave computation based on figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In part, the setback for both women and men in their 20s is the rise of the gig economy, and access to and eligibility for an employer retirement plan. While more than 94 percent of millennials like Ms. Corner, who are eligible for a workplace retirement plan, are saving, many don\u2019t have access to an employer plan.Ms. Blandin had a retirement fund with one of her former employers. \u201cThen I moved on to a different job, and I took that money out\u201d \u2014 about $7,000, she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the craziest thing? I knew it was a bad idea, but I didn\u2019t have an option. I needed to pay off the last of my student loans and credit card debts that had built up from buying furniture for my apartment and purchasing nice office clothes \u2014 I didn\u2019t even have dress pants.\u201d\u201cThe biggest challenge, honestly, is getting started,\u201d Ms. Blandin said. \u201cYou get to this point when you are on your own, and you want to be responsible and put money away, and you realize it\u2019s important, but knowing how to do that gets really complicated. There is all this financial jargon that is hard to understand and you kind of get stuck.\u201dBut about 63 percent of women ages 18 to 29 say \u201cfinancial planning is too difficult to even think about,\u201d Ms. Dychtwald said.One way Ms. Blandin is seeking extra funds to open a Roth IRA is \u201ca side hustle,\u201d she said. \u201cI do sports and concert photography. A lot of my girlfriends do side hustles. One of my friends cooks vegan food, and she caters events. There are people who pick up bar shifts. It\u2019s nice because you can do it within your passion.\u201dDeveloping a contract side gig through an online freelance marketplace like Upwork or Fiverr, or selling craft items on eBay or Etsy, \u201cis a great way to have an incremental pot on the side to use for savings,\u201d Ms. Braxton said.And Ms. Blandin makes it a point to negotiate her salary. \u201cI revisit my pay with my boss regularly and set time aside to discuss everything that I\u2019m doing.\u201dNegotiating for higher pay can make a big difference in the amount young women can set aside for retirement. \u201cI am encouraged by what I see,\u201d Ms. Braxton said. \u201cI have several 20-somethings who have sought me out for help. I encourage them to negotiate as much as they can for salary because more money means more resources all the way around for the rest of their lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hope and Betrayal of Blockchain", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsThis is the most revolutionary and innovative aspect of blockchain. But its promise could be undermined.Trust \u2014 the basis of social and commercial interactions \u2014 has been guaranteed for centuries by institutionalized trust providers, such as hierarchically organized companies and other third-party authorities. These trust mechanisms have worked for offline business models, but they are becoming obsolete in our hyper-connected digital world.In the past few years, however, some open platforms, such as Twitter, have become increasingly restrictive. Things have turned sour, as developers and early users feel betrayed. They had been promised open platforms but that dream was snatched away.Moreover, incidents involving several tech giants, such as Facebook, eBay, Uber and Experian, have shattered their credibility as reliable keepers of our data. Our fear of surveillance and data misuse has grown.Thanks to blockchain, people are now able and eager to take on the platform owners by engaging directly with one another via peer-to-peer, or P2P, distributed networks that run on a commonly agreed-upon set of rules. The resulting machine-driven trust allows users to avoid the fallout from centralized trust mechanisms, such as third-party control or unauthorized surveillance.In fact, the large centralized trust enforcers may soon give way to decentralized trust systems and P2P network-enforced reputation systems that blockchain makes possible.Under such systems, algorithms confirm the authenticity of each transaction and can record each party\u2019s identity, along with their trust and reputation rating, in the blockchain, which acts as a kind of ledger. Misbehavior is prevented because it is impossible to tamper with or falsify the ledger, and accountability is improved because all actions can be independently audited by any participant.It is Uber without Uber, Airbnb without Airbnb.This evolution is already happening. Payment and financial services providers like PayPal are being challenged by Ripple or Circle. Social media and networking services like Twitter and Facebook face competition from decentralized platforms such as Steemit or Akasha. Decentralized apps \u2014 software making decisions and acting autonomously \u2014 can be created and deployed on different blockchains like Ethereum or EOS. These are just a few examples.This beguiling transformation seems too good to be true, and distributed systems based on blockchain face a conundrum.In modern large-scale P2P markets, trust and growth are at odds: The more a network grows, the less trust users often place in it. But user growth is essential to the success of the P2P platform economy.This problem can be solved by making it harder to join the network (reducing user growth) or by centralizing control to a handful of trusted coders or nodes (reducing decentralization). Unfortunately, the blockchain community seems to favor increased centralization.Apart from business-to-business platforms, which generally run on top of private blockchains where governance is centralized by design, the fastest, most secure and most rapidly growing P2P platforms are based on public blockchain networks \u2014 which are all centralized. A handful of people make and enforce the rules.For Ethereum, the largest public blockchain stack, adopted by thousands of P2P platforms, the situation is even worse. The top five mining pools secure as much as 80 percent of the transactions in the ledger. The developers are concentrated as well: 20 percent of Ethereum\u2019s core code was written by the same coder.Machine-driven trust is about to jump from systems controlled by tech giants to systems controlled by a small group of anonymous tech gurus.If only a few members have the ability to edit the system\u2019s ledger and control the protocol, where are the open, transparent, free-to-use and universally accessible blockchains that so many hoped would bypass third-party control and surveillance?Ultimately, this new frontier of managing trust in the digital world presents a rather stark choice: Either we bargain away our privacy to centralized but accountable trust providers or we keep direct \u201ccontrol\u201d of our data via a trust machine run by a limited group of anonymous people who could go rogue.These governance problems undermine the credibility of blockchain as a trust machine for the new P2P economy. It seems that synthetic trust among peers is not supported by a solid set of principles. This lack of trust inevitably atomizes the community and fragments group solidarity, as evidenced by the many chains that have forked off from the original protocols of Bitcoin and Ethereum.For the time being, there is warfare to control those blockchain systems, and not a new common good that the technology still has the potential to deliver.Paolo Tasca is executive director of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for Creative Play in a Digital Age", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CheckupA new statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents of young children to go for high-quality traditional toys rather than elaborate digital ones.Dr. Aleeya Healey, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Albany Medical College who was a co-author of the A.A.P. statement, said that the most essential message for parents was the importance of relationships in the lives of young children. \u201cThe less bells and whistles a toy comes with, the more it lends itself to creative play and imaginative play,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more the toy can do on its own, the more distraction it lends itself to.\u201dDr. Alan Mendelsohn, an associate professor of pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine who was a co-author of the A.A.P. statement, said that there is a great deal of overlap between screens and toys now, and \u201cparents are getting all of these messages about how screens and tablets and mobile devices and laptops are the thing that\u2019s going to help their children to learn and become advanced in their development.\u201dIn fact, he said, there is plenty of evidence that screens can cause problems if they interfere with parents and children playing together, and it\u2019s that playing together that matters most, both while the children are young and as they grow. \u201cSpending some time playing with your child or reading with your child builds the relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps them as things get more complicated in later childhood and adolescence.\u201dAs children get older, of course, they start to demand whatever bells and whistles are on offer. Those vintage Easy-Bake oven ads showed children \u2014 well, girls \u2014 producing spectacular spreads of layer cakes and cookies from the device, as Mother exclaimed in admiration. It was party time and the oven was the star.\u201cParents want to please their children, and children have very strong wishes, some a result of messaging,\u201d Dr. Mendelsohn said. \u201cI would recommend that parents strike a balance between trying to find toys that would make their child happy, but at the same time find toys that are going to be positive for the child\u201d and might lead to parents and children spending time together.When I was seduced by the Easy-Bake oven commercials, my mother said, of course, that any time I wanted to bake cookies, the family oven was at my disposal. My parents said, of course, that the things I baked would not look like the pictures on TV. My father said, of course, that they were only trying to sell me something.None of this mattered to me. I knew what it would take to change my life and get the party started, and it was the only thing I wanted, and ultimately, inevitably, when my 8th or 9th birthday came around, my parents bought me the Easy-Bake oven. You mixed a little packet of cake mix and poured it into a little tin pan and then you waited for the \u201ccake\u201d \u2014 which was the size of a large cookie \u2014 to bake over a light bulb.It took a while, as I recall, and when it was done \u2026 well, you know the story. You know the moral. My mother tried hard to simulate pleased surprise when the cakelets were displayed, but the oven was soon abandoned.I know that someone is reading this with profoundly fond nostalgia, remembering the joy of baking with her own plastic oven, recalling happy doll parties and extravagant midnight feasts. One person\u2019s ill-advised toy is another\u2019s golden childhood memory.One of the universals of play has always been imitation and approximation. The imitation baking that was depicted on the TV ads was so attractive that it trumped the real thing: I wanted the pretend oven, even though the real one was on offer. But in fact I would have had more fun doing real cooking \u2014 under parental supervision \u2014 or serving elaborate imaginary feasts to imaginary royal visitors, or to dolls or stuffed animals.\u201cImaginative play is where the magic happens,\u201d Dr. Healey said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ruth Haring, Top Chess Player Who Led Federation, Dies at 63", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRuth Haring, a top American chess player in the 1970s and \u201980s who played for the national women\u2019s team in five consecutive Chess Olympiads and became a rare female president of the United States Chess Federation, died on Thursday in Chico, Calif. She was 63.The cause was not immediately known, her son, Theodore Biyiasas, said. She had gone to the hospital a day earlier with symptoms of pneumonia, he said.Ms. Haring, the standout in a family of chess players, was chosen for the women\u2019s national team for the 1974 Chess Olympiad, a biennial tournament in which teams from all over the world compete. (The team did not win a medal that year.) The leading four or five women in the country were usually selected for the competition.That same year, Ms. Haring played in the United States Women\u2019s Championship, finishing second to Mona May Karff; it was the best result of Ms. Haring\u2019s career.She played in the next four Olympiads \u2014 in 1976, \u201978, \u201980 and \u201982 \u2014 and several other U.S. Women\u2019s Championships.Ms. Haring married Peter Biyiasas, a Canadian grandmaster, in 1978 after her marriage to Bill Orton ended in divorce. She and Mr. Biyiasas were living in San Francisco at the time and, seeking a steady income while starting a family, she reduced her tournament play and went to work for I.B.M. as a project manager. She later worked for Lockheed, TRW and eBay.She had three children with Mr. Biyiasas before the marriage ended in divorce in 2005. In addition to her son, Theodore, Ms. Haring is survived by two daughters, Lauren Biyiasas Eltoukhy and Christina Biyiasas Hudson; three brothers, David, Brian and Fred; her parents, Maryanne Magoon and Robert Haring; and her companion, Tom Kozik.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Theodore Biyiasas recalled his mother coming home from work one day to find that Mr. Fischer had found and analyzed all her tournament games. Mr. Fischer told her that she often played as if she were behind and needed to be more aggressive \u2014 to play to win.She returned to tournament chess in 2008.At the time, the United States Chess Federation, the sport\u2019s governing body, was emerging from a period of acrimony stemming from a series of lawsuits over an election of officers to its executive board. Ms. Haring decided to dive into chess politics.She was elected to the board in 2009 and two years later was elected president, becoming only the second woman to head the group.Beatriz Marinello, who led the organization from 2003 to 2005, said by email that it is exceedingly difficult for a woman to oversee the federation because the game is so dominated by men, an imbalance that spills over into its politics.\u201cShe became president to help heal the differences between people,\u201d Ms. Marinello wrote. \u201cHer strength was being willing and available to talk.\u201dAfter Ms. Haring\u2019s term as president ended in 2015, she remained on the federation\u2019s board for another year.Ruth Inez Haring was born on Jan. 23, 1955, on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, in Barnstable County. She learned to play chess from her father and her brothers, though she would surpass all of them in skill, Theodore Biyiasas said.When she was young, the family moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, and then to Fayetteville, Ark., where her chess career took off. She became president of the chess teams in high school and at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.Writing years later in Chess Life, the official magazine of the United States Chess Federation, Ms. Haring recalled that on most weekends from 1969 to 1973 she and family members would travel around the country by car, sometimes up to 700 miles, to play in tournaments.Ms. Haring continued to compete until recently, including in a tournament in November at the Sacramento Chess Club. Her son won it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Sees in Brazil Continent-Size Profits and Problems", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExpansion south, into the nation where Amazon\u2019s namesake river ends, may prove a little harder.\u201cAmazon is still kind of irrelevant here,\u201d said Raul Prado, a vendor in the rural town of Guaipava, Brazil, who has relied on online retail sites to build up his business. Less than 1 percent of his sales are through Amazon.Brazil, home to more than 200 million people and the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, is in many ways an obvious target for Amazon\u2019s next major expansion. Google and Facebook have done well in Brazil, but their digital services \u2014 search, social media and advertising \u2014 do not have to overcome the hurdles of selling goods and making deliveries.As a retail behemoth wading into the market, Amazon has found itself playing catch-up with local rivals that know how to navigate Brazil\u2019s distinct challenges: a complicated tax structure, high import costs and the headache of moving goods across a continent-size country.\u201cBrazil is really kind of the natural next country in terms of sheer size,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who was the director of Amazon research at Gartner L2, a business intelligence and research company, but has since left. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity, and they are laying the groundwork for that today.\u201dNext year, he said, \u201cAmazon is going to be all about Brazil.\u201d His prediction came with a caveat: \u201cBut it\u2019s no small undertaking.\u201dAmazon has been present in Brazil\u2019s online retail market since 2012, but until recently it focused on selling books and its Kindle e-reader. A little over a year ago, Amazon made a splash when it expanded to let third-party brands sell electronics directly to consumers on its marketplace.Shares in local competitors tanked following the news, but they later rebounded when it became apparent that Amazon wasn\u2019t on the cusp of rolling out the services that have helped make it a market leader in the United States: first-party sales, by which brands supply Amazon with products and Amazon is the retailer; and its fulfillment service, which packages and ships products from the company\u2019s warehouses.\u201cAmazon arrived a little late to the game,\u201d said Marcel Motta, the Brazil director of the global research company Euromonitor International. Local, established companies, he said, \u201cknow how to get around the obstacles.\u201dMercadoLibre, for instance, the e-commerce leader that first began in Argentina and modeled itself after eBay, has been in Brazil for 19 years.\u201cWe helped build e-commerce in this region,\u201d said Cristina Farjallat, the head of MercadoLibre\u2019s third-party marketplace. \u201cWe have portfolios of sellers and portfolios of consumers that no one else has.\u201dShe said the company had lured more sellers to its site than any other online retailer by working with vendors to create the tools they need. MercadoLibre has a roster of 12 million vendors and its own fulfillment service, and is rolling out a payment service to bypass banks and credit cards.The company helped Mr. Prado, the vendor, turn a modest business venture \u2014 selling satellite antennas door-to-door in his remote village, where cellphone coverage was virtually nonexistent \u2014 into a national enterprise, with 20 employees.\u201cHonestly, I had no idea what I was doing when I started, but MercadoLibre is the first site people open when they go on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the brand name, their own payment plan, the logistics infrastructure and they even offer loans to sellers.\u201dMr. Prado, who created his company, Lojas Mineiras, in 2008, now offers his satellite and telephone products through nearly a dozen online retail sites. More than half of his sales are made through MercadoLibre.That doesn\u2019t mean it will stay that way.This year, Amazon broadened its catalog of products, offering sporting goods, fashion and home accessories, and signed up some major brands \u2014 but all remain independently sold and delivered.As of November, Amazon had just under 1 percent of the market share in Brazil, and was ranked 10th behind online retailers that offer both first- and third-party sales, according to Euromonitor\u2019s research. MercadoLibre had 19 percent of the market share.Experts say the window for Amazon to establish itself as a major player in Brazil is closing, which is why they expect the company to make a significant push in the next year. The question is whether it\u2019s too late.Mr. Smith said he had heard from industry sources, including investors, that Amazon had acquired a lease on a large warehouse outside S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s biggest city; advertised more than 100 jobs, many of them high level; and started negotiations to sell American brands on its Brazilian site. Amazon declined to comment.\u201cJeff Bezos has always harped on the idea that as Amazon saturates the U.S. market, he can go to emerging markets around the globe,\u201d Mr. Smith said, referring to the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s coming. Amazon wants to have boots on the ground in Brazil.\u201dAmazon appears to be moving cautiously in Brazil: It has not had a new platform up and working in the country in time for the Christmas shopping season.\u201cAmazon wants all the pieces of its ecosystem in place first,\u201d Mr. Smith said.One of the major pieces is transportation. Brazil is larger than the continental United States, but its roads are poorly maintained and often flood during rainy season, and the state postal service is widely seen as inefficient and unreliable.Magazine Luiza, one of Brazil\u2019s top e-commerce companies, which began as a mom-and-pop store selling televisions, has said it had overcome these problems by leveraging its pre-existing and growing presence: It has 900 stores across the country.Those stores, which now sell appliances, electronics and furniture to working-class Brazilians, are being converted into mini-distribution centers for Magazine Luiza, and help educate shoppers about the ease of online retail.\u201cPhysical stores are a fundamental part of our platform. We have succeeded in cutting delivery time and price,\u201d said Eduardo Galanternick, the executive director of e-commerce at Magazine Luiza. \u201cWhen you go deep into the interior of Brazil, Magazine Luiza is often the only department store around.\u201dFor example, thousands of rural families use the Magazine Luiza store in Graja\u00fa, a city in northern Brazil\u2019s soybean country, to order appliances and pick up online orders like diapers and brand-name cosmetics.In addition to difficult competitors and terrain, Amazon will face thickets of regulation. Brazil\u2019s convoluted tax structure can make delivering goods across state borders a costly affair, while high import tariffs have priced many foreign-made goods out of reach for all but the wealthiest Brazilians.Nonetheless, the potential for growth \u2014 Brazil represents just 1.1 percent of global sales in online retail \u2014 is expected to attract major investments from Amazon and other companies.Euromonitor forecasts that the Brazilian market will nearly double over the next five years to $35 billion, and some competitors will be squeezed out as obstacles to online retail are eliminated.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of Amazon conforming to our market,\u201d Mr. Prado said. \u201cRight now, they can\u2019t compete. But you never know. I\u2019ll keep offering my products on Amazon, just in case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Last-Minute Shoppers Increasingly Trust Only Amazon to Deliver", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Olivia Zimmermann started her holiday shopping early this year, buying a Bluetooth speaker from Best Buy for her sister. It was supposed to arrive by Dec. 10, two weeks before Christmas.The speaker never showed up \u2014 and the post office said it had delivered the package to a different town. Best Buy apologized and offered to reship it. But Ms. Zimmermann, who works in marketing in Chicago, was over it.\u201cI just want a refund,\u201d she told the retailer, and then added: \u201cAt this point, I have already ordered from Amazon because I know for a fact it will be here when they say it will.\u201dAmazon is far and away the leader in e-commerce, outpacing competitors like Walmart, Target and eBay. But its dominance is never more pronounced than in the nail-biter last-minute sprint before Christmas.The company, based in Seattle, has had a two-decade-long obsession with shrinking the time from click to doorstep. It has built warehouses in more than 30 states and a sophisticated web of delivery methods, giving it a logistical advantage.Amazon has used that edge to lead people to expect near instant gratification that, for a while, only it could deliver. The company built trust in its delivery speed with its Prime membership, which costs $119 a year and includes two-day shipping. This year, in the days leading up to Christmas, Amazon\u2019s share of online sales will increase by almost 50 percent \u2014 to about half of all digital sales \u2014 while most rivals fade, according to the market research firm Rakuten Intelligence.\u201cAmazon\u2019s ability to fulfill more quickly and effectively than competitors has been a key differentiator back to the earliest days,\u201d said Kenneth Cassar, an analyst with Rakuten Intelligence, which is an independent subsidiary of the Japanese e-retailer Rakuten.Traditional retailers still enjoy strong sales when the holiday season begins around Thanksgiving. They advertise widely, luring shoppers with doorbuster deals. The promotions also drive sales to their websites instead of Amazon. Around Thanksgiving, Amazon\u2019s share of online sales can dip to as low as 20 percent in the United States, according to Rakuten.But as November turns to December, and then into Christmas crunchtime, shoppers\u2019 preferences change. Last year, Walmart and Target had their busiest online traffic of the month on Dec. 10. Amazon\u2019s was eight days later, on Dec. 18, according to an analysis by Griffin Carlborg, a researcher at the digital intelligence firm Gartner L2.Amazon\u2019s share of e-commerce sales tends to drop around Thanksgiving, and usually peaks about one week before Christmas \u2014 just enough time for packages to be delivered before the holiday. Amazon\u2019s quick delivery times may contribute to its popularity at Christmastime.Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 16Dec. 1650%20162017201840Amazon30CHRISTMASCHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVING10Best BuyTargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 16Dec. 1620162017201850%40Amazon30CHRISTMASCHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVING10Best BuyTargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 1650%2017201840Amazon30CHRISTMASCYBERMONDAYCYBERMONDAY20THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGBest Buy10TargetWalmartCostco0NOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4daysCostco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Share of all e-commerce salesDec. 16Dec. 1650%20172018CHRISTMAS40Amazon3020THANKSGIVINGTHANKSGIVINGBest Buy10TargetWalmart0CostcoNOV.DEC.NOV.DEC.Average delivery time from click to doorWEEK OF DEC. 2, 2018Amazon3.4Costco3.6Best Buy4.6Target4.6Walmart5.5Note: E-commerce includes all companies with the exception of Amazon Fresh, Ebay, Etsy, Instacart and Tesla.By: The New York Times | Source: Rakuten Intelligence\u201cAmazon has just built up its reputation around rapid fulfillment incredibly well,\u201d Mr. Carlborg said. \u201cCustomers really trust Amazon\u2019s fulfillment offerings.\u201dThose shoppers include Carissa Vinovskis, 26, who puts in 12-hour days researching diabetes at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. She used to shop for Christmas gifts in stores, but as she got busy with graduate school and later her job, she had less time and patience.Panic set in fast in the middle of this month when Ms. Vinovskis realized she had just six days to get presents before visiting her parents. She found a few cute things on Etsy \u2014 \u201cbeautiful, handcrafted gifts,\u201d she said \u2014 and then realized they would take about four weeks to arrive.\u201cI was like, welp, Amazon Prime it is!\u201d she said.An Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a statement in which the vice president who runs Prime, Cem Sibay, said, \u201cWe keep working to add faster and even more convenient delivery options.\u201dMr. Bezos saw that quick delivery could change how people buy things. Price and selection have always been important in retailing, but delivery would surpass store location as another critical factor.In 2005, Amazon began offering free two-day shipping for Prime members, which Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates covers more than two-thirds of households in the United States. Almost a decade later, it started Prime Now, which delivers goods in as little as an hour in 30 cities.Amazon now has over 110 fulfillment centers in North America, more than 250,000 warehouse employees and dozens of its own planes. It is setting up warehouses that hold tens of millions of items closer to major cities, letting it offer free same-day and one-day shipping on more products.These traditional retailers are leveraging their physical stores \u2014 a key advantage they have over Amazon \u2014 and providing ways for people to order online and pick up in person. That is particularly powerful in the final days before Christmas, when shoppers return to stores.For some Walmart purchases, customers don\u2019t need to leave their car to get their order \u2014 an employee will drop it into their trunk. Best Buy said more than 40 percent of its online revenue is from orders that are now picked up in stores. And on Christmas Eve, people can order products online from store inventory as late as 5 p.m. and pick them up just an hour later.Marshal Cohen, who advises retailers for the NPD Group, a market research firm, said three years ago, retailers rushed to match Amazon, offering free two-day shipping until just before Christmas \u2014 but didn\u2019t have their delivery partners sufficiently prepared for the rush.\u201cThey just clogged the system so badly and really disappointed a lot of consumers,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThat memory was pretty strong in a lot of consumers\u2019 minds when it comes to thinking about shopping online.\u201dAmazon is faster than every major competitor, though other retailers are speeding up. In 2016, Old Navy, which is owned by Gap, took about 10 days to deliver a package ordered during the week after Thanksgiving, Rakuten data shows. This year its packages showed up about three days faster. Walmart cut its delivery time from more than a week to six days over the same period. And Best Buy said 80 percent of its small packages now arrive in two days or under.(Rakuten\u2019s data excludes eBay and Etsy because the formats of their electronic receipts are harder to track.)Yet most retailers still have to work to win people\u2019s trust. Jessica Palazzo, who runs after-school programs near Hartford, Conn., bought her mother pajamas from Old Navy two years ago that were guaranteed to arrive before Christmas, but which didn\u2019t appear until January. Old Navy offered her 10 percent off her next order.This year on Black Friday, she put a pair of Gap pajamas into her online shopping cart \u2014 but then had a change of heart.\u201cThat\u2019s embarrassing if you come on Christmas and have nothing for somebody,\u201d Ms. Palazzo said. She ended up buying running socks and a running ear warmer for her mother from Amazon.Advertisement"}

But while the letter has to do with his Jewish identity and mankind\u2019s search for meaning, Einstein used the word \u201cGod\u201d only once in the letter, in the passage quoted above.Einstein wrote in the letter that he was disenchanted with Judaism, even as he said he was proud to be a Jew. In the letter, Einstein declared:\u201cFor me the unadulterated Jewish religion is, like all other religions, an incarnation of primitive superstition. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong, and in whose mentality I feel profoundly anchored, still for me does not have any different kind of dignity from all other peoples.

The Guardian said the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, an outspoken atheist, was one of the bidders who lost out.The God letter, written the year before Einstein\u2019s death, seems to outline Einstein\u2019s view of formal religion and the idea of a God who plays an active part in everyday life, answering individual prayers. \u201cHe did not believe in a God who went around choosing favorite sports teams or people,\u201d Mr. Isaacson said.But at other times Einstein described himself as \u201cnot an atheist,\u201d and the letter does not annul the seemingly spiritual characteristics of his thinking.She said he had been religious when he was a child but \u201clost his religion and science took over.\u201d\u201cEvery time he was asked if he believe in God, he answered cagily: \u2018I believe in Spinoza\u2019s god,\u2019\u201d she said, referring to Baruch Spinoza, a 17th-century Dutch thinker who drew from Jewish religion and history. \u201cIf you say \u2018I believe in Spinoza\u2019s god,\u2019 that\u2019s already saying you don\u2019t believe in what most people believe who believe in God believe. You believe the laws of nature are complete in themselves and contain all the answers.\u201dGutkind had made the case in his book that \u201cthe Jewish soul is perfect intellectually as well as spiritually,\u201d according to a review in Commentary magazine. \u201cThe mathematicized Einsteinian universe is Jewish as well as progressive, because it is anti-mythological.\u201d Commentary also noted Gutkind\u2019s \u201ceagerness to find salvation for modern man in the Jewish spirit\u201d (although the reviewer added that doing so induced Gutkind \u201cto make the most extravagant claims in its behalf\u201d).\u201cThe Jews are the only group to which he feels he could belong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he identifies with them because that is what he was born into, not because they are the chosen people.\u201dShe summarized the letter as \u201ca nice way\u201d to tell Gutkind, \u201cI don\u2019t think like you and I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re saying.\u201d She said that Gutkind\u2019s book had mentioned Einstein 11 times \u201cand holds up Einsteinian physics as the new overarching philosophy of the universe, of space and time.\u201dBut now it is more than 60 years later. What would Einstein say if he knew that the letter was being sold and that the auction house was hoping it would go for a seven-figure price?\u201cI have no idea what Einstein would think,\u201d Mr. Isaacson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like what Steve Jobs would think of the watch, or something.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It takes me a moment to identify it.I\u2019m feeling sorry for the Clintons.In the 27 years I\u2019ve covered Bill and Hillary, I\u2019ve experienced a range of emotions. They\u2019ve dazzled me and they\u2019ve disgusted me.But now they\u2019re mystifying me.I\u2019m looking around Scotiabank Arena, the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and it\u2019s a depressing sight. It\u2019s two-for-the-price-of-one in half the arena. The hockey rink is half curtained off, but even with that, organizers are scrambling at the last minute to cordon off more sections behind thick black curtains, they say due to a lack of sales. I paid $177 weeks in advance. (I passed on the pricey meet-and-greet option.) On the day of the event, some unsold tickets are slashed to single digits.I get reassigned to another section as the Clintons\u2019 audience space shrinks. But even with all the herding, I\u2019m still looking at large swaths of empty seats \u2014 and I cringe at the thought that the Clintons will look out and see that, too. It was only four years ago, after all, that Canadians were clamoring to buy tickets to see the woman who seemed headed for history.It\u2019s a sad contrast with the sold-out boffo book tour of Michelle Obama, who\u2019s getting a lot more personal for the premium prices. But introspection has never been within the Clintons\u2019 range.I can\u2019t fathom why the Clintons would make like aging rock stars and go on a tour of Canada and the U.S. at a moment when Democrats are hoping to break the stranglehold of their cloistered, superannuated leadership and exult in a mosaic of exciting new faces.What is the point? It\u2019s not inspirational. It\u2019s not for charity. They\u2019re not raising awareness about a cause, like Al Gore with global warming. They\u2019re only raising awareness about the Clintons.It can\u2019t be the money at this point. Have they even spent all the Goldman gold yet? Do they want to swim in their cash like Scrooge McDuck?The Clintons\u2019 tin cup is worthy of the Smithsonian. They hoovered more than $2 billion in contributions to their campaigns, foundation and philanthropies.\u201cWhat scares me the most is Hillary\u2019s smug certainty of her own virtue as she has become greedy and how typical that is of so many chic liberals who seem unaware of their own greed,\u201d Charlie Peters, the legendary liberal former editor of The Washington Monthly, told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t really face the complicity of what\u2019s happened to the world, how selfish we\u2019ve become and the horrible damage of screwing the workers and causing this resentment that the Republicans found a way of tapping into.\u201d He ruefully worries about the Obamas in this regard, too.Indeed, in the era of Trump, greed is not only good. It\u2019s grand. The stock market is our highest value. Mammonism rules.But watching the Clintons hash over their well-worn tale of falling in love at Yale Law School, I realize that it\u2019s not only about the money.Some in Clintonworld say Hillary fully intends to be the nominee. Once more, in Toronto, she didn\u2019t rule it out, dodging the question with a lame joke. She carries herself with the air of a president in exile. Her consigliere, Philippe Reines, has prodded reporters on including her name when they write about 2020 candidates.And Bill has given monologues to old friends about how Hillary knows how she\u2019d have to run in 2020, that she couldn\u2019t have a big staff and would just speak her mind and not focus-group everything. (That already sounds focus-grouped.)After losing to an orange puffer clown fish who will go down as one of the most destructive forces in American history and flushing the Obama legacy down the drain, that\u2019s delusional. Some Obama associates say the former president has some regrets about throwing his support solely behind Hillary and knows he misread the anger and frustration of voters.The Clintons refuse to be discarded. It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the center of the public scene and debate. The way that the whole thing came crashing down in 2016 is too hard for them to bear. They would like to rewrite the ending, but there is no way to do that.Nothing they have done lately suggests that they have learned anything, including their obtuse post-#MeToo comments about Monica Lewinsky, who has been far more candid and sympathetic in the 20th anniversary retellings of the impeachment saga. The Clintons are still unable to hold themselves accountable. The formerly golden couple who dominated their party for nearly three decades is traveling North America in a bubble, shockingly un-self-aware.Their pathological need to be relevant in America is belied by a Canadian arena, where stretches of empty seats bear witness to the passing of their relevance.It\u2019s a pity.Advertisement"}

I spend up to five hours a day just sourcing items, and now customers approach me to find pieces for them.\u201dThe hours thrifting at Goodwill centers, flea markets and secondhand stores have certainly paid off. The best piece he\u2019s found? \u201cA \u201990s Gianni Versace Venetian silk shirt that I got for $8. I sold it for $700.\u201d\u201cInfluencers for sure dictate what secondhand shoppers are looking for,\u201d Mr. Barnette said. \u201cThey might not always get the same high-end brands, but will create a similar look from that era with what is available to them through vintage.\u201dBut in an age where everything and anything is instantly re-sellable online, might the very concept of vintage be on the wane?Amber Butchart, a fashion historian and lecturer at the London College of Fashion, doesn\u2019t think so.\u201cI used to be a buyer at a vintage brand, and we were having this conversation 10 years ago,\u201d Ms. Butchart said. \u201cPeople have always been worried about the future of vintage fashion, and convinced it\u2019s over, that there will be no more vintage, but it\u2019s not going anywhere. There has always been a secondhand market, as long as humans have been wearing clothes.\u201dHowever, Ms. Butchart said, \u201cThe industry is definitely changing, and fashion cycles are becoming shorter. Before, the cycle was 20 years, but now it can be five. So we\u2019re seeing trends coming back as soon as five years later.\u201dBut who can name a bona fide trend of five years ago, anyway? What was happening clothes-wise in 2013 again? It is difficult to predict what the future of vintage will look like, and what styles will be remembered favorably from the last 10 years.\u201cWhen we\u2019re living through an era, it\u2019s quite difficult to have an overriding view of it as a whole. Or be able to imagine how future generations might look back on it,\u201d Ms. Butchart said. \u201cWe can\u2019t say that we won\u2019t be able to look back at the 2010s in the future, and recognize fashion from that period. That\u2019s never happened before in history.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described Depop, an online marketplace.

{"Headline": "America Could Lead the Transition to a Digital Currency Reserve", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewAfter spending decades as the dominant global reserve currency, the dollar\u2019s position is being challenged.The greenback\u2019s share of global central-bank reserves has declined in nine of the past 10 quarters, the International Monetary Fund reported in September. The slide is hardly new: It began a decade ago when European leaders attempted to replace the dollar with a euro-based \u201cbasket\u201d of currencies as the common global reserve.But the United States should not fight against the forces of globalization that challenge the dollar\u2019s reserve-currency status. Instead, it must seize the opportunity to incubate technologies that will enable future digital currencies, which could go on to power a transnational currency \u2014 perhaps the best next option for a future global reserve.Committing to this course would provide a check on attempts to supplant the dollar\u2019s role in the global financial system with other sovereign currencies. It would also put the United States at the heart of a more open and equitable financial system.There are lessons in America\u2019s technological history that should inform future policy relating to digital currencies. More than three decades ago the United States government supported the development of the internet. Doing so unleashed huge economic impact on America that can still be seen today in the successes of the nation\u2019s biggest technology companies. The digital financial revolution that the world is on the cusp of has the potential to be just as significant for job creation and economic development.Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, could prove to be as important to commerce as email and text messaging were to communications. New financial systems built on it could help connect people around the world who lack access to traditional banking services. And these innovations could be leveraged by developers in much the same way as entrepreneurs built web services on the internet \u2014 from eBay to Facebook \u2014 with the same enormous impact on the American economy.Countries around the world are racing to lead the next revolution in financial technology. While it is clear that the United States and companies like Coinbase were early entrants in this global movement, it is also true that many nations and individuals are jockeying for leadership. There are currently more than 1,400 digital currencies and tokens available, serving a variety of uses. Central banks from China to Sweden to Uruguay are considering issuing their own.America must maintain its leadership role by leading the way on research and development of cryptocurrency technologies \u2014 just as it did in the early days of the internet \u2014 rather than stifling it. And if it does, it could ultimately build dominant cryptocurrency technologies that become the backbone of the 21st Century financial system.Doing so could yield all sorts of wonderful possibilities. In the 21st century when a national market undergoes a major fluctuation, America could enable an alternative currency. It could make it easier for American farmers to sell to foreign customers without the friction of foreign exchange. And its development agencies, like U.S.A.I.D., could \u201cairdrop\u201d cryptocurrencies to hard-hit regions of the world that lack access to banking infrastructure.That the dollar is under pressure as the world\u2019s reserve currency should only lend more urgency to the endeavor, as America should not come to rely on global cryptocurrency technologies that have been developed by other nations. The United States can retain its leadership role in the global financial system \u2014 but only if it nurtures the development of the technologies that will underpin its future.Brian Brooks is the chief legal officer of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange.Advertisement"}
