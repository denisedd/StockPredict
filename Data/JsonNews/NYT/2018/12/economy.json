{"Headline": "Wall St. Rises in Day of Unsteady Trading as Global Markets Drop", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street fought its way back from early losses on Monday, as another volatile day of trading highlighted investors\u2019 unease about the global economy and corporate profits.After slipping by nearly 2 percent in the morning, the S&P 500 finished the day 0.2 percent higher. Markets in Europe and Asia, however, ended Monday in the red.Among other technology stocks, Microsoft shares climbed 2.6 percent and Facebook rose more than 3 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 0.7 percent.Worries about global economic growth, trade and the strength of corporate America have been battering stocks. While that\u2019s cause for concern, it is important to put slides like this in context.Volatility has tormented stock investors in recent days, as they assess the impact of a trade war that is grinding on and has the potential to slow the global economy. Market watchers cautioned against reading too much into the upturn on Monday.\u201cThe tendency is to look at days like today as a major trend shift,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm. \u201cUsually, going forward, they don\u2019t really add up or amount to much.\u201dOne trigger for the early decline on Monday was the news that Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, facing a certain defeat in Parliament, would seek to delay the vote on a deal for her nation\u2019s exit from the European Union. British lawmakers had been expected to vote on the plan on Tuesday.In London, the FTSE 100 dropped about 0.8 percent. The pound also fell against the dollar, hitting its lowest level since April 2017.Economic data released on Monday also provided investors with more evidence of a slowdown among export-based economies. Figures from Japan showed that the country\u2019s economy shrank more in the third quarter than initially reported, and data from China revealed a sharp slowdown in trade last month.Energy producers, meanwhile, tumbled along with crude oil prices. Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.4 percent. Financial stocks also fared poorly.In a sign that investors were less worried about the situation, semiconductor companies, which rely on supply chains in Asia and have become a barometer of investor sentiment about United States-China relations, rose on Monday. Advanced Micro Devices, for example, rose 2.7 percent.But China is just one of several worries investors are fixated on. Others are rising interest rates and already sluggish sectors of the American economy, like housing and autos.\u201cInvestors are focused on a lot of these walls of worry that are out there,\u201d said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis. \u201cUntil we get some clarity on some of those, the market\u2019s going to continue to struggle.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nearly 132 Million People Will Need Aid, U.N. Says in 2019 Appeal", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 Nearly 132 million people will need aid and protection in 2019, the United Nations said on Tuesday, opening an appeal for about $25 billion as more and more people are displaced by conflicts and protracted conflicts absorb most of the assistance.Mark Lowcock, the United Nations aid coordinator, said that one out of every 70 people on Earth will need assistance next year in seeking an increase in donations of about 10 percent, even though relief agencies are becoming more efficient.\u201cWe need to make it a bigger priority in 2019 to address the underlying causes of crises \u2014 insecurity, conflict, poverty, development failures, inadequate adaptation and resilience to climate change,\u201d he said.The biggest challenge in 2019 will be the three-year conflict in Yemen, which has driven millions toward famine and has given the country the status of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Next year, nearly 24 million people \u2014 three-quarters of the population \u2014 will need some form of assistance, Mr. Lowcock said.The number of people in Yemen receiving food aid from the United Nations each month climbed from three million people in 2017 to eight million this year and will rise to 12 million in the coming year, he added.The United Nations cited estimates that 57,000 people had died since the conflict started and close to four million people had been forced from their homes, including 600,000 people who fled Hudaydah, which is home to Yemen\u2019s biggest port and the target of an offensive by Saudi-backed forces.But the $4 billion in relief the United Nations hopes to deliver in 2019 to stave off a catastrophic famine is a fraction of what is needed to enable the government to resume core functions, including paying teachers and civil servants. Such support would need to continue for years to prevent the country from falling back into crisis, Mr. Lowcock said.With Yemen\u2019s warring parties expected to open peace talks this week, the negotiations and external support could take the edge off extreme suffering in the second half of the year but that included \u201ca lot of supposes,\u201d Mr. Lowcock said.The United Nations aid appeal was \u201cbased on what we think the situation will actually be, rather than wishful thinking about what we would all like it to be,\u201d he said.Yemen was the most extreme example of a significant rise in hunger. Between 2015 and 2017 the number of people facing a food crisis rose by more than half, to 124 million in 51 countries, the United Nations reported.The changing climate means that hunger is likely to remain a major concern in 2019, when an El Ni\u00f1o event, the Pacific climate cycle that typically amplifies heat and is usually associated with record-breaking temperatures, is expected, Mr. Lowcock noted. An assessment by the United Nations found that 25 countries were at high risk of drought, tropical cyclones and floods.The bigger cause of hunger remained conflict and insecurity, which displaced close to 69 million people in 2017 and drove up levels of poverty, malnutrition and disease, while hampering deliveries of humanitarian aid.In South Sudan, where the situation is among the most dire, five years of civil war had left five million people, or half the population, in need of food aid heading into 2019, the United Nations said.The horrific ethnic violence in South Sudan, which is estimated to have cost more than 380,000 lives and devastated its fragile economy, underscores another worrying trend: increasingly protracted crises that monopolize ever higher shares of available aid.In the past five years, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria and Somalia have absorbed more than half of all international humanitarian aid, the United Nations reported. Three years ago, conflicts that had lasted more than five years accounted for less than half the available aid; last year they took more than 80 percent.The trend is deeply worrying, James Munn, Geneva director of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in statement. \u201cHumanitarian assistance will never become anything but a band-aid solution,\u201d he warned, adding that the victims of conflicts need warring parties and countries with influence over them to find political solutions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sudanese Protests, After Days of Violence, Turn Anger Over Bread Toward Bashir", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut when Mr. Bashir then ended fuel and wheat subsidies, at the suggestion of international lending partners, protests broke out.And over the past week, festering public anger compounded by nearly 30 years of frustration over corruption and economic mismanagement has grown into demonstrations so big and widespread that some say they could topple Mr. Bashir\u2019s military government, or at least seriously challenge its legitimacy.Sudan, a predominantly Arab country on the edge of sub-Saharan Africa, entered its sixth day of protests on Monday, with more planned later this week, including a mass procession to the presidential palace, an elaborate Chinese-built complex opened only three years ago.The Sudanese Professional Association, the organization planning Tuesday\u2019s rally, said in a statement that it would submit a memorandum to the Parliament to \u201cdemand the regime to give up the political and executive power to the Sudanese people who flooded the cities with their sole demand to end the regime\u2019s 30 years of dictatorship.\u201dThe authorities have arrested 14 leaders of the National Consensus Forces, an opposition coalition, according to news reports citing its spokesman. The government has shut down internet service and social media sites, as well as universities and schools in the capital, in an apparent attempt to dissuade people from joining the protests.Protests had begun spontaneously and without apparent leaders, he said, but now, people were organizing themselves into a movement.A government spokeswoman said she would comment on the protests, but subsequent calls went unanswered.Many Sudanese have described hundreds of people lining up just to buy bread, withdraw limited amounts of cash \u2014 their salaries \u2014 from bank machines or sleeping in their cars for two days waiting to fill up on gas.Inflation has been so rampant, reaching an annual rate of 70 percent in November, according to government data, that many ordinary Sudanese can no longer spend money on meat or fuul, a staple food made of cooked fava beans. Some people now spend 40 percent of their income just on bread, Mr. Mohamed said.Sudan has a long history of street uprisings, two of which brought down the government. Recently, the country saw protests over rising fuel and bread prices in 2013 and earlier this year, but they were largely contained in the capital and snuffed out by the security forces.This time, the protests started in the eastern city of Atbara, a former locus of anticolonial and union activity. The demonstration then quickly spread to half a dozen cities.\u201cThe Bashir regime has been facing a crisis of legitimacy,\u201d said Zachariah Mampilly, a professor of political science at Vassar College and the author of \u201cAfrica Uprising: Popular Protest and Political Change.\u201dLast year\u2019s lifting of American sanctions came as the Trump administration said the Sudanese government had made progress on a number of issues, including counterterrorism.Washington said the country was also curbing its destabilizing activities in neighboring South Sudan, which split off as an independent nation in 2011. Sudan is also playing a central role in the United States-backed war in Yemen.But the United States is still keeping Sudan on its list of terrorism sponsors, which means it will not be granted debt relief, a major drag on the economy.The International Monetary Fund sent a team to Khartoum in July, and Sudan has started a series of reforms and austerity measures in line with its recommendations, including the removal of subsidies, to try to bolster the economy as it struggles with high inflation and a shortage of hard currency.The monetary fund has not yet agreed to a loan \u2014 one could follow further down the line \u2014 but has committed to technical assistance.\u201cThey thought they could address the economic crisis but could not foresee the political reaction\u201d that the effort would cause, Mr. Mampilly said.The measures by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were designed to alleviate economic suffering, said Ahmed Soliman, an expert on the Horn of Africa at Chatham House, a London-based foreign affairs institute. \u201cBut in the short term they have been harmful,\u201d he added. \u201cThe subsidies were meant to stimulate growth and companies to trade and that\u2019s not happening.\u201dIn part, Sudan is still suffering from South Sudan\u2019s decision to secede, taking with it nearly 75 percent of Sudanese oil reserves. Until the secession, oil revenues consisted of more than half of Sudan\u2019s revenues, Mr. Soliman said, and about 90 percent of exports.But the larger problem, many Sudanese say, is that Mr. Bashir\u2019s government, in power since a military coup in 1989, has not made any significant investments in infrastructure, agriculture or its people, though it has promised to build a museum recording the malign effects of American sanctions.Only 7 percent of the national budget goes to the health sector, for example, compared to 75 percent to defense, security and salaries and perks for senior officials, said Mr. Mohamed, of Justice Africa. The elite has stolen a lot of the wealth too, he added, an accusation government officials have denied in the past.\u201cThis regime has no ability to stop the protests by having economic reforms,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the structure of the economy is so corrupt that they don\u2019t have a clue how to run it.\u201d\u201cThe regime has hit a wall,\u201d he added, \u201cand they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Merkel\u2019s Party Picks Successor in Her Image: Wry, Moderate and a Woman", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 She is a moderate centrist with a humble leadership style and wry sense of humor. She does not boast. But she has a track record of forging unlikely consensus \u2014 and winning elections.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the new leader of Germany\u2019s most powerful political party and likely future chancellor, sounds a lot like the current one. That is her greatest strength and her greatest weakness as she prepares to take over from Chancellor Angela Merkel, a towering figure both loved and loathed inside her party and her country.Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union announced its new leader on Friday after a closely watched vote by party delegates who chose from a list of three candidates: Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer and two men who had vowed to take the party to the right.At a time when voters elsewhere in Europe and the world are clamoring for radical change and are turning to populist \u2014 and often male \u2014 leaders promising easy answers to complex global problems, Germany\u2019s biggest party on Friday opted for the opposite: a woman succeeding another woman with a nuanced political program that above all represents continuity and stability.But Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, who was handpicked by Ms. Merkel as a preferred successor this year and has been called \u201cMini-Merkel\u201d in the German media, will have to strike a careful balance in her effort to unite her party and ultimately her country.In one sense Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s victory over her two male rivals was an endorsement of Ms. Merkel\u2019s liberal legacy \u2014 and a mandate to preserve it.But it was an unusually narrow win. With nearly half the votes backing candidates who were openly critical of Ms. Merkel, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer will have to work hard to differentiate herself from the chancellor \u2014 and to emerge from her shadow.\u201cI have read a lot recently about what I am and who I am: Mini. A copy. Simply \u2018more of the same,\u2019\u201d she said Friday in an impassioned appeal. \u201cDelegates, I stand before you as the person I am, the person who life has shaped me to be, and I am proud of that.\u201dUnlike Ms. Merkel, who grew up in the former East as a Lutheran, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer hails from the West and is a Roman Catholic \u2014 as are most members of the Christian Democratic Union. And unlike Ms. Merkel, she has children.\u201cI stand here as the mother of three children, who knows firsthand how difficult it can be to combine family and a career,\u201d Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said. \u201cI stand here as a former interior minister, as education minister, as social affairs minister, as a governor, someone who over 18 years served her state and the people in her state.\u201dShe continued, \u201cIn these 18 years I learned what it means to lead, and that leadership depends more on inner strength than on the strength of your voice.\u201dHer fans see Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, whose unwieldy name is routinely shortened to A.K.K. in the German news media, as having the right mix of liberalism and conservatism to unite a restive party base.Her policies and life story offer a mix of views with appeal both to voters who like the more modern image Ms. Merkel has given the party and to those who hark back to its more socially conservative Christian roots.Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer had supported Ms. Merkel\u2019s 2015 decision to welcome a million migrants to Germany. But she adopted a tougher position in handling the roughly 7,000 refugees who arrived in her tiny home state of Saarland, drawing national attention.She required unaccompanied minors arriving without documents to undergo medical screenings to help determine their ages, and lobbied for officials in Berlin to deport anyone whose application for asylum had been rejected. Male Muslim refugees who refused to accept food from female volunteers should go hungry, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said.\u201cShe is able to maintain the Christian Democrats as a centrist party that includes people from different ends of the spectrum,\u201d said Daniel G\u00fcnther, the governor of the state of Schleswig-Holstein, who voted for her.On Friday, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, who once posed as a cleaning lady during Carnival, joking that she had been \u201cgiven a shift to clean up\u201d in Berlin, vowed to do just that.\u201cFor me there is no conservative and liberal party, not one that is pro-economy or pro-workers, not one for the East and one for the West,\u201d she said Friday to loud cheers. \u201cFor me, there is only the one union, the Christian Democratic Union, that is our family.\u201dCarsten Linnemann, head of the party\u2019s economic association, predicted, \u201cWe will now see a split.\u201dOthers worried that Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer simply lacked the political capital needed to bridge divides.\u201cShe won, but it was painfully close,\u201d said Dieter Schr\u00f6der, a party member, of Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s slim victory of 517 votes over 482 for Mr. Merz.Ms. Merkel has called herself a longtime \u201cadmirer\u201d of Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer. But political analysts argue that seeing her simply as a younger version of Ms. Merkel sells short a woman admired for her own political acumen.In her home state, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer has led coalitions with various parties, from the free-market Free Democrats to the Social Democrats, before becoming the Christian Democrats\u2019 general secretary earlier this year. As party leader, she is on course to become the party\u2019s candidate for chancellor during the next general election, scheduled for 2021.There is no guarantee that Ms. Merkel\u2019s fragile governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats will survive that long, but Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s election has made it more likely.\u201cIt shows that there is a great continuity in German politics,\u201d said Armin Laschet, the premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany\u2019s biggest state. \u201cThere is no fundamental wish to change things.\u201dAnd, he said, it sends a \u201cstrong signal\u201d to women to have another woman succeed Ms. Merkel.Hours earlier, Ms. Merkel gave her final speech as party leader, marking the end of an era. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born as chancellor and party leader,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, as party members in the audience waved signs reading, \u201cThank you Ms. Chairwoman.\u201d\u201cI am filled with one overwhelming feeling: a sense of gratitude,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cIt was a great joy and a great honor for me.\u201dMs. Kramp-Karrenbauer fought back tears as she took the stage after Friday\u2019s vote. Then, in a gesture demonstrative of the team spirit she had pledged to uphold, she invited her two challengers to join her on the stage.\u201cThe question will be whether we are willing to leave our comfort zone and have the courage to do what the people of this country are waiting for,\u201d Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said, before ending on an optimistic note: \u201cWe can do this. We want this. And we will do this, if that is what you want.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They\u2019ve been dealing with this hassle ever since Tom\u2019s brother died and left his young children in their care.What with their go-go global lifestyle \u2014 so many planes to catch, so many TED Talk-style lectures to give \u2014 they\u2019re a less than ideal choice, guardian-wise. Surely the children\u2019s upbringing is an obligation they can outsource?\u201cWe\u2019re really looking for someone to take over the kids completely,\u201d Tom tells Abigail shortly into the job interview, and if he speaks with the obliviousness of the egregiously entitled, that doesn\u2019t deter the levelheaded nanny from signing on.The children, Miles and Flora, live with a housekeeper at Tom and Evelyn\u2019s country home, and soon Abigail moves there to join them. In the interest of full disclosure, her new employers might have mentioned that the place is riddled with ghosts.Spookiness is scarce, though, in \u201cStrange Window: The Turn of the Screw,\u201d a multimedia adaptation of Henry James by the Builders Association that shifts between the contemporary world and the 19th century. With a few clever tweaks to her outfit, the modern Abigail (Lucia Roderique) becomes the governess from James\u2019s \u201cThe Turn of the Screw.\u201d (Costumes are by Andreea Mincic.)The novella \u2014 in which the bizarre tale of the governess is a story within the story, told to a gathering of friends at Christmastime \u2014 is so unnerving that you wouldn\u2019t want to read it alone late at night. But this production by Marianne Weems, at the BAM Harvey Theater through Dec. 15 as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s Next Wave Festival, comes alive only when it leaves the Victorian era for our own.In the contemporary timeline, Tom (Sean Donovan) and Evelyn (a deliciously shallow Hannah Heller) regularly rate Abigail\u2019s performance on an app, though they\u2019re less scrupulous about paying her on time \u2014 never mind the hazardous duty she has pulled, trying to keep ghosts from preying on the children. (Miles and Flora are played by Joe Solava and Finley Tarr, but their lines are voiced by Mr. Donovan and Ms. Heller.)And when the illiterate housekeeper, Mrs. Grose (Moe Angelos), is corralled into one of Evelyn\u2019s lectures like a human lab specimen into a science experiment, Evelyn whispers outrageous contempt right into her ear.\u201cYou\u2019re nothing,\u201d Evelyn says, so far over the line that of course it\u2019s funny. \u201cYou\u2019re no one. You can\u2019t even read, and I\u2019m not paying you to be here.\u201dClass privilege and the gig economy are two of the primary concerns of \u201cStrange Window,\u201d written by James Gibbs. The precarious position of women who work as household help is of particular interest, with both iterations of Abigail cowed, straitened and ultimately stranded, and yet expected to be ladylike at all times.These themes are more teased than developed, though, and the play\u2019s two very disparate strands fail to twine together meaningfully.Visually and aurally, it\u2019s a striking production. (The set is by Neal Wilkinson, copious black-and-white video by Austin Switser, lighting by Jennifer Tipton, sound and original music by Dan Dobson.) But the chaotic layering of video and live performance foils the Victorian sections of the show.If a ghost story is going to frighten people, it needs to draw them close. \u201cStrange Window\u201d keeps us at a puzzled remove.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. as Talent Scout: Unorthodox Hires, and Maybe Lower Pay", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that piqued his interest.It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 featured the term \u201cdata science\u201d nowhere.Instead, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold\u2019s software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model.The idea is not to focus on job titles, but \u201cwhat skills they have,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou\u2019re really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it.\u201dThe power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market \u2014 not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract.Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers \u2014 even for hard-to-fill roles \u2014 whom they might not otherwise have come across.And while that could also help some candidates, there\u2019s a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring.\u201cYou get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,\u201d Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have to compete for them as much.\u201dFor years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions.While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates.But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don\u2019t explicitly appear on a candidate\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9.To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn\u2019t list the skill on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.By performing a similar exercise across an entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the company\u2019s software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales).Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn.Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance \u2014 say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft.Intuit did not respond to a request for comment.The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner.\u201cThe tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,\u201d Ms. Villanueva said. \u201cWe keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit.\u201dIn the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold\u2019s software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master\u2019s degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in data science.\u201cWe have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,\u201d Mr. Garg said. \u201cYou can predict what they\u2019re likely to do next very easily.\u201d He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data.Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster.Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence.\u201cWe surface people we think would be good draft picks,\u201d rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. \u201cThis person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you.\u201dMr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates.In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly.Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master\u2019s degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages.\u201cThat could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don\u2019t need anything special here,\u201d Mr. Horton said.Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point \u2014 call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren\u2019t compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism.If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height.The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players \u2014 the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs \u2014 not the general population.Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee.But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting.Google says it uses machines to take a second look at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles.The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can\u2019t claim. \u201cWe now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,\u201d he said.Cade Metz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Bubble Bursts, Consider the Anti-Bubble", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are nations and industries in sound economic shape that are ignored by investors because they are not all about tech. Maybe that is about to change. Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.One answer, in any transition period like this one, is to look to anti-bubbles. Bubbles are driven by hype about the hot new thing and defined by mania, including unusually heavy trading and prices rising at an unusually rapid pace and reaching a level that can\u2019t be justified by underlying growth in the economy or company. Anti-bubbles are the mirror image, taking shape in overlooked corners of the world and defined by light trading, with prices stagnating at low levels despite solid growth in the economy or company.To be clear, anti-bubbles do not include legacy companies like department stores and newspapers whose very existence has been thrown into doubt by competition from tech giants. Anti-bubbles encompass countries and companies that would seem to have bright futures but that struggle to attract the attention of investors.Historically, the biggest stock market returns came in the fastest-growing economies. But that pattern changed in recent years, as investors chased technology at the expense of everything else. The highest returns came in slow-growth countries such as Taiwan. The lowest came in fast-growing economies like the Philippines. The reason: Taiwan is a tech-driven economy, the Philippines is not.But as big tech begins to crack, that behavior is beginning to change. Stock markets from the Philippines to Indonesia have started to emerge from anti-bubbles. And in the United States, sound industries that had been left in the dust by the tech giants are starting to make a comeback among investors, too, including telecommunications, real estate and consumer staples. It is not clear where they go from here, but it is not unusual for stocks caught in an anti-bubble one decade to perform well the next.In the 1980s, Japan was widely predicted to be the next dominant economic superpower. Though it accounted for only 15 percent of global economic output, Japan was sucking in nearly half of all the money invested in stock markets worldwide. The United States, where the economy was almost twice as large and growing robustly, was struggling in vain to escape the shadow cast by Japan. It was trapped in that era\u2019s anti-bubble. By the end of the decade, however, the Japan bubble had popped and the United States was poised to take center stage. The next big bubble rose in the United States during the tech craze of the late 1990s, which generated another series of anti-bubbles, particularly in companies and countries that relied for growth on commodities like oil and iron ore. By the end of the decade, big oil companies and commodity-driven economies from Brazil to Russia, rocked by sinking prices, had fallen off the radar of global investors, and their stock prices were dragging bottom. Though the boom in this period was lifting a particularly broad segment of companies and countries, anti-bubbles were as usual forming in overlooked corners of the world. Tech firms, in particular, had been shunned since the dot-com bust, and their stocks were lagging behind the rest of the market. A decade later, dot-com survivors like Apple and Amazon were at the forefront of a new tech boom. If the mood of a bubble is manic, as overexcited investors drive daily trading volumes skyward, the mood of an anti-bubble is the opposite, marked by little trading at all. In a telling sign of the current anti-bubbles, the markets of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia together trade less than $1 billion a day, compared with about $6 billion a day for Apple alone.There are many more anti-bubbles. Poland is a high-growth economy with low debt and a small deficit that is also light on technology companies. Yet among emerging markets, Poland continues to stumble along at lows last seen in the early 1990s, when it was struggling to recover from the fall of Communism. Mexico is another economy facing no obvious threat of financial crisis. Yet money has fled its stock market, helping to drive the peso close to lows last seen during the \u201ctequila crisis\u201d of 1994.The bright side of anti-bubbles is that they are very cheap places to go on vacation. In Mexico City, travelers can get a fancy hotel room for the equivalent of $80, a fancy meal for $15.Anti-bubbles share one thing with bubbles: They don\u2019t last. Eventually, people recognize that prices are out of whack, and adjust accordingly. They go back to looking for inexpensive growth stories, and find them among the forgotten countries and companies.Bubbles are compelling drama, in which the lead characters are always racing excitedly toward a sudden fall. Much less has been written about anti-bubbles, which are in their way equally compelling tales of underdogs moving quietly toward surprising comebacks. The big book on anti-bubbles doesn\u2019t yet exist, but this would be a good moment for it to be written.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Markets Tumble, Tech Stocks Hit a Rare and Ominous Milestone", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Facebook, Apple or Google looked shaky this year \u2014 as investors worried about growth, regulation or mismanagement \u2014 the rest of the market felt it. In recent weeks, as these companies have succumbed to concerns about the global economy, slowing profits or privacy concerns, they have led the decline in stocks.Now, technology companies are dragging stocks into an ominous territory that investors have not seen in nearly a decade: a severe decline known as a bear market.The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed on Friday at 6332.99, down almost 22 percent from its August peak, meaning it has officially entered a bear market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both of which also include the biggest tech companies, are not far behind after falling 17.5 percent and 16.3 percent from their respective highs. After a month of heavy losses, stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008.Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy. In the last 20 years, there have been only two \u2014 one that began with the financial crisis in 2007, and the other that started with the dot-com bust in 2000. Market downturns can gather steam even without strong evidence that economic and corporate fundamentals are weakening.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a feedback loop,\u201d said Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now, we\u2019ve seen some declines, and that emboldens some pundit to say, \u2018This is it.\u2019 They get attention, it puts thoughts in people\u2019s minds and they start thinking, \u2018Maybe I should exit.\u2019\u201dThe Nasdaq is not the only group of stocks in such distress. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks shares of smaller companies, entered a bear market earlier this week. Seven of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 industrial sectors are also at the level, led by energy stocks, which are down 28 percent from their highs earlier this year. That\u2019s in large part because oil has been in a bear market since November.If the broader stock market declines by more than 20 percent this year, it would end what was, by some measures, the longest bull run in history. From March 2009 until its peak in September, the S&P 500 surged 333 percent, a rally that provided a silver lining to the lackluster years that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Investors enjoyed trillions of dollars of gains from the stock market.Those profits are not close to being wiped out. The stock market is still well above where it was even at the start of 2017. But the longer bear markets last, the more pessimism they spread.The mood in the markets can change. The most recent bear markets have not lasted as long as some others in the past. During the two previous bear markets, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to stimulate the economy by slashing interest rates. Investors came to believe that corporate profits would recover and dived back into stocks.The current stock plunge is taking place at a time when the central bank is signaling that it will keep raising interest rates because the economy remains strong, with unemployment near 50-year lows. But on Friday, an influential Fed policymaker said the central bank would keep a close eye on financial markets as it set interest rates.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go into the new year with eyes wide open, willing to read the data, listen to what people are saying, and to reassess the economic outlook,\u201d John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with CNBC.The sudden downturn in technology stocks has many of the attributes of the sell-offs that periodically smash hot sectors in the stock market. But it also signifies how investors have taken a dimmer view of corporate America and the broader economy.They are far below those levels now. Apple is now worth around $715 billion. Amazon has lost nearly a third of its value since hitting its high, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is down 23 percent.Trade tensions and a possible slowdown in the global economy are prompting investors to wonder whether technology companies will grow as fast as expected. Expectations that iPhone sales in China could slow eroded Apple\u2019s value, while Facebook\u2019s slip-ups over data privacy and misinformation have drawn scrutiny from angry governments and made investors nervous.\u201cYou can\u2019t grow at huge percentages forever,\u201d Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said of the tech sell-off. \u201cPlus, I think that whether it\u2019s regulation, whether it\u2019s fear of the global slowdown, those kinds of things have played into it.\u201dAnd there is also the simple fact that they had risen so far so fast. When fear descends on the market, investors often sell the shares that have gone up the most, and at its August high, the Nasdaq was up more than 50 percent from the date on which President Trump was elected.\u201cToo many people had piled on the same side of the boat,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York. \u201cTypically when that happens, the boat tips over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Vanishing Mayor", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "Mayor Bill de Blasio spends far less time at City Hall than he once did, leading some city officials to ask: Has the mayor lost focus?Supported byThat, it turned out, was no easy ask: In two and a half years, the commissioner, Joseph Esposito, had not sat down for a one-on-one meeting with Mr. de Blasio, according to the mayor\u2019s public schedules. On Monday, the two finally met at Gracie Mansion to discuss Mr. Esposito\u2019s fate.The dispute over Mr. Esposito\u2019s status is another recent example of how Mr. de Blasio has maintained a diminished presence at City Hall, allowing his attention to stray more and more. And with a diminished focus at the top, there are signs, as with the Esposito episode where he delegated the task of firing the commissioner to a deputy mayor, that the practical mechanics of government are running less smoothly.Mr. de Blasio, in fact, rarely meets with many of his commissioners, according to the schedules, at times making it difficult for department heads to advance new ideas at City Hall, or to inform the mayor about problems at their agencies.The mayor\u2019s arm\u2019s-length relationship with agency chiefs is in keeping with a broader pattern: He has been making fewer and fewer appearances at the office.In 2014, Mr. de Blasio spent an average of 19 days a month at City Hall, a busy first year in office that included the creation of universal prekindergarten, the mayor\u2019s signature accomplishment.But each year, the mayor has shown up less and less. In 2015, he averaged 17 days a month at City Hall; in 2016 it fell to 14; last year, it dropped to nine. This year, through September, Mr. de Blasio averaged 10 days, according to his official schedules.In July, he was at City Hall for just five days. Above all, the mayor seems to like his getaway days; Mr. de Blasio was at City Hall just four of the first 39 Fridays this year, according to the schedules.In a telephone interview, Mr. de Blasio strongly defended his management style and focus, saying he had set ambitious goals early in his first term and has continued to deliver results on programs such as early childhood education, affordable housing and improving police-community relations.\u201cAnyone who watches what I\u2019m doing understands that every hour, every day, including weekends, I\u2019m focused on this work, which is why we\u2019re getting done what we are getting done,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.With just over three years left in his term, the mayor said he has a \u201chuge, ambitious agenda\u201d that he believed had his administration \u201cat a great level of intensity working to get it done. I certainly am.\u201dHe rebuffed criticism that he lacked a clear vision for his second term. \u201cThere is an animating vision, which is to be the fairest big city in America,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that people in the administration understand as a mandate.\u201dIn July, he created a political action committee, Fairness PAC, to support national Democratic candidates, and to pay for out-of-state political travel for himself and his wife, Chirlane McCray, such as their weekend trip to Vermont where the mayor appeared at an event sponsored by Bernie Sanders.While the mayor was away, Mr. Esposito\u2019s status remained uncertain. Finally, on Monday night, after the situation had been well publicized, the mayor\u2019s office released a statement saying that Mr. Esposito would stay on the job while the city searched for his replacement.\u201cPeople feel distracted by his interest in focusing on the other stuff, the political stuff,\u201d said one city official who spoke, like several others, on condition of anonymity in order to protect relationships in government. \u201cIt\u2019s distracting to those trying to get the work of government done.\u201dTo be sure, the mayor is busy. The schedules show about the same number of total entries each year \u2014 more than 2,000 scheduled activities annually, including meetings, phone calls, speeches, parades, policy announcements, news conferences and out-of-town travel. He often holds public events around the city. For a week in July, the month he barely set foot in City Hall, he traveled each day to Staten Island for a series of events called \u201cCity Hall in Your Borough.\u201dBut more often, the schedules show the mayor staying away from City Hall, where his senior aides work and where commissioners and department heads are frequently present.In the past 12 months, the mayor has not met with the commissioners of the departments of buildings, parks, city planning, youth and community development and the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, according to the schedules.He does meet regularly with the schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, and the police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, according to the schedules, which have been made publicly available through August. But even some agency heads with urgent portfolios have not met the mayor.Eric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, said that several of the agency heads who do not appear on the schedules, including Mr. Esposito, had attended briefings or other sessions with the mayor, but he did not provide details or explain why the meetings were not logged in the schedules.Mr. de Blasio has shifted many of his meetings to Gracie Mansion, which often requires a dozen or more high-level officials whose offices are in City Hall or elsewhere in Lower Manhattan to travel uptown. Aside from the unproductive use of their time to travel back and forth, the officials are also often kept waiting for the mayor, who regularly runs late.Such scheduling keeps Mr. de Blasio and his visitors behind the wrought-iron gate of Gracie Mansion, out of view from both the press and the public.\u201cI have found it\u2019s a very productive place to get work done,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in the interview. \u201cThere are fewer interruptions. There\u2019s more ability to focus on strategy and get the solutions. City Hall is a wonderful place, I\u2019ve spent a lot of my life there and I\u2019m there on a regular basis, but it is a place filled with a lot of interruptions and distractions.\u201dBut more than a dozen current and former city officials and civic leaders said in interviews that they were concerned about the mayor losing focus, and they noted that few new ideas or initiatives had been proposed in his second term \u2014 certainly nothing on the scale of universal prekindergarten.Last month, voters approved three ballot proposals backed by Mr. de Blasio to enact some of these reforms; the mayor said these results showed that the public understood and embraced his vision.Other administration officials also disputed that the pace had slowed at City Hall, pointing to the many programs that have continued from his first term, including one to build and preserve 300,000 units of affordable housing, the Vision Zero initiative to prevent traffic deaths and the creation, albeit delayed, of new homeless shelters.Officials said that the mayor had made a decision with this year\u2019s budget to continue spending on signature programs that he started in his first term, in particular early childhood education, rather than commit future spending to new, big-ticket items.His proposal, known as 3-K, to expand free schooling for 3-year-olds will require a large amount of financing as the number of children covered increases; the mayor did not want to put in place new programs that might take money away from that, especially given uncertainties about the economy and federal and state financing of the city budget.Still, the lack of big new ideas has been widely remarked upon by politicians and local leaders, and some, including the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, have filled the void.\u201cIn the era of term limits, you have to work at continuing to be relevant on the issues facing the city,\u201d said Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, noting that Mr. de Blasio cannot run for a third term. \u201cAs time goes on, people begin to look past your administration.\u201dMr. Stringer, who, like Mr. de Blasio, is a Democrat, said that the mayor has little time to articulate a vision if he wants to carry it out before he leaves office. By early next year, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to need to hear what the last leg of the journey is going to be about. He has to have a laser-beam focus and an agenda for us to get behind.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Normal: It\u2019s a Buyer\u2019s Market", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "With the luxury real estate market in a funk and the rest of the market weakening, what works now? Price cuts, sweeteners and pop-up yoga classes.Supported byThree guests arrived for the recent opening of a three-bedroom rental in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan, with an asking price of $12,589 a month. But no one brought a checkbook \u2014 likely on account of the yoga pants.Such is the state of New York\u2019s luxury housing market, where repurposing, rebranding and, crucially, re-pricing luxury apartments has become the new normal. Amid a glut of new inventory, deals are still happening, but not before buyers and renters exact their pound of flesh. And with continued uncertainty about the economy, rising mortgage rates and the prospect of higher taxes looming, the market isn\u2019t likely to improve soon.So what hath the buyer\u2019s market wrought?Price cuts are deepening, and agents expect more sellers to bend next year. Some developers are negotiating sweeteners, like offering to pay transfer taxes or common charges for a year or more. The rental market shows improvement, but uncertainty remains.And the slowdown has convinced a growing number of developers to get creative with empty apartments \u2014 enlisting tech start-ups that flip unleased rental units for extended-stay travelers or turning unused living rooms into makeshift amenities. Others have doubled down on high-end marketing, while some have delayed listing properties altogether. Even film and TV crews are in on the act, as location scouts turn increasingly to empty luxury apartments for inspiration.Through the first three quarters of the year, 84 percent of ultraluxury listings \u2014 the priciest 10 percent in Manhattan \u2014 sold below the original asking price, up from 65 percent in 2015, when the market was riding high, according to StreetEasy. The median price cut remained unchanged at $500,000, which could suggest sellers need to cut deeper still, said Nancy Wu, an economic data analyst for the company.\u201cIt feels worse when you\u2019re out in the trenches,\u201d said Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, which puts out a weekly report on contracts signed on properties seeking $4 million and up. That segment has taken an average of 441 days to go into contract so far in 2018, the longest stretch since at least 2013, when similar homes spent 172 days on the market. Through Dec. 2, $4 million-plus homes were reduced on average by 9 percent before a contract was signed, but Ms. Olshan believes that after sellers make additional concessions, the actual discount is closer to 15 or 20 percent.She predicts that 2018 will finish with 6 to 10 percent fewer $4 million-plus contracts signed than last year, when 1,172 were signed, and roughly 20 percent fewer than during the peak year of 2013.Some are taking aggressive steps to jump-start sales. Last month, the luxury developer Extell announced that it would pay three years of common charges on its one- and two-bedroom apartments and up to five years on three- to five-bedrooms that go into contract before the end of the year \u2014 a sizable incentive, considering the company owns some of the most expensive condos in the city, including the upcoming 179-unit Central Park Tower in Midtown. Prices there are expected to start at $1.5 million for a studio, according to filings with the state attorney general\u2019s office. The most expensive units have not yet been revealed, but the annual common charges for a five-bedroom asking $78.1 million would be $127,596, according to the filing, or almost $638,000 over five years.Extell ran a similar promotion in some buildings last year, but has since extended the offer to its entire portfolio, said Tamar Rothenberg, a senior vice president with the company, adding that the push was partly prompted by a \u201csignificant amount of product\u201d on the market. In many cases, however, winning concessions from sellers is like pulling teeth.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to tell an owner who wants $8.5 million that it\u2019s worth $6 million,\u201d said Frances Katzen, an agent with Douglas Elliman. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear it, and they usually end up firing the agent.\u201dBut cut they must. Nikki Field, an agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, represents the second brokerage to work on selling the 10,000-square-foot, triplex penthouse at 212 Fifth Avenue, in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan. In 2016, it languished at $68.5 million. Ms. Field and her team came on the following year and raised the price to $73.8 million, but by this November they had re-listed it for $62.8 million, an $11 million discount.In addition to lowering the price, they furnished the formerly raw space with more than $5 million in furnishings and art, from luxury brands like Fendi Casa and Bugatti Home to works by Carroll Dunham, the painter and father of the actor Lena Dunham. \u201cHowever you boil it down, it\u2019s all about price,\u201d said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime Manhattan Residential, who notes that most new units on the market would benefit from a price cut of at least 10 percent. At 100 Barclay, an Art Deco condo conversion in TriBeCa, where sales began in 2015 and where the developer is still unloading new units, Mr. Dankner is listing a three-bedroom resale for $4.09 million.His clients, who bought the apartment in 2017 for $4.35 million, will be taking a loss at that price, but they have agreed to Mr. Dankner\u2019s strategy, because they are competing with similar but more expensive new units in the same building, not to mention the broader market.\u201cYou have to be nimble enough, and eat some humble pie,\u201d said Mr. Dankner, who first listed the unit in September for $4.65 million, and has since dropped the price four times, by increments of 3 to 4 percent. He said he was confident they would have a deal in the next few weeks.With new competition coming to market, coupled with general buyers\u2019 hesitance, time is of the essence for sellers. \u201cAsking too much and passing that three-month point is death,\u201d said David Walker, the chief executive and a founder of the brokerage Triplemint.His agency has recently urged clients, especially those with homes priced over $4 million, to hold off officially listing their properties for about a month, while Triplemint quietly builds interest and gets feedback from prospective buyers. The hope is to get qualified bidders, and a sense of the property\u2019s real worth, before wasting days online.To find motivated prospects, the agency aggregates user data from its website and pulls from a mix of third-party subscription services to narrow down a list of likely buyers. Mr. Walker would not reveal the sources of the data, but similar strategies have mined consumer purchases to find people who might be more likely to buy real estate because of a major life event like marriage or pregnancy.\u201cNone of these things mattered in 2017, when the market was stronger,\u201d he said.Softness in Manhattan\u2019s luxury market has helped the rental market in recent months, but there is still cause for concern.In October, the rental vacancy rate fell to 1.49 percent, the lowest level for that month in nine years, according to a Douglas Elliman report. But that also marked the 41st consecutive month in which the share of landlord concessions had increased over the previous year. Some 41 percent of leases included sweeteners for renters, like a month or more of free rent, up from 28 percent in the same period last year. And over the next several years, more than 22,000 rentals are expected to be built in Manhattan, about half of them currently in some stage of construction, according to Nancy Packes Data Services. In some cases, hard-to-sell condos are seeking renters in the short term, which adds more competition to the rental market, said Jennifer M. Stutz, of Olshan Realty. While the rental market improved last quarter, she said, heading into 2019 \u201cit\u2019s still up in the air.\u201d \u201cWe bring them a new type of demand,\u201d said Alexandros Chatzieleftheriou, a founder and the chief executive of Blueground, noting that the softening market has been a boon for business.For instance, the company leased a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea that might have rented unfurnished for $5,000 a month. It signed a multiyear agreement on the unit, outfitted the space with stylish furniture and amenities like a stocked bar cart and espresso machine, and now rents the space for roughly $6,000 a month. The developer fills an otherwise empty unit, and Blueground turns a profit.\u201cWhat I was paying in hotels was substantially more,\u201d said Jared Anderson, 36, who lives in Florida, but travels to New York weekly for his work at a furniture company, and signed a one-year lease on the space.\u201cI would say it\u2019s pricey, but you get what you pay for,\u201d said Ali Kole, a cosmetics consultant from Boulder, Colo., whose company paid for her one-bedroom in the same building, for $6,450 a month \u2014 shorter stays have higher premiums. No complaints otherwise: After a three-month stay, she leased another unit in the building for three more. (The company\u2019s apartments are not regulated like Airbnb units, because the shortest lease agreements are for one month.)Other start-ups, like hOM, the yoga and social events planner, have given developers and landlords another use for vacant space. At Aalto57, the luxury rental tower in Sutton Place, residents attending an intimate yoga class sat in lotus position, barefoot on the new hardwood, facing an expensive Bertazzoni gas range in a luxury three-bedroom apartment. The unit was listed in November for $12,589 a month, and is offering two months of free rent.The events are a way to boost tenant retention in the building, said Francesca Loftus, the company\u2019s chief executive. Property managers pay hOM a subscription fee, from $2,100 to $30,000 a month, to plan events for residents in amenity spaces and unused apartments. The company currently holds about 50 classes a day, in more than 50 residential buildings in New York. (The majority of the classes are in residential buildings, with about a third in unused apartments.)\u201cThere\u2019s this sort of word-of-mouth marketing benefit,\u201d said Scott Marino, the executive director of multifamily management for Rose Associates, the property manager. Residents who take classes in such units might someday want to upgrade, he said. Other builders have developed an affinity for Hollywood. The Durst Organization began fielding requests from movie and TV producers to film in its buildings about five years ago, said Jordan Barowitz, the company\u2019s vice president of public affairs.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more interest in the residential side, as of late,\u201d said Mr. Barowitz, adding that the company has brought in \u201cwell north of seven figures a year\u201d through the agreements.Recent shoots at Via, the developer\u2019s Far West Side luxury rental tower with an unusual pyramidal facade, have included Bollywood sagas and an upcoming Netflix project. The productions pay from $5,000 for a few hours in an amenities space or apartment to $100,000 for a multiday shoot, Mr. Barowitz said.Via leased its final units about a year and a half ago, Mr. Barowitz said, but it has had more vacancies recently, as several two-year leases expired. He stressed that the company\u2019s growth in the film world isn\u2019t tied to the strength of the rental market; it is simply an arrangement that has created another revenue stream.At the Hub, a rental tower in Downtown Brooklyn, a homegrown film director found inspiration in a vacant penthouse.Spike Lee recently filmed an episode of the forthcoming second season of the Netflix series \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d in a two-bedroom apartment listed for $6,643 a month. That apartment, and the rest of the building, is now leased. Tim Stacker, the location manager for the series, said he had noticed an uptick in developers offering empty apartments for film shoots.\u201cNew developments are attractive to film and TV, because you don\u2019t have to deal with existing tenants, the units are empty, it looks pristine,\u201d said Douglas C. Steiner, the Hub\u2019s developer, who is also the chairman of Steiner Studios, one of the largest film studios in the country.\u201cI\u2019m hoping not to have empty units,\u201d Mr. Steiner said. But the film business hasn\u2019t treated him poorly either, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s found money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Who knows? But in recent months, the anxiety that we could be in for a replay of 1929 \u2014 or 1987, or 2000, or 2008 \u2014 has become palpable not just for the Aspen set, but for any American with a 401(k).What might prove the pinprick to the \u201ceverything bubble,\u201d as doomers like to call it? Could be anything. Could be nothing. Only time will tell if the everything bubble is a bubble at all. But, just a decade after the last financial crisis, here are five popular doom-and-gloom scenarios.Happy holidays!The problem is: The whole system is now running in reverse. The Fed has been hiking rates and spooking markets in order to stave off inflation and other potential ills. Is this an overdue fit of fiscal sanity, or the equivalent of taking away the punch bowl just as the party was getting started, then dumping it on our heads?It could happen.

{"Headline": "Global Growth Cools, Leaving Scars of \u201908 Unhealed", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo much for all that.Yet in declaring that \u201cthe global expansion has peaked,\u201d the brains at the O.E.C.D. effectively concluded that the current situation is as good as it gets before the next pause or downturn. If this is indeed the high-water mark of global prosperity, that is likely to come as a shock to the tens of millions of people who have yet to recover from the devastation of the Great Recession.Though the slowdown appears mild, it also holds the potential to intensify the widespread sense of grievance roiling many societies, contributing to the embrace of populists with autocratic impulses. In an age of lamentation over economic injustice, and with political movements on the march decrying immigrants as threats, weaker growth is likely to spur more conflict. Slower growth is not going to make anyone feel more secure about the prospect of robots replacing human hands, or jobs shifting to lower-wage lands.\u201cIt\u2019s just going to exacerbate the tensions that have led to the socioeconomic and political problems we have seen in the United States and parts of Europe,\u201d said Thomas A. Bernes, an economist at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian research institution. \u201cInequality is going to become even more pronounced.\u201dIn Greece, Spain and Italy, the youth unemployment rate is stuck above 30 percent. In Britain, the typical worker has not seen a pay raise in more than a decade, after accounting for inflation. South Africa\u2019s economy is smaller today than it was in 2010, and now the country is ensnared in recession.In the United States, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7 percent, its lowest level since 1969. Yet so many people have given up looking for work that less than two-thirds of the working age population was employed as of October, according to the Labor Department. That was a lower share than before the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cWe see a lost generation,\u201d said Swati Dhingra, an economist at the London School of Economics. \u201cThere was already wage stagnation and productivity stagnation. The trade war has exacerbated all of that.\u201dThe biggest risk to global growth appears to be that the trade war is, at least in part, working as designed.But it has thrown sand in the gears of China\u2019s industrial juggernaut. As of September, China\u2019s rail freight usage, bank lending and electrical consumption had increased about 9 percent compared with the previous year, down from a pace of more than 11 percent in January.China\u2019s growth was already slowing as its leaders seek to transition from an economy powered by prodigious exports, in enterprises that have spewed pollution, toward a cleaner future propelled by domestic consumption. But the American tariffs have prompted multinational companies to shift orders from Chinese factories to plants in other lands, from Vietnam to Mexico. Uncertainty over the future has postponed some business.\u201cThere\u2019s now potential for bad news on the trade front to trigger shifts in equity markets and a pullback on investment,\u201d said Steven J. Davis, an international business expert at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Given that China is the world\u2019s second largest economy, the consequences of its slowing ripple out widely, helping explain a pronounced drop in factory orders in Germany. American farmers have suffered lost sales as China has responded to tariffs by slapping duties on imports from the United States, not least on soybeans. Stock markets and oil prices have plunged in part on fears that China will buy fewer goods.In lifting interest rates, the American central bank has been acting under the accepted wisdom that too much easy money sloshing around for too long tends to produce trouble, from higher prices to financial mischief. Yet the effect of raising rates is to limit American economic growth, hence Mr. Trump\u2019s unhappiness.The European Central Bank has also been withdrawing the cheap money it unleashed to attack the crisis, phasing out purchases of bonds. This has made credit more expensive across the continent, depriving businesses of capital needed to finance expansions. And that has muted once-hopeful talk that Europe had finally transcended the torpor of the last decade.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like watching a heavily overweight bird try to take off,\u201d said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. \u201cIt staggers to the end of the runway and starts to take off but never really soars.\u201dThe same can be said for the global economy. It is clearly far removed from the terrifying days of the financial crisis. Yet it never really got its groove back enough to generate impressive numbers of jobs, or put meaningful pay increases in the pockets of ordinary people.And now, despite all that, leaner times are unfolding.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Tango, With Consumption and Growth as Dance Partners", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareRobust performance of the services sector offsets slowdown pressures on GDP.Slowdown \uff0d what slowdown?That appears to be the typical response of observers of the Chinese economic growth trajectory these days.As the world\u2019s second-largest economy \uff0d 82.71 trillion yuan ($12.06 trillion) in 2017, up 6.9 percent \uff0d weans itself off exports and increasingly becomes consumption-driven, sectors like services are hogging as much limelight as traditional growth engines like manufacturing and infrastructure, areas that some believe are troubled now.\u201cStable income growth will support consumption growth at a steady level, providing a sound base for the overall economy this year,\u201d said Liu Aihua, spokeswoman for the National Bureau of Statistics.For economists, concerns over a potential debt-bubble-burst no longer hold terrors, it seems. Focus is now on the success of the reform and opening-up policy, and fresh measures to sustain high growth rates by nipping potential risks in the bud and stoking expansion of emerging business segments.Among such measures, the push to services has caught economic pundits\u2019 attention. For, within services, segments like extracurricular education are seeing enormous demand and recording runaway growth.This is raising hopes that the annual gross domestic product or GDP growth targets \uff0d around 6.5 percent for 2018 \uff0d will likely be achieved no matter what, experts said.Skeptics may question such views, but a quiet street in western Beijing appears to bear subtle but convincing testimony that experts\u2019 optimism about the Chinese economy is well founded.A crowd of young parents and their kids converges here on a Saturday morning in November. They are eager to find their way through a passage that leads up to a modern shopping mall. The main gate is still closed, but a cavernous tunnel-like passageway leads the children and their parents to the third floor.Their destination is an area that is home to more than 20 kids\u2019 training centers. These new-age for-profit business ventures target children aged 3 to 16. There are baby swimming centers, painting workshops, dancing classrooms and so-called robot innovation centers.Gao Ruixue, a young mother, watches through a glass wall as her 5-year-old daughter tiptoes gingerly in a ballet classroom. \u201cFortunately, we were not late this time,\u201d she said.It\u2019s a big deal for parents such as Gao to be able to find a place for their kids in training centers like this one. They spend a great deal of money, energy and time to ensure that. In doing so, they help keep the wheels of macroeconomy turning. Gao drives 9.3 miles to bring her daughter to the 9 a.m. ballet class. During the two-hour class, parents like Gao sit and wait outside the arena.The scene is more or less the same outside every center: Long lines of parents on benches, and groups of parents standing because there are not enough chairs to sit on. They share small talk, a sense of achievement and a bit of anxiety.\u201cI just paid 28,000 yuan toward next year\u2019s tuition fees for my daughter. It\u2019s for 90 hours, but the price could have been higher had I paid it late,\u201d said Gao.As soon as the dancing class finishes, she whisks her daughter away to another center next door, this time for an English-language class.Not surprisingly, Gao\u2019s smartphone embeds her family bank account, which she accesses every now and then to pay this bill or that. Gao and her husband pull in some 40,000 yuan in post-tax monthly income, of which 30 percent, or 12,000 yuan, is spent on the girl\u2019s training bills.And 10,000 yuan, or a quarter of their monthly income, goes toward mortgage repayment. \u201cA second child is on our minds, but we\u2019re not sure if we should try, given the financial implications,\u201d Gao said.The significance of the thriving new-age learning centers gets amplified in the shopping mall, where fashion stores and the like have been shuttered due to high rents.But executives of learning centers are unfazed. \u201cWe have more than 1,000 kids on our rolls,\u201d said Wang Yuxuan, a sales consultant of the ballet training center. \u201cWe don\u2019t worry about the rent. We will open a new branch next year as the membership keeps growing.\u201dAccording to a Tencent research report based on a survey of 1,500 Chinese families, about 22 percent of families\u2019 annual income goes toward children\u2019s expenses on average. And education accounts for the largest part of that chunk.Children\u2019s extracurricular education as a consumption item is growing at 21 percent annually. Child-related consumption in China is likely to be a 4.5 trillion yuan market this year, Tencent said in its report.If that comes to pass, it would be equivalent to more than 10 percent of total retail sales in China, which are expected to grow nearly 9 percent this year to 40 trillion yuan.This, economists agree, spells glad tidings. For, China\u2019s exports and fixed-asset investment are facing slowdown pressure this year.Consumption has thus come to be seen as one of the pillars on which headline GDP growth rests, economists said.Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that in the first three quarters of this year, per-capita spending in China reached 14,281 yuan, up 8.5 percent year-on-year. The growth rate itself is higher too \uff0d it was 7.5 percent in the first three quarters of 2017.Almost 11 percent of residents\u2019 per-capita spending was on education, cultural and entertainment-related consumption, NBS data showed.Chinese residents\u2019 per-capita disposable income rose to 21,035 yuan in the January-August period, from 19,342 yuan a year earlier.Some economists believe traditional economic sectors could still drive growth to around 6.5 percent, this year\u2019s target. NBS data showed new business activities relating to knowledge capability, economic vitality, innovation and the internet economy have been growing stronger, easing concerns over risks exerting downward pressure on growth.\u201cThe internet economy, especially e-commerce, maintains exuberant growth momentum, along with emerging consumption patterns like niche online shopping,\u201d said Ye Jingyi, a senior economist with the NBS.China remains the world\u2019s largest e-commerce market with online sales in the first quarter of this year reaching $307.4 billion, up 35.4 percent year-on-year.In the U.S., online retail sales in the first quarter reached $123.6 billion, up 16 percent year-on-year, according to a report from PwC, a global professional services network.Goldman Sachs forecast that this year, consumption in China may contribute 4.9 percentage points of the expected GDP growth rate of 6.6 percent, higher than 4.5 percentage points last year. But consumption is likely to slow next year, and is estimated to contribute 4.3 percentage points of the GDP growth.The \u201cstill-solid labor market and steady wage growth\u201d could support the positive expectation on Chinese consumption in 2019, said MK Tang, an economist with Goldman Sachs.As per NBS data, the unemployment rate fell marginally this year. \u201cOur wage tracker suggests nominal wage growth stabilized at around 7.2 percent year-on-year this year, after moderating for three to four years since 2013. This should offset some of the downward pressures,\u201d Tang said.Recent surveys by the NBS and the central bank suggested that the consumer confidence level edged down of late, as reflected in fewer urban bank depositors willing to consume.According to a Goldman Sachs report, expectation of further weakening in fixed-asset investments, especially in infrastructure, is likely to accelerate policy support measures to protect growth.\u201cWorries about a possible comeback of the debt-driven growth model, or a diminished economic role of private enterprises, weigh heavily on investors\u2019 minds. Policymakers need to strike a fine balance between averting a sharp slide in growth and preventing a fast debt buildup,\u201d GS said in its report.Chen JiaThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}
{"Headline": "Shutdown Might Not Have Much Immediate Impact on the Economy", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe shutdown could also contribute to the growing sense of worry on Wall Street, in part by raising fears about the ability of Congress to manage a more consequential deadline: the need to authorize an increase in government borrowing before the federal debt reaches the current limit, most likely in March.President Trump appeared unfazed by an economic threat his critics contend is of his own making and that he initially said he would \u201cown.\u201d\u201cWe are totally prepared for a very long shut down,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday, as he continued to insist he would veto any government funding bill that did not include money to build a wall along the border with Mexico.The direct economic consequences of the shutdown are modest in the aggregate. Congress has already approved funding for roughly three-quarters of the federal government, which will not be affected. Standard & Poor\u2019s, the credit rating firm, estimates that shutting down the remainder could shave $1.2 billion off gross domestic product each week the government is closed. That is a very small fraction of the nation\u2019s annual economic output, which will be around $20 trillion this year.But it could inflict pain on as many as 500,000 government employees, who could be temporarily out of work during the holiday season. Those who live paycheck to paycheck or had been waiting to amass more funds before paying large bills could face a difficult choice between spending less and borrowing more.Before the shutdown began, businesses around Washington that cater to government employees were bracing for the worst and tiring of the annual shutdown theatrics that tend to occur around Christmas.\u201cIt costs billions of dollars every time they do this, not to mention the impact on consumer confidence every time they threaten to do this,\u201d said Mike Brey, the owner of two Hobby Works shops in Maryland.\u201cThere are two things we don\u2019t want or need this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cIce storms and consumers worried about whether they\u2019re going to be getting their paychecks.\u201dPast government shutdowns have also caused scattershot disruptions to the broader economy.The most recent prolonged shutdown, in October 2013, lasted 16 days. Some people\u2019s lives were largely unaffected. Others were significantly inconvenienced. The beginning of the Alaskan crab-fishing season was delayed by four days, a significant setback for the region\u2019s fishing fleet. Head Start centers serving 6,300 children closed for up to nine days. Four Nobel Prize-winning scientists were forced to shutter their government research laboratories for the duration.An earlier pair of shutdowns also caused disruptions. From November 1995 to January 1996, parts of the government were closed for a total of 26 days. The government stopped processing requests for tourist visas, costing airlines millions of dollars in lost revenue. The courts suspended work on 3,500 bankruptcy cases, leaving financial lives in limbo. The National Park Service estimated that seven million people were forced to postpone or forgo visits to a national park.Although the government experienced two shutdowns earlier this year, S&P notes that such a closing could be more precarious this time around because the fiscal stimulus of the $1.5 trillion tax cuts that Congress passed last year is starting to fade.The White House is so far portraying a sense of calm. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview on Friday that the effect of a brief shutdown would most likely represent a \u201crounding error\u201d on fourth-quarter economic growth, which he projects to be near 3 percent.Mr. Hassett, who spent part of his Friday digging through data about previous shutdowns, said that the longer-term effects on federal workers would be minimal because those workers would almost certainly be repaid. After past shutdowns, Congress has voted to pay federal workers for the hours they did not work, and it could do so again.Mr. Hassett also said he was unconvinced by studies that showed a significant spillover effect of a government shutdown into the private sector.\u201cThere have been many negotiations like this in the past, and we\u2019ve looked back at the way they\u2019ve been covered, and it looks like people were much more hysterical about what might happen than what in retrospect would have been logical,\u201d he said.But the shutdown over funding for a border wall could indicate rough times ahead in Washington. Republicans now hold majorities in both chambers of Congress, but the difficulty of passing legislation could increase next year when Democrats take control of the House.Among the most consequential fights will be over the statutory debt limit, which Congress extended to March 2. Emergency measures to reduce the need for borrowing could allow the administration to extend the deadline until the summer, but no longer.Since Republicans used the debt limit to extract concessions from President Barack Obama, some analysts predict that Democrats could try to use it as leverage with Mr. Trump. A standoff over the debt limit has the potential to be more calamitous than the clash over funding the government because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of the United States defaulting on its obligations.A shutdown \u201cportends a difficult set of negotiations going into the debt ceiling, which can be much more problematic than a shutdown for the faith and credit of the United States economy,\u201d Christopher Campbell, a former assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department who left this year, said on Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End the Innovation Obsession", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of our best ideas are in the rearview mirror. Mr. Sax is an author. TORONTO \u2014 A year ago I stepped into the Samcheong Park Library in Seoul, South Korea, and saw the future. The simple building in a forested park had a nice selection of books, a cafe at its center and a small patio. Classical music played while patrons read, reclining on extra-deep window benches that had cushions to sit on and tables that slid over their laps so that they could sip coffee and eat cheesecake while gazing at the leaves changing colors outside. Seoul is one of the most modern cities in the world, a place suffused with the latest inescapable technology. This library was specifically designed as an antidote to that.\u201cWhat\u2019s so innovative about that?\u201d a friend who works for the library here in Toronto asked when I showed her pictures. Innovation to her meant digital technology, from drones and movie-streaming services and 3D printers, which the library was constantly showing off.\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t they both be innovative?\u201d I asked.We are told that innovation is the most important force in our economy, the one thing we must get right or be left behind. But that fear of missing out has led us to foolishly embrace the false trappings of innovation over truly innovative ideas that may be simpler and ultimately more effective. This mind-set equates innovation exclusively with invention and implies that if you just buy the new thing, voil\u00e0! You have innovated! Each year businesses, institutions and individuals run around like broken toy robots, trying to figure out their strategy for the latest buzzword promising salvation.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]True innovation isn\u2019t just some magic carnival of invention, like a Steve Jobs keynote with a pretty toy at the end. It is a continuing process of gradual improvement and assessment that every institution and business experiences in some way. Often that actually means adopting ideas and tools that already exist but make sense in a new context, or even returning to methods that worked in the past. Adapted to the challenges of today, these rearview innovations have proved to be as transformative as novel technologies.Look no farther than the streets of New York, which have been radically redesigned over the past decade to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians with bike lanes and car-free zones. These ideas aren\u2019t new. They were espoused by city planners and activists more than half a century ago, when Robert Moses was crisscrossing the city with expressways, bulldozing neighborhoods in the name of the car\u2019s transformational technology. At the time Jane Jacobs and other advocates of slower, friendlier streets were dismissed as Luddites. It took more than 50 years of evidence, accidents and political courage to realize what a colossal mistake the Moses approach was and to begin to undo that with proven ideas in people-centric urban planning that aim to bring cities back to those who live in them.Perhaps the best examples of rearward innovation are edible. The culinary story of the past several decades is dominated not by the scientific improvements we were promised, but by a return to food and drink\u2019s more delicious past. Traditional cooking, craft beer, heirloom vegetables and grass-fed beef have brought food forward by turning back. We take this as gospel today, but during the 1980s, when pioneering artisan bakers like Nancy Silverton and Jim Lahey were trying to get the world to abandon Wonder bread for traditional sourdough, their ideas were radical and innovative, and ultimately changed the way many of us cook, shop and eat.These innovations aren\u2019t mired in the past. They are solutions firmly focused on the future \u2014 not some technocentric version of it, where we invent our way to utopia, but a human-centric future that reflects where we\u2019ve been, what we\u2019ve learned and how we actually want to live. If that means we build more libraries in parks, then we are moving in the right direction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He\u2019s Handing Over the Presidency but Not Necessarily His Power", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKINGAKATI, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 His favorite dish is Nile perch \u201c\u00e0 la Congolaise\u201d prepared by a Flemish cook, on his farm in a private safari park populated by lions, rhinos and, rather incongruously, camels.He enjoys watching the N.B.A. and gets on with little sleep. He reads \u201ceverything,\u201d said an adviser, who nonetheless added slyly, \u201cexcept Machiavelli.\u201d He likes zooming around on his motorcycle in Kingakati, where his farm is, and is enthusiastic about legalizing cannabis for medicinal purposes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country he has led for nearly two decades.When asked recently whether he consumed any recreationally, President Joseph Kabila grinned playfully and replied, laughing: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a Catholic.\u201dAn interview with Mr. Kabila recently, along with other snatches of information, dished out sparingly by various members of his entourage, offered glimpses into the Congolese ruler\u2019s inner world, a partial portrait, at least, of a man who, even after 17 years in power, still remains largely an enigma.The president generally keeps his cards close to his vest, according to people who have dealt with him. He recently surprised a gaggle of Anglophone journalists, first by agreeing to be interviewed for the first time in about a decade, and then by letting slip that he could see himself returning to power in the future.Congo\u2019s constitution bars him from running for a third term in a row, a rule that he insists he has respected, even though he has already delayed the coming elections by two years.\u201cWell, I am not going to rule out anything in life,\u201d he said somewhat cryptically, sipping water at a reception organized for the journalists in the presidential palace in Kinshasa, the capital. \u201cAs long as you are alive and you have a vision, you should never rule out anything.\u201d\u201cWill I be active and wanting to achieve what is there to be achieved?\u201d the president said. \u201cYes, definitely. I\u2019d like to be available for my country. The job is not over at all.\u201dOutside, a statue of his father, Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, a former rebel fighter turned authoritarian leader, rises in front of the sprawling complex, an index finger pointing at the sky as if he were about to sound a warning. Just a few days earlier, at least three people were killed in clashes with the police on the sidelines of an opposition rally, and a fire broke out in a building in the capital, where voting materials are kept. Around 8,000 of the 10,000 machines expected to be used for the city were destroyed, officials said, adding that the voting would go ahead anyway.Earlier, Mr. Kabila had appeared suddenly in front of reporters, having kept them waiting for hours in a stifling hallway in the presidential palace. He sported a white-tinged beard and was a plumper, older, slightly more tired version of the broad-shouldered, clean-shaven man whose portrait hangs virtually everywhere here, from hotels to supermarkets. (\u201cDo I have to lose a little weight?\u201d he asked, patting his stomach.)Over the summer, Mr. Kabila stunned the nation by naming as his favored successor Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, a former interior minister whose name resonates little beyond political circles in this country two-thirds the size of Western Europe. Mr. Shadary, considered to be a hard-liner, was said to have been chosen because he is malleable and has weak ties to the army and security services, two forces deeply loyal to Mr. Kabila.Mr. Shadary, who was targeted by a fresh round of sanctions by the European Union last week for brutally repressing protesters last year, is one of 21 candidates seeking the presidency and a whopping 30,000 candidates scrambling for presidential, legislative and provincial seats throughout the nation.According to a recent poll conducted by the Congo Research Group at New York University, Mr. Shadary trails the two leading opposition candidates. But he is expected to win, nevertheless.The opposition has been severely weakened and divided by the defection of two prominent candidates who broke ranks to form their own ticket.The ruling coalition, the Common Front for Congo, built by Mr. Kabila, has far more firepower and has co-opted enough members of the opposition to hold sway over the election, said an American diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing protocol.Mr. Kabila \u201cwill have at least two levers,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cParty leadership and personal patronage leadership to continue to protect his interests.\u201dCritics say that Mr. Shadary, referred to as the \u201cdauphin,\u201d from the French word meaning heir to the royal throne, is simply keeping the presidential seat warm for Mr. Kabila, much in the way Dmitri Medvedev did in 2008 for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who was also facing a two-term limit.Mr. Kabila insists that the elections will be fair and transparent. When asked whether he would accept an opposition victory, he replied, nodding slowly: \u201cYes, definitely, definitely, definitely.\u201dBut many Congolese are skeptical, and some expressed horror at the prospect of another Kabila presidency down the road.\u201cIt will be a catastrophe for the republic, because for 17 years his regime was characterized by corruption, impunity and the violation of human rights,\u201d said Georges Kampiamba, president of the Congolese Association for the Access to Justice.\u201cPresident Kabila has no obstacles from returning to power in 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law is clear. He can come back if he wants to.\u201dFranc Ngoma, who scrapes out a meager living selling prepaid phone cards in Kinshasa, said he wanted to see the back of Mr. Kabila. \u201cIt\u2019s a president who does not communicate with his people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have jobs. If he comes back, I\u2019ll move to Angola.\u201dElectronic voting machines, made by a South Korean company and used in Congo for the first time, have raised concerns that they may be more vulnerable to vote rigging than paper ballots. Given the scarcity of electricity in parts of Congo, there are also worries that swathes of the population could be disenfranchised.The president has been widely credited for bringing stability to a country that was torn apart in what is commonly referred to as the \u201cGreat African War,\u201d a bloody conflict in the late 1990s that left millions dead and many more displaced.The younger Mr. Kabila, trained as a soldier, invited foreign companies to invest in minerals like copper and cobalt, helping the economy quintuple during his tenure.Mr. Kabila had a promising start, said Jason Stearns, director of the Congo Research Group. \u201cHe liberalized the economy and brought unification and growth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could fly, make bank transfers, phone from the east to the west\u201d of the country.In 2006, he oversaw the first multiparty elections since independence. He helped set up democratic and electoral institutions, and guaranteed freedom of speech.\u201cThen came the reckoning,\u201d Mr. Stearns said. \u201cIt became clear that the democratic institutions were just a facade. The reality of most institutions is that they are there to distribute patronage, not to secure the safety of citizens.\u201d\u201cThere are still challenges in as far as consolidating peace,\u201d Mr. Kabila said in a moment of candor. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same challenges we had 20 years ago.\u201dBack at the reception, as reporters tried to glean some more personal information about him, he was asked what his favorite movie was.\u201c\u2018Apocalypto,\u2019\u201d he replied promptly, referring to an action-adventure movie co-produced by Mel Gibson about a Mayan hunter who makes a daring escape after being captured for a ritual sacrifice.\u201cAnd in the end, he lives, no?\u201d Mr. Kabila said.Steve Wembi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Strategy for Dealing With Trump: Warn Him About China", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s new government has a strategy for dealing with President Trump.Don\u2019t anger him. Don\u2019t cave in to him. Try to get him to help fund an ambitious investment plan to stem migration by creating jobs in Central America.And if Mr. Trump cannot be persuaded, Mexican officials said in interviews that they would remind him that there is another player in the region willing to step into the vacuum: China.That, in a nut shell, is the approach the Mexican government is betting can defuse the standoff over the thousands of migrants amassed at its border with the United States, hoping to make it across.Mexico\u2019s plan to try to raise money to develop Central America and southern Mexico was announced last week, when Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the country\u2019s new president, introduced what he called a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d to address the root causes of Central American migration: a $30 billion initiative to invest in the region and welcome migrants into Mexico with visas, health care and employment.Mexican officials have compared the proposal to the plan to rebuild postwar Europe. This approach would represent a break with Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s predecessor, who considered giving in to Mr. Trump\u2019s demands and allowing people seeking asylum in the United States to remain in Mexico while they wait.And Mexico\u2019s new plan is, in many respects, the opposite of Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to crack down on migration, which includes building a wall, deploying the military and cutting aid to Central America.In speaking about the contours of their new policy, Mexican officials told The New York Times that they would not force a confrontation with Mr. Trump by demanding that he accept the migrants onto American soil; that would only anger the American president, and he would not do it anyway, they said.But at the same time, they said they were not going to strike a deal with the United States to keep asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border. That would allow Mr. Trump to claim a victory Mexican officials are not willing to give him. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to aggravate already strained relationships with the Trump administration.Instead, they want to change the focus of the conversation to expanding the economy of Central America and the south of their country by marshaling public and private investment to build infrastructure, develop the energy sector and create jobs in the region so people do not have to stream north in the first place.They acknowledge that it may be difficult to convince the Trump administration to invest large sums in the region, a proposal they have only recently broached with American officials.The Mexican strategy to rely on the United States\u2019 concerns about China\u2019s expanding influence in the region reflects a growing sense in Mexico that it can no longer take cooperation with the United States for granted.Both the White House and State Department declined to comment on the Mexican proposal.\u201cFor a long time there has been this competition within Latin America for influence, where China is willing to invest billions in infrastructure and energy that the United States simply isn\u2019t,\u201d said Duncan Wood, the director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center.The proposal is also a reflection of the distinct personalities of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and Mr. Trump: Both are mavericks \u2014 albeit on opposite sides of the political spectrum \u2014 and both are willing to break with long-established conventions.\u201cPartly because of Trump and partly because of Andr\u00e9s Manuel, there is an opening there,\u201d Mr. Wood said.Unlike his predecessor, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is willing to chart an independent course in his response to the Trump administration \u2014 partly because of Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on migration and partly out of a conviction that the only way to tackle the matter is to go after its root causes.And to do that, Mexico will look for help wherever it can find it, including China, which has already expressed an interest in Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s plan to lay hundreds of miles of track for a tourist train in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula \u2014 a project widely opposed by environmental advocates.Of course, that does not mean Mexico will make a sharp turn to China, given its longstanding relationship with the United States. Nor does floating the idea that China may participate make Mexico\u2019s costly proposal any more plausible.\u201cThe money is just not there,\u201d said Mark Feierstein, the former senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. He noted that the United States was spending more than $650 million a year in Central America\u2019s Northern Triangle, which is composed of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.But that may be beside the point.\u201cIf nothing else, it is a good bargaining chip,\u201d said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, of the idea that China could increase its investment in the region. \u201cBoth sides are laying down their frameworks and their points of view as to how they should proceed.\u201dThe idea that China could increase its influence in Mexico emerged even before Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador came into office.\u201cI heard from senior Mexican officials during the transition that if the United States is not going to treat Mexico with respect, don\u2019t be surprised if you see a Chinese submarine in a Mexican port,\u201d said Juan Gonzalez, who was an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Central America.\u201cI think it was hyperbolic,\u201d he said of the outgoing officials\u2019 warning, before adding, \u201cI think Mexico sees increased political risk coming from the political process in the United States and they are diversifying their interests.\u201dSince taking office on Dec. 1, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has done nothing if not shake up the establishment.He has announced the cancellation of the construction of a new airport, a multibillion-dollar project that was well underway, and temporarily suspended new auctions for oil exploration in Mexico. He has also cut salaries for government employees and proposed a measure to dismantle a much-vaunted education overhaul.As he did on the campaign trail, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has focused on domestic issues \u2014 an inward-looking vision that differs from recent Mexican presidents who saw the global stage as the nation\u2019s future.But the migrant crisis forced its way to the top of the agenda, proving a frustrating first test for Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.The arrival of thousands of migrants traveling in caravans from Honduras and other Central American countries raised the profile of an existing problem, increasing the stakes and forcing Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador to decide how to manage it just days after taking office.For decades, Mexico kept its head down as hundreds of thousands of migrants \u2014 many of them Mexican \u2014 made their way into the United States. But in recent years, the nation\u2019s status as a transit country has changed.Mexico is becoming a destination, not just a portal to the United States. Every year, more people apply for asylum in Mexico, and many more choose to stay and seek work. A bottleneck in the United States has meant that thousands of migrants are stuck waiting months at the border for their initial asylum interview with the American authorities.In 2014, at the urging of the Obama administration, Mexico adopted a tough policing strategy along its southern border with Guatemala that essentially amounted to detention and deportation. But that also failed to curtail the flow of migrants.Today, with about 10,000 migrants having entered Mexico in caravans that focused global media attention on their plight, mass roundups and deportations are not an option, officials say. Nor is striking a deal with the Trump administration to host the migrants indefinitely.So Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government is trying to fold them into Mexican society \u2014 and raise money to invest in projects that would boost employment and prosperity in the region.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to point out that the causes of migration have to be dealt with,\u201d said Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico\u2019s foreign secretary, adding that Mexico wants to counter the idea \u201cthat the best way to confront migration is through exclusion and control.\u201dThis is, in part, a recognition that Mexico forms a part of a busy migration corridor and that, with or without help from the United States, it has to deal with the issue.\u201cFinally, the issue of the Northern Triangle and migration is seen as a regional issue,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, the director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego, and a former Mexican presidential adviser. \u201cThere is a window of opportunity. The knowledge and awareness have never been as clear as they are now.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is also signaling an interest in playing a broader leadership role in the region, as Mexico did during the 1970s and 1980s.\u201cMexico wants to take back leadership in the region,\u201d said Rodolfo Cruz Pi\u00f1eiro, director of the department for population studies at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana. \u201cMexico is telling the U.S.: \u2018I can control this region for you, but I need your economic help.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat will the U.S. ask?\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the great unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It goes something like this: \u201cWe understand that we\u2019ve made mistakes. But don\u2019t you realize that if you damage us, you\u2019ll just be handing over the future to China? Unlike America, China is standing behind its tech firms, because it knows that the competition is global, and it wants to win.\u201dBut to accept this argument would be a mistake, for it betrays and ignores hard-won lessons about the folly of an industrial policy centered on \u201cnational champions,\u201d especially in the tech sector. What Facebook is really asking for is to be embraced and protected as America\u2019s very own social media monopolist, bravely doing battle overseas. But both history and basic economics suggest we do much better trusting that fierce competition at home yields stronger industries overall.That\u2019s the lesson from the history of Japanese-American tech competition. During the 1970s and into the \u201980s, it was widely believed that Japan was threatening the United States for supremacy in technology markets. The Japanese giant NEC was a serious challenger to IBM in the mainframe market; Sony was running over consumer electronics, joined by powerful firms like Panasonic and Toshiba. These companies enjoyed the support of the Japanese state, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which pursued a nationalistic industrial policy thought to be infallible.That\u2019s the risk of a governmental embrace of companies like Facebook, Apple and Google. While they may now seem as extraordinary as IBM did in the 1970s, they might not seem that way a decade from now. And if no one can imagine doing social networking better than Facebook, remember that no one dreamed that the personal computer, once little more than a toy for hobbyists, would displace the mighty mainframe.If we give these companies a pass when it comes to antitrust enforcement, allowing them to dominate their markets and buy up their competitors, America may lose what has been its signature advantage: its willingness to allow the new to replace the old, to accept rebellion and change \u2014 the industrial version of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s cycle of rebellion and the \u201cblood of patriots.\u201dAnd then, as Zuckerberg has prophesied, the future of tech may very well belong to China after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemala Cautious on Young Migrants\u2019 Deaths, Wary of Angering U.S.", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The deaths of two Guatemalan children in Border Patrol custody raised a furor in the United States, but drew a far more muted response in their own country, where a government focused on its survival is afraid that antagonizing the Trump administration could end American support.The children, Felipe G\u00f3mez Alonso, 8, and Jakelin Caal Maqu\u00edn, 7, fell ill and died this month after they crossed the southwestern border into the United States with their fathers, in separate events, and were detained by the Border Patrol.Their deaths prompted outrage in the United States over the conditions that migrants, especially children, endure in Border Patrol custody, putting the Trump administration on the defensive as the president insists that Congress approve $5 billion toward building a wall he says will thwart illegal immigration.But the Guatemalan government\u2019s response has been cautious. Aside from sending diplomatic notes to the State Department requesting an investigation into each child\u2019s death and offering to pay for the bodies\u2019 return home, the government has sidestepped the issue. There has been no formal protest against the American crackdown on migrants or condemnation of the hardships that even children are facing in detention centers.President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala has made no public statement, leaving it to Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel to issue updates on her ministry\u2019s efforts to learn why the children died and bring their bodies home.\u201cThe government of Guatemala regrets that a citizen has lost her life in this journey and points out that the places where migrants cross now are more dangerous and the distances they travel are longer,\u201d the foreign ministry said in announcing Jakelin\u2019s death.The reason for the government\u2019s reticence, analysts suggest, is a combination of Guatemala\u2019s centuries-old discrimination against its indigenous Mayan communities, into which both children were born, and a careful political calculation ahead of next July\u2019s presidential election.Mr. Morales has cultivated relations with the Trump administration and its allies to assure their support in his fight against an international panel on corruption that has accused him of campaign finance violations and filed charges against a wide array of political and economic power brokers in Guatemala.His efforts have been largely successful, and the United States has fallen silent as Mr. Morales has defied rulings from Guatemala\u2019s highest court and barred members of the panel, including its head, from the country.But the Trump administration has remained supportive of Mr. Morales even as his actions to shut down Cicig have taken Guatemala to the brink of a constitutional crisis. Now, with migration becoming a growing irritant in that relationship, Mr. Morales is anxious to smooth over the tensions.When a caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants crossed through Guatemala on its way to Mexico in October, the exodus angered President Trump, who fired off messages on Twitter blaming Guatemala and Honduras for allowing them to move north, said Fernando Carrera, a former foreign minister in Guatemala.Despite the deaths of the two children, \u201cthe government of Guatemala doesn\u2019t want to give more ammunition to that argument,\u201d Mr. Carrera said. \u201cThey stay quiet and they don\u2019t react.\u201dAid may be less of a worry for Mr. Morales, though, than continued United States support for his effort to oust the Cicig panel. For more than a year, Mr. Morales and his government have been carefully developing allies in Washington, nurturing ties with evangelical groups and conservative legislators and moving Guatemala\u2019s embassy to Jerusalem, soon after the Trump administration did.The Morales government is keen to protect its relationship with the Trump administration, said Quique Godoy, who resigned last year as a senior planning official in the Morales government in protest of the attacks on Cicig.\u201cThey are more worried about Cicig than trying to denounce the United States government of mismanaging\u201d its treatment of migrants, Mr. Godoy said.Mr. Carrera, the former foreign minister, said the Guatemalan government and its allies saw Cicig \u2014 which has insisted on controls in campaign finance \u2014 as a threat before the election next summer.The results of the July vote will determine what happens to the panel. It will also affect Mr. Morales\u2019s future. He is not eligible to run for re-election and will lose his immunity from prosecution after stepping down, leaving him open to the Cicig-backed investigation into illicit campaign financing. The president\u2019s son and brother have also been targeted by the panel.What has guided the Guatemalan government\u2019s response to the migrant children\u2019s deaths is a consular protection program that the foreign ministry has had in place for many years to provide support for migrants, including legal help and, when deaths occur, the return of bodies, Mr. Carrera said.Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, said that Ms. Jovel, the minister, had spoken frequently with the secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, in recent months to emphasize the importance of protecting migrant children.The children\u2019s deaths have also underscored the deep failures of successive Guatemalan governments to improve conditions for the country\u2019s poorest people, particularly the indigenous Maya who make up at least 40 percent of the population.Jakelin, who died in an El Paso hospital a few days past her seventh birthday, was buried on Christmas Day in her small village, a cluster of thatched-roof houses where Q\u2019eqchi\u2019-speaking families struggle to survive by growing corn and beans.Felipe, who died on Christmas Eve in a New Mexico hospital, had left his isolated Chuj-speaking village with his father. The village is near the Mexican border in the province of Huehuetenango, which sends more migrants to the United States than any other in Guatemala. Four out of five people in his rural municipality live in poverty, official statistics show.\u201cWe have a de facto apartheid society,\u201d said Anita Isaacs, a Guatemala scholar at Haverford College. \u201cThis country continues to be almost as racist as it has been historically.\u201dThe result is that the death of an indigenous child barely registers, she said: \u201cThese lives are worth less, and these people are fundamentally invisible.\u201dAlongside that indifference, Ms. Isaacs said, is an interest in developing the regions where indigenous people live. Palm oil plantations have begun to encroach on the Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 lands north of the village where Jakelin\u2019s family lives.Historically, these communities have been evicted to make way for cash crops like sugar or coffee, Ms. Isaacs said.\u201cWhat better form of eviction than them leaving the country completely?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a major reason why the Guatemalan government doesn\u2019t care.\u201dThe contribution is likely to rise as the number of Guatemalans seeking to reach the United States surges \u2014 the result, Ms. Isaacs said, of \u201ca perfect storm\u201d of poverty, violence and environmental crises.In a region with little investment in infrastructure, education or health care, like the remote areas on the border of Guatemala and Mexico where these two children were from, a temporary hardship \u2014 like this year\u2019s sharp drop in coffee and sugar prices \u2014 can provide the final push to people who are thinking of migrating, said Mr. Godoy, who is now the director of Propuesta Urbana, an organization that works on urban development and migration.\u201cThe main reason why people keep migrating is because we are not generating the right conditions locally for people not to migrate,\u201d Mr. Godoy said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marriott Data Breach Is Traced to Chinese Hackers as U.S. Readies Crackdown on Beijing", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain that collected personal details of roughly 500 million guests was part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort that also hacked health insurers and the security clearance files of millions more Americans, according to two people briefed on the investigation.The hackers, they said, are suspected of working on behalf of the Ministry of State Security, the country\u2019s Communist-controlled civilian spy agency. The discovery comes as the Trump administration is planning actions targeting China\u2019s trade, cyber and economic policies, perhaps within days.Those moves include indictments against Chinese hackers working for the intelligence services and the military, according to four government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Trump administration also plans to declassify intelligence reports to reveal Chinese efforts dating to at least 2014 to build a database containing names of executives and American government officials with security clearances.Other options include an executive order intended to make it harder for Chinese companies to obtain critical components for telecommunications equipment, a senior American official with knowledge of the plans said.The moves stem from a growing concern within the administration that the 90-day trade truce negotiated two weeks ago by President Trump and President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires might do little to change China\u2019s behavior \u2014 including the coercion of American companies to hand over valuable technology if they seek to enter the Chinese market, as well as the theft of industrial secrets on behalf of state-owned companies.Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied any knowledge of the Marriott hacking. \u201cChina firmly opposes all forms of cyberattack and cracks down on it in accordance with the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIf offered evidence, the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to the law.\u201dTrade negotiators on both sides of the Pacific have been working on an agreement under which China would commit to purchasing $1.2 trillion more of American goods and services over the next several years, and would address intellectual property concerns.But while top administration officials insist that the trade talks are proceeding on a separate track, the broader crackdown on China could undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to reach an agreement with Mr. Xi.American charges against senior members of China\u2019s intelligence services risk hardening opposition in Beijing to negotiations with Mr. Trump. Another obstacle is the targeting of high-profile technology executives, like Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the communications giant Huawei and daughter of its founder.\u201cIf I think it\u2019s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made \u2014 which is a very important thing \u2014 what\u2019s good for national security \u2014 I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,\u201d Mr. Trump said.American business leaders have been bracing for retaliation from China, which has demanded the immediate release of Ms. Meng and accused both the United States and Canada of violating her rights.While American intelligence agencies have not reached a final assessment of who performed the hacking, a range of firms brought in to assess the damage quickly saw computer code and patterns familiar to operations by Chinese actors.The Marriott database contains not only credit card information but passport data. Lisa Monaco, a former homeland security adviser under Mr. Obama, noted last week at a conference that passport information would be particularly valuable in tracking who is crossing borders and what they look like, among other key data.Such information is exactly what the Chinese use to root out spies, recruit intelligence agents and build a rich repository of Americans\u2019 personal data for future targeting. With those details and more that were stolen from insurers like Anthem, the Marriott data adds another critical element to the intelligence profile: travel habits.James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, said the Chinese have collected \u201chuge pots of data\u201d to feed a Ministry of State Security database seeking to identify American spies \u2014 and the Chinese people talking to them.\u201cBig data is the new wave for counterintelligence,\u201d Mr. Lewis said.\u201cIt\u2019s big-data hoovering,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chief technology officer at CrowdStrike, who first highlighted Chinese hacking as a threat researcher in 2011. \u201cThis data is all going back to a data lake that can be used for counterintelligence, recruiting new assets, anticorruption campaigns or future targeting of individuals or organizations.\u201dIn the Marriott case, Chinese spies stole passport numbers for up to 327 million people \u2014 many of whom stayed at Sheraton, Westin and W hotels and at other Starwood-branded properties. But Marriott has not said if it would pay to replace those passports, an undertaking that would cost tens of billions of dollars.Instead, Connie Kim, a Marriott spokeswoman, said the hotel chain would cover the cost of replacement if \u201cfraud has taken place.\u201d That means the company would not cover the cost of having exposed private data to the Chinese intelligence agencies if they did not use it to conduct commercial transactions \u2014 even though that is a breach of privacy and, perhaps, security.And even for those guests who did not have passport information on file with the hotels, their phone numbers, birth dates and itineraries remain vulnerable.That data, Mr. Lewis and others said, can be used to track which Chinese citizens visited the same city, or hotel, as an American intelligence agent who was identified in data taken from the Office of Personnel Management or from American health insurers that document patients\u2019 medical histories and Social Security numbers.The effort to amass Americans\u2019 personal information so alarmed government officials that in 2016, the Obama administration threatened to block a $14 billion bid by China\u2019s Anbang Insurance Group Co. to acquire Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide, according to one former official familiar with the work of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, a secretive government body that reviews foreign acquisitions.Ultimately, the failed bid cleared the way later that year for Marriott Hotels to acquire Starwood for $13.6 billion, becoming the world\u2019s largest hotel chain.As it turned out, it was too late: Starwood\u2019s data had already been stolen by Chinese state hackers, though the breach was not discovered until this past summer, and was disclosed by Marriott on Nov. 30.It is unclear that any kind of trade agreement reached with China by the Trump administration can address this kind of theft.The Chinese regard intrusions into hotel chain databases as a standard kind of espionage. So does the United States, which has often seized guest data from foreign hotels.Even the Office of Personnel Management hacking was viewed by American intelligence officials with some admiration. \u201cIf we had the opportunity to do the same thing, we\u2019d probably do it,\u201d James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, told Congress afterward.\u201cOne thing is very clear to me, and it is that they are not going to stop this,\u201d Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThis is what any nation-state intelligence agency would do. No nation-state is going to handcuff themselves and say, \u2018You can\u2019t do this,\u2019 because they all engage in similar detection.\u201dSince 2012, analysts at the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, the GCHQ, have watched with growing alarm as sophisticated Chinese hackers, based in Tianjin, began switching targets from companies and government agencies in the defense, energy and aerospace sectors to organizations that housed troves of Americans\u2019 personal information.At the time, one classified National Security Agency report noted that the hackers\u2019 \u201cexact affiliation with Chinese government entities is not known, but their activities indicate a probable intelligence requirement feed\u201d from China\u2019s Ministry of State Security.David E.

{"Headline": "Anchorage Goes Back to School After an Earthquake", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANCHORAGE \u2014 Monica Bradbury stood bundled in her coat in the hall of the elementary school where she was dropping off her daughters, ages 7 and 10. It was close to 9 a.m. on Monday, still coal-dark in the nation\u2019s far north, and this was the first morning back to school after the biggest earthquake to hit Alaska\u2019s biggest city in decades. But she could not quite bring herself to leave.\u201cI\u2019m more nervous than I thought I\u2019d be,\u201d Ms. Bradbury said, gazing into the classroom. \u201cIf we can just get through the day without another big aftershock, we\u2019ll be O.K.\u201dThousands of aftershock tremors \u2014 many imperceptible, others large enough to shake people from their church pews \u2014 have rattled lives in the days since a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck on Nov. 30. This week was a tense juncture for parents, teachers and the roughly 48,000 public students returning to the schools that many of them had fled in panic when the huge quake struck at 8:29 a.m. local time that day.All 92 of the school system\u2019s buildings sustained some damage. With at least two schools still unfit for use, more than 1,000 students were resuming classes in a different school than the one they attended two weeks ago. Libraries have been consolidated. And counselors from as far away as Portland, Ore., have arrived to work with anxious children and teachers.Deena Bishop, the superintendent of the district, handed out gift pencils to the younger students on their first day back and said that the schools would focus for now on a simple goal: healing.\u201cComing together, figuring it out, getting started,\u201d Dr. Bishop said. \u201cWe just have to work through it. You don\u2019t pick your emergencies.\u201dAs classes began, some teachers dived right in, forming chat circles on the rug and encouraging students to share their stories of the earthquake.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to dig it all back up,\u201d he said.Remarkably, no fatalities or serious injuries have been attributed to the earthquake, in part because Alaska\u2019s strict building codes are predicated on life in one of the most active seismic zones on the planet, in a northern corner of the Pacific Rim.But the quake brought a new layer of stress for students in a school system that has already wrestled with tumult. Anchorage, which has some of the most ethnically diverse public schools in the nation, has seen state support for education erode for years. Notably, support for capital improvement projects has fallen away, as Alaska\u2019s economy has struggled with falling oil production and declining revenue from taxes that oil companies pay to drill in places like the Prudhoe Bay, in the state\u2019s far north.The schools have also seen reverberations from the opioid crisis, which has brought families wrestling with drug and alcohol problems from outlying areas into the largest urban center, Anchorage.\u201cOur kids are coming to school with a lot more trauma,\u201d said Starr Marsett, president of the Anchorage school board. And budget cuts have not helped, she said, adding: \u201cWe have one counselor for every 750 elementary students.\u201dThe schools have seen a drop in enrollment, too, as families have left Alaska, seeking economic opportunities. In each of the last two years, about 500 students have left, leading to funding cuts for schools under per-pupil formulas. A labor dispute with the teachers\u2019 union has dragged on for months. And the prospect of new state funds seemed increasingly tenuous after the election last month of Mike J. Dunleavy, a Republican who has pledged to slash state spending, as governor.\u201cEverybody is incredibly uncertain right now about what is going to happen,\u201d said Diane Hirshberg, a professor of education policy at the University of Alaska.For the moment, the earthquake seems to have overtaken the schools\u2019 other problems.\u201cEverybody has got the singular focus of getting schools back up and running,\u201d said Tom Klaameyer, the president of the Anchorage Education Association, the teachers\u2019 union.Don Bee, a substitute teacher, said he came to school on the first day back just to be a steady presence.\u201cWhat they\u2019ve asked me to do is go around and see if teachers need a hand with anything and if someone needs reassurance,\u201d Mr. Bee said, as he sat by the front door of an elementary school on Monday morning.Mr. Bee, who retired from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said he was walking his grandson, Tristan Travers, 6, to school when the earthquake hit. They both went down on all fours, unable to stand as the ground heaved. Tristan was brave, his grandfather said, at least until his mother arrived to get him. Then the tears came.\u201cI know their anxiety, and how it feels to be a child, and really not knowing when the next earthquake is going to hit,\u201d Ms. Wilcox said. The earth is a restless place, she told the children, and earthquakes, especially here in Alaska, are part of that story. \u201cThis is what planet earth does,\u201d she said later. \u201cThis kind of relieves some anxiety.\u201dBefore the reopening of schools, officials had raced to be sure that the buildings were not only structurally sound, but also secure in other ways. Emergency radios had to be checked for damage and battery power. Video cameras were recalibrated and realigned.One step will be skipped. The monthly fire drill testing the evacuation of classrooms will not take place in December. \u201cWe\u2019ve already done it,\u201d said Steve Brown, the security coordinator, \u201cin real time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shopping Gala Built on Musings About Being Single Is Now a Marketing Phenomenon", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareNov. 11 annual splurge reflects a significant shift in consumer behavior.In the past decade, Nov. 11 has undergone a dramatic transformation from being just another date on the calendar to becoming the world\u2019s largest single-day discount shopping festival.Also known as Singles Day, it debuted in 2009 as an online antidote to the sentimentality surrounding the Western Valentine\u2019s Day. It takes its name from the way the date is written numerically as 1111, which resembles \u201cbare branches,\u201d a Chinese expression for the unattached.As this year\u2019s shopping gala progressed, milestones from previous years fell one by one.It was no surprise that Alibaba, which created the extravaganza to spur low-season online sales, broke its own record by clocking up sales worth 213.5 billion yuan ($30.8 billion) in just 24 hours, up by 27 percent year-on-year.The number of parcels generated on the day exceeded 1 billion for the first time, in line with estimates from Alibaba\u2019s chairman, Jack Ma.But beyond its huge scale, the gala reflects a paradigm shift in consumer behavior, as more shoppers look to imported goods, which they view as being of higher quality, even though they cost more \u2013 some of which are even designed exclusively for the Chinese market.For instance, it took just over six hours for cross-border online transactions to reach last year\u2019s full-day record on Tmall Global, Alibaba\u2019s dedicated portal for such purchases.While not disclosing the final sales figure, the company said more than 40 percent of items were bought from international brands. Beauty products from Japanese cosmetics specialist Kao and hairdryers from Dyson, which is headquartered in Britain, were among those that saw sales worth 10 million yuan in the first hour of trading during this year\u2019s shopping spree.Cross-border sales were also brisk on other e-commerce platforms. Those on NetEase Kaola, the cross-border portal owned by internet company NetEase, surpassed last year\u2019s total in just 78 minutes.Overseas products from the Amazon Global Store, which covers top destinations among Chinese customers for cross-border shopping and is owned by United States tech giant Amazon, achieved double-digit growth.Xu Lei, chief marketing officer of JD and CEO of JD Mall, which saw the amount of imported fresh food sold double compared with last year, said, \u201cThere has been a noticeable shift in China toward quality over price, which we see in the growing numbers of consumers who are willing to pay more for branded and imported goods.\u201dBefore Nov. 11, consultancy Oliver Wyman had projected that imported goods would be those most in demand at this year\u2019s festival. In a survey released just ahead of Singles Day, it found that 57 percent of customers surveyed said they intended to buy overseas goods, and such sales would constitute one-third of overall spending for the festival.New growth engineThe buying spree has helped to ease any concerns over a slowing economy, as consumption takes center stage in powering the nation\u2019s economic engine. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the contribution of consumption spending to GDP growth reached 78.5 percent in the first half of this year.The overall size of the nation\u2019s online retail sector reached 7.18 trillion yuan last year, a year-on-year rise of nearly 32.2 percent. This figure is projected to exceed 18 trillion yuan by 2025, with the online proportion of retail sales of consumer goods forecast to hit 25 percent, the bureau said.Meanwhile, the retail import penetration rate of China\u2019s cross-border e-commerce sector (consumers buying goods through cross-border e-commerce platforms as a proportion of online consumers) rose from just 1.6 percent in 2014 to 10.2 percent last year, according to research by consultancy Deloitte, the China Chamber of International Commerce and Alibaba\u2019s research arm.Buying imported goods online has become more commonplace, as new users\u2019 average spending per transaction and the average number of product categories bought increases, the study found.For example, the average number of product categories bought by first-time users in 2014 was 1.6, but by last year this had risen to four, while average spending per transaction last year rose to 2.5 times that in 2014.This trend is a vote of confidence for companies such as Chemist Warehouse, an Australian online pharmacy. According to Nancy Jian Fei Fei, its Greater China CEO, it was the only company with origins in Australia and New Zealand to achieve sales of 100 million yuan on Tmall Global on Nov. 11 this year. \u201cOur popularity is in part thanks to the growing disposable income of Chinese consumers and their changing mindset on healthcare,\u201d Jian said. \u201cAlso, our brand awareness has been further strengthened as more foreign manufacturers devote more resources to marketing efforts in China.\u201dWang Ying, 34, a company clerk in Shanghai, bought two bottles of vitamins from Chemist Warehouse during Singles Day this year and enjoyed a discount of 25 percent.\u201cThe maturing cross-border e-commerce setup can circumvent a lot of consumer education work,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the bonded warehouse in place, these imported goods can be delivered within just a couple of days to your doorstep.\u201dHusayn Remtulla, CEO of VIVA Naturals, a Canadian nutrients supplier, said, \u201cDouble 11 is similar to Black Friday (the shopping day held the day after Thanksgiving in the U.S.) or even Amazon Prime Day (a one-day global event exclusively for Prime members), except the scale and magnitude dwarfs anything that happens here in North America.\u201dRemtulla\u2019s company reaped gains from its first Nov. 11 event last year, securing two months\u2019 worth of sales in 24 hours.\u201cIt really sets you up for the next year,\u201d he said. \u201cA successful Double 11 allows us to reinvest in the business, and to learn from our customers in China about what they love and what they are looking for.\u201dCao Lei, director of the China E-Commerce Research Center, said the history of Nov. 11 indicates that this year\u2019s sales peak will be next year\u2019s \u201cnew norm.\u201d\u201cBrisk sales generated on Nov. 11 have reflected the dynamism and resilience of the Chinese economy. The event itself is the best demonstration of the upgrade in consumption, branding, supply chain and even manufacturing,\u201d he said.Chu Yin, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing, said that in echoing the country\u2019s opening-up policy and import strategy at a commercial level, the 2018 shopping gala was set to become a natural online extension of this month\u2019s China International Import Expo, serving as an indicator of the latest global business practices.Experience valuedAccording to the import consumption report led by Deloitte, those born after the 1990s constitute 45.2 percent of Chinese consumers who buy imported items online.Unlike those who are older, the younger generation values experience over price and is likely to pursue niche products and brands, said Zhang Tianbing, Deloitte Asia Pacific consumer products and retail industry leader.This requires brands to constantly evolve with changing customer preferences, and win over their hearts and wallets, Zhang said.Joost Vlaanderen, president of Mondelez China, the company behind Oreo cookies, said Nov. 11 has become a test bed for its \u201csupply chain system, new products and even new ideas.\u201dMondelez is among some 80 international brands that have begun to customize offerings and launch product co-creations tailored to the Chinese market.Powering these efforts are data analytics and consumer insights offered by Tmall\u2019s Innovation Center, which can help brands devise new strategies and channels.For example, confectionery maker Mars teamed up with Alibaba to create a chili-infused Snickers bar aimed at satisfying Chinese demand for a tongue-tingling treat.The decision to cash in on the growing popularity of mala, the Chinese term for numbing and spicy, was based on consumer research by both companies to find a new flavor to bring to the market.Wallace Du, head of both digital commerce at Mars and the company\u2019s China Digital Innovation Center, said, \u201cLeveraging the insights we got from the collaboration, we connected a flavor with our chocolate that is loved by 41 percent of Chinese consumers.\u201dFrom its online launch in August last year to mid-March, sales of spicy Snickers bars surpassed 9 million yuan, with 92 percent of consumers giving them positive reviews. The company said the bars had reached the yearly sales target within six months.Jacques Penhirin, partner and head of the Greater China office at Oliver Wyman, said Chinese consumers are now more selective compared with a year ago and are keeping their spending in check as they search for more unique events or offerings.\u201cThe days of breakneck growth seen by tapping new audiences in China cannot continue. Increasing per-head spending will become increasingly vital,\u201d Penhirin said.According to Wang Xiaofeng, senior analyst at U.S. market research company Forrester, gross merchandise volume generated on Nov. 11, although hitting another record high this year, will no longer be the focus as the event evolves from a purely discount one to a testing ground for new commerce initiatives and emerging technologies.Such diversification is providing plenty of opportunities for emerging brands such as Ocean King, an Australian manufacturer of nutrients, skincare and honey products, to capture the huge consumption potential in smaller Chinese cities.\u201cMajor international brands already have a strong presence in key cities like Beijing and Shanghai, making it difficult for us to penetrate,\u201d said Ocean King director William Ma.On the other hand, less established brands might be better received by consumers in smaller cities and townships who are curious to embrace new products, and where operating and marketing costs tend to be lower.Jason Yu, China general manager of shopper behavior specialist Kantar Worldpanel, said, \u201cThe vast population base and the unleashed consumption power from smaller cities, townships and rural areas are magnets for international brands.\u201dHe WeiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

Concerns about a slowing economy and a sharp spike in oil prices had already caused India\u2019s stock market to give up most of its gains for the year.\u201cThis will give a very bad signal to the Indian markets,\u201d said Sebastian Morris, a professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. \u201cIt establishes beyond a doubt that Mr. Modi cannot get along with anyone with an independent mind.\u201dBut tensions between the Reserve Bank of India, which Mr. Patel led, and the government had grown to the point that one of his deputies, Viral Acharya, gave a speech in October warning of the perils of too much government interference.\u201cGovernments that do not respect central bank independence will sooner or later incur the wrath of financial markets, ignite economic fire and come to rue the day they undermined an important regulatory institution,\u201d Mr. Acharya said then.Mr. Modi\u2019s government had threatened to invoke an obscure legal provision to force the central bank to adopt certain policies.In particular, the government sought to soften the central bank\u2019s rules for new lending by state-owned banks, which are struggling to manage their portfolios of previous bad loans.Mr. Modi had also sought a transfer of some of the central bank\u2019s $132 billion in cash reserves to pump up government spending before elections next May, a measure the central bankers had resisted.Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party won an overwhelming victory in national elections in 2014, but it has struggled to maintain its popularity amid a rocky economic record.Unhappy farmers recently marched on the capital in New Delhi and in Mumbai, the country\u2019s financial center, to demand loan forgiveness and higher crop prices. Legions of small shopkeepers and manufacturers have complained about the paperwork involved in one of Mr. Modi\u2019s signature policies, the imposition of a national goods and services tax.Mr. Modi\u2019s other major economic policy, the sudden invalidation of paper money in November 2016, has been roundly criticized by economists as causing great disruption to India\u2019s cash-based economy without providing any real benefits. Mr. Patel and the central bank were forced to manage the fallout of the move.On Tuesday, election officials will tally the votes in legislative elections in five states, providing an early indicator of Mr. Modi\u2019s re-election prospects next year.Mr. Patel, whose term was to end next September, decided not to wait it out.\u201cPatel swallowed a lot of bitter pills,\u201d said Arun Kumar, an economics professor at the Institute of Social Sciences near New Delhi. \u201cThe pressure from the government was increasing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spread the Digital Wealth", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are plenty of ways to deliver tech jobs to rural communities.Mr. Khanna, a Democrat, represents Silicon Valley in the U.S. House.One key question for the United States in the 21st century is whether noncoastal towns and rural communities, including many communities of color, will be able to participate in the digital revolution. We know that almost all Americans are avid consumers of technology, but many lack the opportunity to do the creative work that fuels our digital economy.Economists keep telling those left out of our digital future to move to the tech hubs. Sometimes I wonder if they have ever been to places like Jefferson, Iowa, or Beckley, W.Va. If they visit, they will realize that many people there are not looking to move. They are proud of their small-town values and enjoy being close to family. They brag that their town doesn\u2019t need many traffic lights. And they worry about a brain drain.These places also are not looking to become the next Silicon Valley. They are self-aware enough to recognize that there are benefits for the world\u2019s top engineers and computer scientists to flock to Palo Alto, Calif., or Austin, Tex. They understand why venture capitalists betting millions of dollars would want to be close to the start-ups they fund to have some control and accountability. But the choice facing small towns should not be binary \u2014 it should not be \u201cadopt the Silicon moniker or miss out on the tech future.\u201dSmall towns can also sustain entrepreneurial activity that is tailored to their needs. Consider the fifth-generation internet service provider in Jefferson, Iowa, that was willing to make a bet on investing in fiber to serve a 4,200-person town. Jefferson is not chasing brand-name venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road but is seeking more modest investments in local businesses that will solve local problems.Finally, the federal government can change incentives. When awarding federal software contracts, agencies should give favorable consideration if at least 10 percent of the work force is rural. We should, moreover, adopt stronger Equal Employment Opportunity reporting requirements for companies on the number of programmers they hire by country and location.When I was in Beckley to visit the new tech campus, I was reminded of the story of John F. Kennedy\u2019s visit to West Virginia during his 1960 campaign, when coal miners enthusiastically supported his vision for going to the moon. Our nation has always had a love affair with innovation. I saw that spark in the Beckley students, many from coal mining families, who were eager to show off their tech projects.One of the most popular teachers was a Pakistani-American woman, with a thick accent, who was teaching software design. When some of the Beckley students asked me what more they should do to bring tech, I joked that they would be wise to open up a few more Pakistani or Indian restaurants. There was awkward silence and then laughter. If we can figure out how to give more Americans a shot in tech, a shot at the ordinary jobs that don\u2019t necessarily afford rock star status or come with generous stock options but that can sustain middle-class life, then we might just take a step toward stitching our nation back together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Huawei Executive\u2019s Arrest Is Igniting Fear. The U.S. Should Take Notice.", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldIn an email with the subject line \u201cTravel Restriction to China,\u201d the Silicon Valley networking giant cautioned employees against nonessential travel to China \u201cdue to recent events.\u201d Cisco has since said that the email was sent in error and that there are no China travel restrictions on its employees.Still, the fear is real.Over spicy hot pot last week after the announcement of Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, an American-educated Chinese tech entrepreneur told me that he wouldn\u2019t travel to the United States unless necessary. Another Chinese tech figure, one who is backed by American money, discussed whether he should give up his beloved iPhone for a Huawei smartphone.The founder of an artificial intelligence start-up said that when he visited the Bay Area in October, he was questioned extensively at immigration. One investor, a former Silicon Valley engineer who moved back to China a few years ago to set up a venture capital fund focused on A.I., left his laptop at home and deleted messages from the social media platform WeChat from his phone in case American security personnel decided to take a peek. They didn\u2019t.(All the tech industry figures spoke on the condition of anonymity \u2014 to protect themselves not just from the Chinese government but from the American government as well.)\u201cOut of national security consideration, we can start thinking about the possibility of ousting Apple from China,\u201d Fang Xingdong, the founder of ChinaLabs, a technology think tank in Beijing, wrote on WeChat.On Chinese social media, jingoism is running high. \u201cA guilty conscience needs no accuser!\u201d \u201cBoycott Cisco!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s detain Tim Cook of Apple!\u201dThe United States, on the other hand, risks losing important potential allies in its tug of war with China\u2019s authoritarian government. China\u2019s tech elite are comfortable with the American system and open to many Western values. It would not be in Washington\u2019s interest to push them closer to the Communist Party.\u201cThe party building in the past few years was a big present to the U.S. and Europe,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, an economist at Hong Kong University.China\u2019s pro-market elites have been trying to use the pressure of a slowing economy and the trade war to push Mr. Xi to give power back to entrepreneurs, which would be in line with some of Washington\u2019s goals.Now, they aren\u2019t sure that the Trump administration views them any differently from the Chinese government.This time is different. Huawei is among the most respected private enterprises in China. The world\u2019s biggest telecom equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone maker, Huawei is frequently exalted in China\u2019s business world for elbowing out its bigger Western rivals and developing cutting-edge technologies.There are all kinds of tales about how hard Huawei engineers and salespeople work. Many entrepreneurs told me that they respected Ren Zhengfei, Huawei\u2019s founder and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, more than high-profile Chinese internet tycoons like Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent because Huawei is the only Chinese corporation with a truly global footprint.The United States accuses Ms. Meng of being directly involved in efforts to circumvent its sanctions against Iran. The authorities there may have compelling evidence. For people not familiar with China and China\u2019s business world, it may be puzzling that some businesspeople would take Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest so badly.Still, many people in China who have grown up under an authoritarian regime see only a blunt exercise of state power. Because many Chinese view Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest as a tool to escalate the trade war, they see her as a victim of geopolitics rather than a potential lawbreaker.They also worry they could be seen as tainted simply because they are from China. Think of it as China\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d \u2014 it is hard to be a truly independent private business in China because the government controls most of the resources. The Chinese government uses bank loans, business licenses and regulations to make sure companies toe the party line.

{"Headline": "Your Apps Know Where You Were Last Night, and They\u2019re Not Keeping It Secret", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "By Richard Harris | Satellite imagery by U.S.D.A. N.A.I.P.Dozens of companies use smartphone locations to help advertisers and even hedge funds. They say it\u2019s anonymous, but the data shows how personal it is.The millions of dots on the map trace highways, side streets and bike trails \u2014 each one following the path of an anonymous cellphone user.One path tracks someone from a home outside Newark to a nearby Planned Parenthood, remaining there for more than an hour. Another represents a person who travels with the mayor of New York during the day and returns to Long Island at night.Yet another leaves a house in upstate New York at 7 a.m. and travels to a middle school 14 miles away, staying until late afternoon each school day. Only one person makes that trip: Lisa Magrin, a 46-year-old math teacher. Her smartphone goes with her.An app on the device gathered her location information, which was then sold without her knowledge. It recorded her whereabouts as often as every two seconds, according to a database of more than a million phones in the New York area that was reviewed by The New York Times. While Ms. Magrin\u2019s identity was not disclosed in those records, The Times was able to easily connect her to that dot.The app tracked her as she went to a Weight Watchers meeting and to her dermatologist\u2019s office for a minor procedure. It followed her hiking with her dog and staying at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s home, information she found disturbing.\u201cIt\u2019s the thought of people finding out those intimate details that you don\u2019t want people to know,\u201d said Ms. Magrin, who allowed The Times to review her location data.Like many consumers, Ms. Magrin knew that apps could track people\u2019s movements. But as smartphones have become ubiquitous and technology more accurate, an industry of snooping on people\u2019s daily habits has spread and grown more intrusive.By Michael H. Keller and Richard Harris | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeAt least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information, The Times found. Several of those businesses claim to track up to 200 million mobile devices in the United States \u2014 about half those in use last year. The database reviewed by The Times \u2014 a sample of information gathered in 2017 and held by one company \u2014 reveals people\u2019s travels in startling detail, accurate to within a few yards and in some cases updated more than 14,000 times a day.Businesses say their interest is in the patterns, not the identities, that the data reveals about consumers. They note that the information apps collect is tied not to someone\u2019s name or phone number but to a unique ID. But those with access to the raw data \u2014 including employees or clients \u2014 could still identify a person without consent. They could follow someone they knew, by pinpointing a phone that regularly spent time at that person\u2019s home address. Or, working in reverse, they could attach a name to an anonymous dot, by seeing where the device spent nights and using public records to figure out who lived there.Many location companies say that when phone users enable location services, their data is fair game. But, The Times found, the explanations people see when prompted to give permission are often incomplete or misleading. An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. That disclosure is often buried in a vague privacy policy.\u201cLocation information can reveal some of the most intimate details of a person\u2019s life \u2014 whether you\u2019ve visited a psychiatrist, whether you went to an A.A. meeting, who you might date,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has proposed bills to limit the collection and sale of such data, which are largely unregulated in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not right to have consumers kept in the dark about how their data is sold and shared and then leave them unable to do anything about it,\u201d he added.After Elise Lee, a nurse in Manhattan, saw that her device had been tracked to the main operating room at the hospital where she works, she expressed concern about her privacy and that of her patients.\u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Ms. Lee, who allowed The Times to examine her location history in the data set it reviewed. \u201cIt feels like someone is following me, personally.\u201dThe mobile location industry began as a way to customize apps and target ads for nearby businesses, but it has morphed into a data collection and analysis machine.\u201cWe look to understand who a person is, based on where they\u2019ve been and where they\u2019re going, in order to influence what they\u2019re going to do next,\u201d Ms. Greenstein said.Financial firms can use the information to make investment decisions before a company reports earnings \u2014 seeing, for example, if more people are working on a factory floor, or going to a retailer\u2019s stores.By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google Earth\u201cThe book \u20181984,\u2019 we\u2019re kind of living it in a lot of ways,\u201d said Bill Kakis, a managing partner at Tell All.Jails, schools, a military base and a nuclear power plant \u2014 even crime scenes \u2014 appeared in the data set The Times reviewed. One person, perhaps a detective, arrived at the site of a late-night homicide in Manhattan, then spent time at a nearby hospital, returning repeatedly to the local police station.By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google EarthThe most prolific company was Reveal Mobile, based in North Carolina, which had location-gathering code in more than 500 apps, including many that provide local news. A Reveal spokesman said that the popularity of its code showed that it helped app developers make ad money and consumers get free services.WeatherBug, owned by GroundTruth, asks users\u2019 permission to collect their location and tells them the information will be used to personalize ads. GroundTruth said that it typically sent the data to ad companies it worked with, but that if they didn\u2019t want the information they could ask to stop receiving it.By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeThe Times also identified more than 25 other companies that have said in marketing materials or interviews that they sell location data or services, including targeted advertising.The spread of this information raises questions about how securely it is handled and whether it is vulnerable to hacking, said Serge Egelman, a computer security and privacy researcher affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley.\u201cThere are really no consequences\u201d for companies that don\u2019t protect the data, he said, \u201cother than bad press that gets forgotten about.\u201dCompanies that use location data say that people agree to share their information in exchange for customized services, rewards and discounts. Ms. Magrin, the teacher, noted that she liked that tracking technology let her record her jogging routes.Brian Wong, chief executive of Kiip, a mobile ad firm that has also sold anonymous data from some of the apps it works with, says users give apps permission to use and share their data. \u201cYou are receiving these services for free because advertisers are helping monetize and pay for it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou would have to be pretty oblivious if you are not aware that this is going on.\u201dBut Ms. Lee, the nurse, had a different view. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what they have to tell themselves,\u201d she said of the companies. \u201cBut come on.\u201dMs. Lee had given apps on her iPhone access to her location only for certain purposes \u2014 helping her find parking spaces, sending her weather alerts \u2014 and only if they did not indicate that the information would be used for anything else, she said. Ms. Magrin had allowed about a dozen apps on her Android phone access to her whereabouts for services like traffic notifications.But it is easy to share information without realizing it. Of the 17 apps that The Times saw sending precise location data, just three on iOS and one on Android told users in a prompt during the permission process that the information could be used for advertising. Only one app, GasBuddy, which identifies nearby gas stations, indicated that data could also be shared to \u201canalyze industry trends.\u201dMore typical was theScore, a sports app: When prompting users to grant access to their location, it said the data would help \u201crecommend local teams and players that are relevant to you.\u201d The app passed precise coordinates to 16 advertising and location companies.A spokesman for theScore said that the language in the prompt was intended only as a \u201cquick introduction to certain key product features\u201d and that the full uses of the data were described in the app\u2019s privacy policy.The Weather Channel app, owned by an IBM subsidiary, told users that sharing their locations would let them get personalized local weather reports. IBM said the subsidiary, the Weather Company, discussed other uses in its privacy policy and in a separate \u201cprivacy settings\u201d section of the app. Information on advertising was included there, but a part of the app called \u201clocation settings\u201d made no mention of it.Even industry insiders acknowledge that many people either don\u2019t read those policies or may not fully understand their opaque language. Policies for apps that funnel location information to help investment firms, for instance, have said the data is used for market analysis, or simply shared for business purposes.\u201cMost people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Emmett Kilduff, the chief executive of Eagle Alpha, which sells data to financial firms and hedge funds. Mr. Kilduff said responsibility for complying with data-gathering regulations fell to the companies that collected it from people.Many location companies say they voluntarily take steps to protect users\u2019 privacy, but policies vary widely.By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobeSome companies say they delete the location data after using it to serve ads, some use it for ads and pass it along to data aggregation companies, and others keep the information for years.Several people in the location business said that it would be relatively simple to figure out individual identities in this kind of data, but that they didn\u2019t do it. Others suggested it would require so much effort that hackers wouldn\u2019t bother.It \u201cwould take an enormous amount of resources,\u201d said Bill Daddi, a spokesman for Cuebiq, which analyzes anonymous location data to help retailers and others, and raised more than $27 million this year from investors including Goldman Sachs and Nasdaq Ventures. Nevertheless, Cuebiq encrypts its information, logs employee queries and sells aggregated analysis, he said.There is no federal law limiting the collection or use of such data. Still, apps that ask for access to users\u2019 locations, prompting them for permission while leaving out important details about how the data will be used, may run afoul of federal rules on deceptive business practices, said Maneesha Mithal, a privacy official at the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cYou can\u2019t cure a misleading just-in-time disclosure with information in a privacy policy,\u201d Ms. Mithal said.Apps form the backbone of this new location data economy.The app developers can make money by directly selling their data, or by sharing it for location-based ads, which command a premium. Location data companies pay half a cent to two cents per user per month, according to offer letters to app makers reviewed by The Times.Targeted advertising is by far the most common use of the information.Google and Facebook, which dominate the mobile ad market, also lead in location-based advertising. Both companies collect the data from their own apps. They say they don\u2019t sell it but keep it for themselves to personalize their services, sell targeted ads across the internet and track whether the ads lead to sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Google, which also receives precise location information from apps that use its ad services, said it modified that data to make it less exact.Smaller companies compete for the rest of the market, including by selling data and analysis to financial institutions. This segment of the industry is small but growing, expected to reach about $250 million a year by 2020, according to the market research firm Opimas.Apple and Google have a financial interest in keeping developers happy, but both have taken steps to limit location data collection. In the most recent version of Android, apps that are not in use can collect locations \u201ca few times an hour,\u201d instead of continuously.A spokesman said the company mandates that developers use the data only to provide a service directly relevant to the app, or to serve advertising that met Apple\u2019s guidelines.Apple recently shelved plans that industry insiders say would have significantly curtailed location collection. Last year, the company said an upcoming version of iOS would show a blue bar onscreen whenever an app not in use was gaining access to location data.After examining maps showing the locations extracted by their apps, Ms. Lee, the nurse, and Ms. Magrin, the teacher, immediately limited what data those apps could get. Ms. Lee said she told the other operating-room nurses to do the same.\u201cI went through all their phones and just told them: \u2018You have to turn this off. You have to delete this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cNobody knew.\u201dSept. 12, 2018May 10, 2018May 19, 2018Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Watch Ahead of the Fed Meeting", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFed Chairman Jerome H. Powell faces the challenge of convincing investors that the Fed is striking the right balance. The Fed will issue a policy statement and a set of economic projections at 2 p.m. Mr. Powell will then hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. to answer questions about the Fed\u2019s plans.Here is what to watch as we head into Fed Day.The Fed on Wednesday is widely expected to recognize the continued strength of the economy by announcing a quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate after a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. It would be the fifth consecutive quarter in which the Fed has raised its benchmark rate. The rate would move into a range between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent.The Fed also is expected to announce that it will continue to reduce its portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which it accumulated after the financial crisis as part of its broader campaign to hold down borrowing costs. The holdings, which peaked at about $4.5 trillion, have now declined to about $4.1 trillion, and the Fed is reducing its holdings by $50 billion per month.But with markets uneasy, the central bank is expected to emphasize that future rate increases will depend on continued economic growth. In other words, the Fed could signal that while there is no reason to be worried about the economy at the moment, it is paying close attention to data that could signal economic weakening both in the United States and abroad.Financial markets are well-prepared for a rate hike. Attention instead is focused on what the central bank says about its plans for next year. Mr. Powell already has emphasized that the Fed is shifting to a new phase of monetary policy, in which it will offer less guidance about its plans.Instead, the Fed will emphasize that economic developments will dictate the course of policy. If growth is strong, the Fed is likely to raise rates at least a few more times. If signs of faltering growth continue to emerge, the Fed could pause for a while to take the measure of the economy.Most Fed officials have said that they want to return the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to a neutral level, meaning that the Fed would neither be stimulating nor discouraging economic activity.Even as the Fed seeks to get out of the forecasting business, it is still planning to release a set of forecasts by the members of its policymaking committee, showing how many times they expect the central bank to raise rates next year.In the last round of forecasts, published in September, most Fed officials predicted the central bank would raise rates three times in 2019. Shaving those predictions would underscore the Fed\u2019s doubts about the economy\u2019s trajectory.The committee comprises the Fed\u2019s board of governors and the presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks.Mr. Trump has repeatedly warned the Fed to stop raising rates, saying it is going to snuff out the economic recovery and advising it to \u201cfeel the market.\u201d Mr. Powell has so far brushed off any suggestion that the Fed might pay attention to the president\u2019s admonitions but any signal that the Fed is slowing its pace of rate increases will undoubtedly raise questions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign is working.That said, while many economists think Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the independent Fed have been ill-advised, there is a growing school of thought that a slowdown in rate increases may be warranted given signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad.With a rate increase already baked in for December, investors will be reacting most heavily to the projections for next year. If the Fed signals it is slowing down, expect markets to applaud.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Bolivia, Morales\u2019s Indigenous Base Backtracks on Support", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARMEN DEL EMERO, Bolivia \u2014 In this remote indigenous village in Bolivia, the rule has been the same for generations: Leaders can be re-elected only once. After that, they must hand power to someone else.So it came as a shock to Nelo Yarari, the leader of Carmen del Emero, a community of indigenous Tacana people in the Bolivian Amazon, when President Evo Morales said he would be running for a fourth term.One thing especially stung for Mr. Yarari: As Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous leader, Mr. Morales had vowed to champion native values from the presidential palace.In seeking for yet another term, Mr. Morales was violating a basic tenet of the Tacanas, power sharing. He was also pushing for oil and gas extraction in protected areas and proposing hydroelectric dams that would displace native communities.\u201cWe don\u2019t consider him indigenous here,\u201d Mr. Yarari said. \u201cHe has turned his back on us.\u201dWith the election set for next year, the issue of a boundless presidency has become a broader concern for a Latin America where threats to democracy are mounting.In Venezuela, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro now rules as an autocrat, extending his own term this year in an election widely seen as rigged. More than 300 people in Nicaragua have been killed in protests to end President Daniel Ortega\u2019s tenure.And some see an autocratic streak in Mr. Morales\u2019s support for crackdowns by Mr. Maduro and Mr. Ortega and in his own history of attacking the media and stacking the courts with judges who favor him.\u201cEvo is now asking: What can I do to stay in power?\u201d said Marcelo Arequipa, a political-science professor at the Catholic University of Bolivia in La Paz. \u201cThis issue has become so important it sometimes means sidestepping the Constitution.\u201dAt first, many in Carmen del Emero \u2014 a two-day journey by river from the town of Rurrenabaque and more than 250 miles north of the capital \u2014 saw Mr. Morales as the antithesis to a long chain of leaders who did not represent their interests.Mr. Morales promised something different. He preached inclusion of indigenous groups, cut ties to American coca-eradication programs that stung farmers and used the state\u2019s wealth to cut the poverty rate in half by 2012.Yet 12 years after he took office, many indigenous groups are questioning whether it is their interests \u2014 or Mr. Morales\u2019s own political ambitions \u2014 that are behind his unrelenting grip on the presidency.\u201cWe\u2019ll be the first who get displaced by this,\u201d said Felcin Cartagena, a resident of San Miguel, downstream from the site of the dam.The president has even been abandoned by some indigenous coca growers, his early base. In October, a coca growers\u2019 union from the Yungas region endorsed former President Carlos Mesa, Mr. Morales\u2019s main rival in the race, after one of the union\u2019s leaders was arrested on charges of planning an ambush that killed a soldier. The group said Mr. Morales was trying to quash the union by falsely accusing its leader.Mr. Morales has done much to ensure he remains in office, including calling a constitutional assembly during his first term that allowed him to run two more times and pushing the referendum in 2016 that would have allowed him to run for a fourth term.After that narrowly failed, the Constitutional Court, which is largely loyal to Mr. Morales, ruled last year that the president could run again on the grounds that term limits amounted to a human rights violation.Adriana Salvatierra, a lawmaker from Mr. Morales\u2019s party, Movement for Socialism, said the president had neither violated the Constitution nor lost support among native groups. His presidency empowers them by showing \u201cthe indigenous peasant as a revolutionary power,\u201d she said.Ultimately, she said, Mr. Morales needs to stay in power to counter ascendant conservative leaders in neighboring Brazil and Chile who she said were seeking to erase gains made by the poor.\u201cEvo Morales is the only one that can guarantee economic growth, stability, sources of work,\u201d she said.Indeed, Mr. Morales has delivered on many of those fronts, keeping Bolivia\u2019s economy afloat even as Brazil and other nations in the region suffered through a recession when commodity prices slumped. But that is not enough, even for many of Mr. Morales\u2019s erstwhile supporters.\u201cWe have a president violating the Constitution \u2014 whether he\u2019s done good or bad, it\u2019s the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Yarari, the leader of Carmen del Emero, said.The Tacanas greeted Mr. Morales\u2019s first election as their own victory and as evidence that, at last, the national government would begin to have a presence in the distant village, he said. Before long the government began collecting taxes from Carmen del Emero, charging the Tacanas for the caiman crocodiles they hunt and the timber they harvest.But government services did not follow. The village school was built 40 years ago, the health center is 30 years old, and neither has been maintained, Mr. Yarari said. When floodwaters decimated the village in 2014, covering it in mud for months, it was the Red Cross that came to help, the leader said.Further upstream along the Beni River is San Miguel, which is fighting Mr. Morales over the proposed hydroelectric dams. If built, the dams would flood regions around Madidi National Park in Bolivia\u2019s northwest, considered one of the world\u2019s biodiversity hot spots.The Tacanas had spent years fighting previous governments over the project, but they were taken aback when Mr. Morales began pushing for it. In June, the indigenous group sent a small armada of canoes upstream to block the river, in an effort to keep engineers from the site.The dam project would aim to supply electricity to Brazil, but not to Amazonian villages in the area, like San Luis Grande. That angered Triniti Tayo Cori, a leader of the Tsiman\u00e9 people.\u201cThrough our own effort we\u2019ve gotten light to our town: We bought a generator, we bought cables, we bought light bulbs,\u201d Mr. Tayo Cori said, describing a recent effort to install public lighting after years of asking the government to do so.Yerko Ilijic, a Bolivian lawyer and political scientist, said Mr. Morales was making his calculations based on votes: Small groups like the Tacanas and Tsiman\u00e9 aren\u2019t a priority.\u201cWhen you\u2019re a politician, who do you negotiate with?\u201d Mr. Ilijic asked. \u201cYou negotiate with whoever has the biggest numbers.\u201dMr. Ilijic said Mr. Morales appeared to be striking up alliances with some of the very landed interests he once fought. In September, he signed a law to use bioethanol as an additive in Bolivian gasoline, which was seen as a boon for the sugar industry. The farms that produce bioethanol have long angered indigenous groups for advancing deforestation.For some, next month\u2019s election will present a difficult choice between two unsatisfactory candidates: Mr. Morales and Mr. Mesa, who was vice president under Mr. S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, the exiled president who oversaw the Aymara killings that lifted Mr. Morales to power.Rodrigo Quinallata, an activist in the city of El Alto, near La Paz, campaigned against allowing Mr. Morales more terms. An Aymara, he says he will continue that struggle.\u201cWe have to admit that in the end someone who is wearing a poncho can be as corrupt as someone who is wearing a tie,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated an action on tax policy taken by Gonz\u00e1lo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada as president of Bolivia. He proposed a tax increase that would have raised taxes on the poor; he did not raise taxes on the poor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arts Meets Science and Chemistry Wins the Day", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsForgive Paul M. Romer for turning two of the greatest days of his life into a one-day event. He was just being economical.Mr. Romer, who was until January the chief economist of the World Bank in Washington, was married Monday to Caroline Weber, an author and full professor of French Literature at Barnard College, Columbia, in a celebration ceremony at the Anglican Episcopal Church of St. Peter and St. Sigfrid in Stockholm.The bride, radiant in an aqua-colored caftan by Oscar de la Renta, and groom, stately in white tie and tails, exchanged ceremonial vows before the Rev. Nicholas Howe, an Anglican priest, and 16 family members, including the couple\u2019s parents, as well as five of Mr. Romer\u2019s six siblings and both of his children.\u201cThis came as a total surprise,\u201d said Mr. Romer, 63, who learned he had won the coveted award in the quiet of an October morning at the Greenwich Village apartment he shares with Ms. Weber, 49, who was sound asleep when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences called with the news.\u201cIt was a once-in-a-lifetime moment,\u201d Ms. Weber said. \u201cI was absolutely thrilled for him.\u201dAccording to the Swedish Academy, Mr. Romer earned his Nobel, more specifically, \u201cfor integrating technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis.\u201d (Mr. Nordhaus won \u201cfor integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis.\u201d)\u201cOn a personal level, one of the most interesting things about winning the Nobel is how happy it made so many people I know,\u201d said Mr. Romer, who is currently on a leave of absence from N.Y.U., where he is a University Professor of Economics.\u201cFrom colleagues at N.Y.U., to the woman who runs the dry cleaner\u2019s where I take my clothes, to the doorman down the street who always gives my dogs\u2019 treats, everyone just seemed so thrilled for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was something I didn\u2019t anticipate.\u201dTwo years later, he found Ms. Weber.\u201cShe helped me discover a side of myself that was hidden,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she has exposed me to a part of intellectual life that I\u2019ve had little professional exposure to.\u201dOn Dec. 18, they are to be legally married at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau, which seemed unlikely given the circumstances of their first official meeting five-and-a-half years ago.For Ms. Weber, whose first marriage had ended in divorce, it wasn\u2019t quite love at first sight.\u201cI had the distinct feeling I had met Paul before,\u201d she said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t figure out when or where I had seen him.\u201dNevertheless, they hit it off, and after dessert, Mr. Romer was walking Ms. Weber to her home in Greenwich Village, when he turned to her and said, \u201cThanks for being so discreet about how I had asked you out before.\u201dMs. Weber was initially taken aback, but then it all started coming back. She soon remembered having met Mr. Romer three months earlier at a pizzeria-restaurant in Manhattan.\u201cWe were both sitting at the bar, late-night, grading papers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe started chatting, and I thought he was very handsome, but I was dating someone at that time.\u201dBefore leaving that night, Mr. Romer asked Ms. Weber for her email address for the purpose of sending her information about a public lecture he was scheduled to give at N.Y.U.\u201cI thought she was very attractive, very outgoing and ferociously smart,\u201d Mr. Romer said. \u201cBut I remember looking into her eyes as she handed me her email address and thinking, \u2018She\u2019s never going to contact me.\u2019\u201dHis instincts were correct, as Ms. Weber had decided to move on, but through some quirk of fate, they were back in each other\u2019s orbit just three months later, with the Marrons joining them for dinner to help lighten the atmosphere.By reintroducing Mr. Romer to Ms. Weber, who was now unattached, Mr. Marron gave him more than just another gift.\u201cHe gave me a miracle,\u201d said Mr. Romer, who still has the scrap of paper on which Ms. Weber scrawled her email address. \u201cWho gets two chances at the same miracle?\u201dThey began dating immediately, each fascinated by the other\u2019s credentials in an arts meets science kind of way.His father, 90, once served as governor of Colorado, and was also head of the Democratic National Committee when Bill Clinton was president. He later became the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District and a consultant to the College Board, based in Washington.\u201cI had never been interested in or particularly savvy about economics,\u201d she said. \u201cI had briefly worked on Wall Street after college as a very unhappy and unsuccessful investment banker at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, but I had never really followed the economy.\u201cYet I was really struck by how fluent Paul was in making the economic issues that are of interest to him relevant to contemporary considerations, and relevant to history and to human technological and human cultural development.\u201dThe more she spoke of him, the softer her voice became, her tone drifting from scholarly to lovingly.\u201cHe was also a very kind, very decent, incredibly principled person whose moral compass was front and center,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was someone who completely accepted me for who I am, with all my quirks and foibles.\u201dMr. Romer was equally impressed with Ms. Weber, the only daughter of Carol C. Weber and Russell J. Weber of Charlottesville, Va., whose parents are both retired professors of organizational behavior at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business.Mr. Romer, whose first two marriages ended in divorce, said that Ms. Weber \u201chelped me discover things about myself that I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cShe taught me that I had more of a sense of humor than I had really known, and that I also I have this love of words that I really didn\u2019t know was there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m mildly dyslexic and I\u2019ve always had trouble spelling,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought of myself as a word person, or a writer, I was always more comfortable with mathematics, but Caroline helped me appreciate words through verbal interactions, and now I love words, I love the shadings that can generate humor and I love a well-crafted phrase, that was the side of myself that had been hidden.\u201dIn September 2013, four months after they had reconnected, Mr. Romer and Ms. Weber journeyed together to N.Y.U.\u2019s campus in Shanghai, China, where Mr. Romer had agreed to teach economics for a semester.\u201cThat was one of our big adventures early on,\u201d said Ms. Weber, who went on a sabbatical to be with him. \u201cIt was also a big test of our relationship as we were living in a country where neither of us spoke the language, which made some things difficult, but I\u2019m grateful to have had that experience.\u201dThree years later, a more painful experience during a long-distance period in their lives brought them closer together.In November 2016, just a few weeks after Mr. Romer had gone to the World Bank in Washington, Ms. Weber was walking their three dogs \u2014 they now have four \u2014 when two of the bigger ones began pulling her in the direction of another dog.\u201cJust as this is happening, a bicycle comes flying by,\u201d Ms. Weber said. \u201cIt was just a perfect storm of awfulness that resulted in me tearing all the ligaments in both of my knees.\u201dMr. Romer rushed back to New York by train, and found Ms. Weber in a hospital emergency room, still in much pain.\u201cPoor thing,\u201d he said, \u201cit was really tough to see her in that position.\u201dHe began commuting from Washington every weekend to be by her side, and she has since recovered after two full years of physical therapy, just in time to celebrate two of the biggest days of her life, which, like his, happened on the same day.\u201cOn our way to pick up Paul\u2019s Nobel Prize, we\u2019re stopping off to get married,\u201d said Ms. Weber, laughing as she spoke, just before heading to Sweden.She, too, had found her own economical miracle.Advertisement"}

Apple used it to bring back $252 billion that it had stashed abroad.Mr. Trump, who had chided Apple over various issues in the past, reacted to the January announcement by praising the company while crediting his own policies for getting it to make the investments.In September, though, Mr. Trump took aim at Apple again over jobs after the company told trade officials in a letter that the administration\u2019s tariffs would affect a wide range of products.\u201cMake your products in the United States instead of China,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cStart building new plants now.\u201dNone of the new positions announced by Apple on Thursday appeared to involve manufacturing.Unlike Amazon, whose competition for a new headquarters was highly publicized, Apple has been relatively quiet about its expansion plans. The company opened its own new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., last year.The new 133-acre campus in Austin will initially employ 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support. It will ultimately have the capacity for up to 15,000 workers. Apple said it expected that its expanded presence in Austin, where it already employs 6,000 people, would make it the area\u2019s largest private employer.Apple said it had applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County. Those rebates would be in the tens of millions of dollars over 15 years, said a person familiar with the application, who declined to be named because the negotiations are private.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas hailed Apple\u2019s decision on Thursday as \u201ca testament to the high-quality work force and unmatched economic environment that Texas offers.\u201dCities and states are competing to lure high-paying tech jobs that can improve their economies and generate tax revenue.But tech companies, which rank among the world\u2019s largest by market value, carry downsides like gentrification and higher living costs that can push out longtime residents. Austin, like Seattle and the Bay Area, has experienced those effects in recent years as Apple and other technology companies expand.Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said the concentration of tech jobs in a few metropolitan areas was widening a gap between big cities and the rest of the country. He said the dynamic was contributing to the nation\u2019s political divide.\u201cThe digitalization of the economy is exaggerating the urban-rural divide,\u201d said Mr. Sundararajan, who studies the technology industry\u2019s role in the economy. \u201cThe part of the digital revolution that I have been waiting for, that I haven\u2019t seen kick in in the United States, is the large platforms enabling opportunities for individuals who may not have high-tech skills.\u201dJack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Solar Mini-Grids Give Nigeria a Power Boost", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGBAMU GBAMU, Nigeria \u2014 Music blasts from King Royal Guesthouse, a small restaurant in the village of Gbamu Gbamu, a three-hour drive from Lagos. It\u2019s early afternoon, but purple and green disco lights flash above a television. A powerful fan blows the hot air as patrons sit on plastic chairs, drink cold beers and sodas, and check their cellphones.The owner, Olamide Olasunkanmi, previously used a generator to power appliances. He had to buy heavy jugs of gasoline and carry them on a motorbike from the nearest town, about 30 minutes down a dirt road that becomes a muddy mess when it rains.But Mr. Olasunkanmi doesn\u2019t use the generator much since he connected to a new solar mini-grid in the village in February.Now, steady solar electricity is available 24 hours a day. When he relied on the generator, he had to unplug the freezer and turn off the television and fan if he wanted to use his water pump. Now, he can run all the appliances at the same time. He pays about 20,000 naira ($55) each month for solar power \u2014 about what he paid for gasoline. But he uses more appliances and electricity, and he says his \u201cstress is reduced\u201d because he no longer hauls fuel from town. \u201cWe enjoy the power more,\u201d he said.In Gbamu Gbamu (pronounced BOMB-ou BOMB-ou), in Nigeria\u2019s Ogun State, more than 2,500 people like Mr. Olasunkanmi no longer rely on expensive, polluting generators to light homes and run small businesses such as grain mills, cocoa drying and welding operations, carpentry workshops, and small restaurants and hotels.Rubitec built the Gbamu Gbamu mini-grid, composed of more than 300 large solar panels on a compact plot of land. A small powerhouse is lined with imported inverters and batteries that can store enough energy for electricity, even during the rainy season. Wires on wooden poles run from the mini-grid to homes and businesses that have paid for a connection.Solar mini-grids are part of new efforts in Nigeria to increase electricity and bolster energy security in Africa\u2019s most populous country. Nigeria is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of oil and gas and the largest producer of hydropower in West Africa.Nigeria\u2019s power plants can generate about 13,000 megawatts of electricity, but they produce only about 4,000 megawatts because of gas shortages, as well as grid constraints, poor maintenance and technical problems.Nigeria aims to increase electricity capacity to 30,000 megawatts by 2030 with a third of that from renewable energy sources such as hydropower and solar. It\u2019s an ambitious target because proposed incentives such as tax breaks on imported solar panels, batteries and equipment have yet to be put into effect.However, to stimulate other industries such as agriculture, food processing, construction and technology, Nigeria needs electricity.Increasing renewable energy and moving away from generators would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and hazardous particulate matter known as black carbon, Ms. Hommers said.Yet solar mini-grids are no silver bullet. To be sustainable, companies must have enough paying customers, preferably commercial users who demand more power.\u201cWe need to stimulate more demand,\u201d Bolade Soremekun, chief executive of Rubitec, said of the Gbamu Gbamu mini-grid. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about having lights and charging phones. If people use electricity for productive use, it can earn more money.\u201dElectricity from the mini-grid costs about 150 to 200 naira per kilowatt-hour compared with 25 to 30 naira from the national grid. However, mini-grid power is still cheaper than fuel for generators and more convenient and reliable. As equipment costs come down and companies add customers, electricity prices could come down. And solar can be more reliable than the national grid.If all goes smoothly, actual mini-grid construction can take less than one month \u2014 far less time than building a hydropower plant.In Gbamu Gbamu, Rukayat Lawal works at Kadet Agro, a small business that dries cocoa beans in a large metal machine. Over its roar, she explained that the company used to spend at least 7,000 naira for a 30-liter jug of gasoline to dry 100 large sacks of cocoa. Now, Kadet Agro spends about 5,000 naira to do the same work.Ms. Lawal is relieved that she no longer has to spend two hours to go to town and fetch gasoline jugs on a motorbike. And at home, \u201cwe use fans, watch TV, we charge our phones,\u201d she added. In the village, people often sleep outside to escape the stifling heat indoors. With solar-electricity fans, \u201cnow we can sleep inside,\u201d she said. \u201cWe enjoy the solar very well.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the establishment in which Olorunwa Eleshin was retrieving drinks from a refrigerator powered by a solar mini-grid. It was the God Dey Hotel bar, not the King Royal Guesthouse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The South Asian Artists Making Their Mark on the Western Scene", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen from India, Pakistan and beyond are finally gaining recognition thanks to a spate of recent and coming museum shows.In Ranjani Shettar\u2019s installation \u201cSeven Ponds and a Few Raindrops,\u201d looping, delicate steel forms covered in tamarind-stained muslin sway ominously in midair, evocative of parched flora or exoskeletons. Reimagining local craft traditions to create abstract sculptures, the Indian artist\u2019s work, which was on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art this summer, speaks elegiacally to environmental loss, to historic relationships with the earth and to future uncertainties. While visually distinct, the installation at the Met couldn\u2019t help but be in conversation with another: \u201cWe Come in Peace,\u201d Huma Bhabha\u2019s much-photographed two-part sculpture of a figure shrouded in a black garbage bag prostrating before a godlike giant, which conjures a haunting narrative of war and brutality, and of our ongoing grappling with the other.Before 2013, neither the Met, the Museum of Modern Art, nor the Guggenheim had featured a solo exhibition of a South Asian woman. While some have been present in occasional regional surveys \u2014 primarily at institutions like the Asia Society and the Queens Museum (where the influential 1997 exhibition \u201cOut of India\u201d helped introduce contemporary art from the subcontinent to U.S. audiences) \u2014 Jain believes those group shows were often reductive. \u201cIt was a basic overview, a 30,000-foot view,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a much deeper conversation going on.\u201dAccording to Shanay Jhaveri, the Met curator behind the Shettar and Bhabha installations, a heightened focus on South Asian women flows from American museums actively thinking more globally and beginning to reckon with long-held blind spots. Indeed, Jhaveri\u2019s mere presence is evidence of what he calls a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d on the Met\u2019s part: Brought on in 2016, he\u2019s the museum\u2019s first curator of South Asian modern and contemporary art, one of a number of newly created positions focusing on the non-Western world. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is a reconsideration of our received art histories,\u201d Jhaveri says. \u201cPart of that is an acknowledgment that there are a number of female artistic practices that have been overlooked, marginalized or forgotten.\u201dIn the decade since, the market has remained cautious. But diminishing commercial pressures seem to have created room for complexity and nuance \u2014 for women, for artists who truly expand conceptions of what South Asian art can be. \u201cBefore 2008, it was like, \u2018The next hot spot is India and we must figure it out,\u2019\u201d says Jain. \u201cNow, institutions are finally recognizing these people as artists and not only as the next wave.\u201dIf the spate of American exhibitions in the United States by South Asian women is any indication, these parallel energies \u2014 deeper interest from American museums, a canny push from South Asian practitioners \u2014 are having a real effect. But of course, the latest iteration of the trend still comes with pitfalls, as grouping a diverse array of South Asian women artists into a single story of progress risks othering them further, as well as flattening their work in precisely the ways they reject.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is a Recession, and Why Are People Talking About the Next One?", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy may be healthy, but the cynics abound.It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess when the good times will end, but in a complicated, volatile world it\u2019s not a question of if a recession is coming, but when.Here\u2019s a brief guide to what you should know about recessions and why some people are talking about the next one now.Simply put, a recession is when the economy stops growing and starts shrinking.Some say that happens when the value of goods and services produced in a country, known as the gross domestic product, declines for two consecutive quarters, or half a year.In the United States, though, the National Bureau of Economic Research, a century-old nonprofit widely considered the arbiter of recessions and expansions, takes a broader view.Recessions come in all shapes and sizes. Some are long, some are short. Some create lasting damage, while some are quickly forgotten. And some touch virtually all parts of the economy, while others are more targeted, said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan and a former member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.\u201cIn a slight recession, many won\u2019t experience any kind of labor market problems, they won\u2019t see very many of their friends experience labor market problems, but there are other communities that get completely devastated,\u201d she said.A recession ends when growth returns, but it can often take some time for society or the bureau to recognize it.Despite recent headlines, things have been going quite well: Unemployment is at its lowest level in decades; employers have added jobs for eight years running; and the economy this year is on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2005.So why are some worrying about the next recession?Some worry that the nation is overdue. The expansion is currently the second-longest on record and will be the longest if it continues into next summer, according to the research bureau.But experts dismiss that line of thinking, arguing that recoveries don\u2019t merely die of old age.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason the economy can\u2019t continue enjoying good times forever, essentially,\u201d Dr. Stevenson said. \u201cRecessions get started when something knocks the economy off course \u2014 a shock or a change.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s foolish to ignore all these things and say they don\u2019t matter at all,\u201d said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut it\u2019s also foolish to think that there\u2019s some sort of law of physics here.\u201dWhile people talk of \u201cbusiness cycles,\u201d there is little regularity to how recessions occur.Recessions are difficult to compare because each affects different parts of the economy in different ways and at different times. But only one stands out like the recession that began in 1929, known as the Great Depression, which is seared in the memories of older Americans and passed down in family lore.\u201cThe gold standard,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics at George Washington University and the co-director of the school\u2019s research program on forecasting. \u201cYou can choose any metric you want to and it just looks really horrific.\u201d (A depression is a general term for a very deep recession.)The Great Recession, which stretched from late 2007 to mid-2009, is typically considered the next worst. During that recession, the value of goods and services produced in the United States fell by a little more than 4 percent.Not really. Try as they may, politicians and government officials can do little to fully ward off recessions.\u201cPolicymakers can\u2019t prevent what they don\u2019t predict,\u201d Dr. Sinclair said.\u201cThe forecasting record on consistently predicting recessions in enough time and with enough accuracy to actually implement policy to prevent them is just shockingly poor,\u201d she said.Even if policymakers were able to create a perfectly well-oiled economy, they would have to tame psychology, too. That\u2019s one reason they try to put the best face on indicators like job reports, stock market indexes and holiday retail sales.\u201cIf consumers decide that a recession might be coming so they stop spending, then a recession will be coming,\u201d Dr. Stevenson said.Officials can do some things to lessen the severity of a recession through the use of monetary policy, carried out by a central bank like the Federal Reserve, and fiscal policy, set by lawmakers.With fiscal policy, lawmakers can try to soften the effects of recessions. One response might include targeted tax cuts or spending increases on safety net programs like unemployment insurance that kick in automatically to stabilize the economy when it is underperforming.While it\u2019s hard to predict when or where a recession will strike, individuals can take precautions to blunt its effects.For one, they can make sure they have enough money saved up to survive a job loss or other financial catastrophe.Experts typically advise having enough money set aside to cover living expenses for three to six months.Recessions also tend to hit those with less formal education the hardest, so it helps to have or pursue a higher education, if possible.\u201cThe people who tend to get hurt most in a recession are those with less education, and it takes the longest for them to recover,\u201d Dr. Stevenson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says China Will Curtail Fentanyl. The U.S. Has Heard That Before.", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China vows to stem the supply of the powerful opioid fentanyl flowing into the United States. It pledges to target exports of fentanyl-related substances bound for the United States that are prohibited there, while sharing information with American law-enforcement authorities.Such promises, echoed in the recent meeting between the countries\u2019 presidents, ring familiar.So when the Trump administration said on Saturday that President Xi Jinping of China had agreed to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance in \u201ca wonderful humanitarian gesture,\u201d analysts said there was little to cheer about.\u201cIt\u2019s in many ways all theater from the White House and very little serious substance,\u201d said John Collins, executive director of the International Drug Policy Unit at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt seems to me the same story again.\u201dCracking down on the manufacturing and distribution of fentanyl in China is no easy task. As Mr. Collins noted, many classes of the drug are already considered controlled substances in the country. Fentanyl\u2019s chemical structure and those of related analogues can be modified to create similar yet distinct substances, so new versions can be concocted quickly.Because of fentanyl\u2019s potency and the ease with which it can be produced, one kilogram bought for $3,000 to $5,000 in China can potentially kill 500,000 people, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.The Trump administration said that Mr. Xi\u2019s announcement meant that people selling fentanyl to American buyers and shipping it into the United States would \u201cbe subject to China\u2019s maximum penalty under the law\u201d: the death penalty. China did not specify the punishment for violating the new ban, but anyone guilty of trafficking in controlled substances is subject to capital punishment.The United States has long pushed China to systemically control all fentanyl substances. China\u2019s approach has been to ban chemicals one by one, and only after getting evidence for why it should do so from the other countries and the United Nations.The lag has allowed Chinese makers of illicit drugs to create new fentanyl derivatives faster than they can be controlled, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.China, which does not have an opioid-abuse problem, has made some progress in cooperating with the United States on the issue. It has said it would label 25 fentanyl substances and two precursors \u2014 the chemical ingredients that can be used to make the drug \u2014 controlled substances.Officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration have recently praised China for being receptive to working together and sharing information.Jeremy Douglas, the regional representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said China\u2019s willingness to take steps to control fentanyl was \u201ca good move.\u201d\u201cPractically it means that anything that is created in that class will be automatically on the Chinese control list, and there will be legal repercussions for trafficking,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s nothing stopping a pharmaceutical company or supplier from selling related but noncontrolled substances.\u201dBut Mr. Douglas said the impact would not be immediate. He said he had clarified the announcement\u2019s meaning with a senior official in Beijing, who told him that China would need to amend its laws before the full ban could take effect.That process might take months, assuming China proceeds. As with other points of contention between the two countries, the problem for Washington is getting Beijing to fulfill its promises.Complicating the matter is the size of China\u2019s chemical industry. State Department data shows that there are about 160,000 chemical companies in China. Weak regulation means that those producing fentanyl substances will probably still be willing to sell them despite the new ban.\u201cChina controls the majority of global fentanyl sales, so it is a thriving industry there,\u201d said Jeffrey Higgins, a retired special supervisory agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration. \u201cThere are economic incentives for the Chinese to let opioid production flourish and fewer incentives to restrict their economy to cooperate with foreign law enforcement. We will have to wait and see how much the Chinese government cracks down on fentanyl producers.\u201dThere is also little awareness in China that the United States has an opioid problem, or that China is contributing to it.During an informal meeting about health care cooperation in Virginia last month, American officials told senior officials from the China Food and Drug Administration and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention about America\u2019s fentanyl problem.Chen Xi, an assistant professor of public health at Yale University who was there, said the Chinese officials said that \u201cthey had never heard of this.\u201dNow, he said, \u201cit\u2019s no longer underground, everyone is talking about this.\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s a major breakthrough \u2014 a major step toward better stronger enforcement and regulation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Next America\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow do we govern in the age that will begin with the 2020 election? Opinion ColumnistI have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime \u2014 and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent \u2014 he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus \u2014 but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the \u201cNext America\u2019\u2019?\u201cYou know William Gibson\u2019s line, \u2018The future is already here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed\u2019? Well, the future is here, and now it\u2019s starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,\u2019\u2019 Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of \u201cIndispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,\u2019\u2019 remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. \u201cThe basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.\u2019\u2019This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass.Where do I start? A good place is with 5G \u2014 fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around \u2026 2020.Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 like deploying self-driving vehicles \u2014 requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor.As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, \u201cThink of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.\u2019\u2019It could be as revolutionary as the internet. But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides.An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently \u201cabout 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.\u2019\u2019But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be \u201ccontinuous lifelong learning\u2019\u2019 \u2014 because when the pace of change is accelerating, \u201cthe fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition.\u201dThat means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 we will need new national trampolines.We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time.Tennessee has already done that.These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services?\u201cBut that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for \u2018free\u2019 in exchange for personal data,\u201d Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. \u201cThis has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.\u2019\u2019Just one person \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain \u2014 and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros \u2014 should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look.Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump\u2019s tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We\u2019ve had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we\u2019ve never run one so huge during a boom.That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare \u2014 just when all the baby boomers are retiring.In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more \u2014 from climate change to zoning rules \u2014 and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won\u2019t let us do that again. The Next America won\u2019t wait.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Secret to Winning in 2020", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the populism, stupid.Opinion ColumnistYoung or old? Female or male? White, black or Latino? The first stage of the 2020 presidential campaign \u2014 the jockeying stage \u2014 is underway, and Democrats are trying to figure out who the ideal candidate is.They\u2019re asking the wrong questions, though. Demographic identity matters much less than people often imagine. Think about it: Would an algorithm meant to produce the ideal candidate have spat out any of the past three presidents \u2014 a 70-year-old, orange-haired reality-television star; a law professor with the middle name Hussein; or the son of a recent one-term president with the very same name?There is only one quality \u2014 beyond, of course, charisma \u2014 that Democrats should demand in their nominee. The Democrats need a candidate who can and will run as an economic populist.They need a candidate who will organize the 2020 campaign around fighting for the little guy and gal. (And most of the potential Democratic nominees could do so.) It would be a campaign about Republican politicians and corporate lobbyists who are rigging the game, a campaign that promised good jobs, rising wages, decent health care, affordable education and an end to Trumpian corruption.The first big batch of evidence is public opinion: On economic issues, most Americans are decidedly populist.These issues are politically potent because they unite the Democratic coalition and divide the Republican coalition. The Democratic base \u2014 including Africans-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos, young college graduates and middle-class women \u2014 leans populist, polling shows. But so do the white-working class voters who often swing 21st-century elections.Democrats still aren\u2019t going to win a majority of the white working class. But they don\u2019t need to. They just need to avoid getting crushed. When they do that, they win elections.In southern New Mexico, Xochitl Torres Small talked about hard work and grit. In northeast Iowa, Abby Finkenauer\u2019s campaign slogan was, \u201cFighting for Iowa\u2019s Working Families.\u201d In dozens of districts, Democrats campaigned on protecting people\u2019s health insurance.And most of these candidates won. If Democrats repeat their 2018 performance in 2020, they will win the White House.This group is mostly white, mostly without a college degree and disproportionately rural, according to the analysis, by YouGov Blue and Data for Progress. On social issues, the group\u2019s attitudes look pretty Republican. Many of its members think sexism isn\u2019t that big of a problem, for instance. They express anxiety about demographic change and favor tighter border security.These are the sort of voters that some Democrats had written off as irredeemable racists. But that\u2019s a terrible mistake.On economic issues, swing voters look decidedly un-Republican. They are even more populist than loyal Democrats. By a wide margin, they favor free college, a big expansion of Medicare and federal action both to reduce drug prices and to create jobs.Trump\u2019s populism is a mirage, but many voters believed it in 2016. He was the rare Republican who criticized free trade and seemed to care more about protecting Medicare than reducing the budget deficit. Trump managed to out-populist Hillary Clinton, and it\u2019s a part of why he won.The Democratic president before Obama \u2014 Bill Clinton \u2014 ran as a populist, too. It\u2019s true he also pitched himself as a centrist rather than a liberal. But populism isn\u2019t the same as liberalism. Most voters don\u2019t tote up all of a candidate\u2019s policies and try to figure out his or her precise ideology. They care more about the values a candidate projects, and Clinton sold himself as an ally of workers.Contrast Bill Clinton and Obama with the Democrats who have lost a presidential election over the last generation: Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Al Gore. Fairly or not, none of them figured out how to portray themselves as defenders of ordinary families.Finally, it\u2019s worth glancing at other countries where, as in the United States, the middle class has been struggling lately. Populism has also been working, for both good and ill, in many of those places.Populism takes very different forms \u2014 from odious racism to sensible economics \u2014 but there is no other political style consistently succeeding in the Western world right now.There is more than one form that a Democratic populist can take. Franklin Roosevelt, the most successful populist of the past century, was an aristocrat. Bill Clinton and Lyndon Johnson were hardscrabble Southerners. Barack Obama managed to do quite well with much of the white working class despite having one big obvious difference from them.So the need to run a populist campaign in 2020 doesn\u2019t point to any specific candidate.Yes, there are a few for whom populism would come easily, including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The same applies to Senator Sherrod Brown. While most Democrats were getting thumped in Ohio this year, his blue-collar style helped him win comfortably.Then there are other candidates for whom a populist campaign would be a natural outgrowth of their careers. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, has focused on the disturbing power of large corporations. Kamala Harris, the California senator, has proposed a huge middle-class tax cut.We\u2019re living in a populist era. The question is who figures out how to thrive in it. In 2016, it was Trump. It doesn\u2019t need to be in 2020.A previous version of this column misstated the title of Emmanuel Macron. He is the president of France, not its prime minister.Advertisement"}

But as she has tightened her grip on power, fundamental rights have been eroded.Now the 71-year-old leader is seeking her third consecutive term on Sunday. In defending her record, Mrs. Hasina questioned the very definition of human rights.\u201cIf I can provide food, jobs and health care, that is human rights,\u201d she said this month in an interview with The New York Times. She vowed, if re-elected, to deliver 10 percent annual growth, up from the current 7.8 percent, and eliminate extreme poverty while continuing to strengthen welfare programs.\u201cWhat the opposition is saying, or civil society or your N.G.O.\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t bother with that,\u201d she said of nongovernmental organizations and her critics. \u201cI know my country, and I know how to develop my country. My biggest challenge is that no one is left behind.\u201dLocal activists, political rivals and international rights organizations accuse Mrs. Hasina of co-opting state institutions like the judiciary and the police.Some Bangladeshis have been punished after speaking against the government, and a new law on digital security gives the police sweeping powers to monitor people\u2019s activity online and arrest critics without warrants. There are fears she will become even more heavy-handed should she win a new term.Mrs. Hasina and her Awami League are pitted against the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The country has vacillated between the two parties since the advent of democracy in 1991, when military rule ended.Mrs. Hasina dismissed such criticism from local and international organizations.\u201cThey are trying to please their donors and exaggerating,\u201d she said, to get more funding.\u201cHe was doing propaganda against the government and instigating people to violence,\u201d Mrs. Hasina said of Mr. Alam, who has been freed on bail but could still face prison time.Voters complain this election gives them few real choices. The opposition coalition is dominated by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party but encompasses some two dozen parties bound by little other than their desire to check the prime minister\u2019s hold on power.It is unclear which candidate the opposition would vote in as prime minister should it clinch a majority of the 300 seats up for grabs in the election.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party\u2019s own track record is marred. Even its secretary general, Mirza Fakhul Islam Alamgir, acknowledged in an interview this month that human rights violations and corruption flourished under his party in the past, with extrajudicial killings and disappearances used as governance tools.But Mr. Alamgir and his allies say that violations under the B.N.P. government were limited and that, given another chance, they would govern well.Some voters who are satisfied with the economic development under Mrs. Hasina\u2019s leadership may still vote for the B.N.P., not because they think the party has a greater affinity for human rights, but because they hope to salvage democracy, they say, by providing a check on the governing party in Parliament.\u201cWe are choosing the lesser of two evils in our politics,\u201d said Iftekharuzzaman, who goes by one name and is the executive director of the Bangladesh arm of Transparency International, a corruption watchdog.\u201cAll government institutions have a stake in the elections now; they have been politicized strongly,\u201d he said, adding that if Mrs. Hasina \u201cwins a third term, she will increase her authoritarianism, her hold over the state.\u201d\u201cThe only silver lining one can see out of this mess is a Parliament with a significant opposition to provide some checks and balances,\u201d Mr. Iftekharuzzaman said.He and Human Rights Watch say that the governing party has undermined an open campaigning process, with the police intimidating opposition candidates and protesters, imprisoning politicians for several days under false charges and tearing down their posters.The B.N.P. said this month that 10 of its candidates are in prison and 6,000 party loyalists have been arrested.\u201cIf we have a multiparty system, a Parliament that works and a government without absolute power, then this election may be worth the intimidation,\u201d said Kamal Hossain, the head of the opposition coalition. He had previously been allied with Mrs. Hasina.Independent observers say that antipathy toward incumbents is strong and that it is hard to determine whether Mrs. Hasina will win on Sunday. But the opposition is plagued by bitter infighting, and the manifestoes of the B.N.P. and the Awami League are nearly identical, promising vague paths to continued economic growth and better welfare programs.Mrs. Hasina said in her interview that the right to criticize the government freely is only a concern of the urbanized elites. She says her government has delivered on what rural Bangladeshis are most concerned with: getting food on the table, medical care and jobs.Per capita income has increased by nearly 150 percent, while the share of the population living in extreme poverty has shrunk to about 9 percent from 19 percent, according to the World Bank.Electricity generation has also increased drastically under Mrs. Hasina\u2019s rule, helping to boost factory production and spreading out to homes in rural areas. The rates of maternal mortality and illiteracy have also declined.Sultana Kamal, a Bangladeshi activist who was once close to Mrs. Hasina but has become increasingly wary of her, said a win by the current government would be seen as an indifference by voters to rights concerns.\u201cIf Awami League returns, they will say, \u2018The critics are criticizing us, but we returned to power on the people\u2019s vote. The people don\u2019t care about extrajudicial killings, human rights or corruption,\u2019\u201d she said.Bangladesh\u2019s telecoms regulator has ordered mobile operators to shut down high-speed mobile internet services until midnight on Sunday, the day of a national election.Activists are worried that the shut down will prevent election monitors from sharing information about any irregularities at polling stations and alerting the public.For Rashed Khan, a student who moved to Dhaka from a farming village to attend college, resentment of the crackdown on freedom of expression and assembly is not limited to city-dwellers, as the prime minister says.\u201cI am from a village,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cVillage politics are important; they want to be able to speak their minds.\u201dLike other activists, Mr. Khan says democratic ideals cannot be sacrificed for economic growth.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the government want our opinion, our input?\u201d asked Mr. Khan. \u201cIf we have no rights to criticize the government, this development doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Consumers are cautious. Apartments are sitting unsold. Industrial profits are falling, too.But China\u2019s state media wants people to look at another indicator: men\u2019s underwear.Sales of boxers and briefs are surging in Liaoning Province, according to The Global Times, a fervently nationalist tabloid controlled by the Communist Party, bringing a bit of good news to a down-and-out part of China\u2019s rust belt that epitomizes many of the country\u2019s economic problems. Cheered by the prospect of a brighter future, the article argued, Liaoning men are upgrading a part of their wardrobe that most of their friends and family will never see.In highlighting such an unorthodox economic indicator, The Global Times is harking back to a long tradition of eclectic economic indicators, one that the general public and even some economists like to turn to when the usual yardsticks of the dismal science just won\u2019t do.But in the case of the Liaoning Underwear Index, economists are \u2014 to put it lightly \u2014 skeptical.\u201cThe only relevant context here,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm, \u201cis that China\u2019s economy is slowing markedly and official media have been ordered to smear the pig with lipstick.\u201dLiaoning itself provides a handy example.

Even before that, it gave birth to one of China\u2019s most closely watched unofficial economic gauges: the Li Keqiang Index.While the Li Keqiang Index has some grounding in economic nuts and bolts, the Liaoning Underwear Index was greeted by economists with a hefty dose of caution.The Global Times cited data from the research arm of the online retailer JD.com, saying that men\u2019s underwear sales had jumped 42 percent in 2017 and 32 percent so far this year. The rate of increase in underwear sales in Liaoning is greater than in any other province, The Global Times wrote. But when asked whether JD.com had comparable figures for other provinces, Ling Cao, a spokeswoman for the company, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have figures from other provinces.\u201dThe JD.com figures are also online only, meaning they don\u2019t include underwear sales in brick-and-mortar stores.Global Times staff members didn\u2019t respond to calls and an email for comment.Here\u2019s the thing: Even if its methodology is uncertain, the Liaoning Underwear Index may be coincidentally right.The province\u2019s figures for industrial profits, production and consumption have been on the rise, experts say. Much of that growth may come from Chinese efforts to rekindle the economy, as it turns away from efforts to cut debt and begins approving the sort of big-cement, big-iron building and infrastructure programs that fueled so much of its growth after the global financial crisis of 2008.\u201cOn the face of it, the Liaoning branch of the National Bureau of Statistics has reported some decent economic numbers for the past few months,\u201d said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego.\u201cHaving said that,\u201d Mr. Shih added, \u201cthis is happening after a couple of years of dismal economic performance.\u201dThere\u2019s another possibility, he said. Underwear, being soft and eminently foldable, can be easily shipped from one corner of China to the next. So it will go where there are customers.Perhaps, goes this thinking, Liaoning men are returning home because they can\u2019t find work in any other province. And they have to wear something.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renault Under Pressure as Carlos Ghosn Remains in Jail", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 When Carlos Ghosn was arrested on his private jet in Japan last month on charges of violating the nation\u2019s financial reporting laws, Nissan promptly removed him as its chairman. At the French automaker Renault, the management stuck by Mr. Ghosn, its chief executive and chairman.But an intensifying storm is putting pressure on Renault\u2019s defensive posture.Mr. Ghosn was detained just as Renault was suffering a slump in sales in Europe and confronting a worsening power struggle with Nissan, its longtime partner. There is even a political dimension. In the Yellow Vest protests that have galvanized France, Mr. Ghosn has become a symbol of excess wealth and runaway corporate power.Renault\u2019s position is becoming increasingly untenable the longer Mr. Ghosn sits in jail.His chances of being released soon from his tiny prison cell in Tokyo, where he has been held since Nov. 19, dimmed considerably on Sunday after a Japanese judge ruled that he could be held at least through Jan. 1 and perhaps longer, to give prosecutors more time to question him. Before that, on Friday, the authorities arrested Mr. Ghosn again based on new allegations of financial misconduct.At stake is not only Mr. Ghosn\u2019s position atop Renault, but also the fate of the company\u2019s longstanding alliance with Nissan, which Mr. Ghosn also led. Renault and Nissan are being forced to confront the frictions between them and agree on new leadership for their unique auto-making union.Mr. Ghosn, a larger-than-life figure who forged a global auto empire out of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, which joined in 2016, was stripped of his chairmanship posts by both Japanese carmakers after an investigation by Nissan alleged that he had illegally omitted reporting millions in compensation in Japanese securities filings.But at Renault, where Mr. Ghosn was a star executive for two decades, top management refrained from passing judgment, while a temporary leadership team runs the company in his absence.It\u2019s a difficult time for the automakers to be uncertain about their leadership. Demand for cars in China, the United States and Europe, the three biggest auto markets, is falling. Analysts agree that the alliance that Renault and Nissan founded in 1999 to share purchasing and expertise is essential if the companies are to remain competitive in an industry where size provides a crucial advantage.In the United States, Nissan is facing the consequences of a strategy focused on winning market share at the expense of profit, championed by Mr. Ghosn. Nissan is trying to dial back its discounts just as the overall market enters a downturn, and as the Ghosn arrest tarnishes its image.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to ratchet back incentives when other companies are ratcheting them up,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, an online buying and selling platform. \u201cTheir strategy came home to roost.\u201dRenault needs Nissan, the dominant performer in the alliance, to continue contributing to Renault financially. Some Renault officials are concerned that Nissan\u2019s operating margin has been slipping, including since the scandal erupted.Renault officials have been waiting to hear Mr. Ghosn state his own defense before making a formal decision about his future with the company, according to two people familiar with the situation. That has been impossible while he has been incarcerated, unable to receive visits from his lawyers, family or anyone at Renault.If Renault hears from Mr. Ghosn soon, the board may meet in January, ahead of a formal February meeting, to discuss how to proceed, one of those people said.Officially, Renault and the French government, which is Renault\u2019s biggest shareholder, say they support the presumption of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s innocence. But behind closed doors, it has become increasingly difficult to see how Mr. Ghosn can continue his leadership.Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a Nissan director who was also arrested, are charged with underreporting more than $40 million in Mr. Ghosn\u2019s Nissan compensation over five years. Investigators in Japan are also looking into a Dutch subsidiary of the Nissan-Renault alliance that Mr. Kelly allegedly used as a slush fund to pay for some of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s luxurious homes and other expenses related to a high-flying executive lifestyle.On Friday, Japanese prosecutors added a new allegation: that Mr. Ghosn shifted more than $16 million in personal losses incurred a decade ago to Nissan. The Japanese authorities have not indicted Mr. Ghosn on any charges related to the accusation, but have allowed prosecutors to continue holding him just when it looked as if he might be released on bail.Renault\u2019s lawyers have been poring over documents handed over only recently by Nissan\u2019s lawyers, and providing their legal opinions to the Renault board.Mr. Ghosn maintains his innocence, according to his Japanese-appointed lawyer. But a stream of coverage about his lucrative compensation, luxurious homes and an over-the-top wedding reception for him and his new wife at the palace at Versailles have rankled sensibilities in France.During the recent Yellow Vest protests in France denouncing inequality, Mr. Ghosn was sometimes held up as a symbol of outsize wealth and corruption. Photos of his Versailles wedding party, featuring actresses dressed as Marie Antoinette, were passed around mockingly on social media.The optics are proving tricky, especially for the French government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault. President Emmanuel Macron is struggling in opinion polls, with average French people seeing him as a \u201cpresident of the rich.\u201dEven if Mr. Ghosn is freed on bail, it is unclear that he would be allowed to leave Japan. He would still have to prepare for lengthy court proceedings, making it nearly impossible for him to dedicate time to running Renault, much less the alliance.Prosecutors are expected to depict Mr. Ghosn as a powerful executive who overstepped bounds by seeking ways to amass a hidden fortune on top of his already lucrative compensation..Renault\u2019s priority is to smooth frictions with Nissan over governance and the future leadership of the alliance, which grew to depend solely on Mr. Ghosn. None of the automakers appear willing to allow a single dominant figure to run operations or accumulate power again the way he did.Tensions have risen in the face of suspicions in France that Nissan may be using the opportunity to reshape the alliance\u2019s balance of power. There are also concerns that Nissan dragged its feet in presenting the French with evidence of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s alleged wrongdoing.Renault owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, and Nissan holds a 15 percent share of Renault without voting rights. Nissan has said it wants to rebalance the alliance ever since a dramatic episode in 2015, when Mr. Macron, then France\u2019s economy minister, ordered a surprise increase in the French government\u2019s stake in Renault, which was meant to double the state\u2019s voting rights.The move, which Mr. Ghosn opposed in a bitter fight with Mr. Macron, rattled Nissan, which threatened to leave the alliance\u2019s master agreement. To calm tensions, Renault agreed not to interfere in Nissan\u2019s governance, including Nissan shareholder decisions on the appointment, dismissal and compensation of Nissan board members.That has become a poison pill for Renault after the arrest of Mr. Ghosn, who holds one of the three seats that Renault is allotted on Nissan\u2019s board. Now that Mr. Ghosn is unable to take part in meetings, all Renault can do for now is plead with Nissan to call a special shareholder meeting to name a replacement \u2014 a step that Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, declined to take last week.Mr. Saikawa met with Renault\u2019s chief operating officer, Thierry Bollor\u00e9, in Amsterdam on Thursday at the headquarters of Renault-Nissan BV. It was the first time the men have met face-to-face since Mr. Saikawa held a news conference in Tokyo last month to announce Nissan\u2019s allegations.Both companies reaffirmed their commitment to the alliance, and discussed future projects and other elements of Renault-Nissan operations.Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt. Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Houston Recalls Legacy of George Bush, Its Lone Star Yankee and Senior Booster", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Inside the airport that bears his name, George Herbert Walker Bush looks, at a distance, as if he\u2019s wearing a cape.Mr. Bush and Houston \u2014 both a little quirky, a little square, a little misunderstood \u2014 were a natural fit. The former president was an apolitical Lone Star Yankee, revered for long ago helping to give an international gravitas to a city where he lived off and on since the 1950s and spent his post-White House years. He was born in Milton, Mass., and raised in Greenwich, Conn., but few in Houston ever had the nerve to hold it against him, because just about everybody in Houston came there from somewhere else, too.Mr. Bush was the most senior local booster in the city, known nearly as much for being the former chairman of the Harris County Republican Party (in 1963) and a congressman (until 1971) as for being president. One of his last local acts showed his evenhandedness in these partisan times. In June, Mr. Bush wrote a letter to the mayor of Houston, supporting the city\u2019s bid to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\u201cFor the record, I was not in Houston 90 years ago when we hosted the 1928 Democratic Convention at Sam Houston Hall,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote.\u201cGeorge H.W. Bush served with valor and integrity as the 41st president of the United States,\u201d Houston\u2019s mayor, Sylvester Turner, said in a statement. \u201cBut to Houstonians he was one of our most esteemed and relatable neighbors. He and his wife, Barbara Bush, were our sports teams\u2019 biggest fans, and boosters for everything Houston.\u201dThis was the man whose most memorable quote in years had to do with men\u2019s hosiery. In 2012, as his fondness for wearing bright eye-catching socks was going strong, he explained that he simply \u201clikes a good sock.\u201d At his wife\u2019s funeral at St. Martin\u2019s Episcopal Church in Houston, Mr. Bush wore a pair of socks with a colorful stack-of-books design, a tribute to Mrs. Bush\u2019s advocacy work for family literacy.In Houston and its surrounding suburbs, Mr. Bush had not only an airport in his name but a park, a high school and a few more life-size statues. Above Buffalo Bayou, a bronze statue of Mr. Bush looks out into the distance with his hand in his pocket, gazing at, of all things, James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and Mr. Bush\u2019s tennis partner at the Houston Country Club. The statues of the two close friends face each other in the downtown park, separated by about 100 yards, in Houston\u2019s oddest and longest-running staring contest.\u201cAll I can do now,\u201d Mr. Bush told The New York Times in 2011 about the statue, \u201cis hope that the pigeons will be kind and gentle.\u201dCharles C. Foster, a Houston immigration lawyer and a longtime friend of the Bush family, came up with the idea for the George H.W. Bush Monument, which was unveiled in 2004. Mr. Foster recalled the day he sat in Mr. Bush\u2019s office at 10000 Memorial Drive and asked for his blessing for the project.\u201cHe looked at me and he sort of looked up at the ceiling,\u201d Mr. Foster said. \u201cHe pointed to the ceiling and said, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t you wait until I\u2019m up there?\u2019 And then he said, pointing downward, \u2018Or perhaps down there?\u2019\u201dIn 1990, Mr. Bush helped turn the eyes of the world to Houston.As president, he brought thousands of reporters and foreign dignitaries to Houston that summer for the Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations, an annual gathering of the world\u2019s economic powers. The summits had been held in a number of global cities \u2014 London, Tokyo, Paris, Venice \u2014 and Mr. Bush made the case that his adopted hometown belonged among such world-class company.Houston was scrappier back then. The city was rebounding from an oil bust in the 1980s that crippled the economy, and it tried hard to present its best, and cleanest, face to the cameras and the visitors, picking up millions of pounds of trash, repaving roads and enlisting the aid of 12,000 volunteers.\u201cThat was huge for Houston,\u201d Mr. Foster said of the 1990 summit. \u201cWhen the president had a chance, he could have picked some mountain retreat. But he picked his hometown. He was well aware of the chip on our shoulders that we didn\u2019t feel like Houston got the recognition that it should.\u201dNow, with 2.3 million residents (compared with 1.6 million in 1990), Houston is the fourth-largest city in America, known as much for its diversity as its energy-capital status. George Bush High School, part of the Fort Bend school district, is 43 percent Hispanic, 38 percent black, 12 percent Asian and 4 percent white. More than 90 languages and dialects are spoken in the district.Early Saturday morning in the upscale Tanglewood area, Houstonians paused at the gates at South Post Oak Lane and North West Oak Drive \u2014 the entrance to the gated community where Mr. Bush lived. Someone draped an American flag in the center of the gates, decorated for the holidays with Christmas wreaths.Shirley Matthews, 66, a lifelong Houstonian who lives nearby, walked up and took a picture of the memorial for her mother. \u201cHe was just a good person,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t perfect. But it\u2019s family, and we love each other.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The notion that there is a new and better world to strive for and dream about has largely disappeared from our all too skeptical, one might even say cynical, society.There are plenty of dystopias to give us nightmares, but a world without a utopia may be a world not worth living in; utopia is to our notion of history as the speed of light is to the cosmos. It forms the horizon of possibilities necessary for orientation to the world. Without an imaginative search for a better society we are bound to flounder in confused expediency.Because the ideologies of the past century have been largely discredited as false utopias, we are bereft of the notion of a better future.

In this era of accelerating technologies, poverty, disease, resource scarcity, illiteracy and violence are declining. In the past 20 years global poverty has decreased by more than 50 percent. In the past 200 years we have doubled our life expectancy. These are but two examples of the remarkable advancements we have made as modern life moves forward, with comparable progress in extending education, providing sanitation and instilling democracy worldwide.At the core of these trends lies the steady and constant doubling of the price-performance ratio and capacity of information technologies \u2014 technologies that are a thousand times more powerful than they were years ago and will be a million times more powerful 20 years from now. As medicine, agriculture, energy and manufacturing become forms of information technology, we will see radical transformation in all aspects of our lives, including our health, food, clothing, housing and work. The future is better than you think. So, rather than look back at what society may have left behind, I look forward to the future in which our species breaks the shackles of its genetic legacy and achieves inconceivable heights of intelligence, material progress and longevity.Ray Kurzweil is an American author, computer scientist, inventor and futurist.Danielle AllenWe have largely quit intentionally cultivating democratic knowledge \u2014 the knowledge, skills and capacities that civic actors need to sustain healthy democracies.Last June, my home state, Massachusetts, passed new state educational standards, introducing a yearlong civics course for eighth-graders and increasing the focus on civics elsewhere in the curriculum. We can rebuild civic education state by state. Of course, civic education without improvements in how our political institutions function won\u2019t solve the problem, but without a citizenry who knows how to operate democratic institutions, and why we might want them, we won\u2019t be able to rescue our democracy.Danielle Allen is a classicist and political scientist. She is a professor at Harvard University and the author of \u201cCuz: The Life and Times of Michael A.\u201dJacob SollSophistication used to be valued, both as a way of looking at the world and a means of living in it. Now, as our affairs become dizzyingly complex and depressingly straightforward, it is getting lost. It\u2019s odd and it\u2019s troubling. We are losing our grasp of the general concept that things are complicated, and that deep knowledge \u2014 civic, cultural, political \u2014 is a perfect old tool for the challenges of a new world.Just within the Western tradition, Machiavelli, Castiglione, Bacon, Hobbes, Cavendish, Montesquieu, Wollstonecraft and, yes, Ben Franklin, not to mention most of the great novelists and scientists, all called for it. So did the great composers and painters.And then we\u2019ve lost our social sophistication, from elegance and manners to great conversation and the very essential need for high irony. These things were once central to politics too. One didn\u2019t need to be rich to have these qualities. I had a socially sophisticated barber when I was a kid.Greta Garbo and Cary Grant made sophistication a democratic trait; it was all about nuance and seeing the many shades of our world. Jane Austen and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac knew it, too. Frederick Douglass saw that to make the case for freedom, he would have to master language in all of its nuances. This is a paradox and a challenge in the age of artificial intelligence and Twitter. If we cannot rediscover humane sophistication \u2014 a learned and elegant folly \u2014 we will lack the fine analytical blade of deep understanding.Jacob Soll is a professor of philosophy, history and accounting at the University of Southern California.Alexia WebsterFrom my very first visit, I fell madly in love with the Mediterranean.Every five years or so, when my family could afford it, we would trek across the hemisphere, leaving behind the dry, icy Johannesburg winter to visit my grandparents in their village on a little island in Greece.The sea was a realm of magic, an otherworldly kingdom where the octopuses danced in slow motion and pink coral and sea urchins lined the rocks like strange little houses in an underwater village. Years have passed since my first visits, and though the hills are still lit up by the light of the Milky Way and the thick hum of cicadas fills the air, my underwater kingdom has been raided, and the Mediterranean lies almost barren.Now in the summer months, tourists like me arrive in big ferries, while yachts fill the bay and slick boats that look like spaceships shine their bright underwater spotlights into the empty sea below.

I took the idea of the quaint European cake shop and modernized the experience, but my work is a synthesis of what is now and of the work of those who came before me.We are constantly building on the past, polishing it, re-creating it. Recipes are perfect examples of this. Passed down from generation to generation, they are annotated by each baker who uses them.When I designed the wedding cake for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle last spring, we left behind the tradition of a fruit cake, opting instead for lemon and elderflower, flavors that embody the ethos of this moment: seasonality and sustainability. The royal family\u2019s beautifully crafted gilt cake stands had been used countless times over many years, developing a burnished quality that I consider to be more beautiful than something new and perfect. And the many hands that have held them make them intrinsically more beautiful.I\u2019d like to think our society appreciates this nuance. Something old. Something new.Claire Ptak is a baker and pastry chef.

I\u2019m sure these devices will become surgically implanted some day. It\u2019s just a matter of time.I admit that I\u2019m addicted, like millions of others. I feel naked without my device. I feel desperate when it\u2019s misplaced. I confess: I like having an extension for my brain when I can\u2019t remember a fact. Would I want that device implanted? I don\u2019t think so.What we have gained in access to information, we have lost in terms of our time. Every email, every text, every call expects an instant response.

Unlike consumer goods, architecture was for the long haul. That meant durable materials, of course, but it also meant durable ideas; both were required to withstand the test of time.No more. Globalization, branding and the celebrity architect phenomenon have changed all that. Buildings have become more like blockbuster movies; instead of the long haul, they celebrate the immediate, the here and now and up-to-the-minute.It\u2019s all very exciting, for today. But what about tomorrow? Once the novelty wears off, what\u2019s left? Will old buildings be like Hula Hoops and pet rocks; yesterday\u2019s fads? Will they simply be discarded, like old cell phones? Will the only alternatives available to an older building be modernization \u2014 \u201cfreshening up,\u201d in developer\u2019s parlance \u2014 or demolition? If architecture continues down this road, it will sacrifice one of its most precious functions: providing a living connection to the past, to people who were like us, and yet not like us.Witold Rybczynski is a Canadian-American architect, professor and writer.

Since I lived at home, my only expenses were books, lunch money and the bus fare to and from school. I spent my time studying art and literature with the feeling that I was embarking on a lifetime endeavor of the utmost importance.Unlike the local delicatessen, where I ate my lunch every day, the college didn\u2019t hand me a bill after my classes, or after the hours that I spent in the college library.

However, it is also true that with the right investments by sports institutions, in both the public and private sectors, the path for girls to achieve their full potential won\u2019t be as difficult as it was for me.We need more women in decision-making positions in sports governing bodies, better policies for women athletes and more opportunities for girls to play sports, wherever they are in the world.We cannot say humanity has truly moved forward until we level the playing field for women and girls, in every area where they have the potential to excel.Marta Vieira da Silva plays for the Orlando Pride and the Brazilian Women\u2019s National Soccer Team.

{"Headline": "Old Mines Are Full of Dangers (and Possibilities)", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rescue of three people from a mine in West Virginia focused attention on the perils of former mines. But some are being used in creative ways.The mine where the Dec. 12 rescue took place was shut down two years ago, according to records kept by the state Department of Environmental Protection. The operator, Elk Run Coal Company, was acquired last month by Contura Energy, a Tennessee-based coal company.A spokeswoman for Contura said the site had been properly sealed when it was shut down, as required by state law. It\u2019s not clear how the group \u2014 which the authorities said was trying to steal copper \u2014 was able to get into the underground mine, which spans more than 1,000 acres. The Raleigh County prosecutor, Kristen Keller, said her office was investigating.Rescue workers encountered dangerously low oxygen levels and had to pump in fresh air and clear standing water. They eventually progressed 4,000 feet into the mine, with assistance from the West Virginia National Guard and other agencies.\u201cThis is the biggest lesson I\u2019ve ever learned in my life,\u201d Mr. Beverly said.Once they\u2019re shut down permanently, former mining sites can be redeveloped by companies who seek out their wide-open space and unique topography.The report argued that cleaning up the sites and creating jobs would benefit local economies, and noted that wind-power projects were underway on former mining sites in Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Wyoming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On First Day of OPEC Meetings, No Deal to Cut Global Oil Output", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 OPEC ended a meeting on Thursday without striking a deal to reduce oil output and without any clear sign one would be reached when officials from the organization, Russia and other oil producers reconvene Friday.As he climbed into a car on a rainy street outside OPEC headquarters, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, told reporters he was \u201cnot confident\u201d an agreement that would keep supply and demand in balance was within reach.Mr. Falih had said in the morning that \u201call options\u201d were on the table, but that a reduction of one million barrels a day \u2014 roughly 1 percent of the global oil supply \u2014 would be \u201cadequate\u201d to balance the markets. One million barrels a day would likely be considered a modest cut by traders. He said he had heard a range of numbers discussed, from 500,000 to 1.5 million barrels a day.Ann-Louise Hittle, an analyst at the market research firm Wood Mackenzie, said that it was not surprising for the group to fall short of a deal on its first day of meeting.\u201cThey faced a lot of complicated issues,\u201d she said.Mr. Falih, whose country represents 12 percent of global oil output, said he had met with the American special envoy Brian Hook on Wednesday. He said Mr. Hook had \u201crefrained\u201d from asking the Saudis not to cut production, but quickly added, \u201cI don\u2019t need permission to cut.\u201dThe two men discussed several issues, including Washington\u2019s plans to carry out sanctions on Iran.OPEC has been whipsawed by competing pressures lately.On one hand, the world is widely viewed as having an oil glut substantial enough to justify a cut in production. Such a move would prop up prices, which have tumbled since reaching about $76 a barrel for West Texas intermediate crude, the American benchmark, in early October. Prices fell again Thursday. West Texas crude dipped more than 3 percent, to $51.26 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped about 3.5 percent, to $59.40.As low as prices have gotten, President Trump is pressing OPEC, and Saudi Arabia in particular, to maintain production levels to keep them down for American consumers. Mr. Trump used Twitter on Wednesday to show that he was paying attention to the talks.The president\u2019s attempts to intervene in OPEC deliberations create a quandary for the Saudis, whose role in setting production levels and influencing the markets makes them key decision makers at OPEC.\u201cThe Saudis have many constituencies to please, some of them contradictory,\u201d said Roger Diwan, a vice president for oil market strategy at the research firm IHS Markit. \u201cThe tweeting takes away their ability to communicate effectively.\u201dIn normal times, analysts said, there would be little hesitation to cut supplies. But these are not normal times.\u201cThis is one of the strangest OPEC meetings I can remember,\u201d Jim Krane, an energy fellow at the Baker Institute at Rice University said on Wednesday. \u201cBalancing the oil market is taking a back seat to political intrigues involving Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a Trump-caricature Thanksgiving parade balloon hanging outside OPEC headquarters,\u201d he added.Tensions are also emerging within OPEC. Qatar, which has long been part of a bloc of Gulf Arab states supporting the Saudis, said on Monday that it would leave the oil cartel next year to focus on developing natural gas. It hinted that the decision was motivated partly by frustration over the Saudis\u2019 dominance of oil policy.Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s longstanding rival in OPEC, is a complicating factor. The Iranians reacted angrily to news reports of Mr. Hook\u2019s presence in Vienna. The diplomat has been traveling the world to build support for America\u2019s latest sanctions against Iran.Mr. Zanganeh also told reporters before the beginning of the meeting on Thursday that Iran would not accept a cut beyond what was already being reduced by sanctions.Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest exporter, and Russia, which also produces about 12 percent of the world output, increasingly see their interests aligned. Production cuts in late 2016 lifted prices to the point that Saudi Arabia and Russia were persuaded in June to open up the taps. The move was partly a response to Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints at the time about rising prices.\u201cWhat this confirms is that you need to have Russia in place to have a credible deal,\u201d Mr. Diwan said.Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, did not attend the meeting on Thursday, but was expected to be at the session on Friday.The oil market\u2019s focus, though, quickly shifted from possible supply shortages to worries about a potential glut caused, among other things, by a slowing world economy and unexpectedly robust output from the United States.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Thursday that last week the United States had become a net exporter of oil, gasoline and other refined fuels for the first time in 75 years, a notable, if potentially fleeting, distinction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe and U.S. Agree on Chinese Threat, but Are Too Busy Feuding to Fight It", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 They are creating defenses to limit Chinese investment, accusing China of seizing technology from foreign companies and warning of Chinese efforts to undermine their political system.It may all sound like a game plan hatched by officials in Washington, but the agenda is straight out of Brussels. While President Trump battles China over the issue of trade, Europe is in the midst of a conflict with Beijing that, in its own way, is just as intense.European leaders have become increasingly alarmed by what they consider China\u2019s aggressive incursions into the continent\u2019s economy, including paying $23 million to expand port facilities in Bulgaria, providing $3.8 billion in financing for a high-speed railroad connecting Hungary and Serbia and acquiring a German robotics company that employs 14,000 people worldwide.\u201cWe want to have a better overview when certain critical infrastructure is targeted by them,\u201d Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told an audience in Brussels last month.European politicians are also frustrated that although they have many of the same concerns as their American counterparts about China, there has been little cooperation or coordination in their strategies. Rather than joining forces to contain China\u2019s economic expansionism, the Trump administration has treated Europe with disdain.\u201cWe had some serious differences in the past,\u201d Marietje Schaake, the vice chairman of the European Parliament\u2019s delegation for relations with the United States, said in an interview. \u201cBut it has become much more confrontational, at the worst possible moment. We need to stand together as defenders of the liberal order.\u201dRepresentatives of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen described plans to expand manufacturing in the United States, which could tamp down Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints that Europe exports far more cars to America than the other way around. His threat to impose tariffs on imported cars receded for the moment, representatives of Volkswagen and Daimler said.Some White House officials, including Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, have consistently argued that friction with Europe is a distraction from the more urgent task of reining in China. And behind the scenes, Ms. Malmstrom said, American, European and Japanese officials are having \u201cquite constructive discussions\u201d about trade with China.But conversations with officials in Brussels make it clear that the relationship between the European Union and the United States has deteriorated significantly since Mr. Trump took office, and they are unsure how or if it can be salvaged.In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that Europe treats American products unfairly, representatives of the European Commission and the United States government have tried to dismantle barriers to trade in industries like pharmaceuticals, medical devices and even shellfish. But several participants in the talks said European and American officials have been completely out of sync, making it difficult to achieve progress.Each side accuses the other of obstructionism. The Americans have expressed frustration with the Europeans\u2019 insistence on assembling a consensus among its 28 member countries before agreeing to anything. White House officials have told the Europeans directly that they believe they are stalling, in hopes of waiting out the Trump administration.Mr. Sondland spoke of missed opportunities for the United States and Europe to join forces against what he described as \u201cChina\u2019s persistent and unfair trade practices,\u201d but there have been examples of cooperation.But the Europeans have accused the White House of repeatedly poisoning the atmosphere with its raw, transactional approach to relations. They were floored when, at the end of May, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Europe, while threatening to impose levies on foreign-made cars and car parts.\u201cThat was a shocking experience, that the U.S. administration is ready to impose tariffs against Europe,\u201d said Jeppe Kofod, a Danish member of the European Parliament who has met several times during the past year with Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, and other American officials.Mr. Kofod said he first realized the depth of the Trump administration\u2019s antagonism toward Europe during a lunch in Washington late last year with Mr. Ross and a delegation from the European Parliament. The meal, in a room at the Library of Congress with a view of the Capitol, began on a cordial note, Mr. Kofod recalled. But then Mr. Ross began attacking what he said were Europe\u2019s unfair trade practices.\u201cWe appealed to him that we should take on China together,\u201d Mr. Kofod said. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, you are as bad as China.\u2019\u201dMr. Ross said he remembered the conversation differently. \u201cWhat I said was that both Europe and China espouse free trade rhetoric but are in reality much more protectionist than the United States,\u201d Mr. Ross said in a statement on Friday.The prospect of auto tariffs brought Europe to the negotiating table, he said. \u201cEurope showed little interest in trade negotiations before that.\u201dIn some ways, China is even more of a threat to Europe than it is to the United States. In America, cheap products from China are blamed for hollowing out the industrial heartland. Europe has been though the same thing. In the tumultuous last decade of financial and debt crises, China\u2019s efforts to expand its economic portfolio and pursue manufacturing around the world left Europe with fewer well-paying, middle-class jobs at home.The European Commission, the union\u2019s administrative arm, has fought a long-running battle to protect its steel industry from subsidized Chinese competitors. Low-price solar cells made in China devastated Germany\u2019s attempts to cultivate a solar-cell industry in the last decade.The financing from China has often been welcome. Chinese investors were willing to put money into distressed companies shunned by others. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group has revived Volvo Cars since buying it from Ford in 2010, and has helped to rejuvenate the region around Gothenburg, Sweden, the port city where Volvo has its headquarters.But European sentiment toward China shifted in 2016 after Midea, a Chinese appliance manufacturer, bought Kuka, a German maker of industrial robots for 4 billion euros, or $4.6 billion.Kuka robots are ubiquitous in car factories around the world, and the company was an example of German technological leadership in a growing industry. Midea\u2019s acquisition of the company caused a political furor because Germans feared the Chinese would gain control of Kuka\u2019s expertise as factories were becoming increasingly automated. But German political leaders had few legal tools to intervene.The decision in Brussels last month to give the European Union more power to block such acquisitions was, in large part, inspired by the Kuka deal and the inability of political leaders to protect sensitive technology.But 16+1 is also seen as an attempt to exploit tensions between wealthier Western European countries and formerly Communist countries like Hungary. Unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the Chinese do not nag Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, about policies that are seen as a threat to democracy. A bank controlled by the Chinese government is financing improvements to the rail line between Belgrade and Budapest.So even if the United States and Europe share many of the same objections to Chinese economic policy, they are far apart on what to do about it. Mr. Trump has used tariffs and threats of tariffs to put pressure on China, and has been unconventional in his approach. Mr. Trump sees international trade as a deal, by him and with him, to be made personally with President Xi Jinping of China.The proposals found an unlikely ally. China was among 11 other countries that backed the reforms. The United States did not. A spokeswoman for the United States mission in Geneva, where the trade organization is based, declined to comment.\u201cThat\u2019s what we try to tell our American friends,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told a small group of reporters at a briefing in Brussels last month, two weeks after returning from talks in Washington. \u201cLet\u2019s work together. When we work together we have a lot of impact.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syria Pullout by U.S. Tilts Mideast Toward Iran and Russia, Isolating Israel", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The American decision to withdraw from Syria has abruptly scrambled the geopolitics of the Middle East, clearing the way for Iran to expand its influence across the region, leaving Israel virtually alone to stop it, and raising the prospect that thousands of Islamic State prisoners could be set free.The decision shows that even a relatively small move \u2014 the United States has only about 2,000 troops in Syria \u2014 can have far-reaching consequences in a complex war, leaving allies struggling to cope and adversaries pleased and emboldened.Turkey, Iran and the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad also stand to reap enormous immediate benefits from the American withdrawal.On the other hand, allies like the Kurdish forces who fought alongside the United States in Syria feel betrayed and are threatening to free thousands of Islamic State prisoners if the United States abandons them.Israel, which hoped the American presence in Syria would block Iran from completing its corridor to the sea, now has to reckon with a new reality.\u201cThis leaves us alone in the arena with the Russians,\u201d said Michael Herzog, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former Israeli defense official. \u201cWe are alone in the battle against Iran in Syria.\u201dAs the American decision ripples across the region, many countries will be forced to reassess their relationships. The result could be a series of new balancing acts: Israel trying to tilt Russia against Iran, Turkey playing Russia and the United States off one another, and Syria balancing the Kurds against Turkey, among others.\u201cYou look at any country in this region, and they can\u2019t trust us, and they don\u2019t want to trust the Russians, but who else is there?\u201d said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Egypt and Israel who now teaches at Princeton.The American presence in Syria was particularly vexing for Iran, preventing Iranian-backed militias from crossing into Syria from Iraq. A pullout would free Tehran to treat the Iraqi border as fully porous, easing the movement of fighters and weapons \u2014 and potentially of the advanced missiles and other weapons through Syria to Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s partner in Lebanon.That freedom of movement could also ease the pain of American sanctions, which are damaging Iran\u2019s economy. \u201cThe area is oil-rich,\u201d said Lina Khatib, a Middle East expert at Chatham House in London. \u201cSo removing U.S. troops could increase the chances of Iran getting its hands on oil fields in the northeast.\u201dMostapha Bali, the spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, denied there was any discussion of releasing prisoners from the Islamic State. \u201cAny news coming from such sources is not reliable and is not coming from us,\u201d he said.But a Western official from the United States-led coalition fighting in Syria, which includes more than a dozen countries, confirmed that such discussions had taken place.\u201cThe best result of terrible options is probably for the Syrian regime to take custody of these people,\u201d said the official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not permitted to speak publicly. \u201cIf they are released it\u2019s a real disaster and major threat to Europe.\u201dSome analysts played down the threat as a bluff, or a cry for attention, saying that if the Islamic State prisoners were freed they could sooner be expected to turn on the Kurds than thank them.That invasion became more likely with Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, which was seen as giving Turkey a green light to carry it out. The American withdrawal helps Turkey in two ways: it abandons the Kurds, whom Turkey sees as a threat, and removes American troops from northeastern Syria, which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he will invade to attack Kurdish positions there.An invasion, however, would not be free of risk.The greater likelihood, analysts said, was that the Kurds seek an agreement with Syria\u2019s president, Mr. Assad, that grants them limited autonomy in eastern Syria in exchange for their loyalty. Such an agreement would put Turkey into greater conflict with both Mr. Assad and the Russians.To Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision came as a deep embarrassment heading into an election year in which his national-security credentials, closeness with Mr. Trump and obsessive focus on stopping Iranian expansion were central to his argument for another term. Mr. Netanyahu said he learned of the withdrawal decision in talks with Mr. Trump on Monday.\u201cThis caught the Israeli government by surprise,\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, an Israeli analyst at International Crisis Group. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether indeed Trump called Netanyahu two days ago or not, but that\u2019s a very short time between two close allies. That\u2019s barely a heads-up.\u201dMr. Netanyahu seemed to reach the height of his influence in Washington earlier this year when Mr. Trump moved the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and then abandoned the Iran nuclear agreement, which Mr. Netanyahu had railed against for years.But Mr. Netanyahu ends the year \u201cappearing to have mismanaged Israel\u2019s relations with the two global superpowers, the U.S. and Russia,\u201d Mr. Zalzberg said. Mr. Putin has refused to meet with him since the accidental downing of a Russian military jet in Syria during an Israeli airstrike in September.While Israeli military experts played down the tactical dangers of being left alone to fight Iran in Syria, many said an American retreat was debilitating to Israeli morale.\u201cIt\u2019s all of 2,000 soldiers,\u201d said Eyal Zisser, an expert on Syria and Lebanon at Tel Aviv University. \u201cPsychologically, though, they were there, which to a degree put the others \u2014 the Russians, the Iranians \u2014 on notice.\u201dBut an abrupt American pullout gives credibility to the idea, increasingly pervasive in the Middle East, that the United States\u2019 support for its allies is not what it once was, Mr. Zalzberg said. \u201cAnd that narrative is very harmful for Israeli power and deterrence, irrespective of the veracity of it,\u201d he said.Russia may be the biggest beneficiary of an American departure, which would leave it as the major global power in Syria and restore its Soviet-era role as a player in the Middle East.Mr. Putin\u2019s praise for Mr. Trump aside, he is likely to use an American withdrawal to \u201ctell the world that Russia\u2019s won against the U.S. in this proxy war,\u201d said Ms. Khatib of Chatham House. And with good reason, she added: \u201cRussia will take advantage of the vacuum to set the terms for the trajectory of the Syrian conflict as it wishes. It paves the way for Russia to treat Syria as part of its virtual territory.\u201dBut while Moscow and Tehran may both gain in the short term, the end of the war in Syria is likely to bring them into conflict, as their alliance in support of Mr. Assad will give way to competing interests: Russia wants a strong government in Damascus that is loyal to Moscow, while Tehran wants a weak regime on which it can impose its will.\u201cIt seems to me we\u2019re seeing the rise of a new axis in the Middle East, aligning Russia, Israel and countries like Saudi Arabia against Iran,\u201d Ms. Khatib said. \u201cBut this will take a while to play out. And it does not remove the immediate danger that is now going to increase when it comes to Israel\u2019s own security.\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, Neil MacFarquhar and Andrew E.

Prices start at about 25 pounds ($32), and each product comes with a \u201cWhy It\u2019s Good\u201d tab listing certain vital statistics: whether it has been made by an artisan, for example, or is a fair-trade product, and if the garment is more than 95 percent organic, vegan, or made using upcycled fabric. The site also has some specific challenges because of its mission.\u201cI spend a lot of time evaluating whether a brand ticks enough of the boxes needed for us to stock them,\u201d Ms. Lintott said. She delves into the size and location of factories, whether manufacturing is outsourced or fully owned, the use of dyes and synthetics in production, transparency of supply chain and a company\u2019s long-term intentions. Although plenty of labels work aesthetically for Antibad, and nearly fit the bill in terms of sustainability on the surface, many don\u2019t make the cut. One big issue, according to Ms. Lintott, is that some brands make part of their collection using reclaimed materials but use synthetics for other parts.\u201c\u2018Sustainability\u2019 is obviously a word that is being thrown around a lot, and it is impossible to be all things to all people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for me a sustainable fashion company is one that is mindful and considerate of the people and planet. That is engaged with how it can support local economies and uses materials that are either biodegradable or recyclable.\u201dAdmittedly, a growing e-commerce company, dependent on multiple repeat purchases and fast cross-continental deliveries, is not itself exactly environment friendly. So Ms. Lintott has done her best to offset the worst. She uses only recycled packaging, works with a carbon-offset company to neutralize shipping emissions through donations to emission reduction projects, and uses a carbon-neutral server to host the Antibad website.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t actually that difficult to find \u2014 our server is in Ireland \u2014 but it certainly wasn\u2019t a request our web developers had ever heard before,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cThat said, they all firmly agree that it works just as well as any other server. I think they have been converted.\u201dUnlike a marketplace e-commerce model like Farfetch, where the site works as a storefront for brands but never holds inventory, Antibad only buys wholesale. It also never places items on sale.\u201cPromotional sales are a big no for us, as a price should be fair and representative of the work that has gone into it \u2014 though of course that means a greater degree of risk for us at a time when newness drives the global fashion business,\u201d Ms. Lintott said. Then again, more than half of the brands stocked do not follow traditional fashion cycles, which limits exposure to the inventory going out of season. So far, the reaction has been very strong, Ms. Lintott said, though she wouldn\u2019t release sales figures. She is expecting a good holiday season.Investing in these brands, she said, feels \u201clike we are putting our money \u2014 and that of customers \u2014 in the right hands,\u201d noting that at this time of year, it\u2019s especially important to examine our relationship with consumption \u201cNo one can offer a perfect solution to everything wrong with the fashion system,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can offer more choice to curious shoppers. And that\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

From its high on Sept. 20, the S&P 500 is down 19.7 percent.The market has reached this point after a rare downward streak this month \u2014 stocks fell for four consecutive days through Monday. Investors have looked past evidence of economic strength, however, and toward a potential slowdown in 2019.Messages from the White House over the long holiday weekend kept investors on edge. President Trump was repeatedly critical of his handpicked Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell. In a Twitter post on Monday, he said, \u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\u2019t have a feel for the Market, they don\u2019t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders.\u201d Top advisers, however, tamped down talk that the president was considering trying to fire him.Those worries have joined other concerns, including weakness in global trade and the economic impact of a potentially lengthy government shutdown, to feed the volatility on Wall Street.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump again expressed dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve. Asked about Mr. Powell, he told reporters, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see. They\u2019re raising rates too fast. That\u2019s my opinion.\u201dBut in a seeming recognition that his criticism of the Fed is adding to jitters, the president noted that the recent decision to raise interest rates reflected the strength of the economy. \u201cThe fact is, the economy is doing so well that they raised interest rates, and that is a form of safety, in a way,\u201d he said.And he urged Americans to buy stocks.\u201cI think it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, a great opportunity to buy.\u201dInitial reaction was positive. In Japan, where stocks slumped 5 percent on Tuesday, the market opened on Wednesday 1.5 percent higher.But some investors remain cautious.\u201cThe market has only gone down basically in a straight line for the last two weeks. It\u2019s healthy to have corrections but to have no reprieves and no rallies during that time isn\u2019t good,\u201d said Matthew Turk, an investor in San Diego who manages his own money.Mr. Turk said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about what\u2019s in store for the markets on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy. It feels like it\u2019s never-ending right now.\u201dCharles Campbell, a managing director at MKM Partners, which provides trading services for big money managers like pension funds, hedge funds and mutual funds, said he began communicating with his clients at 6 a.m. on Christmas morning.Mr. Campbell said the Fed\u2019s rate increases had been weighing on the markets. Investors were beginning to fear a slowdown and wanted to see more acknowledgment from the Fed that it would change course in the face of economic weakness.Mr. Campbell said if the Fed did slow down its rate increases, it could provide relief the markets sorely need.King Lip, the chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, said he was looking toward big companies\u2019 earnings reports as a potential break from the bad news.Public companies try to avoid surprising investors, offering plenty of hints about how their quarterly results will look, and Mr. Lip said the indications for some of the largest companies were still positive.\u201cWe\u2019ve been following what companies have been telling us over the last few weeks and generally what they\u2019ve been saying has been pretty good,\u201d Mr. Lip said. The coming earnings season in January, he said, could bring a respite from the sell-off: \u201cEven if we dip into bear-market territory, I think it\u2019s going to reverse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Environmentalism Just for Rich People?", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray matterSometimes it can seem as if only the privileged support the cause. But the truth is more complicated.Dr. Gross is a sociologist.The Yellow Vest protests that have convulsed France for the past few weeks, leaving chic Parisian neighborhoods smoldering, are making environmentalists nervous.As with working-class support for the faltering coal industry in the United States, the question arises: Is environmentalism a boutique issue, a cause only the well-off can afford to worry about?Some social science suggests the answer is yes. In a landmark 1995 paper, the sociologist Ronald Inglehart observed an intriguing pattern in public support for the environmental movement. According to a public opinion survey he conducted in 43 nations, the countries where large percentages of the population supported strong environmental policies shared two characteristics: They were dealing with major environmental challenges (air and water pollution and species conservation were among the top priorities at the time) and they were affluent.Mr. Inglehart argued that citizens were apt to prioritize environmental concerns only if they were rich enough not to have to fret about more basic things like food and shelter. Environmentalism was part of a larger \u201cpostmaterialist\u201d mind-set, focused on human self-realization and quality of life, that was naturally to be found in the world\u2019s economically advanced societies \u2014 and especially among better-educated, wealthier citizens. Mr. Inglehart anticipated that growing prosperity, rising education levels and increasingly dire environmental circumstances would translate into the further spread of environmental consciousness in the years to come.In some ways the situation in France fits this theory. France is wealthy and well educated. And environmentalism is big there. A 2017 study, for instance, found that 79 percent of the French population believes climate change to be a very serious problem. It is plausible to think that some of the anger the Yellow Vests are unleashing on Paris revolves around the cultural gap separating those French citizens privileged enough to be able to devote time, attention and money to matters like the environment from those not as fortunate.Thought-provoking as Mr. Inglehart\u2019s thesis is, however, it\u2019s not hard to identify weaknesses. Here\u2019s an obvious one: The United States, like France, is a prosperous country with a well-educated population. Yet according to a survey conducted this year by the Pew Research Center, only 44 percent of Americans say they care a great deal about climate change.More recent research bolsters this skeptical view. Work by the sociologists Riley Dunlap and Richard York, based on a wider range of data, turns Mr. Inglehart\u2019s finding on its head: They have discovered that the publics of poorer countries facing imminent resource loss from environmental destruction often hold the strongest pro-environment attitudes. For example, the island nation of Fiji \u2014 which stands to be decimated by global warming, rising sea levels and storms \u2014 ratified the Paris climate agreement on a unanimous parliamentary vote before any other nation did.Another study, by the political scientist Matto Mildenberger and the geographer Anthony Leiserowitz, has found \u201cno evidence\u201d that people became less attuned to climate change when their economic prospects dwindled after the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Dunlap and Mr. York emphasize the contingency and variability of public support for environmental causes and practices. How much backing there will be \u2014 and in what quarters \u2014 depends on the specific environmental, economic and political conditions countries face. Environmental protection efforts can advance if the environmental movement acts strategically.The notion that there are few hard-and-fast rules when it comes to public support for environmentalism has influenced the response of environmentalists to the Yellow Vest protests. While raising taxes to reduce fossil fuel consumption or fund green energy transitions is essential, they say, depending on how and when such policies are proposed, they may spur a backlash. So smart rollouts and messaging matter. Mr. Macron\u2019s environmental policies, for example, were announced from on high, without meaningful input from all the communities that would be affected.Environmentalists insist that there is no reason in principle why a more effective communications strategy could not be found to pull together urban dwellers and the rural working- and lower-middle-class in a broad environmental coalition. The fact that the French public is sympathetic to the cause of the Yellow Vests but also concerned about the climate shows that the protests were never really about the environment in the first place.Such a perspective is comforting. But it arguably understates the magnitude of the problem the environmental movement now confronts. Yes, contrary to the theory of postmaterialism, the well-off aren\u2019t the only ones who care about climate change and the environment. Yet in many of today\u2019s capitalist democracies, class and status resentments, fostered by rampant inequality and whipped up by opportunistic politicians, have developed to such an extent that issues like the environment that affect everyone are increasingly seen through the lens of group conflict and partisan struggle.Differences between urban and rural, new economy and old, college educated versus working class and cosmopolitan versus local loom larger than ever. Although the research of the sociologist Dana R. Fisher shows that in the United States, climate change activists have been working to diversify their ranks, the trust needed for truly large-scale environmental coalition building is wearing thin.Thus a different interpretation of the Yellow Vest protest may be warranted. Without a concerted effort to address inequality \u2014 which some in the environmental movement consider someone else\u2019s department \u2014 the bold policy changes needed to slow global warming risk never getting off the ground.Neil Gross is a professor of sociology at Colby College.Advertisement"}

Since President Trump once owned casinos, you\u2019d think that he might have caught on by now. Then again, those casinos went bankrupt, an outcome that Mr. Trump blamed on anyone not named Donald Trump.Now that he\u2019s president, the table stakes are much higher. Except that Americans are the ones who are losing. With the stock market at the brink of a bear territory since September, and the S.&P. 500 off about 10 percent this year, the president continues to insist in tweets, and in conversations with his economic advisers and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, that everything would be great \u2014\u00a0if it was not for that meddlesome Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. \u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed,\u201d Mr. Trump ranted on Monday. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a feel for the Market.\u201dThe only problem our economy has is the Fed.

The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch - he can\u2019t putt!The Federal Reserve Board has had the temerity to do exactly what it had signaled for months it would do, steadily raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. The Fed is legally mandated to maximize employment and contain inflation, not to prop up the stock market on presidential orders. Mr. Powell also signaled that the Fed would pause in this rate-raising mode if the economy began to slow. Wall Street was not surprised in the least by this pronouncement.Mr. Trump was in Iraq, and off Twitter, on Wednesday.While a paralyzed federal government is not yet damaging the economy, the damage from Mr. Trump\u2019s other personal policy perversions is piling up. On its own, the economy, while clearly slowing, is doing well enough and will probably continue to do well enough with minimal fine tuning. Mr. Trump complains bitterly that Mr. Powell is going to turn him into Herbert Hoover by doing what the Fed is mandated to do. But what turned Hoover into Hoover is a Federal Reserve that did nothing and a Republican Congress that conducted a disastrous trade policy rife with tariffs.The really scary part, if one continues this historical comparison, is that the Great Depression was ended not as much by smart economic policy as it was the end of a failed foreign policy marked by American isolationism in the years leading to World War II. Today, Mr. Trump\u2019s America First posture is behind his abrupt decision last week to withdraw antiterrorism troops from Syria. His own generals \u2014 \u201cmy generals\u201d \u2014 and national security staff have warned that such a retreat could allow the shattered Islamic State to regroup and spread global chaos again.But what do generals know about warfare? About as much as economists with Ph.D.s at the Fed know about the economy. That is, a lot.Maybe the kid can now call Chairman Powell and commiserate, while the rest of us brace for King Minus\u2019s next touch.Advertisement"}

After all, after the 2016 U.S. election and the Brexit vote in Britain, there was a lot of talk about a broad popular backlash against globalization. Over the past two years, however, it has become clear that this backlash was both smaller and shallower than advertised.But if there\u2019s no strong constituency for protectionism, why are we teetering on the brink of a trade war? Blame U.S. trade law.The creators of the U.S. trade policy system realized, however, that it couldn\u2019t be too rigid or it would shatter in times of stress; there had to be ways to relieve pressure when necessary. So trade law gives the executive the right to impose tariffs without new legislation under certain circumstances, mainly to protect national security, to retaliate against unfair foreign practices, or to give industries facing sudden surges in foreign competition time to adjust.In other words, U.S. trade law gives the president a lot of discretionary power over trade, as part of a system that curbs the destructive influence of corrupt, irresponsible members of Congress. And that setup worked very well for more than 80 years.Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t intended to handle the problem of a corrupt, irresponsible president. Trump is pretty much all alone in lusting for a trade war, but he has virtually dictatorial authority over trade.What\u2019s he doing with that power? He\u2019s trying to negotiate deals. Unfortunately, he really, really doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. On trade, he\u2019s a rebel without a clue.Markets plunged earlier this week as investors realized that they\u2019d been had. As I said, business really doesn\u2019t want a trade war.Let\u2019s be clear: China is not a good actor in the world economy. It engages in real misbehavior, especially with regard to intellectual property: The Chinese essentially rip off technology. So there is a case for toughening our stance on trade.But that toughening should be undertaken in concert with other nations that also suffer from Chinese misbehavior, and it should have clear objectives. The last person you want to play hardball here is someone who doesn\u2019t grasp the basics of trade policy, who directs his aggressiveness at everyone \u2014 tariffs on Canadian aluminum to protect our national security? Really? \u2014 and who can\u2019t even give an honest account of what went down in a meeting.Unfortunately, that\u2019s the person who\u2019s now in charge, and it\u2019s hard to see how he can be restrained. So the future of world trade, with all it implies for the world economy, now hinges largely on Donald Trump\u2019s mental processes. That is not a comforting thought.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Market Is Worried. The Economy Is Strong. How Will the Fed React?", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The challenge confronting the Federal Reserve as it meets this week is a tale of two economies. Wall Street investors are behaving as if the economic expansion is in grave danger, while the best available data show that the American economy has continued to grow at a healthy pace.The disconnect is visible on other Wall Streets across the United States.Dorice Soroka, who runs a small company at Wall Street and Myrtle Lane in Daytona Beach, Fla., said her revenue has finally reached the level she last saw in 2006. \u201cAnd that was unhealthy growth,\u201d Ms. Soroka said of the years before the crisis. \u201cThis is much more healthy.\u201dPeoples State Bank, on East Wall Street in Eagle River, Wis., also is prospering.\u201cOur market areas remain economically healthy,\u201d said Scott M. Cattanach, the president of PSB Holdings, which operates nine branches in central and northern Wisconsin. The bank recently reported that profits rose 28 percent in the third quarter, and demand for development loans remained strong in the fourth quarter.Katy Brooks, the president of the Bend, Ore., Chamber of Commerce \u2014 whose offices sit on Wall Street \u2014 said the region\u2019s tech companies were trying to fill more than 400 vacancies.The Fed on Wednesday is widely expected to recognize the continued strength of the economy by announcing a quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate after a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. But the central bank also is expected to tip its hat to queasy investors by emphasizing that future rate increases will depend on continued economic growth.\u201cWhile the domestic economy remains healthy, the external backdrop has worsened,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, referring to a recent weakening of international economic growth, particularly in Europe and China. Mr. Gapen said financial conditions in the United States had also tightened sufficiently for the Fed to worry about the broader economic effect.The expected rate increase, which would lift the benchmark rate into a range between 2.25 and 2.5 percent, would mark the fifth consecutive quarter that the Fed has moved to raise borrowing costs. The benchmark rate now sits close to the bottom of what most Fed officials regard as a neutral zone in which the Fed would neither be encouraging nor discouraging economic activity.The Fed also will publish a set of economic projections by the members of the committee, which comprises the Fed\u2019s board of governors and the presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks. In the last round of forecasts, published in September, most Fed officials predicted the central bank would raise rates three times in 2019. Shaving those predictions would underscore the Fed\u2019s doubts about the economy\u2019s trajectory.There is still a lot of good news. The economy has been expanding for almost a decade, the unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is the lowest in a half-century, job growth remains strong and wages are beginning to rise faster.Consumer spending, the primary form of economic activity in the United States, has been growing at a healthy pace, up 0.6 percent in October. \u201cWhat we know about Main Street is they\u2019re spending like banshees on Christmas stuff, and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve seen a real increase in wages at the low end of the spectrum,\u201d said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton.Ms. Swonk, who expects the Fed to raise rates on Wednesday, said the central bank was trying to strike a delicate balance by wrapping up its post-crisis campaign to stimulate the economy by holding down interest rates to encourage consumer and business borrowing.\u201cThere is good news, and that\u2019s what the Fed is acknowledging by raising rates,\u201d she said.\u201cThey don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to crush the economy.\u201dThe fragility of the economy is visible in the anxiety of investors. Between 2004 and 2006, the Fed raised rates at 17 consecutive policy meetings \u2014 from 1 to 5.25 percent \u2014 without noticeably dampening the euphoria on Wall Street. In recent years, markets have treated each quarter-point increase in the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate as a significant threat to growth.But the fragility is also visible far from New York\u2019s financial district.Ms. Soroka, in Daytona Beach, runs a company that gathers information on development projects, allowing contractors and workers to identify potential opportunities.The company, Builders Exchange and Reprographics, employed eight people before the crisis. Ms. Soroka cut half of those jobs during the crisis, and she has not hired anyone as revenue has recovered. In part, she said, technology has reduced her need for workers. Local governments increasingly post the information she needs on websites, eliminating the need for people to collect documents in person.But Ms. Soroka said she also remained nervous about investing in her company. Even in the 10th year of an economic expansion \u2014 one of the longest periods of growth in American history \u2014 she said she was reluctant to spend on office decorations, or buy new equipment.\u201cI tiptoe into things,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t know how sustainable this is going to be.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s interest rate increases have added a new reason for anxiety. Higher borrowing costs appear to be pinching housing, as sales of new and existing homes have softened in recent months. The government reported Tuesday that housing starts increased in November, but the change was driven by a rise in multifamily construction, which tends to vary month to month.Ms. Soroka said that developers in the Central Florida region that she watches closely are showing signs of increased caution. For example, she said, developers appear to be breaking projects into a larger number of phases, so the initial increment of construction is smaller. A developer might obtain permits for a 500-lot subdivision, she said, but begin with a section of 50 homes.\u201cI know a lot of business owners who are thinking about being a little more liquid, which means that money is not going into the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just holding it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Misguided Priorities of Our Educational System", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "OpinionWe spend too much money on college students and not enough on everyone else. Supported byMr. Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Consider two high school seniors \u2014 one who exhibits strong academic talent and one who does not. For one, December marks the homestretch of a yearslong effort, intensively supported by his school, to prepare the perfect college application. For the other, December is just another month on the path to, well, whatever might come after graduation. The former will likely proceed steadily toward a bachelor\u2019s degree; the latter is unlikely to finish college if he enrolls at all. To whom does our education system owe what?That second student, to be clear, has done nothing wrong. He probably clawed his way through his town\u2019s standard college-oriented curriculum, though it neither targeted his interests and abilities nor prepared him for work force success. Looking ahead, he faces a labor market in which he may need to work harder than his college-bound counterpart for lower pay, with fewer options and slower advancement. Yet we celebrate the first student and lavish taxpayer funds on his education. To the second student, we offer little beyond a sympathetic \u201cSorry.\u201d Our education system has become one of our nation\u2019s most regressive institutions.One explanation for this bizarre state of affairs, in which society invests heavily in those headed for economic success while ignoring those falling behind, is the widespread belief that everyone can be a college graduate. If that were true, the shove toward the college pipeline might make sense.A second explanation is the widespread belief that a college diploma is a necessary and sufficient \u201cticket to the middle class.\u201d If that were true, even a small chance at escaping the supposedly sad fate of inadequate education is better than ever admitting defeat.Pushing people from the former category to attend college and land in the latter category does them few favors. And remember, that assumes they graduate; people in their position typically will not. Remember also, those are the outcomes before we attempt to create an attractive non-college pathway that they might prefer and that might equip them for success.What might such a pathway look like? For the roughly $100,000 that the public spends to carry many students through high school and college today, we could offer instead two years of traditional high school, a third year that splits time between a sophisticated vocational program and a subsidized internship, two more years split between subsidized work and employer-sponsored training, and a savings account with $25,000, perhaps for future training. Any American could have, at age 20, three years of work experience, an industry credential and earnings in the bank.For student borrowers unlikely to graduate, the current subsidies succeed mainly in luring them toward a substantial investment of time and money that is both high-risk and low-return. If a good alternative existed, they would be well served to take it. Certainly, the choice should remain theirs. But to decide wisely whether college is worth the cost, they need to actually face the cost.People often applaud vocational education in theory, provided it is \u201cfor someone else\u2019s kids.\u201d Those kids are most kids, and a false promise of college success does more harm than good. We owe them our focus and the best pathway that we can construct \u2014 one that carries them as close as possible to the destination their college-bound peers will reach, and sometimes beyond.Advertisement"}

A pebble in the sea of the French economy. A step to address climate change, according to President Emmanuel Macron.Of course, that\u2019s not how millions of workers who depend on their cars saw it.Mobility is the story of globalization and its inequities. Mobility means more than trains, planes and automobiles, after all. It also includes social and economic mobility \u2014 being too poor to afford a car, being rich enough to transfer money out of the country. These are all inextricably linked. Weeks of protests by the Yellow Vests have made that clear.\u201cAs small businesses have been dying in these smaller cities and towns, people find themselves forced to seek jobs elsewhere and to shop even for basic goods in malls,\u201d said Alexis Spire, a French sociologist. \u201cThey need cars to survive, because regional trains and buses have declined or no longer serve them. Once you begin to unpack the Yellow Vest phenomenon, the uprising is a lot about mobility.\u201dExperts have been drawing parallels between the Yellow Vests and the social rifts exposed by Donald J. Trump\u2019s election in the United States and Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union. But there are also larger trends at work in France, involving the evolution of cities, the impact of cars, and the geography of race and class \u2014 trends rooted in the postwar years.In 1947, the book \u201cParis and the French Desert,\u201d by a young geographer named Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gravier, helped inspire Charles de Gaulle to reorganize the country \u2014 decentralizing resources, redistributing industry, promoting regional cities and creating new towns linked by a nationwide web of publicly funded rail lines.Modern, decentralized France spread a promise of prosperity and mobility. For decades, the promise was kept. Until it wasn\u2019t.As a handful of big cities thrived with globalization, France\u2019s regional governments, saddled with more financial burdens, became caught in a vicious cycle. Capital disappeared along with factories and jobs. Revenues shrank, debts mounted and infrastructure declined.The gasoline tax \u201cexposed a profound cultural fracture,\u201d said Olivier Galland, a director at the National Center for Scientific Research.On a recent morning, I visited a highway roundabout at Senlis, in the northern region of Oise, where two dozen Yellow Vest protesters huddled around a trash-can fire, sipping cups of tomato soup. Passing drivers honked in sympathy.It\u2019s no accident that the movement takes its name from the Day-Glo vests that French motorists are required to keep in their vehicles. Like the fuel tax, the vests are a burden imposed on drivers by the state, and, for a population that has felt ignored, they also are an ideal, ready-made tool for getting noticed.\u201cThe government makes us pay for these ourselves,\u201d Val\u00e9rie Lemaire, one of the protesters at the roundabout, said, pointing to her jacket and stamping her feet in the freezing mud. \u201cWe pay, pay, pay.\u201dOise is peripheral France. It includes Senlis, a pretty, prosperous bedroom community. But it is also an area where deindustrialization and inadequate public transit have taken a toll.Just across the road from the Yellow Vest encampment is a new Amazon depot, which offers warehouse jobs. This area used to have better-paying factories. Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport \u2014 less than an hour\u2019s drive to the south on the highway, depending on traffic \u2014 is the major employer these days. Creil, 15 minutes from Senlis, is a poor city of 35,000 with a largely vacant downtown and blocks of public housing. It is home to many baggage handlers and airport security guards.There\u2019s no direct train to the airport, and buses are infrequent. So people have to drive if they don\u2019t want to trek into the middle of Paris and then back out again. Avoiding the slower regional roads is also costly, even without factoring in gas, because the French government ceded authority over hefty highway tolls to a private company some years ago.A tollbooth is visible from the roundabout. The Yellow Vest protesters stormed it in November \u2014 allowing traffic through without paying. \u201cWe paid to build the roads with our taxes,\u201d Christophe Bartel, a 47-year-old protester, told me. \u201cNow we\u2019re supposed to pay private companies a fortune to use our own roads? It is a scandal. We\u2019re fed up.\u201dThe protesters also blockaded a nearby mall that has been drawing business from city centers like Creil\u2019s.Claude Letranchant, 59, had scrawled a message on the back of his yellow vest: \u201cEcology is only an alibi,\u201d referring to the climate argument for the fuel tax.\u201cI am a strong environmentalist,\u201d Mr. Letranchant said. \u201cEverybody here is.\u201d He waved toward the other protesters warming themselves by the fire. They nodded.\u201cWhat Macron said about the fuel tax was only political,\u201d Mr. Letranchant insisted. \u201cWe don\u2019t care for politics, only for each other.\u201dThere\u2019s no question Mr. Macron has made himself a convenient pi\u00f1ata for the protesters. They saw him cut taxes for companies and the rich. They saw airlines, spewing tons of carbon to move globe-trotters around, paying no tax for fuel. They saw themselves being strapped with a disconnected president\u2019s commitment to meet European Union debt standards.And they have stopped seeing themselves embraced by French intellectuals and heroized in French movies and by labor unions, whose membership has shrunk dramatically. They found themselves out of sight and out of mind in Paris.Which is why it is also impossible to separate the fury over the fuel tax from housing prices, which have skyrocketed in big cities like Paris, driving working people to areas where home prices are lower but public transport much worse.As Mr. Guilluy put it: \u201cMobility is liberty expressed through geography.\u201d\u201cWorking families in small cities and towns who used to send their children to jobs and universities in big cities like Paris don\u2019t have the money to do that now,\u201d he said. \u201cA city like Paris prides itself on being an open society, but to these people it has come to seem more like a medieval castle, a place closed to the disenfranchised, who are made to feel invisible.\u201dAt the shabby train station in Creil, I came across Henri Djonga and his 2-year-old son, Andi, swaddled in a hooded coat. Every morning, Mr. Djonga said, he takes a 5 a.m. train to Paris to work at a minimum-wage job moving boxes. He used to live some miles away in Compi\u00e8gne, he said, but that required an extra two hours\u2019 commute each day, so he and his family settled in Creil, at greater expense.\u201cTrains are frequently delayed,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe system is not reliable. But it\u2019s better than driving.\u201dHe still pays to own a car because his wife and children can\u2019t buy groceries or get to school or pick him up from the station without one. So he supports the Yellow Vests, he said, adding, \u201cWe all do in Creil.\u201dI asked how much of a difference it made that Mr. Macron has postponed the fuel tax and promised an extra 100 euros a month \u2014 about $115 \u2014 for those earning minimum wage.Mr. Djonga shrugged. \u201cNot enough,\u201d he said and headed off with Andi toward the shuttered streets.Pierre Desorgues contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Real-Life Effects of Trump\u2019s Environmental Rollbacks: 5 Takeaways From Our Investigation", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor nearly two years, President Trump has pursued an aggressive, far-reaching effort, lobbied for and cheered on by industry, to free American business from what he and many of his supporters view as excessive environmental regulation.The consequences are starting to play out in noticeable ways in communities across the United States. Here are five takeaways:But industry consistently balked at those regulations, calling them an overreach, duplicative and unnecessary, unleashing a backlash that has informed Mr. Trump\u2019s approach.So, with equal decisiveness, Mr. Trump has sought to undo his predecessor\u2019s agenda by blocking, delaying and killing measures. The Trump administration cited its rollbacks as a victory and the fulfillment of a campaign promise.The rapid change in policy direction shows how both presidents used their expansive executive powers \u2014 but for very different outcomes.The early impacts of the Trump rollbacks are beginning to emerge across the country, from California to North Dakota, Texas and West Virginia. The Times visited the communities facing these changes, and found that local residents and business leaders are often divided. Some believe that the Obama administration went too far in imposing new environmental demands, while others worry that the changes the Trump administration is making will hurt their families, in particular their children.The geographic diversity of the places grappling with the trade-offs highlights how pervasive the connections are between natural resources, health and economic opportunity. In the vast farmlands of central California, day care centers have to take account of pesticide-spraying schedules. The local government\u2019s revenues on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota have grown to $330 million from $20 million over the last 15 years because of vast fossil fuel reserves that can now be pumped from the ground using fracking. National forests 400 miles away can be clouded with haze produced by a coal-fired power plant near Houston.No parts of the federal government during the Trump era have been more aggressive in rolling back rules than the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, which between them regulate much of the intersection between the environment and the economy. Together their rule changes have touched nearly every aspect of environmental protection, including air pollution caused by power plants and the oil and gas industry, water pollution caused by coal mines, and toxic chemicals and pesticides used by farmers nationwide.In short, what is at stake is the quality of the air we breathe and the food we eat, the cleanliness of the rivers that flow past us, and the pace at which the climate is changing. Two years after Mr. Trump took office, the policy shifts are not nearly complete; dozens of other rules have been targeted for rollback.After decades of legislation and regulation, the environment in the United States continues to get cleaner. What has changed under Mr. Trump in most cases is the pace of improvement, which has been slowed in a number of key areas compared to what it would have been if the Obama rules had been preserved.If there is a single industry that has been at the center of the fight \u2014 both during the Obama expansion of rules and the Trump rollbacks \u2014 it is coal. Mr. Obama targeted the industry as a way to combat climate change. Mr. Trump has defended and promoted it as part of his populist political and economic strategy. Mr. Trump\u2019s approach has been to slow demands for further steps to curb air and water pollution caused by coal-burning power plants. The tug-of-war involves coal mines as well, which were ordered by Mr. Obama to take steps to help clean thousands of miles of rivers and streams, only to be told by Mr. Trump that these measures were no longer necessary.At the core of the fight between environmentalists and the Trump administration is a debate over a simple question: How much improvement is enough? By some measures \u2014 such as overall emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, two major air pollutants that cause smoke and haze and a variety of health ailments \u2014 environmental quality in the United States has continued to improve in the Trump era.That is in large part because of the rapid closure of more coal-burning power plants. But the pace of those declines would almost certainly have been greater had Obama-era policies continued. So what is happening in the United States is a slowing of the pace of progress \u2014 not a return to the era, before the E.P.A. was created in 1970, where a river in Ohio caught fire.Another factor is that environmental change happens slowly. So the real impact of the Trump-era policies may not be fully apparent until years after Mr. Trump leaves office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Market Rout Has Trump Fixated on Fed Chair Powell", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has unabashedly hitched his political fortunes to a rising stock market. Now, with stock prices in retreat, he has become increasingly fixated on the idea that one man is to blame for the recent rout: Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Trump has said choosing Mr. Powell for the Fed job last year was the worst mistake of his presidency, and he has asked aides whether he has the power to fire him.But the volatile stock market, which just posted its worst week since 2008, is falling in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s own policies, including an escalating trade war with China, a shutdown of the federal government and the fading effects of the $1.5 trillion tax cut Mr. Trump ushered in at the end of 2017. While the Fed\u2019s rate increases have upset investors \u2014 who seem to have a darker view of economic growth than the central bank does \u2014 some analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s musings about the Fed would only exacerbate anxieties.\u201cIf Powell gets terminated, what we\u2019ve seen happen in the markets in the past few weeks will look like a walk in the park,\u201d David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said in an email on Sunday. \u201cThe dollar will go into a tailspin, and even confidence in the Treasury market will erode, especially among foreign creditors.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers scrambled over the weekend to reassure markets that Mr. Trump was not, in fact, planning to fire Mr. Powell. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump accepting that he did not even have the power to do so.Mick Mulvaney, the incoming acting White House chief of staff, implied on Sunday that Mr. Trump had, in fact, inquired about removing Mr. Powell, saying on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the president \u201cnow realizes he does not have the authority.\u201d But Mr. Mulvaney added that he had heard this from Mr. Mnuchin, not from Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has not addressed the issue directly, including on his own Twitter feed, which he has frequently used to criticize the Fed. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters on Saturday, \u201cI\u2019m aware of no plans to fire Mr. Powell\u201d \u2014 but that brief statement stopped well short of corroborating Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s account of the president\u2019s views.Mr. Mnuchin has worked in recent days to obtain Mr. Trump\u2019s assurance that he would not remove Mr. Powell, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that person cautioned that Mr. Trump could change his mind. The person noted Mr. Trump has a tendency to nurse grudges even when he temporarily sets a subject aside.Mr. Mnuchin has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to stabilize markets, which are on pace for the largest December declines since the 1930s. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to make sure their operations were running smoothly.Still, Mr. Trump is hardly alone in his opposition to the Fed\u2019s move. Some economists argue the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign to drive up employment and wages. They note that the Fed is about to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive year, suggesting there is no need to step on the brakes.Many investors had also wanted a pause, and the decision set off another slide in stock prices.But even investors who disagreed with Wednesday\u2019s decision generally do not want politicians to play a larger role in Fed policymaking, preferring to leave the management of interest rates primarily in the hands of technocrats. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.\u201cMarkets are in the business of looking forward, and looking forward to a world with greatly diminished central bank independence isn\u2019t something that markets should find comforting,\u201d Eric Winograd, senior United States economist at AllianceBernstein, said in an email.\u201cI\u2019d be very careful about doing that,\u201d Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters on Saturday. \u201cThe independence of the Fed is the foundation of our banking system.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said, \u201cGiven the Fed\u2019s consensus on monetary policy, any effort to remove Powell would hit the trifecta: unlawful, ineffective and damaging to the economy.\u201dA key question is whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to remove Mr. Powell. The Federal Reserve Act, which had its 105th anniversary on Sunday, says the president can remove members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, including Mr. Powell, only \u201cfor cause.\u201dNo president has ever tried, but legal scholars say the language is generally interpreted as meaning the president could not remove Mr. Powell over a policy disagreement.The law, however, does not address the president\u2019s authority to remove Mr. Powell from his role as Fed chairman without removing him from the Fed\u2019s board, a move that some of the president\u2019s advisers have urged.But it is far from clear such a decision would serve the president\u2019s purpose. A replacement for Mr. Powell would require Senate confirmation, and this person would join a policymaking committee that voted unanimously for the December rate increase. That committee also might be inclined, on future rate decisions, to demonstrate its independence from the president.While Mr. Trump has turned on his chairman, the Fed\u2019s trajectory should not have been a surprise.When Mr. Trump chose Mr. Powell as Fed chairman in the fall of 2017, he said, \u201cBased on his record, I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy through any challenges that our great economy may face.\u201dMr. Trump also chose three of the other four members of the Fed\u2019s board, all of whom joined Mr. Powell in voting for all four 2018 rate increases.In conversations with friends and advisers, Mr. Trump has acknowledged responsibility for the selection of Mr. Powell. He told Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, that it was \u201cone of the worst choices I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d according to Mr. Moore.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers have encouraged him to remove Mr. Powell, arguing that the decision would reverse recent stock declines.Others, including Mr. Mnuchin, have warned that Mr. Trump would harm his own interests.Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said presidents had often tried to shape Fed policy, but the current episode stood apart because Mr. Trump appeared to be acting against his own interest in a stable economy.\u201cI think what is the unusual part here is that it seems the president has created the crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cHis intervention certainly seems to be making things worse for him and worse for the Fed and worse for the economy. It\u2019s just very shortsighted, and we\u2019re not used to that.\u201dAlan Rappeport, Maggie Haberman and Katie Rogers contributed reporting from Washington, and Peter Eavis from New York.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Itsy-Bitsy, Teenie-Weenie, Very Litigious Bikini", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a sunny summer day in Montauk, Ipek Irgit was in the familiar situation of not knowing what she was doing with her life. It was 2012, and she was 34 years old. Earlier in the year, after having her heart broken, she had taken a vacation in Brazil, visiting Rio de Janeiro and the beach towns of Bahia. Now she was on the beach on Long Island, wearing a handmade-looking bikini with crochet and exposed elastic straps, trying to figure out what to do and who to be.It had been 11 unsettled years since Ms. Irgit moved from Turkey to New York, with $300 in her pocket and a vague dream of making a life in one of the city\u2019s creative industries. She became part of a downtown class of trendsetters who all seemed to have a purpose. It was an expensive existence, especially for Ms. Irgit, who, without the cushion of a trust fund, bounced from job to job. She was a waitress and a bartender; she worked for a fashion company as an assistant to a merchandiser and in the wholesale department. Nothing stuck.Ms. Irgit looked at the bathing suit and saw untapped \u201csuperpowers.\u201d It was bright, colorful and looked fantastic on Instagram. Its tiny form contained an unexpected array of elements: triangular panels; contrast-color stitching; and most distinctively of all, those vibrant elastic straps threaded through loops of crochet. The suit had a D.I.Y. sensibility popular on both the internet and the runway, and Ms. Irgit hoped buyers would see it as sexy but sporty, bohemian but sophisticated. \u201cA reflection,\u201d she said, \u201cof my personality.\u201dMs. Irgit asked a friend in the fashion industry to create a prototype, and a factory in China made a batch at a cost of about $29 each. Ms. Irgit decided to mark up the retail price to $285, putting her suit into the high-end luxury market. She paid careful attention to branding, playing around with \u201cbikini\u201d and her initials \u2014 I.I.I. \u2014 before settling on \u201cKiini\u201d and a logo with three triangles over the \u201ci\u201ds, like the panels on the top and bottom of her suits.\u201cI was, like, bombarded,\u201d Ms. Irgit said. \u201cThat was it.\u201dSales were exploding. By 2015, Ms. Irgit\u2019s suit had brought in approximately $9 million, said Sally Wu, who for years helped the company source its bikinis from China.As is often the case in fashion, Kiini\u2019s success drew copycats. Ms. Irgit complained about it to her lawyer, who advised her to apply with the United States Copyright Office for protection.In fashion, there is a fine, sometimes indistinguishable line separating inspiration and theft. Most apparel companies try not to get distracted by items that are derivative of their own. The trend cycle moves so quickly that experts tend to believe the best use of resources isn\u2019t litigation, but creating next season\u2019s styles.Ms. Irgit, though, could not abide the idea of rival versions of colorful crocheted bikinis. In 2015, she was particularly inflamed by the introduction of a faux-Kiini made by Victoria\u2019s Secret. That October, in the central district of California, her lawyers filed a federal lawsuit accusing the company of copyright infringement. It called for Victoria\u2019s Secret to stop selling the swimwear and pay damages.Ms. Irgit felt victorious. A year later, in April 2018, Kiini filed another federal lawsuit, this time in the Southern District of New York, against Neiman Marcus and two swimwear companies. It accused them of unfair competition, misleading consumers about the origin of the swimsuits and violating Kiini\u2019s \u201ctrade dress.\u201d In lay terms, Kiini was saying that any consumer in the world who saw a crocheted-and-exposed-elastic bikini would assume it was a Kiini.For an upstart brand, one lawsuit was rare. A second was unheard of. Kiini\u2019s litigiousness brought Ms. Irgit unwanted attention \u2014 and revealed that even the tiniest two-piece can hide a lot of secrets.One day in August, Ms. Irgit greeted me at a loft in Tribeca, a large and airy space that serves both as her home and as Kiini\u2019s showroom and office. We sat at a long, rectangular kitchen table that separates the living area and the work space. It is a point of pride for Ms. Irgit that she used her own marketing savvy to develop Kiini\u2019s high profile without the use of a publicist, but our interview took place under specific conditions negotiated by Risa Heller, a crisis communications consultant.As we spoke, Ms. Irgit shared her disdain for the legal process \u2014 a hatred of lawsuits and a belief that it is lawyers who benefit the most from them. It was the creative process she most cherished, she said. She meandered, though, when I asked her repeatedly to talk about inventing the Kiini. Did she sketch it? How did she come up with the idea of threading elastic through crochet?\u201cIt goes back to with my grandmother,\u201d Ms. Irgit said, in her most specific answer. \u201cWe used to make things like crochet bikinis, so I was like 10 and 11.\u201d\u201cYou made crochet bikinis when you were 10?\u201d I asked.\u201cNot me, I\u2019m not making them, right?\u201d Ms. Irgit said. \u201cNo, \u2018make\u2019 is like \u2014 it is usually my idea. I\u2019m not that \u2014 I didn\u2019t make them. My mom made it, or my grandma made it.\u201dWhat about the bathing suit Ms. Irgit was wearing on the beach in Montauk in 2012 with Mr. Becker? Who made it? \u201cI had had it made,\u201d was all Ms. Irgit would say.I called Mr. Becker, her paddle ball partner.He remembered the moment well. \u201cShe was wearing it,\u201d Mr. Becker said. \u201cI noticed it and I said it was really cool. She told me she had found them in Brazil and was contemplating starting to do something with it in different varieties.\u201dMaria Solange Ferrarini lives in Trancoso, a beach town in Brazil\u2019s Bahia state, along a dirt road littered with garbage and stray animals. When I walked up to her tidy four-room home one day this summer, she greeted me dressed in crocheted shorts with brightly colored elastics woven through them. Under a sleeveless T-shirt, she wore a similar bikini top.Inside, as we talked with the help of a translator, Ms. Ferrarini picked up a ball of yarn stuck through with a needle. She had a habit of grabbing it and crocheting absent-mindedly, holding it almost like a rosary, as she told her story.Ms. Ferrarini, 61, described herself as a street artist, but most people in Trancoso know her as the bikini lady. Since 1998, she has been selling handmade crochet-and-elastic bikinis on the beach, walking up and down the sand with her creations dangling off a hula hoop. She and the suit are inseparable. \u201cIt\u2019s my husband,\u201d she said, with a laugh.I looked at one of the bikinis in her living room. Ms. Ferrarini\u2019s standard two-piece has two dark denim triangles connected by visible stitches of embroidery thread to crochet straps with brightly colored elastics woven through them. The bottom is made to match. It is virtually identical to the bikini Ms. Irgit had copyrighted.\u201cI created this bikini to survive,\u201d Ms. Ferrarini said. She was born in S\u00e3o Carlos, a university city outside S\u00e3o Paulo, where her father was a bricklayer and her mother was a seamstress. When she was 10, her mother taught her to crochet so that she could make clothes for herself and her younger sisters. Around 1994, she moved to Trancoso, took a room in a guesthouse, and tried to make money with her craft. She crocheted thong bikini bottoms and sold them by pacing the beach. It was nudist, though, and that created a problem.To get back to the guesthouse at the end of the day, Ms. Ferrarini had to pass a seaside church. As a Catholic, she didn\u2019t feel right walking by in just a thong, with her breasts exposed. In reverence, she added a handmade, curtain-like top that draped over her chest. The design evolved into a bikini top.When Ms. Ferrarini realized she needed more support than yarn could provide, she began to thread elastics through the crochet to give a little lift. Other women quickly took note. They asked her to make tops for them, too. Initially, she sold the bikinis for the equivalent of $2.50. She increased the price by about $5 every couple of years.It was around that time that the town was visited by another trendsetter: Ipek Irgit. She confirmed the visit during our interview.Before I left Trancoso, I accompanied Ms. Ferrarini on a sales walk along the beach. She arranged a sale to a woman from California, and then sold a top to another tourist, from Canada, who mentioned she\u2019d seen the same style \u201call over the place.\u201dMs. Ferrarini sighed. She was used to that, she said, but it still stung. To her, an artist, it is about creative integrity. \u201cI\u2019d see people in bikinis, and foreigners doubted that I was the creator,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said the bikini was from the United States. To my face!\u201dSally Wu was happy on the day in mid-2012 when her friend, Ms. Irgit, contacted her to ask a favor. Earlier in the year she had been traveling in Brazil, she said, and was home with a new bikini. Ms. Wu said that Ms. Irgit told her, \u201cI need to figure out how to copy it.\u201dMs. Wu was a good person to ask. Raised in Shanghai, she had moved to New York and become a fashion designer, then segued into the industry\u2019s \u201cprivate label\u201d niche, working as a product developer and bilingual liaison between brands and Chinese manufacturers. She understood design, production and importing.In Ms. Wu\u2019s recollection, Ms. Irgit brought a bikini to her Chinatown apartment and laid it on a couch. Ms. Wu saw that the suit, particularly the top, would be more complex to reconstruct than a layman might imagine. It would be tricky for yarn, for instance, to maintain its structure and color while being regularly submerged in water. And the unlined fabric would need to be a certain thickness, or else it would be see-through. She walked Ms. Irgit through each step of the replication process.\u201cShe is not a designer,\u201d Ms. Wu said of Ms. Irgit this summer, as we sat on the back terrace of her current home, in East Harlem. \u201cBut she is a good marketer. She knows how to create a brand, and she really knows how to market a product.\u201dAfter their initial consultation, Ms. Wu asked Ms. Irgit to send her a document of specs that Ms. Wu could relay to a Chinese manufacturer. Ms. Irgit sent the email on July 28, 2012. \u201cSally darling,\u201d it began, and referred Ms. Wu to attached photos, with measurements and colors annotated. Ms. Irgit signed it \u201cxo i.\u201dWorking with the factory, Ms. Wu helped to create a prototype. Ms. Irgit loved it, and asked for 300 more. Ms. Wu was worried about such a large order; if they didn\u2019t sell, Ms. Irgit would be out a lot of money. But the Kiinis did sell \u2014 and sell and sell. What started as a favor for Ms. Irgit became a major time commitment. \u201cEven in winter, we were shipping to Australia, shipping to Europe, shipping to New York,\u201d Ms. Wu said. Ms. Irgit was crazed trying to manage the commercial demand and the press attention.The two women were consumed by work, and their relationship was fraying. Ms. Wu urged Ms. Irgit to expand her brand beyond a single motif. She made suggestions that Ms. Irgit ridiculed. Given the frostiness, Ms. Wu was surprised, she said, to get a phone call from Ms. Irgit one night in the late summer of 2016.\u201cCan I come over?\u201d Ms. Irgit asked.About a half-hour later, she arrived. She was nearly a year into litigation with Victoria\u2019s Secret, and she explained that in the discovery process, lawyers for Victoria\u2019s Secret had learned that Ms. Wu had a hand in Kiini\u2019s production. Victoria\u2019s Secret had given Ms. Irgit\u2019s lawyers advance notice that Ms. Wu was going to receive a subpoena for a deposition.Ms. Wu said she clearly recalled what Ms. Irgit said next. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018You can\u2019t really tell them I copied.\u2019 I said, \u2018Listen, Ipek, I\u2019m not going to lie.\u2019\u201d (Ms. Irgit disputed Ms. Wu\u2019s recollection. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d she said.)The two women talked some more. Ms. Wu was upset about getting pulled into a legal mess. Ms. Irgit was worried about how the drama could impact Kiini\u2019s production.Before Ms. Irgit departed, Ms. Wu said, Ms. Irgit wrote a note on a yellow sticky pad. It read, \u201cIf Kiini LLC wins the VS case Ipek is treating\u201d \u2014 the penmanship is imprecise and the word \u201ctreating\u201d might be \u201chosting\u201d or \u201chaving\u201d \u2014 \u201cSally ChaCha and 3 optional friends on holiday anywhere in the world!\u201d (Cha Cha was a nickname for Ms. Wu\u2019s daughter.) She signed it \u201cIpek,\u201d underlining her name in a flourish.Ms. Wu said she never received a subpoena. The next year, Victoria\u2019s Secret settled the lawsuit with Kiini.By April 2018, around the time that Kiini sued Neiman Marcus, Ms. Wu and Ms. Irgit\u2019s friendship and business arrangement had totally deteriorated. They had a blistering fight over email, with each woman impugning the other\u2019s integrity, and Ms. Wu stopped working with Kiini.Not long after, Ms. Wu had dinner with a friend, an entrepreneur named Doug Schmidt. She told him the whole story about her work with Ms. Irgit: replicating that first Brazilian bikini, the copyright, the lawsuits. Mr. Schmidt told Ms. Wu that he had friends at Neiman Marcus. He bet they\u2019d want to hear her story, too.In April, lawyers for Kiini sent Neiman Marcus a letter urging it to cease and desist selling swimwear from brands including Platinum. Neiman Marcus notified PilyQ, Platinum\u2019s parent, and Mr. Forge started digging on PilyQ\u2019s behalf. He got in touch with lawyers involved in the Victoria\u2019s Secret litigation and heard rumors of an unacknowledged bikini maker in Brazil.This summer, Mr. Forge was thrilled to learn from someone at Neiman Marcus that there was a woman named Sally Wu who had worked with Ms. Irgit from the beginning. Mr. Forge met Ms. Wu for a drink and got her story. She subsequently emailed him a photo of the yellow sticky note with Ms. Irgit\u2019s signed offer. She also agreed to give Mr. Forge access to data from her old hard drives.Within days, he was looking at the \u201cSally darling\u201d email Ms. Irgit sent to Ms. Wu some six years earlier, with photographs of the bikini she wished the Chinese producers to use as a reference for her prototype. On his computer, Mr. Forge scrutinized the pictures for details. One image was of the bikini bottom turned inside out.Mr. Forge zoomed in. He zoomed again. Then he saw it. \u201cI could not believe my eyes,\u201d Mr. Forge told me. On the elastic, in marker, was a phone number, the words \u201cTrancoso, B.A.\u201d and the signature of Solange Ferrarini.In May 2018, as Mr. Forge was conducting his work, Kiini amended its lawsuit against Neiman Marcus to formally add PilyQ, Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor, Macy\u2019s and others as defendants. Mr. Forge found it outrageous. The way he saw it, PilyQ was compensating Ms. Ferrarini for her creation \u2014 and was now being sued by someone who he believed had copied that work and passed it off as her own to the United States Copyright Office.Mr. Forge contacted a lawyer who had done work for Victoria\u2019s Secret in the Kiini matter, Michelle Rutherford, and asked her to take on a new client. On June 13, on behalf of Ms. Ferrarini, Ms. Rutherford sued Ms. Irgit and Kiini in federal court, in the Central District of California, citing unfair business practices and asking for a public apology.On July 3, one of Ms. Irgit\u2019s lawyers, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences,\u201d petitioned the court to be removed from his role as counsel in her case against Neiman Marcus and the others. On July 6, Ms. Irgit withdrew her case.Mark A. Berman, Ms. Irgit\u2019s lawyer in the case in which she is the defendant, has filed motions to dismiss and to have Ms. Rutherford disqualified. The judge, Fernando M. Olguin, who also oversaw Kiini\u2019s action against Victoria\u2019s Secret, has not yet ruled.It\u2019s unclear what the implications of the new lawsuit are for Ms. Irgit. David J. Christopher, the chief of operations for the United States Copyright Office, declined to comment.When I spoke to Ms. Irgit in her Tribeca apartment this summer, she said she was not concerned about the case and was trying to focus on her company. Sales are not what they were during what Ms. Wu said were the peak times of 2015 and 2016, but Ms. Irgit is developing new products, including swimsuits for girls.As for the allegations in the lawsuit, Ms. Irgit said she sent photographs of Ms. Ferrarini\u2019s bikini to Ms. Wu in 2012 because she liked the colors.She said the reason a photograph of a distinctive Trancoso pineapple cart had appeared on an early version of the Kiini website was simply because \u201cit was a cute photo.\u201dShe didn\u2019t have much to say about why the bathing suit shown in a photograph submitted to the Copyright Office is a near replica of Ms. Ferrarini\u2019s bikini.She said the note promising Ms. Wu a reward if a court verdict went her way was not a bribe.At one point during the interview, Ms. Irgit walked into another room and returned with what she considered evidence that she created the design that became the Kiini. It was a bikini made in the Ferrarini/Kiini style, with elastic woven through crochet sewed to fabric \u2014 in this case, padded leotard-like pink fabric with mustard-yellow polka dots. The suit, she said, was made in 1999 and had been at her aunt\u2019s house in Turkey until recently.Ms. Irgit declined to be quoted directly on a number of topics.Last month, though, she sent me an email expressing anger at Ms. Wu. She was even angrier with PilyQ and Mr. Forge, whom she called a \u201cbully\u201d and a \u201cscumbag.\u201d\u201cWhat do they tell their children at the dinner table about how they make money?\u201d Ms. Irgit wrote, saying she imagined them as film characters like Dr. Evil, from \u201cAustin Powers,\u201d and Maleficent, from \u201cSleeping Beauty,\u201d attaching .gifs of them to illustrate her point. (\u201cIpek\u2019s cartoon perspective is fitting for someone who lives in a world where people who expose frauds are villains and people who commit them are victims,\u201d Mr. Forge said.)Ms. Irgit\u2019s email also contained some positives. She pointed out that there would not be press attention and legal fights over crochet bikinis had she not envisioned and marketed a trendsetting global brand. \u201cI must have done something right,\u201d she wrote.Ciara Long contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Or It Could Turn to China.", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s Museum of Cosmonautics displays with rightful pride artifacts from its early years of storied achievements in space exploration: the first satellite, the first dog in space, the first man and, soon thereafter, the first toolbox.Labeled in blocky Cyrillic writing a \u201cpanel with instruments for technical service and repair,\u201d the toolbox held an array of handy items like pliers, two wooden-handled files and a hacksaw, spare blade included.Russian space officials are trumpeting this history of grit and ingenuity in orbit as they hope to persuade Washington to continue joint piloted exploration in the next decade rather than split into separate paths. They face significant hurdles.The American incentives for engaging with Russia in space in the 1990s \u2014 political goals like the employment of idle rocket scientists to prevent missile proliferation \u2014 have mostly disappeared with the resumption of tensions.Further complicating matters are the plans by some entrepreneurs to create private space stations for space tourism.Dmitri O. Rogozin, the director of Russia\u2019s space agency, said in an interview that the hole had been drilled in a deliberate act of sabotage, but it remains unclear whether this happened before launch or in orbit.\u201cIt was intentional damage to the ship, we are convinced of this now,\u201d Mr. Rogozin said of the hole, about the size of a pencil eraser. Cosmonauts on board patched it with specialized tape. \u201cThis was intentional action; manual, intentional action.\u201dNever miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.The capsule was launched in June but started leaking air only weeks later, suggesting that if the hole had been drilled before launch it must have been plugged with a sealant that broke down over time and was sucked into the vacuum of space.The investigation has to be conducted in space, as the portion of the Soyuz ship with the hole is designed to separate and burn during re-entry, meaning that it cannot be examined on the ground.Mr. Rogozin said he and Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, had agreed not to speculate on the causes or the political implications of the matter until the investigation is completed. Whether the hole affects talks on future space cooperation, Mr. Rogozin said, \u201cdepends on the result of the investigation.\u201dThe mystery of the hole notwithstanding, it is unclear how much longer the post-Soviet era of space cooperation between the United States and Russia can last in the more hostile environment now surrounding relations.In the interview, Mr. Rogozin said Russia wanted to carry on joint flights with the United States and its allies, despite the tensions over election interference, wars in Syria and Ukraine, and the chemical weapons poisoning of a former double agent in Britain.The American and Russian piloted space programs should remain merged, he said, as a symbol of coexistence and the peaceful pursuit of science. He also argued that it would be a mistake to leave the Russians out of any risky venture in space.Russian hardware would provide a safety net if something went wrong near the moon, he said, just as Russian rockets were able to supply the International Space Station after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, which grounded the shuttle program for more than two years.\u201cEven if Americans make their own lunar transport system, there should always be a reserve, for the safety of the crew,\u201d he said. \u201cThat reserve can exist only if a partner \u2014 and now only Russia can do this, and nobody else \u2014 has another, alternative transport system capable of saving the astronauts in case of a very problematic situation.\u201dAnalysts say Moscow has a strong incentive to maintain the joint program: a decided lack of money to pursue a lunar station on its own. Russia\u2019s budget for its space program is something less than one-tenth what the United States spends on NASA.The Russians successfully launched a fresh crew to the station on the same model of rocket on Dec. 3.Russia\u2019s preference is to press on with a space program entwined with the United States\u2019, on either the lunar program or another venture, Mr. Rogozin said. But if talks fail, Russia can turn to China or India for partnership.\u201cChina is offering many initiatives for cooperation, is asking us to help them develop, though they have already achieved a good level of development,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are suggesting creating a joint station.\u201dThere might then be two stations circling the Earth or the moon, one led by the United States, the other a Russian-Chinese enterprise. Mr. Rogozin even floated the idea of a \u201cBRIC station,\u201d the acronym for the developing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China.Mr. Rogozin in November ordered the Russian Academy of Sciences to study the prospects for a solo Russian program to build a habitable base on the surface of the moon.Ivan M. Moiseyev, the director of the Institute of Space Policy in Moscow, said in a telephone interview that any proposal for a lone Russian lunar station was fantastical, given the budget constraints. \u201cThe technical capability exists, but the finances don\u2019t.\u201dThe Soviet Union, though beaten to the moon by the United States, was no slouch in lunar exploration. The Soviet Union was the first to photograph the far side of the moon and to land a rover and return a sample robotically. But it canceled its piloted program in the 1970s rather than strive for a second-place landing. \u201cWe were close,\u201d Mr. Moiseyev said.Separate programs today, Mr. Rogozin said, are a fallback option. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right,\u201d he said, to plan for a future of piloted flight after the International Space Station with multiple, competing national programs or alliances.What Russia can offer, Mr. Rogozin said, is a margin of safety for any future moon orbiting station.Over decades operating the Salyut and later Mir space stations, Russian cosmonauts tackled a range of in-flight emergencies and repairs ranging from fires to collisions that made the Russian program look like an orbiting Murphy\u2019s Law. But they survived.\u201cIt\u2019s better, cheaper and safer to go together,\u201d Mr. Rogozin said. \u201cPoliticians will say, \u2018Let\u2019s do it alone,\u2019 but politics ends where the opinion of a serious scientist begins. That\u2019s what I say.\u201dIf the United States chooses to exclude Russia, and an emergency arises, he said, \u201cWho will answer for that?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Fall Back Into Negative Territory for 2018 as Economic Uncertainty Grips Investors", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street dropped again Friday, pushing the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year, as investors continued to fixate on how much the economy and corporate profits could slow next year.Until recently, the American stock market had been something of a standout performer among global markets. The S&P 500 was up 9.6 percent for the year well into September. But over the last few months those gains have disappeared as investors began to assess the potential fallout from a trade war between the United States and China and, rising interest rates.\u201cEssentially there is a scare in the market about the future growth prospects of the global economy,\u201d said Hari Srinivasan, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, an asset management firm.While the market initially rose slightly, those gains evaporated as the issue of a trade war resurfaced later Friday morning. Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, said on CNN that the United States would increase tariffs on Chinese imports if the two countries could not reach an agreement on trade by the end of a 90-day negotiating period. President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed on Saturday to the standstill on new tariffs, but confusion about the nature of the agreement has only added to recent volatility in the stock markets based on widespread expectation that the American economy will likely slow next year.The arrest could mark a risky new phase for many big technology firms, which depend on networks of factories and subcontractors in Asia and have bet on strong demand from Chinese consumers to fuel future growth.Shares of these companies fared particularly poorly on Friday. Companies that make networking equipment and cellphones in China were also sharply lower. The semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices fell more than 8 percent, while Apple was down more than 3 percent. Microsoft and Amazon both fell more than 4 percent. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell more than 3 percent.Industrial stocks also saw significant losses Friday, with the S&P 500 industrial sector dropping 2.6 percent. Large exporters Boeing and Caterpillar, which ship large amounts of goods to China, fell 2.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.\u201cIt is a slowdown and it is making investors nervous, and it could possibly slow down further,\u201d said Stephen Gallagher, director of research at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in New York. \u201cAnd the risks are pointed to the downside with the trade tensions just continuing to build.\u201dBut softer market sentiment soon touched the oil markets, where crude prices moderated their gains. After gaining more than 5 percent earlier in the day, Brent crude oil rose 2 percent, to $61.57 a barrel. West Texas crude, the American benchmark, rose 1.9 percent, to $52.48.The S&P 500 energy sector declined by 0.6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Digital Divide Is Wider Than We Think, Study Says", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFerry County in northeastern Washington spans more than 2,200 square miles of mostly forestland, rivers and lakes. And according to the Federal Communications Commission, everyone in the sprawling county has access to broadband internet.But that is not the reality experienced by the roughly 7,500 residents of this county, which is rich in natural beauty but internet-poor.The county seat, Republic, has basic broadband service, supplied by a community cable TV company owned by residents. But go beyond the cluster of blocks in the small town, and the high-speed service drops off quickly. People routinely drive into town to use Wi-Fi in the public library and other spots for software updates, online shopping or schoolwork, said Elbert Koontz, Republic\u2019s mayor.\u201cWe don\u2019t really have broadband coverage across the county,\u201d Mr. Koontz said. \u201cWe\u2019re out in the woods.\u201dA new study by Microsoft researchers casts a light on the actual use of high-speed internet across the country, and the picture it presents is very different from the F.C.C. numbers. Their analysis, presented at a Microsoft event on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., suggests that the speedy access is much more limited than the F.C.C. data shows.Over all, Microsoft concluded that 162.8 million people do not use the internet at broadband speeds, while the F.C.C. says broadband is not available to 24.7 million Americans. The discrepancy is particularly stark in rural areas. In Ferry County, for example, Microsoft estimates that only 2 percent of people use broadband service, versus the 100 percent the federal government says have access to the service.Accurate measurements on the reach of broadband matter because the government\u2019s statistics are used to guide policy and channel federal funding for underserved areas.Telecommunications experts and some politicians have pointed to the shortcomings of the official F.C.C. statistics for years. Last year, the agency began a formal review, still in progress, of how to improve its broadband measurements.\u201cMaintaining updated and accurate data about broadband deployment is critical to bridging the digital divide,\u201d Ajit Pai, the commission chairman, said at the time. \u201cSo we\u2019re teeing up ideas for collecting more granular and standardized data.\u201dThe Microsoft researchers shared their analysis with F.C.C. officials. The agency declined to comment on the findings.The issue with the current F.C.C. statistics, experts say, is that they rely on simplistic surveys of internet service providers that inherently overstate coverage. For example, if one business in an area has broadband service, then the entire area is typically considered to have broadband service available.The Microsoft researchers instead looked at the internet speeds of people using the company\u2019s software and services, like Office software, Windows updates, Bing searches and maps, and Xbox game play. The Microsoft data is much more detailed than the official government statistics, said John Kahan, Microsoft\u2019s chief data analytics officer for external affairs.Microsoft plans to put the national comparisons, as well as state and county data, on a website this month.The Microsoft analysis also includes county unemployment data, which points to the strong correlation between joblessness and low rates of broadband use. The unemployment rate in Ferry County, for example, is 11 percent, more than twice the statewide rate.\u201cThe worst place to be is in a place where there is no access to the technology everyone else is benefiting from,\u201d said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft.Expanding broadband also benefits Microsoft and other tech companies because it enlarges the market for their products and services. And like others, Microsoft is promoting a potential solution.The technology is promising, experts say, but one tool among a handful needed to bring broadband connectivity to rural America. Other tools include fiber networks, satellite coverage and high-speed mobile service.A key challenge is bringing down the cost of devices that use white-space technology. In mid-2017, they cost $800, but are now just $300, Microsoft says. The goal is to get the price to $100.Last year, Microsoft announced plans to work with internet providers and hardware firms to propel the adoption of white-space technology. To date, the company says, it has deals in 13 states to bring broadband to over a million people in rural areas.Microsoft on Tuesday said its Airband initiative planned to reach three million rural residents by July 2022, a million more than its target announced last year.Microsoft is urging the government to keep the white-space broadcast spectrum open for public use. It is also pushing to get a larger portion of the more than $4 billion a year that the F.C.C. and the Agriculture Department spend in grants and subsidies to bring broadband to rural areas.Microsoft competitors and critics say one of the wealthiest companies in the world is lobbying for an advantage and government money. Broadcasters also worry the white-space technology could interfere with local television service.\u201cBroadcasters have always supported rural broadband deployment,\u201d said Dennis Wharton, executive vice president for communications at the National Association of Broadcasters. \u201cBut we\u2019re skeptical whether Microsoft can deliver that service without significant interference and disruption to local television signals in smaller markets.\u201dIn Ferry County, a white-space broadband effort will begin next year. Declaration Networks, a company that focuses on bringing broadband to rural areas, has just received a commitment for money from the F.C.C. for the project.\u201cFerry County has a lot of needs, and we\u2019re going to try address that,\u201d said Bob Nichols, chief executive of Declaration Networks, which is based in Vienna, Va.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

In a new book, \u201cThe Government-Citizen Disconnect,\u201d Suzanne Mettler, a political scientist at Cornell University, observes that Mitch McConnell was known as a pro-civil rights, union-friendly moderate as a county executive in Louisville in the late 1970s. As federal transfers grew from around 10 percent of the income of the average Kentuckian in 1970 to 24 percent in 2016, seven percentage points more than the national average, the ideology of Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader \u2014 and the rest of Kentucky\u2019s congressional delegation \u2014 moved sharply to the right.And local Democrats \u2014 who once thrived in heavily unionized mining towns \u2014 gradually lost ground.

And in 2016, Republicans captured the State Assembly and for the first time gained full control of Kentucky\u2019s executive and legislative branches.Share of all state assemblies100%9080DEMOCRATS7060504030REPUBLICANS20100\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918Share of all state assemblies100%9080DEMOCRATS7060504030REPUBLICANS20100\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918Share of all state assemblies100%9080DEMOCRATS7060504030REPUBLICANS20100\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918Source: Steven Rogers, Ph.D (Saint Louis University) | By The New York TimesTransfers from the federal government account for more than half of residents\u2019 personal income in 11 counties across the country. Ten are in eastern Kentucky; another is in West Virginia. Nine of those sit in Kentucky\u2019s Fifth Congressional District, which was the first in the nation to declare a winner on election night, Nov. 6: Harold Rogers, a Republican who has held the seat since 1981. He won 79 percent of the vote. Even excluding health insurance \u2014 which some experts argue should not count \u2014 people in this patch of Appalachia draw between a fifth and a third of their income from the public purse. Take Daniel Lewis, who crashed his car into a coal truck 15 years ago, breaking his neck and suffering a blood clot in his brain when he was only 21. He is grateful for the $1,600 a month his family gets from disability insurance; for his Medicaid benefits; for the food stamps he shares with his wife and two children.\u201cEvery need I have has been met,\u201d Mr. Lewis told me. He disagrees with the governor\u2019s proposal to demand that Medicaid recipients get a job. And yet, in 2016, he voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cIt was the lesser of two evils,\u201d he said.About 13 percent of Harlan\u2019s residents are receiving disability benefits. More than 10,000 get food stamps. But in 2015 almost two-thirds voted for Mr. Bevin. In 2016 almost 9 out of 10 chose Mr. Trump.Conservative values surely run strong in this county of many churches and only one liquor store. But the politics of Harlan, a storied Democratic enclave whose yearlong strike against the Duke Power Company\u2019s coal-mining interests in 1973 is seared into union lore, can\u2019t be explained simply by voters\u2019 cultural leanings. As Professor Mettler points out, the people who rely most on government transfers are least likely to vote. Only 31 percent of Kentucky\u2019s electorate voted in 2015; only 16 percent voted for Mr. Bevin. Participation was lowest in the counties most dependent on federal aid. The governor\u2019s victory was not propelled by the neediest Kentuckians.More government assistance100%80CountiesTrump won60Trendline40MorevotesforTrump20001020304050%Counties Clinton wonelection in each county.3.4 million100,000More government assistance100%9080Morevotes forTrump70CountiesTrump won60504030Trendline20CountiesClinton won1000102030405060%3.4 million100,000Notes: The axes are government transfers as a share of income and Trump\u2019s share of the vote in 2016 in counties across the United States. The trendline is weighted by the total votes.Sources: David Leip\u2019s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections; Bureau of Economic AnalysisA cognitive disconnect is at play: People often don\u2019t link benefits they rely on with the idea of government welfare. Professor Lacy\u2019s research, for instance, suggests that ideology and identity influence how people perceive their benefits, and can outweigh their personal experience of such assistance. He finds that Democrats and African-Americans, but not whites or Republicans, were much more likely as groups to feel they were benefiting from government programs in 2012, when Mr. Obama was president, than during the George W. Bush administration in 2008.But Harlan\u2019s experience suggests that the steepest barrier keeping voters from embracing the government payments that help them get through the day comes from fundamental mistrust. It\u2019s not necessarily that people here don\u2019t understand they benefit. They fear that Washington \u2014 so distant from rural America \u2014 does not understand their plight or have their interests in mind.\u201cPeople in Harlan County have been on the front lines of the war on poverty for 50-plus years and can see its actual effects,\u201d said Preston Jones, the 31-year-old assistant director at the Pine Mountain Settlement School, over the mountain from Harlan. \u201cIt is degrading.\u201dMr. Jones, a Republican who not long ago was a Democrat, speaks from a deep well of grievance over the fact that generations of Harlan residents have had to turn to the government for sustenance. That sentiment mixes in with a vague but powerful resentment across the county toward a political system that people here blame for allowing, encouraging even, the decline of coal, its economic backbone.Harlan is one of the poorest counties in the nation. It has been poor for a long time. The typical household takes in barely $25,000 \u2014 less than half the national median. Opiate abuse is rampant. Over the last century or so, the population has shrunk by more than two-thirds.Data from Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program shows that as the coal industry has withered since 2010 \u2014 squeezed out by natural gas as cheaper fuel for power generation \u2014 productivity in terms of economic output per Harlan County worker has shrunk by an average of 8.6 percent a year. There are few open storefronts downtown, mostly occupied by disability lawyers and pawn shops. \u201cThe biggest business for a long time was the U-Haul rental business as people moved out of state,\u201d said Jay Nolan, who runs a string of newspapers based in London, some 70 miles northwest. \u201cIn Harlan you had to wait for days to get one.\u201dMany people blame Mr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan for killing coal and credit their vote for Mr. Trump to his promise that he would revitalize the industry. Some are skeptical of a government that saved Detroit\u2019s automakers but not Appalachia\u2019s lifeline. And this feeling is going to be hard to shake.Harlan has few answers to its economic tribulations: few roads linking it to the world\u2019s markets, few good broadband links, few college graduates, few investors willing to risk their money there. \u201cMost of the kids from here who have a chance to go to university never come back,\u201d said Colby Kirk, executive director at One Harlan County, a nonprofit economic development group serving the area.Success, when it happens, happens on a small scale. This year, the Harlan County Chamber of Commerce gave its business-of-the-year award to a fledgling coal-mining company that has grown to 220 jobs, almost twice as many as last year.Therein lies a monumental obstacle to transforming the politics of America\u2019s safety net. As small towns lag behind prosperous urban centers along the coasts, as rural communities shed businesses and jobs, and as their residents turn to welfare as a last line of sustenance, the more they will resent Washington\u2019s inability, or unwillingness, to stem the decline.

{"Headline": "Italy and E.U. Reach a Budget Deal, as Populist Plan Runs Into Reality", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 This time, Italy\u2019s populists blinked.Since taking power in June, Italy\u2019s populist government has outmaneuvered political opponents, out-screamed its loudest critics, used the press for target practice and waltzed away from scandals unscathed. Italian and European liberal forces that sought to stop their rise have seemed powerless to lay a glove on them.But on Wednesday, the populist juggernaut slammed into reality, the only force that seems capable of slowing it down.After months of torturous negotiations, acrid insults, internal tensions and enough social media airtime to fill a Netflix series, Italy\u2019s populist leaders bowed to the demands of the European Union to roll back its expensive, rules-flouting budget. It did so in the face of costly penalties and potentially debilitating economic punishment inflicted by the international markets, real-world forces that threaten to inflict genuine pain on their electoral base.\u201cThe U-turn from the Italian government,\u201d financial analysts at Barclays wrote in a note to clients, indicated that the populists had realized \u201cthe potential perils involved with Italy holding unreasonable fiscal policies and an anti-E.U. stance.\u201dInvestors, on edge over the possibility of Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, causing an economic disaster that could infect all of Europe, breathed a sigh of relief. Markets reacted warmly to the deal, and the Milan-based stock market rallied and borrowing costs fell.The initial budget spent billions on a universal income plan, essentially an enormous unemployment program, that would benefit the base of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement in the chronically underemployed south. Five Star\u2019s coalition partner, the League, demanded tax breaks and a lowering of the retirement age. Critics considered the promise a hand out for the League\u2019s base of workers in the north.The initial budget had a spending deficit equal to 2.40 percent of gross domestic product, a figure considered onerous for a country with such a burdensome debt.For months, Italy refused to budge. But on Wednesday, it yielded by shaving billions of euros off the budget.Speaking in Brussels, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice-president responsible for the euro, announced that the agreement would leave Italy with a budget deficit next year of 2.04 percent of gross domestic product.A substantial part of the savings, he said, \u201cstems from the delayed entry into force of the two main expansionary measures \u2014 the citizens\u2019 income and the rolling back of pension reforms.\u201dPierre Moscovici, the bloc\u2019s commissioner for economic and financial affairs, who for months fought with Italy\u2019s populists, said \u201cthe agreement of today shows unambiguously that the Commission is not the enemy of the Italian people, as some people would like to describe us.\u201dHe added that \u201cI hope that after today we can move beyond these caricatures, both ways, and I hope that today we can also put to rest any doubts over Italy\u2019s place in the European Union.\u201dTo bring Italy back into the fold, Brussels, which originally wanted the budget spending to be no more than 1.6 percent, chose vinegar over honey. Eager to instill structural changes in Italy, it took a hard line and made it clear that it would begin a process that could punish Italy with costly fines for breaking its agreements.In addition to trimming its spending plans, the Italian government responded by promising to sell off public buildings and to impose stiffer fines and higher interest rates on tax dodgers.It revised its growth forecast from 1.5 percent, which Europe and the markets found deeply unrealistic, to less than 1 percent, which Europe and the markets find only mildly unrealistic.Officials in Europe, who are eager to prevent more chaos in what many consider the soft southern underbelly of the European Union, characterized the deal as Italy\u2019s recommitment to the bloc and to the euro.The Italians tried, with some difficulty, to claim they had gotten what they wanted.In an address to the Italian Parliament, which will have to approve the budget by the end of the year to avoid another round of negotiations with Brussels, Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said that the \u201cdetermined\u201d negotiations had paid off. He said the government never did anything to \u201cbetray the trust\u201d of its voters.Instead, speaking over heckles from opposition senators, Mr. Conte, who once said there was no \u201cPlan B\u201d to the original budget proposal, said that the technicians in Brussels had shown how the government actually needed less money \u201cthan initially foreseen.\u201dContrary to the official statement in Brussels, he said, plans for a universal income and lowering the retirement age would not be delayed, a claim helped by the fact that no official start date for the programs had ever been offered.\u201cWe never backed down on content,\u201d he insisted, adding, that the government \u201cnever retreated.\u201dIt sure seemed like they had.Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s powerful deputy prime minister and leader of the League party, had earlier said that he would not budge from the 2.4 percent spending figure, \u201cnot even if baby Jesus arrives.\u201d He insisted that he would not allow even \u201cone comma\u201d of the budget to be changed. \u201cItalians come first,\u201d he said at another point. \u201cItaly no longer wants to be a servant to silly rules.\u201dOn Wednesday, he sounded like he suddenly took those rules more seriously. \u201cTo have avoided the infringement procedure is the victory of common sense for the good of Italian citizens,\u201d he said.Mr. Salvini\u2019s governing partner, Luigi Di Maio, the political leader of the Five Star Movement and the minister of both economic development and labor, had in September called the proposed budget \u201chistoric.\u201d\u201cIn a decisive manner, with this measure, with this budget, we will have abolished poverty,\u201d he said on Italian television.Throughout the negotiations, Italy\u2019s populists tried to rally popular support against Brussels with their usual mix of aggressive language, social media attacks and public outrage. Mr. Salvini insinuated that the Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was a drunk, while the Five Star co-founder, Beppe Grillo, mused about his potential mental illness.But none of it seemed to work.On Wednesday, critics of the government hoped to exploit the government\u2019s vulnerability. The previous government argued that the negative reactions of the financial markets to the government\u2019s provocations had cost Italians real money.\u201cFor the first time, Italy\u2019s budget was launched in Brussels,\u201d Paolo Gentiloni, the prime minister with the previous center-left government, who had proposed a budget with a 0.8 percent deficit, wrote on Twitter. \u201cSovereigntists without sovereignty. The economic effort of the last six years liquidated in six months.\u201dBarclay\u2019s, the financial analysis firm, added in its note that \u201cthe experience of the past six months suggests the Italian government may be more mindful of the effects that anti-E.U. rhetoric can have, which is also a positive development in our view, albeit unlikely that a populist coalition such as this will fully abandon such a stance.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s new deputy has been serving as a \u201ccounselor\u201d to the secretary with a focus on domestic finance since joining the department, where he helped draft the $1.5 trillion tax cut that Republicans passed last year.\u201cIt is an honor to be confirmed by the United States senate,\u201d Mr. Muzinich said. \u201cI look forward to working with Secretary Mnuchin and our team at Treasury to advance the president\u2019s economic policies.\u201dTwo of Mr. Trump\u2019s previous picks for the job, James Donovan, a longtime executive at Goldman Sachs, and Brian Brooks, an executive at Fannie Mae, withdrew from consideration.The elevation of Mr. Muzinich comes as Mr. Mnuchin has been engrossed in trade negotiations with China and working to enforce new sanctions on Iran. The role of the deputy secretary is to run the day-to-day operations of the Treasury Department. With several senior Treasury positions still unfilled, however, Mr. Muzinich is likely to continue focusing heavily on the enforcement of the tax legislation, financial regulation and legislative affairs.Mr. Muzinich\u2019s role could become even more critical given that Mr. Trump has considered Mr. Mnuchin as a possible candidate to be his next chief of staff. Mr. Mnuchin, however, has indicated that he prefers his current position at Treasury.In an administration that is ideologically split between so-called Wall Street globalists and economic nationalists, Mr. Muzinich, who holds a business degree from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, fits comfortably in the camp of the New York bankers. He previously worked at Morgan Stanley and was the president of Muzinich & Company, an international investment firm founded by his father.Before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich was policy director for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign and helped write Mr. Bush\u2019s tax plan.Most Democrats opposed Mr. Muzinich\u2019s confirmation, citing his role in shepherding the tax overhaul passed last year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Postal Worker\u2019s Christmas ", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy grandfather was part of a long tradition of postal workers who sacrificed Christmas Eve with their families to deliver holiday packages.Ms. Anderson is the director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies.Every year on Christmas Eve, my extended family gathers for a meal that can be served at the last minute, whenever we\u2019re ready to eat. This tradition of cold salads, ham balls and cookies goes back to my mom\u2019s childhood.My mother\u2019s father was a North Dakota postal employee, so on Christmas Eve, she never knew when he would get home. He was determined to keep working, my mom would tell us, \u201cuntil every Christmas package that could be delivered would be delivered.\u201d He started working for the Postal Service in 1911, and family lore has it that he sometimes had to trudge through the snow on horseback to deliver the mail.As in my grandfather\u2019s day, today\u2019s postal workers have a mandate to provide universal service, delivering mail and packages to every American household at uniform rates, no matter where they live. That mandate has helped bind our vast nation.Specifically, the task force urges the Postal Service to change its pricing system to maximize profits on commercial package deliveries. This would be a major blow to families who buy products online and live along high-cost delivery routes.If the Trump task force has its way, customers in these areas would no longer be able to turn to the Postal Service for surcharge-free, lower-cost rates on most of these routes. Small businesses hoping to send mail or packages to these places would also suffer.Rural communities would also be more likely to lose their local post offices. The task force wants to get rid of a law prohibiting the closing of rural post offices solely because they\u2019re running a deficit. The Postal Service would also have the green light to reduce delivery days from six to five or even fewer days per week and expand the use of cluster mailboxes to replace door-to-door delivery.These and other proposed service cuts would shrink the number of good postal jobs \u2014 jobs that have long supported this country\u2019s middle class. My grandfather\u2019s 47 years of steady Postal Service employment protected the family from the Great Depression and paid for my mom\u2019s teacher training.A generation earlier, my great-grandfather supported his family delivering the mail from Westerly to Newport, R.I., lugging his loads first onto a train and then a ferry. He got the position after the Civil War, when the government created jobs for Union Army vets like him by expanding free delivery service.So what\u2019s behind this cutthroat cost-cutting?The Trump task force report claims that the Postal Service is a financial disaster. In fact, its operations are funded through postage, not tax dollars. Every day, the Postal Service delivers more than 400 million letters and packages at rates that are just a fraction of those in other rich countries \u2014 including the European nations that have privatized their postal operations.While refusing to end this onerous mandate, the task force opposes the post office\u2019s efforts to raise new revenue. The Postal Service has proposed expanding into check-cashing, bill payment and other financial services that could raise new revenue. These would be low-cost, reliable options for consumers without access to traditional banks, and they are services that post offices in other countries have provided for many years. But the task force opposes this move, arguing that the Postal Service can\u2019t compete effectively with banks for this business.This year, as my family gathers for our traditional Christmas Eve meal, we will remember our ancestors\u2019 hard work \u2014 and hope that our country\u2019s Postal Service will continue to thrive for many more generations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kerry: Forget Trump. We All Must Act on Climate Change.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf we fail, it won\u2019t be just the president\u2019s fault.Mr. Kerry was the secretary of state from 2013 to 2017.This week is the third anniversary of the Paris climate agreement. The Trump administration marked it by working with Russia and Gulf oil nations to sideline science and undermine the accord at climate talks underway in Katowice, Poland. Scientists tell us we must act now to avoid the ravages of climate change. The collision of facts and alternative facts has hurt America\u2019s efforts to confront this existential crisis. Ever since Mr. Trump announced that he would pull America out of the Paris accord, those of us in the fight have worked to demonstrate that the American people are still in. But the test is not whether the nation\u2019s cities and states can make up for Mr. Trump\u2019s rejection of reality. They can. The test is whether the nations of the world will pull out of the mutual suicide pact that we\u2019ve all passively joined through an inadequate response to this crisis.Talk to leaders who are gathered in Poland. They acknowledge that we aren\u2019t close to getting the job done in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet. People are dying today because of climate change, and many more will die and trillions of dollars of damage to property will occur unless America gets back in the fight.Future generations will measure us by whether we acted on facts, not just debated or denied them. The verdict will hang on whether we put in place policies that will drive the development and deployment of clean technologies, re-energize our economies, and tackle global climate change. Every day that goes by that we\u2019re paralyzed by the Luddite in the White House is a day in the future that our grandchildren will suffer. That\u2019s not hyperbole \u2014 that\u2019s science.Instead of tacitly accepting that inaction is preordained for the remaining two years of the Trump presidency, Congress should send Mr. Trump legislation addressing this crisis. It will force him to make choices the American people will long remember: Will he say no to deploying solar technology that would turn the American West into the Saudi Arabia of solar? No to turning the Midwest into the Middle East of wind power? No to a manufacturing revolution that could put West Virginia back to work in ways that his beloved coal never will?Make him choose \u2014 and let\u2019s find out.Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democrat from New York and Senate minority leader, is right to demand that infrastructure legislation actually hasten the transition to a clean energy economy and increase climate resilience. In soon-to-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi, he has a partner who wrangled the votes in the House in 2009 to pass a landmark cap-and-trade program to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases (though it never made it out of the Senate), and can join him in seeking investments in low carbon infrastructure. And if Mr. Trump says no, make climate change the galvanizing issue for 2020 for millennials who will vote as if their lives depend on it \u2014 because they do.If we fail, future generations will judge us all as failures, not just this president. They will have no time for excuses. Facts matter. Act on them.John Kerry was a Democratic senator from Massachusetts before becoming secretary of state in the Obama administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Day, a Life: When a Medic Was Killed in Gaza, Was It an Accident?", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKHUZAA, Gaza Strip \u2014 A young medic in a head scarf runs into danger, her only protection a white lab coat. Through a haze of tear gas and black smoke, she tries to reach a man sprawled on the ground along the Gaza border. Israeli soldiers, their weapons leveled, watch warily from the other side.Minutes later, a rifle shot rips through the din, and the Israeli-Palestinian drama has its newest tragic figure.To the Palestinians, she was an innocent martyr killed in cold blood, an example of Israel\u2019s disregard for Palestinian life. To the Israelis, she was part of a violent protest aimed at destroying their country, to which lethal force is a legitimate response as a last resort.In each version, Ms. Najjar was little more than a cardboard cutout.An investigation by The New York Times found that Ms. Najjar, and what happened on the evening of June 1, were far more complicated than either narrative allowed. Charismatic and committed, she defied the expectations of both sides. Her death was a poignant illustration of the cost of Israel\u2019s use of battlefield weapons to control the protests, a policy that has taken the lives of nearly 200 Palestinians.It also shows how each side is locked into a seemingly unending and insolvable cycle of violence. The Palestinians trying to tear down the fence are risking their lives to make a point, knowing that the protests amount to little more than a public relations stunt for Hamas, the militant movement that rules Gaza. And Israel, the far stronger party, continues to focus on containment rather than finding a solution.In life, Ms. Najjar was a natural leader whose uncommon bravery struck some peers as foolhardy. She was a capable young medic, but one who was largely self-taught and lied about her lack of education. She was a feminist, by Gaza standards, shattering traditional gender rules, but also a daughter who doted on her father, was particular about her appearance and was slowly assembling a trousseau. She inspired others with her outward jauntiness, while privately she was consumed with dread in her final days. The last day of her life begins well before sunrise. Ms. Najjar fries sambousek, small meat pies, to share with her father for the predawn meal before the Ramadan fast. She shows him a new suit she bought for her 5-year-old brother, Amir. They pray together before going back to sleep.When he awakens that afternoon, she is gone.Today, the medics are hoping for a low-key Friday. But around 5 p.m., the protest gains energy. A crowd surges toward the fence and the Israelis unleash a suffocating barrage of tear gas. There has been no gunfire yet. It is still possible to kid around. \u201cLet\u2019s go get martyred together,\u201d Ms. Najjar teases Mahmoud Abdelaty, a fellow medic. \u201cGo on and get hit so I can take care of you.\u201d\u201cAre you scared of death?\u201d she asks Mahmoud Qedayeh, another member of their team of volunteers. \u201cYou only die once.\u201dFor the Israel Defense Forces, she was a nightmare of a victim: a photogenic symbol of nationhood, youth and compassion.On March 30, the protests\u2019 first day, Ms. Najjar became the youngest of three volunteers tending to the wounded, and the only woman.To the young men in skinny jeans and T-shirts hurling rocks at Israeli soldiers, she seemed to appear beside them almost as fast as they fell, bandaging burns, splinting fractures, stanching gunshot wounds, offering encouragement, sometimes hearing last words.Journalists noticed. Practically overnight, she became a fixture of news reports, with a growing social-media following. \u201cEverybody knew her,\u201d said another medic, Lamiaa Abu Moustafa.Over the next nine weeks, shrapnel pelted Ms. Najjar\u2019s legs, a flaming tire burned her, a tear-gas grenade fractured her arm. She cut off her cast the same day and went back to the protest.Others cowered when Israeli soldiers fired at them. Not Ms. Najjar. \u201cThe gunshots we hear will not harm us,\u201d she told a colleague. The implication: You won\u2019t hear the one that kills you.She inspired other women to become medics, despite social conventions in this deeply conservative Muslim territory that reserve dangerous work for men. \u201cI wanted to become like Rouzan, brave and strong and helping everybody,\u201d said Najwa Abu Abdo, a 17-year-old neighbor, explaining her decision to volunteer.Unmarried and uninterested in marriage for the time being, Ms. Najjar remained very much the star of her own drama. She sent affectionate texts to peers who each believed they were her closest friend. She lied about her credentials, pretending to be a college student. She obsessed over backbiting and jealousy within her social circle.Yet she had more on her mind.For Ms. Najjar, the protests were not just an opportunity to vent at the barbed wire that made Gaza feel like an open-air cage. They were an opportunity to gain medical experience, to make a name for herself and perhaps, by making an impression, to further her goal of making nursing school affordable.By late May, she seemed well on her way.Tear gas is everywhere. The Israelis have not yet fired live ammunition, but the acrid fumes are overwhelming. \u201cLike a dense fog,\u201d says Fares al-Qedra, another medic.It\u2019s a giant dance: Protesters run toward the fence, soldiers launch gas grenades, the protesters back off. Repeat.Ms. Najjar, noticeable in her white coat and red lipstick, scurries around spraying saline solution in people\u2019s eyes to wash away the gas. So many need her help that she cannot keep up.A 54-year-old man is hit in the forehead by a gas grenade. Ms. Najjar rushes to him, bandages the gash, then runs alongside as he is carried to an ambulance.Gaza had not always been locked up behind barbed wire, sensors and bunkers.Before 2005, Gaza residents could work in Israel. But rocket attacks and bombings after the Second Intifada erupted in 2000 prompted Israel to cordon off the strip and eventually abandon its settlements there. When Hamas seized power from the Palestinian Authority after a weeklong civil war in 2007, Israel imposed a punishing blockade, severely restricting travel and trade.By 2017, after three wars with Israel, Gaza\u2019s economy was a shambles and the authority\u2019s president, Mahmoud Abbas, was determined to finish off Hamas. He laid off thousands of Gaza workers and cut electricity to a few hours at a time.With imams urging people to attend and Hamas chartering buses, crowds grew quickly. The protests became a kind of nationalist circus. Mothers brought children, vendors hawked falafel and families slept in tents. Nearer the fence, young men burned tires, crept up with wire cutters or improvised firebombs \u2014 and presented Israeli snipers with easy targets.Bloodshed served Hamas\u2019s public-relations purposes, winning international attention and sympathy. The Israelis obliged.Later, Israeli officials explained that military policy permitted deadly force only as a last resort, against an imminent threat of violence, and after exhausting lesser options like verbal warnings, tear gas and warning shots. Spokesmen insisted that commanders had to approve each shot and, in one subsequently deleted Twitter post, that \u201cWe know where every bullet landed.\u201dBut the first day of protests alone left more than 20 dead and hundreds wounded. Since then, one Israeli soldier has been killed by sniper fire. The Palestinian death toll has reached 185.The victims include two women and 32 children. Journalists. A double-amputee in a wheelchair. A young man who had a tire in his arms and was running away from the fence when he was shot in the back.And medics. A new friction point has opened up: A few dozen protesters have drifted about 200 yards north along the fence, past the point where a bunker on the Israeli side had loosely marked the protest\u2019s northern boundary.Some of the protesters begin tearing at the barbed-wire coils about 40 yards in front of the fence. Israeli soldiers quickly drive up and take defensive positions on the other side. They\u2019ve shot people for less. For now, they fire only a warning shot and more tear gas.Except for a visit to Egypt in 1997, at three days old, Ms. Najjar spent her life confined to the cramped Gaza Strip, mainly in Khuzaa, a tiny border village where nearly everyone is a Najjar \u2014 descended from refugees who fled in 1948 from Salamah, near Jaffa.Rouzan was precocious, entering kindergarten at 2, picking up English words and reciting poetry. And happy: Her mother, Sabreen, given to melancholy, recorded her laughing. \u201cShe would move worlds when she saw me sad,\u201d she said.But Rouzan was a daddy\u2019s girl. Her father, a lanky entrepreneur named Ashraf al-Najjar, spoiled her, when that was still possible. He worked in Israel for months at a stretch, buying appliances or furniture to sell in Gaza at four times what he paid. There was meat for dinner.\u201cTo be honest, I long for those days,\u201d he said.As a little girl, Rouzan reached for toy stethoscopes. Her father expected to send her overseas to study medicine someday.But then came the rockets, the blockade, the wars. No longer able to work in Israel, Mr. Najjar opened a motorcycle-repair shop. It was bulldozed by the Israeli army during the 2014 invasion. He went bankrupt and took handouts from siblings. Rouzan skipped school field trips to scrimp.Khuzaa was largely reduced to rubble in the war. Two of Rouzan\u2019s best friends were killed, one of them along with more than 20 of her relatives. She saw a cousin\u2019s body torn apart. The Najjars\u2019 home was damaged, the recordings of her laughter lost. When they returned from shelter, the dead and dying lay in the streets.Rouzan said she wanted to learn how to help.Opposite the Israeli bunker, Ms. Najjar rushes toward the fence to help a teenager, as Israeli soldiers look on. Someone behind her throws a rock at them, using her as cover. Two protesters are trapped near the barbed wire, lying on the ground.She and several other medics \u2014 among them her friends Rasha Qudeih and Rami Abo Jazar \u2014 make their way forward again to try to help. They raise their hands to show the Israelis they mean no harm.Two shots ring out overhead. Ms. Najjar waves at the soldiers, who are only about 50 yards away, not to shoot. But as she edges closer, another shot, much closer, kicks up the sand.A soldier emerges from behind a jeep, leveling his rifle. \u201cThe sniper is aiming at us!\u201d Ms. Qudeih yells.The medics turn and run, as a fresh barrage of tear gas descends on them. Ms. Najjar is the slowest to retreat.Nearly everyone who saw Ms. Najjar at the protests was struck by her readiness to place herself in harm\u2019s way. Again and again, there she was in video clips: the first to those in trouble, the last to safety.\u201cShe was reckless,\u201d said Eslam Okal, a trauma nurse from Rafah who volunteered at the Khuzaa protests after hearing about Ms. Najjar. \u201cI told her, \u2018Your first priority is safety.\u2019 We had many arguments over this. But her bravery won out.\u201dIn high school, she was the alpha of a clique of mildly rebellious teenagers who bridled at the dress code of their all-girls school: white scarf and hijab, dark trousers. Ms. Najjar wore bright colors and accepted the scoldings that followed.Other girls were quiet in class. But Ms. Najjar interrupted the teachers with questions, stood her ground when chastised and talked back constantly, though usually through a smile.How she became so fearless and outspoken is impossible to pin down, but several people who were close to her cited a traumatic experience when she was 15.During 10th-grade finals, Rouzan returned home to a tense situation in her family\u2019s four-story building. Her aunt, Nawal Qedayeh, whom Rouzan adored and who was seven months pregnant, was being treated like a pariah by Rouzan\u2019s paternal aunts and grandmother, who refused to let her use the communal kitchen. When Ms. Qedayeh was caught scrubbing pots there, a fight broke out, and Rouzan watched as her grandmother pushed Ms. Qedayeh down the stairs. Both she and the fetus she was carrying were killed.Rouzan, the only eyewitness, had a choice: She could stay silent, forgoing justice for her aunt\u2019s killing and following the social expectation for a young woman to leave weighty legal matters to the men. Or she could tell the truth and potentially send her grandmother to prison.Rouzan testified. Her grandmother was convicted of accidental manslaughter and spent more than a year in prison.Nisreen Abu Ishaq, Rouzan\u2019s high school religion teacher, said the ordeal made her \u201cstronger and more daring.\u201d After that, said Suzan Mahdi al-Reqeb, a school administrator, \u201cnothing stood in her way.\u201dGaza CityMediterraneanSeaGAZAWESTBANKKhuzaaJerusalemAreaof detailISRAELISRAELEGYPTBy The New York TimesMoney did. Knowing she couldn\u2019t afford college dejected her. She had also failed part of the entrance exams. Yet she scarcely gave up.\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe stomped her feet and said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to waste years waiting for things to get better \u2014 I\u2019ll find another way.\u2019\u201dShe began taking basic first aid courses and discovered that she could simply \u201cforget\u201d to pay the fees: \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d she told a friend who almost paid $5 in tuition.She hung around emergency rooms, running errands, observing surgery, pretending to belong until the staff realized she didn\u2019t. When Seif Abdel Ghafour rushed his dying uncle to Nasser Hospital, he was bewildered by the place until Ms. Najjar led them where they needed to go. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she treated us like we were her brothers.\u201dThe protests would let her test her skills. When the Health Ministry made about 200 volunteer medics take a written exam, Ms. Najjar scored 91, the highest in her group. She was given an identification card, lab coat and white-and-pink paramedic\u2019s vest.She wore them like armor.To the north, past the bunker, at least two protesters throw homemade firebombs at the Israelis. No damage is done, but it\u2019s a significant escalation from slinging rocks. Ms. Najjar is recovering from the tear gas she inhaled. Nearby, protesters start cutting away a new section of barbed wire.Suddenly, there\u2019s a rifle shot. A young man in the group to the north is hit in the leg.That is where Israeli forces are instructed to aim, a tactic, Israeli officials say, intended to minimize fatalities. But they fire a heavy battlefield round, one meant for targets hundreds of yards away. At 100 yards, ballistics experts say, a missed shot could bounce like a skimming stone. \u201cIf I missed, and it will hit a rock, I don\u2019t know where the bullet will go,\u201d a senior Israeli commander says.Nearly every protester in Khuzaa has at least one story of Ms. Najjar coming to his rescue. Some have many.When Mahmoud Abu Shab, 26, a kafiyeh-wearing rock thrower, was shot through the hand in March, she stanched the bleeding. One day in April, when he failed to get out of the way of a stretch of barbed wire being dragged from the fence, she bandaged his wounds.He didn\u2019t know that she had bought the medical supplies herself. She was collecting a shekel a day from a group of supportive young women. She even sold off a gold ring to buy supplies.\u201cShe wanted to always be at the fence, to be a daughter of men,\u201d said Nada al-Laham, another volunteer, using an expression for a woman driven by a strong sense of national identity.Her father said he urged her to take a day off: \u201cShe\u2019d say, \u2018No, Baba, there are people who need me.\u2019\u201dHer mother visited the protests, but said their chats ended abruptly: \u201cSuddenly there would be a wounded protester, and she\u2019d just stop talking and say, \u2018I have to go, there\u2019s someone I need to save.\u2019\u201dMs. Najjar saw her role as part of the Palestinian struggle as much as those burning tires or wielding wire cutters. She became a practiced spokeswoman, never refusing an interview request, not always waiting to be asked.Her Facebook posts could be florid. She once wrote that her bloodstained uniform carried the \u201csweetest perfume.\u201dThe protests became Gaza\u2019s biggest social event. Matches were made, engagements announced almost every day. Young men and their parents paraded through the Najjars\u2019 home seeking betrothal to the now-famous Rouzan. \u201cTen or 12 just during Ramadan,\u201d her father said.She turned them all down, he said: \u201cShe had her own goals in mind.\u201dAfter the protests ended, she planned to retake and ace the college-admission tests. Somehow, she would find her way to nursing school.Ms. Abu Moustafa is concerned. The Israelis often shoot at the rope pullers, she says. She urges Ms. Najjar to leave.The rope pullers finally make off with a small coil of barbed wire. Much of the crowd follows. The clamor around the two women subsides.As the protests took on a sense of permanence, Ms. Najjar\u2019s bravado became alloyed with increasingly frequent allusions to her possible demise.\u201cWhen my life finishes, make me a sweet memory for those who know me,\u201d she wrote on Facebook on May 5.\u201cThey said to me, \u2018Bend a little, as the bullet is on its way to you,\u2019\u201d she wrote later. \u201cI said to them, \u2018The bullet chose me because I do not know how to bend, so why should I change my way?\u2019\u201dShe texted one friend an apology in case one of them was martyred.\u201cSay a nice prayer for my memory,\u201d she told another on May 24.Her parents said such morbid talk was uncharacteristic. While many in Gaza speak of death as preferable to the here-and-now, Ms. Najjar \u201cclung to life,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe never wanted to be a martyr. She loved life.\u201dOne of her happiest days ever, friends said, was Tuesday, May 29. She cashed a $100 check \u2014 a one-time gift to each member of her team of medics, the Palestine Medical Rescue Service, from its overseers in the West Bank \u2014 and joined colleagues on a small boat that left the Gaza City marina, hoping to catch up to a flotilla that was challenging the blockade.They were on the water nearly three hours under the brilliant Mediterranean sun before being turned back by an Israeli gunboat.\u201cI said I hoped we wouldn\u2019t get hit,\u201d said Mr. Abdel Ghafour, the man she had helped at the hospital and who had since befriended her. \u201cShe said, \u2018So be it! We die as friends.\u2019\u201dSunset is coming and with it, the end of the fast. Things seem to be quieting down at the fence.An Israeli soldier looking across at where Ms. Najjar stands now might see a man waving a Palestinian flag aloft, a few straggling protesters ambling around, and a cluster of medics helping a protester on the ground recover from tear gas. No one in the area is doing anything menacing. The tear gas is doing what it is meant to: making the use of lethal force unnecessary.Suddenly, there is another gunshot.Mohammed Shafee, a medic, sees things \u201cfly into my body.\u201d He\u2019s sprayed in the chest by small bullet fragments.Mr. Abo Jazar perceives an explosion on the ground, then screams in pain. He\u2019s grazed in the thigh. Behind them, Ms. Najjar reaches for her back, then crumples.  As Ms. Abu Moustafa looks on in shock, Ms. Najjar is picked up by protesters she had treated just a few minutes ago. As they carry her off, blood pours from her chest.Three medics down, all from one bullet. It seemed improbable.It was fired from a sand berm used by Israeli snipers at least 120 yards from where the medics fell.The Israeli military\u2019s rules of engagement are classified. But a spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, said that snipers may shoot only at people posing a violent threat, like \u201ccutting the fence, throwing grenades.\u201dTo deliberately shoot a medic, or any civilian, is a war crime. Israel quickly conceded that Ms. Najjar\u2019s killing was unintended.\u201cShe was not the target,\u201d Colonel Conricus said. \u201cNone of the medical personnel are ever a target.\u201dBut no Israeli soldiers reported accidental shootings. After-action reports said snipers aimed at four men that day and hit them all, the army said.The Times found the first, third and fourth of those protesters, each shot in the leg exactly when and how the army said they were. But The Times could not corroborate the army\u2019s description of the second person it said was shot, which matched the time Ms. Najjar was killed.The army said it was a man in a yellow shirt who was throwing stones and pulling at the fence. But the only man in a yellow shirt anywhere near the line of fire was not doing that or much of anything else, The Times found. He stood about 120 yards from the fence and posed no threat.Even if the man was a legitimate target, there remains the question of the medics standing behind him.Prof. Ryan Goodman, a New York University expert on the laws of war, who was a special counsel to the Pentagon on war crimes and targeting rules, said the key to whether a war crime was committed was whether the sniper was aware of a high risk that civilians would be harmed.\u201cThe laws of war would not want any military personnel to deliberately fire in the direction of the medics,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s close to the line. I\u2019m saying it crosses the line.\u201dA senior Israeli commander told The Times in August that 60 to 70 other Gaza protesters had been killed unintentionally, around half the total killed at that point.Yet the Israeli army\u2019s rules of engagement remain unchanged, the military says.That alone may constitute a separate violation of international humanitarian law, experts say: After enough civilians have died, commanders have a duty to make changes to ensure that they aren\u2019t needlessly targeted.\u201cYou lose the right to say, \u2018Oops,\u2019\u201d said Noam Lubell, a professor of the law of armed conflict at the University of Essex.Colonel Conricus said that not all those killed unintentionally had been shot unintentionally. Sometimes soldiers had aimed at the legs of people they considered to be legitimate targets, he said, but killed them instead of wounding them.Israel considers members of Hamas fair game whether they are armed or not, an interpretation of international law that is not universally accepted.Colonel Conricus also said the rules of engagement were merely an upper limit on the use of force, and that the army was doing other things, such as training troops when they are first assigned to the fence, to curb civilian casualties.Israeli military lawyers conceded there had been some misconduct but said that no soldiers were suspected of intentionally killing anyone they knew they shouldn\u2019t have.On Oct. 29, nearly five months after she was killed, Israel\u2019s military advocate general began a criminal investigation of Ms. Najjar\u2019s death.But the senior commander told The Times in August that no recordings of the shooting from the Israeli side existed. He had no idea exactly when Ms. Najjar had been shot. He learned that from The Times.Israel seems content to say that protecting its border is a messy business. \u201cUnfortunately, yes,\u201d said Colonel Conricus, \u201cin a situation like that, accidents happen, and unintended results happen.\u201dAn ambulance races Ms. Najjar to a triage tent, where she is deposited in the \u201cred zone\u201d for trauma cases.She had wanted so badly to belong here that she used to visit the tent often, even when she was not escorting patients. Now, the professionals crowd around frantically trying to save her. The doctor who intubates her is the same one who administered the Health Ministry exam she aced back in April.\u201cWhy kill her?\u201d cries her shattered father. \u201cShe was an angel of mercy.\u201dReporting was contributed by Yousur Al-Hlou, Malachy Browne, Iyad Abuheweila and Neil Collier from Khuzaa; Ibrahim El-Mughrabi from Gaza City, and John Woo from New York.Advertisement"}

Now, they have found themselves in the center of a perilous geopolitical battle, Canadian pawns in a larger contest between two of the world\u2019s biggest superpowers, China and the United States.On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said their detainment was unacceptable, and warned that Canada was getting ensnared in a dust-up between the United States and China.She is awaiting an extradition hearing.Senior Canadian officials said Canada\u2019s ambassador to China, John McCallum, had been granted access to Mr. Kovrig on Friday.They said the aim of the \u201cconsular visit\u201d was to assess the well-being of a Canadian citizen, clarify the nature of the detention and provide a communication link with his family. They declined to comment on Mr. Kovrig\u2019s condition or whereabouts.Canada\u2019s foreign ministry said it was pressing Chinese authorities for access to Mr. Spavor.On Friday, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan held talks in Washington with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis, including a discussion on securing the release of the two Canadians.Michael Kovrig, a native of Toronto who was living in Hong Kong at the time of his detainment, was working as a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization.A former Canadian diplomat, he had taken a leave from the ministry two years ago, and no longer enjoyed diplomatic immunity.Friends called him an affable \u201cnerd,\u201d and said he loved swing and ballroom dancing. A former journalist, he spoke Mandarin and Hungarian, noting on his LinkedIn page that he had \u201cworked in 20 countries and traveled through more than 50.\u201dBut his line of work also made him vulnerable, experts on China said.Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China who was Mr. Kovrig\u2019s boss when he was first secretary at the embassy in Beijing, said Mr. Kovrig\u2019s job had involved gathering information on sensitive subjects, like Taiwan and minority groups, subjects that would have attracted the scrutiny of the Chinese authorities.\u201cThe Chinese would\u2019ve been waiting for the right moment to spring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Meng case provided them the perfect opportunity.\u201dHe said Mr. Kovrig was likely being subjected to psychological pressure, detained in a room with the lights left on 24 hours a day. He said China\u2019s accusation that the crisis group was operating illegally in China could be a precursor to filing espionage charges.Joanna Chiu, deputy bureau chief in Vancouver for The Toronto Star and a friend of Mr. Kovrig, said that, as a foreigner and former high-level diplomat, he would have been aware that he was being monitored, but that he was not the paranoid type.\u201cWorking in China you just assume everything can be accessed by the Chinese government,\u201d she said, noting that Mr. Kovrig was about six feet tall, and stood out in China.He stressed that Mr. Kovrig had nothing whatsoever to do with the Huawei case. He said Mr. Kovrig frequently traveled to Beijing and was a regular guest on Chinese media.\u201cWe are very worried for his well-being and his security,\u201d he said.Michael Spavor, the other detained Canadian, is a daring adventurer known for his high-level contacts in North Korea.He had also lived in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, teaching at a school run by a Canadian nongovernmental organization.Yet in his Reuters interview he characterized his involvement in the country as outside the parameters of politics.\u201cFor me, encouraging these sports engagement events, these nonpolitical friendship interactions, promoting these kind of events can show people that Americans and Koreans can get along very well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "9 Idyllic (and Newly Reopened) Caribbean Hotels to Visit Next Year", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing extensive renovations, some of the region\u2019s most beloved resorts are now more enticing than ever.By the time last year\u2019s brutal hurricane season ended in the Caribbean, several resorts in the region \u2014 particularly on St. Barts, Anguilla, the British and United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico \u2014 were devastated. Collectively, the area suffered over $140 billion in damage, and tourism, the region\u2019s main economic driving force, nose-dived. Buildings were flattened and basic services upended; on Anguilla, for instance, 90 percent of the electricity infrastructure was impaired, as was the main water supply. Just over a year later, though, almost all of the hotels in the affected regions have reopened, many with massive renovations and improvements that should draw crowds this holiday season \u2014 and help restore local economies. Here, a rundown of some of the most notable comebacks in the islands.Located on a wild, forested corner of tiny Dominica, in the West Indies, this secluded resort has been fully restored by its owner, Gregor Nassief, who reopened the property on Nov. 1. The six existing one-bedroom villas are now joined by a new two-storey one-bedroom villa that Nassief has named Ti-Fey: a treehouse of sorts made of polished, sustainably sourced Guyanese greenheart wood. It\u2019s set high above the ground amid the jungle vegetation and offers a view of the crashing surf below through floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Nassief has also added a new seafood restaurant \u2014 which serves grilled lobster and fish caught in the surrounding waters \u2014 as well as a yoga pavilion that offers small classes and spa treatments.After a year of renovations, the serene hillside Hotel Le Toiny reopened in October on its perch at the rugged eastern end of St. Barts. New additions include eight free-standing one- and two-bedroom villas overlooking the undeveloped expanse of Toiny Bay, which join the 14 existing ones, as well as a new infinity pool and bar \u2014 a literal beach club where the tables and chairs sit directly on the sand, steps from the water. The hotel has also recruited the chef Jarad McCarroll, who previously worked at the Michelin-starred restaurant Ours in London, to oversee its French-inflected namesake restaurant.After almost a year of rebuilding, the majestic cliffside Malliouhana resort reopens this month on the shore of Meads Bay in Anguilla. New cabanas line the two-tiered main pool, which now extends toward the cliff\u2019s edge for even better views of the Caribbean. Next spring, 11 beachfront suites will be added \u2014 all accented in the hotel\u2019s signature palette of lemon yellow and turquoise \u2014 plus an upgraded spa with an ocean-view infinity pool. And for guests desiring extra privacy, there will be a new two-bedroom villa on the secluded Turtle Cove Beach, featuring a garden patio, plunge pool, whimsical paintings by the Haitian artist Jasmin Joseph and seashell chandeliers.An earlier version of this article misidentified the interior designer of the Cheval Blanc hotel; he is Jacques Grange, not Jacques Garcia. The article also misstated when some areas of the Malliouhana resort are scheduled to open. The beachfront suites, spa and two-bedroom villa will open next spring, not this month. In addition, the article referred incorrectly to the hotel's garden suites; they are part of the 11 beachfront suites, not separate from them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ofo, Pioneer of China\u2019s Bike-Sharing Boom, Is in a Crisis", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Brilliantly simple, emission-free solution to the problem of urban congestion? Or the maddening height of venture-backed technology hubris? Now, one of China\u2019s leading bike start-ups, Ofo, is facing serious financial problems. Its founder is on a government blacklist for unpaid bills. Millions of riders who placed deposits are demanding their money back. And the business model used by many of China\u2019s tech firms \u2014 spend furiously to acquire new users, worry about profits later \u2014 is showing its limits.The run of Ofo customers seeking refunds appears to have started last week. Doubts about the company\u2019s financial health had swirled for months. People said on social media they were unable to get refunds on deposits of $15 to $30, which they put down to rent Ofo\u2019s bumblebee-yellow bikes. (The company\u2019s Chinese nickname translates as \u201cLittle Yellow Bike.\u201d)The post touched off outrage about the apparent differences in the way the company was treating Chinese people and foreigners. It also set off a rush among other Ofo users seeking refunds.\u201cOfo\u2019s user base is large, so there is a possibility that the number of applications for deposit refunds will soar,\u201d the company said late Monday in a statement posted on Weibo. \u201cPlease be patient. We promise that deposits will be refunded according to the proper procedures. To all users, please don\u2019t worry!\u201dThe statement appears only to have made people worry more.Many customers used the Ofo app to apply for refunds and joined a queue that had climbed to nearly 12 million people by Thursday. In an email to employees on Wednesday, Ofo\u2019s founder, Dai Wei, acknowledged that the company had been under financial strain all year.Hundreds of people have also shown up at Ofo\u2019s Beijing headquarters this week. On Thursday, the company\u2019s fifth-floor office was filled with police officers and shouting customers. Two women were crying. Zhang Wei, a migrant worker, had come to the office on Monday seeking a refund and had left without it, missing a day of work in the process. Mr. Zhang, 27, showed up again Thursday morning and wound up angrily kicking an Ofo employee. After being taken to the local police station and released, he returned to the Ofo office. He finally managed to convince an employee to transfer him the amount he had put down, around $30.By then, he had spent a total of around $15 to travel to and from Ofo\u2019s offices by subway and taxi. But he said it was worth it. \u201cIt was never about the money,\u201d he said. \u201cI just needed to vent.\u201dLiu Jingyi, a student from the northern city of Xi\u2019an, had forgotten about her Ofo deposit until she saw people talking about it on Weibo last month. Ms. Liu, 23, said she was not optimistic that she would get her money back. \u201cLook at how many shared bikes there are now,\u201d she said. \u201cI always felt that these cash-burning business models would have to end sooner or later.\u201d When the history of the current go-go era in China\u2019s tech industry is written, Ofo\u2019s rise and fall may serve as a useful parable. In bike rentals, ride hailing, food delivery and more, a good business idea attracts a swarm of copycats. Cutthroat competition ensues. Many companies and investors get burned. Mr. Dai founded Ofo in 2014 while studying at Peking University. Cities like New York, London and Paris had long had programs for renting bicycles for short time periods. But those programs required riders to return the bikes to docks fixed to the ground. Ofo and another Beijing start-up, Mobike, realized that by equipping bikes with GPS and digital locks, commuters could use their phones to rent bikes, freeing them from fixed docks. That would keep bikes circulating, and available wherever people needed them.Financial pressure started building as well. As long as new riders kept signing up, cash kept flowing in the form of deposits. But it has been expensive for the companies to replace damaged stock, and to hire workers to haul bikes all day from low- to high-demand locations.Ofo\u2019s bikes still have their fans in China. Bi Wenwen, a 38-year-old entrepreneur in Shanghai, applied for a deposit refund in November. She does not expect to receive it, but she said she would still use Ofo in the meantime.\u201cIt provides a lot of convenience,\u201d Ms. Bi said.Wang Jinzhi applied for a refund from Ofo two weeks ago. But he has already lost all confidence in the sharing economy. Mr. Wang, a 28-year-old financial analyst in Beijing, lost the $500 deposit he paid a high-end car-sharing company after the company folded.

A Lawmaker Calls It Unscrupulous.", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRICHMOND, British Columbia \u2014 Melody Bai arrived in Vancouver from China in the late stages of pregnancy with one goal: to give birth to a Canadian baby.Awaiting her was an elaborate ecosystem catering to pregnant women from China, including a spacious \u201cbaby house\u201d where she spent four months, attended to by a Mandarin-speaking housekeeper.Caregivers offered free breast massages to promote lactation, outings to the mall, lectures on childbirth with other Chinese mothers-to-be and excursions for high tea.\u201cIt\u2019s an investment in my child\u2019s education,\u201d Ms. Bai, a 28-year-old flight attendant, said by phone from Shanghai, months after returning to China with her newborn and passport in hand. \u201cWe chose Canada because of its better natural and social environment.\u201dMs. Bai is part of a growing phenomenon in Canada known as birth tourism, which is not only generating political opposition, but mobilizing self-appointed vigilantes determined to stop it.It is perfectly legal.The practice underlines how Canada, and British Columbia in particular, has become a favored haven for well-heeled Chinese seeking a refuge for wealth and kin away from authoritarian China.Mr. Griffith argues that Canada intended birthright citizenship for those who wanted to live in and contribute to the country. \u201cSince those engaging in birth tourism have no or barely any real link to Canada,\u201d he said, \u201cthe practice is challenging a very Canadian value of fair play.\u201dWith its sprawling Chinese food markets, Chinese-language newspapers and large number of caregivers speaking Mandarin, Richmond has become ground zero for birth tourists from China.About two dozen baby houses are in operation. Visits to about 15 addresses showed that some operate openly while others work under licenses as tour agencies or present themselves as holiday rentals. Some are in homes. Others are in apartments. Many are booked through agents and brokers in China.In a visit to one, the Baoma Inn, a modern house across from a park, a woman in the late stages of pregnancy could be seen in a second-floor window. A young man who answered the door confirmed that the inn was a baby house before another angrily slammed the door.But during a telephone call in Mandarin inquiring about the Inn\u2019s services, a man said it offered a one-stop package including \u201cguaranteed appointments\u201d with \u201cthe No. 1 obstetrician in British Columbia,\u201d who spoke Mandarin and had \u201ca zero accident rate.\u201dCustomers usually stay for three months, he said, including one month after the birth, to allow time to apply for a passport for the newborn and to recuperate, as is the Chinese custom.He added that his agency had seven sales offices in China. The bill for a three-month stay at a two-bedroom apartment, not including meals and prenatal care, is about 25,000 Canadian dollars ($18,331).\u201cThe women all go back to China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t enjoy any social benefits from the Canadian government and don\u2019t need it.\u201dBob Huang, who with his wife runs Anxin Labour Service, a birthing center in the nearby city of Burnaby, said he was frequently contacted by agents in China who wanted a 50 percent commission on every successful referral. He said he preferred to post his own ads on local Chinese classifieds websites.Some Richmond residents say birth tourism is undermining the community\u2019s social fabric.On a recent morning, she received an anonymous tip on Facebook that as many as 20 pregnant \u201cbirth tourists\u201d from China were being housed in a nearby modernist high rise.Ms. Starchuk complains that birth tourists bump local mothers from maternity wards, a concern echoed by some local nurses, and get access to public services without paying taxes.The issue has become conflated with resentment in the Vancouver area against soaring housing prices, which some residents blame on an influx of wealthy Chinese.But Ms. Bai, who had her baby in Vancouver in February, said that given the hefty price she had paid to give birth here \u2014 60,000 Canadian dollars, including housing and hospitalization \u2014 she was subsidizing the Canadian health care system and contributing to the local economy.\u201cMy child won\u2019t be enjoying any Canadian health benefits, as we are living in China,\u201d she said.Since her son is Canadian, however, she and her husband, a pilot, could save about 150,000 Canadian dollars on tuition fees at an international school in Shanghai.After gaining fluency in English and Western culture, her son could also later attend a Canadian university at the discounted local rate. Eventually, the entire family could emigrate to Canada.Some first- and second-generation immigrants oppose birth tourists for jumping the queue.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is fair to come here, give birth and leave,\u201d said Wendy Liu, a Richmond resident of 11 years, adding that she had been repeatedly harassed after Ms. Starchuk mistakenly put her house on a list of birth tourism centers.A nonresident, Yan Xia, gave birth there, racked up a bill of 312,595 Canadian dollars in maternity and neonatal care for her newborn because of complications, and then absconded without paying the bill, according to a civil claim the hospital filed at British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court in April, six years after Ms. Xia gave birth.Including six years\u2019 worth of interest, Ms. Xia\u2019s bill would amount to about 1.2 million Canadian dollars.Daisy Xiong contributed reporting from Vancouver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Markets Are Wild, but Bond Markets Can Be Dangerous", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sell-off in stocks isn\u2019t the only ominous economic sign emanating from financial markets. The bond markets, much more closely linked to the actual economy, are also flashing a warning.Ask someone how \u201cthe Dow\u201d is doing and, even if they don\u2019t know the answer, they\u2019ll know what you\u2019re talking about. Ask them about the bond market and you\u2019ll most likely get a blank stare.When it comes to the economy, however, bonds are far more important than stocks. Bond markets dictate the cost of borrowing money, and that can determine actual economic activity. The decision by a C.E.O. to build a plant or take the plunge on a new product is often decided by how much it will cost to borrow the money to pay for it. When that payment climbs too high, corporate activity slows, and so does the economy. Lately, borrowing costs have been rising quickly. Investors worried about corporate debt loads and the impact of a potential slowdown on profits are demanding companies pay them higher interest rates. And, in a recent troubling sign for the economy, fewer companies have been turning to the bond market to finance their businesses.As with the swooning stock market, weakness in the bond market doesn\u2019t mean the economy is destined for an immediate downturn. But signals being sent by bond investors will almost certainly arise in discussions among policymakers at this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on monetary policy, which will culminate on Wednesday with a decision on interest rates. Here\u2019s what you need to know.Like any borrower, a company raising capital in the bond markets pays interest. What they pay depends on how likely it is that a lender will get repaid. Consumers have credit scores. Companies have debt ratings. The greater the risk that a borrower won\u2019t be able to pay up \u2014 known as credit risk \u2014 the higher the interest rates. American Treasury bonds almost always have the lowest interest rates. That\u2019s because lending to the United States government \u2014 which has a virtually unblemished record of repaying creditors \u2014 is considered pretty much the safest investment on earth.Everyone else, even the most powerful, cash-rich corporations, must pay more. For example, Home Depot went to the bond market late last month, raising $1 billion by selling 10-year bonds. At the time, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 the federal government\u2019s cost to borrow for 10 years \u2014 was about 3.06 percent. Home Depot, considered a safe or \u201cinvestment grade\u201d borrower \u2014 paid an interest rate of almost 4 percent to borrow for 10 years. The difference between the low interest rate that the government pays and the higher rate of another borrower is called the credit spread. Riskier borrowers typically have larger spreads. Bankers who arrange bond issues for companies set the interest rate by looking at where the company\u2019s other bonds are trading and assessing the demand for the new bond.A higher credit spread can also reflect investors\u2019 concerns about things like the broader economy and the future ability of any company to pay money back. In recessions, for example, they rise for even the healthiest companies.\u201cAs the credit spread goes up, lenders are saying, \u2018We\u2019re really worried about making loans, riskier than lending to the government,\u2019\u201d said Philip Bond, a professor of finance at the University of Washington.Since early October, credit spreads have increased fast.Borrowers with investment-grade debt ratings (essentially higher credit scores) are paying more than 1.4 percentage points above Treasurys to borrow, up from less than 1 percentage point at the start of the year. Spreads on junk bonds, issued by companies that are considered significantly less creditworthy, have risen even more, from around 3.2 percentage points at the start of the year to more than 4.5 percentage points now, according to FactSet.The sudden increase \u2014\u00a0\u201cwidening\u201d in the bond market\u2019s lingo \u2014\u00a0is telling us that investors are suddenly more nervous about handing over their cash to corporations. The same change in sentiment is playing out in the stock market and the reasons are largely the same. A trade war that has no end, signs of a slowing world economy and a widely expected deceleration in growth the United States have all pushed investors to take less risk. At the same time, the Fed is slowly removing the helping hand it has extended to markets and the economy for the last decade, by raising rates and shrinking the stockpile of bonds it owns. Recent drops in oil prices are also making investors less willing to place their money with the smaller energy companies that tend to borrow in junk-bond markets.While the stock market sell-off may eventually affect sentiment among consumers and corporate executives, bond market moves can have an immediate impact on the economy by discouraging borrowing and investment. It is true that borrowing costs are still very low by historical standards, because the Fed only just began to step back from its post-crisis programs to keep them that way. But one concern among investors is that this effort to hold down costs encouraged borrowing to a point that could be problematic in a downturn. Netflix has gone from having very little debt in 2010 to having more than $10 billion now. Verizon now has $113 billion of debt, more than double the amount it had six years ago. By one measure, the ratio of corporate debt to G.D.P., the total level of borrowing is at all-time highs.In general, higher debt levels could make it tougher for companies to repay the lenders if there\u2019s a slump in the economy, or a hiccup in sales, or a decline in the value of assets.That turmoil didn\u2019t lead to a full-blown recession. But it did coincide with what some economists, including those at JPMorgan Chase, now call a \u201cmini recession\u201d between 2015 and 2016, in which industrial spending by companies in the manufacturing sector slowed sharply and dragged on growth.And with the American economy already expected to slow in 2019, the climbing costs of corporate borrowing could determine whether any slowdown turns into something much worse.Advertisement"}

These newsmakers \u2014 whether they sought media attention or a spotlight was cast on them because of a news event \u2014 are among the most memorable people we met in 2018. Brooke is a sophomore now. She still lives in \u2014 and loves \u2014 Parkland. Though she was not among the students who immediately became activists, she has recently written op-ed pieces about school safety and gun laws, and in October she spoke at a Democratic Party event in Colorado. In one of her speeches, she explained why she is now so outspoken: \u201cI\u2019ve told anyone I can my story. For me, talking about it, sharing it, waking people up, has been the best therapy.\u201d \u2014 JACK HEALYJames Shaw Jr. was memorable because he did not want to be.Four people died. Officials believe the toll could have been far worse if not for Mr. Shaw.After the shooting, the electrician, who turned 30 Friday, helped raise more than $240,000 for victims.But now he\u2019s in the spotlight. Next year, he might run for mayor.\u2014 ALAN BLINDERSarah Zorn can do more than 70 push-ups in two minutes. She holds black belts in three karate disciplines.In 1995, the first woman to gain full admission to the Citadel, Shannon Faulkner, walked onto its Charleston, S.C., campus escorted by federal marshals. The Citadel community was, to put it mildly, not ready to accept a woman in its ranks. Ms. Faulkner was subjected to death threats and sexist slurs as she fought in the courts for the right to enroll in the public school.But Ms. Faulkner was also not ready for the Citadel. She suffered in the torrid heat during her first grueling day of training, and dropped out a week later. That fueled the argument, in some quarters, that the Citadel was no place for women.Of course, they were wrong \u2014 demonstrably so, thanks to Ms. Zorn, and measurably.\u2014 RICHARD FAUSSETWilfred Jones met me on a cold winter day in a part of San Juan County, Utah, that sits within the Navajo Nation. Days before, a federal judge had ruled that officials had been illegally diluting the Native American vote for decades, a decision that meant Navajo people might win two of three county commission seats.\u2014 JULIE TURKEWITZTraveling from story to story, I see my share of fresh tragedy and raw pain. But from wherever I report, whether in this country\u2019s most sprawling cities or most remote towns, I find people like Ms. White who are doing the quiet work of putting things back together.Happily, it sounds like normalcy is returning to Oklahoma. When I spoke to Ms. White this month, she said the grass had come back, her cattle had returned to once-blackened pastures and workers were replacing the final section of the roughly 15 miles of perimeter fencing that she lost in the fire.\u201cExcept for the burned trees,\u201d she said, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t think anything happened.\u201d \u2014 MITCH SMITHThe early details were grim enough.It is impossible to fathom what it means to have three generations wiped out. Tia Coleman lost her husband, her three children, four in-laws and a nephew. How do you start over after something like that? How do you even want to continue to live?A reporter asked Ms. Coleman if she was happy she made it out alive.\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d she said. \u2014 JOHN ELIGONThen Mr. Bearden returned to the patch of land he calls home. His food had spoiled. His camper was mostly wrecked. Drinking water was scarce. Mr. Bearden, a military veteran with prostate cancer, seemed resigned to his fate. He became a symbol of the struggling people who are so often forgotten in the aftermath of a natural disaster.The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles has tried to contact Mr. Bearden to sort out his license. But he does not have a phone, and the agency has been unable to help him.The manager of the R.V. park, though, said this month that Mr. Bearden is still there, still in Panacea, and like the rest of the Panhandle, still holding on.\u2014 PATRICIA MAZZEIIn April, after working with genealogists to identify a perpetrator through distant relatives, the police in Sacramento arrested Joseph DeAngelo, who had been living quietly for years in a tidy suburb. They charged him as the so-called Golden State Killer, who had terrorized communities up and down California in the 1970s and 1980s.While it was an ensemble act, Mr. Holes, an investigator with the Contra Costa County district attorney\u2019s office, is credited with cracking the case. And he has not gone quietly into retirement. The fame he earned from solving the case has turned him into a media star. He recently inked a deal with the television network Oxygen to produce true crime documentary shows. \u2014 TIM ARANGOIn the early 1990s, Mr. Fields pleaded guilty, but served no time, for his role as a drug courier, a minor player in a kingpin\u2019s empire. He moved to the Detroit suburbs, married a doctor, earned a decent living, volunteered in his community. But he is hardly a free man. With a felony on his record, career paths are closed off; he can\u2019t even coach his son\u2019s Little League team. He began seeking a pardon years ago, unaware that he was living in an historically pardon-stingy stretch of presidential administrations. Listening to the disheartened but thoughtful Mr. Fields, his fate resting on the whims of various presidents, was a sober reminder: News as daily spectator sport is a luxury, for those lucky enough to be mere spectators. \u2014 CAMPBELL ROBERTSONNow a 17-year-old junior, Rome knows he could have been killed or paralyzed by that one bullet, but he does not want the shooting to be what defines his life. He\u2019s still a pitcher on the varsity baseball team and has a verbal commitment to attend and play baseball for the University of Houston after he graduates in 2020.He barely notices the scar below his left ear.\u201cIt brought me down for just about a week, and then I just battled through it,\u201d Rome said. \u2014 MANNY FERNANDEZFor decades, Rabbi Daniel Wasserman has led Pittsburgh\u2019s Orthodox chevra kadisha, a Jewish burial society that guards and ritually prepares bodies after death. Traditionally, members of the burial society do not speak about what they see, instead working anonymously.\u201cThank God, you move forward, other lives move forward\u201d he said. \u201cThere are births and bar mitzvahs, marriages and funerals,\u201d of the routine sort, far different from the ones that gripped his community in October. \u2014 JENNIFER MEDINAHe put out a message that people \u2014 not big money \u2014 should fuel politics. Mr. Phillips, who owns a chain of coffee shops and is heir to the Phillips liquor fortune, refused to accept political action committee money of any sort. He won his race, and so far remains committed to not accepting special interest money.\u201cI think I\u2019m the only member of Congress who took it that far,\u201d he said. \u2014 FARAH STOCKMANMs. Saunders, 89, struck me as a symbol of both the hardiness and the exhaustion of Californians during a year when the world around them felt so precarious. Ms. Saunders, an actor in the 1950s and 1960s who had bit parts in several movies, now lives with a couple who took her in after the mobile home she rented was destroyed. She attributes her survival to her faith and the prayers she said in the car as it drove through tunnels of flames. \u2014 THOMAS FULLERHe was unable to cement two big projects on his final-year bucket list: a high-speed rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles and twin water tunnels in the Sacramento Delta. And the housing crisis has only grown worse in this last year, and will be handed off to his successor, his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom.Still, Mr. Brown is leaving with high marks from the public. California\u2019s economy is humming, and Mr. Newsom will inherit a huge budget surplus, compared to the deficit Mr. Brown found eight years ago. He has emerged as a leader in the fight against climate change and President Trump. And now, Mr. Brown is off to his family ranch in the hills of Northern California.\u2014 ADAM NAGOURNEYBrandie Wilson runs the Humboldt Area Center for Harm Reduction in Eureka, Calif, which provides a needle exchange program and health referrals for people struggling with addiction. When we met in March, she had already become a lightning rod in the community, a rural town along the Redwood Highway wrestling with a severe addiction crisis. Many of the area\u2019s most vulnerable people counted on her for support and guidance. The story \u201creally demanded that our community talk about this and talk about it in a real, ongoing, and sustainable way,\u201d she recently said. \u201cThere were a lot of people in our community who said, \u2018Thank you for saying what you said.\u2019\u201d \u2014 JOSE A. DEL REALDr. Novembre, a professor at the University of Chicago, told me that he worried about drawing attention to how his field\u2019s work is being misappropriated. Little is known about the genetic underpinnings of intelligence and behavior, much less how varying environments and cultures may have influenced them. \u201cBut I also worry about not talking about it,\u201d he said. \u2014 AMY HARMONScot Peterson, an armed sheriff\u2019s deputy in Parkland, Fla., who failed to rush inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a gunman fired upon students, was named the Coward of Broward and quickly became the fall guy for one of the nation\u2019s worst school shootings. But 10 months later, it is clear that many other mistakes may have contributed to the massacre.\u2014 RICHARD OPPEL JR.Each morning, Igor Gavrish walks through three locked doors and scans his iris twice to get into the Boston University laboratory where he works. While the authorities have decided the 24-year-old Russian immigrant can be trusted to work with some of the world\u2019s deadliest viruses, he cannot pass a background check to enlist in the United States Army.He may eventually be deported to Russia, where he could be punished for trying to join the Army. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to go back,\u201d he said. \u2014 DAVE PHILIPPSAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Adds 155,000 Jobs in November as Hiring Slows Modestly", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u25a0 155,000 jobs were added last month. Economists had expected a gain of about 190,000. The monthly average for September, October and November was 170,000.\u25a0 The unemployment rate remained 3.7 percent.\u25a0 Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent after growing by 0.2 percent in October. The year-over-year gain remained 3.1 percent.After a week when the stock market suffered from motion sickness and presidential tweets caused trade tensions to flare, a weaker-than-expected jobs report may have disappointed some quarters. But faulty forecasts do not mean that the labor market has suddenly stalled. For the 98th month in a row, employers increased payrolls, and monthly job gains are still averaging above 200,000 this year.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an economy that is well in expansion mode but that is coming off the boil after a strong second and third quarter,\u201d said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management. \u201cSo the state of the job market is good. It\u2019s just that the pace of job creation is slowing a little bit.\u201dYearly wage growth remained at 3.1 percent for the second month in a row, a level not seen since the recession. \u201cIf you have solid wage growth while productivity is improving, that is the best of both worlds,\u201d Mr. Donabedian said.Friday\u2019s report is unlikely to discourage policymakers at the Federal Reserve from raising benchmark interest rates when they meet on Dec. 18 and 19.Nonetheless, the report is being seen as a warning flag on some fronts. The recent volatility in the stock market and an increase in the monthly average number of people applying for unemployment benefits has worried people, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.Still, Mr. Rupkey labeled the report \u201cpretty darn good,\u201d and said it should help calm the markets.Uncertainty about trade policy is the primary source of anxiety. \u201cThe ball is in the president\u2019s court to make sure the China deal is still on,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the biggest impediment now.\u201dIn the meantime, the labor market is mostly delivering. The unemployment rate and new claims for jobless benefits are at or near record lows. And the average monthly increase in payrolls this year is more than enough to keep the jobless rate below 4 percent.\u201cPeople who are working in finance are looking at the stock market,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, research director at the job-search site Indeed. \u201cThe typical worker just wants to find a good job with hours and rising wages.\u201dThat search has been getting easier and easier.Ms. Gimbel said sectors that have had a particularly hard time hiring \u2014 like nursing and retailing \u2014 are now posting more full-time than part-time jobs, a sign that employers are struggling to find workers.\u201cEven now,\u201d she added, \u201cat this point in the recovery, one of the fastest-growing jobs search terms on Indeed is people looking for \u2018full-time work.\u2019\u201dThe labor shortage has also finally started benefiting workers who were hit hardest during the recession: minimum-wage earners, African-Americans, Latinos and Americans with fewer skills and less education.Gartner, a research and consulting firm that conducts a quarterly survey of 20,000 employees at companies valued at $100 million or more, found that most workers were extremely optimistic about their ability to find new jobs.At the same time, years of sluggish wage growth and fewer opportunities for advancement have made some workers dissatisfied with their current employers.\u201cEmployees who say they are willing to go above and beyond at work has declined,\u201d said Brian Kropp, vice president for human resources at Gartner. One out of four employees used to say they were giving their work an extra oomph \u2014 something Gartner calls \u201cdiscretionary effort.\u201d Now, it\u2019s closer to one in six.The reason, Mr. Kropp said, is simple: Workers are not being rewarded for their efforts. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s harder for employees to get promoted nowadays,\u201d he said. In 2006, for example, it took an average of about two and a half years to get a promotion, compared with four and a half years today.Fears about changing jobs have also eased, he said. Workers are more willing to take the risk of hopping to another employer in search of better compensation.Some of the strongest gains to payrolls this year have been in manufacturing \u2014 long a buttress of middle-class employment. In November, manufacturers added 27,000 jobs. That comes on top of the nearly 300,000 positions created in the previous 12 months.The scarcity of people with the training and skills to work in some factories has been a challenge, though.\u201cIf someone is here a year, they never leave,\u201d said Mark Willey, president of Western, an employee-owned millwork. \u201cOur problem today is just finding people who want to work, to show up on time and are willing to apply themselves.\u201dThe company has 217 people on staff and expects to raise the total to 230 next year.The average worker earns $16.95 an hour, Mr. Willey said, and gets a generous benefits package. Because the business is 100 percent employee-owned, workers build up equity in the company after a year.Western has used temporary agencies after failing to get enough applicants on its own, and employed inmates at a nearby correctional facility as part of a work-release program. \u201cWhen they get released, we hire them,\u201d he said. \u201cSome we even hire while they\u2019re still in.\u201dThis has been a good year and the company is scouting locations to build a new factory, but Mr. Willey expects business to cool over the next couple of years. The shortage of competent workers, not only at factories like Western\u2019s but also in construction, is slowing single-family home building at the same time that tariffs have bumped up the cost of materials, he said.He pointed to the aluminum sills that ran along the bottom of doors, and the steel hinges bolted onto the sides.The Commerce Department recently reported that construction of single-family homes fell for the second month in a row in October.Manufacturing and related sectors tend to be more susceptible to economic cycles and are particularly vulnerable to tariffs.Mr. Rupkey of MUFG said that manufacturing had been one of the economy\u2019s strongest segments in recent years. \u201cYou wonder how long that\u2019s going to continue,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies.Most analysts expect the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rates by a quarter-point, to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. It would be the fourth rate increase this year.But they cautioned that it did increase the likelihood that the Fed would take a more cautious approach next year, following through on its announcements to be more \u201cdata dependent\u201d and look at the numbers as they come as opposed to following a preset course.Snowstorms in the Midwest and raging wildfires in California may have distorted employment data in November. Last month\u2019s figures will be revised twice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Stocks Inch Higher as Crude Oil Tumbles", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe panic that has gripped Wall Street abated on Tuesday, with stocks rising after a decline that had left the market at its lowest point in more than a year. The rebound was tempered somewhat by a slide in crude oil and energy stocks.Trading was volatile though, as the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymakers began a two-day meeting amid concerns that the global economy is weakening and corporate profit growth could slow. The Fed is still widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter point at the end of that meeting, on Wednesday, but the central bank is also expected to signal that it is aware that deteriorating conditions in financial markets could reflect real risks for the economy.Markets have been highly reactive to any indication that the Fed\u2019s plans are changing. When the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, seemed to suggest in early October that the central bank was intent on raising interest rates, stocks plunged. Weeks later, when he made comments that were taken as an indication that the rate increases were near an end, they rose sharply.Since stocks reached a high in late September, they have been brought lower by a range of concerns, from signs that the trade war between China and the United States is beginning to weigh on global growth to worries that higher interest rates will eat into corporate profits. The result has been a drop not only in stocks, but also risky corporate bonds and commodities.On Tuesday, the S&P 500 reversed a string of recent losses that had brought it to a new low for 2018, but only just. The benchmark rose just 0.01 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite fared better.Crude oil plunged nearly 8 percent to below $46 a barrel and energy stocks were among the day\u2019s worst performers. Exxon Mobil, for example, was down nearly 3 percent.Investors in energy markets are not just worried about economic growth. They are also concerned about a supply glut amid rising output in the United States and countries like Libya and Venezuela. OPEC has agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, but those cuts will not take effect until next year.Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, weighed in on the recent turmoil in stocks, predicting that it signals the end of a nearly decade-long bull market.Stocks in Europe were lower, while shares in Asia suffered a steeper decline after a speech on reform from China\u2019s top leader sent markets down on Tuesday.The speech by President Xi Jinping quoted Communist Party theory, failed to mention the trade war and offered little insight into Beijing\u2019s plans. Though Chinese officials do not usually use such events as a forum for announcing new initiatives, many investors had been hoping that Mr. Xi might introduce new efforts to prop up China\u2019s slowing growth or defuse trade tensions with Mr. Trump.\u201cThe main question for Chinese markets at the moment is to what extent the government will stimulate the economy and whether there will be a trade deal with the U.S.,\u201d said Tom Rafferty, China regional manager at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\u201cOn both those fronts, Xi\u2019s speech offered little in terms of specifics, and we remain highly skeptical that a deal with the U.S. will be done,\u201d Mr. Rafferty said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was It Something We Said? U.S. Border Towns Fret as Canadians Stay Home", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBLAINE, Wash. \u2014 This town near the border of Canada is home to only 5,500 residents, but it has about 20 mailbox stores \u2014 so many that the town recently banned new ones from being constructed along the main drag. The stores were built on their allure to Canadians, who save in shipping and customs costs by having their waders from L.L. Bean or mock Tiffany lamps from Amazon mailed to the stores, then carry the packages back over the border.But this year, the packages have slowed. The mailbox stores have quieted. And Canadians say politics and pride are keeping them away.\u201cFor a lot of people, your president is not their favorite, and they\u2019ve chosen to stay home instead,\u201d said Colleen Clark, 48, a Canadian who lives just 10 minutes from the border, and has stopped coming. \u201cThe whole Trump idea \u2014 the building the wall, the this and the that. Canadians are a bit more open and inclusive, we\u2019re not into building walls.\u201dWhy did the Canadian cross the border? That\u2019s a complex calculation on America\u2019s northern edge from here in Blaine to the tip of Maine because the variables are always in flux, as currency exchange rates, online shopping trends \u2014 and now the uncertainties of international politics and national pride \u2014 filter into the mix.Rarely have things been so tense. Earlier this year, in the midst of a trade dispute, President Trump called Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, \u201cdishonest and weak,\u201d and threatened punitive action against Canada, one of the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners. Canadian shoppers have not forgotten, according to recent surveys in Canada and interviews with dozens of people on both sides of the border.And the stores of Blaine, only 30 miles from Canada\u2019s third-largest city, Vancouver, have felt the impact.Ms. Clark, for her part, said that hard-nosed economics was reason enough to stay home. She is the executive director of the chamber of commerce in Langley, British Columbia, and said the tense back and forth between the countries over tariffs and the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement have roiled the businesses she represents, which include dairy farmers and manufacturers.Her decision to stop coming to the United States was partly in solidarity with them. \u201cI wanted to put my money where my mouth is,\u201d she said.Recent surveys of Canadians suggest that such feelings run deep, concluding that shoppers intend to keep more of their money at home this year. A study by the Whatcom Council of Governments found that Canadians spent less time in the United States this year than they did five years ago, and of those who did travel there, fewer ventured much past the border.It was too early to know for sure whether the shifting mood was having a tangible effect on the economy of border towns in the northern United States, economists said. Overall, Washington State\u2019s economy has expanded with job and population growth, and some of the strongest growth has occurred north of Seattle, near the Canadian border. Any downturn in visits from Canadians would be muted by that.And the statistics on border crossings have been mixed \u2014 with some months up from 2017 and others down. The most recent figures available, for September, showed 32,000 fewer people in passenger vehicles entering the United States from Canada into Blaine, Wash., a 4.6 percent drop from the same month last year.But Michael LeBlanc, a senior retail adviser at the Retail Council of Canada, a trade group, said Mr. Trump had stirred Canadian pride.\u201cThey were generally insulted by the tone,\u201d he said of Canadians, \u201cand it kind of put steel in their spines, \u2018Well, I\u2019m just not going to shop in America.\u2019\u201dSteve Hagen, who runs a mailbox store in Blaine, said he was closely watching every shift of mood for portents of what may come. At Hagen\u2019s of Blaine, which includes a play area for children who have crossed the border with their parents, Mr. Hagen said October business fell sharply. It picked up after Thanksgiving, though, so the overall picture still seemed unclear.What Canadians think about America as a whole can sometimes be distinct from what they feel about their closest American towns. In towns like Blaine, some Canadian customers live only a few blocks from the cluster of mailbox stores. (Regulations are part of the mix too: Depending on how long Canadians are in the United States and how much money they have spent, they are supposed to declare purchases from other places and pay Canadian taxes.)\u201cFor Canadians, Whatcom County is a kind of near-abroad \u2014 it\u2019s seen as not quite American,\u201d Tom Roehl, a professor of international economics at Western Washington University in Bellingham, said of the county closest to the Canadian border, which includes Blaine. \u201cWe kind of take advantage of that.\u201dShane Miller, a computer programmer from Canada who bought specialty Christmas decorations at Hagen\u2019s on a recent day, said he was traveling across the border less frequently. But he said there were products that cannot be found in Canada, or that carry such huge shipping and customs costs as to make him drive over.\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d said Mr. Miller, 45. \u201cA lot of Canadians, myself included, are not huge fans of the political status of the U.S. right now, but I don\u2019t let that stop me \u2014 though I might think twice about taking a long vacation down south or something.\u201dBargains can be alluring, too.\u201cI still like to shop a lot,\u201d said Tina Olexa, 54, a marketing trainer from Surrey, southeast of Vancouver.Ms. Olexa thinks all the bluster about pride and nationhood, on both sides of the border, may fade. \u201cThere are people who say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to support the United States,\u2019 and I think, \u2018Well, how long is that going to last?\u2019\u201d she said.Shannon Newson, who lives 30 minutes from the United States in the suburbs of Vancouver, is still coming.She said the Pacific Northwest still feels a little like Canada to her \u2014 fern-green and wet and not all that friendly to Mr. Trump either. Washington State went strongly for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Whatcom County delivered one of her most lopsided majorities. \u201cIf I lived somewhere where I had to go into a red state to shop, I might think differently,\u201d Ms. Newson said on a recent morning as she embarked on a two-day shopping trip in the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mattis Resignation and Afghan News Alarm U.S. Allies", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe surprise announcements came after President Trump said he was pulling American forces out of Syria, a decision that prompted Mr. Mattis to resign with a statement about the need to \u201ctreat allies with respect and also being clear eyed\u201d about potential enemies.In Afghanistan, Mr. Mattis was seen as the reliable conduit to the American government, and someone who provided balance to the whims of an often unpredictable president.But the developments drew particular alarm in Australia, a close American ally whose soldiers have died in American-led wars in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan.A senator with the governing Liberal Party, Jim Molan, said the news meant that going forward, \u201cAustralia must be self-reliant in its defense.\u201d\u201cThe implications on Australia are the United States \u2014 whose military capability now has been severely reduced since the end of the Cold War \u2014 now has introduced another extreme variable into their decision-making and that must be of deep concern to Australia,\u201d Mr. Molan told The Australian newspaper.Mr. Mattis\u2019s resignation \u2014 to take effect in February \u2014 reignited concerns in Australia about whether the United States could be depended on as an ally. The countries are part of the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d group, also including New Zealand, Britain and Canada, which share intelligence on strategic matters.\u201cI had a discussion with a senior government official this morning and he asked, \u2018Who\u2019s left in the U.S. cabinet who we regard as an adult?\u2019 We both scratched our heads,\u201d said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and a former government defense strategist.The news drew concerns about how Washington would treat sensitive issues in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the challenge from China, Mr. Jennings said.\u201cMattis offered a consistent approach to pushing back against China,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Trump everything is negotiable, everything is up in the air.\u201dAustralia has been ramping up its military spending in recent years without explicitly saying it needed to be self-reliant on military matters, but its direction toward more self-sufficiency in terms of its defense has been clear, particularly as China asserts itself in the region.The news of the planned troop withdrawal in Afghanistan took officials in that country particularly by surprise, with one saying \u201cnothing was communicated,\u201d though Afghan officials were aware of a potential pullout.A Japanese official, however, expressed confidence that the country\u2019s military alliance with the United States would remain strong given Mr. Trump\u2019s close personal relationship with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Although Mr. Mattis was a key voice in the administration opposed to pre-emptively attacking North Korea in 2017, the Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was confident that such proposals were unlikely to be revived any time soon.In China, the country\u2019s military viewed Mr. Mattis as a hard-liner, and the architect of a containment strategy designed to thwart the country\u2019s growing naval reach into the Asia-Pacific region.To demonstrate American support for Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its territory, Mr. Mattis dispatched warships to the Taiwan Strait three times this year. And Mr. Mattis has pushed back hard against China in the South China Sea, sending warships close to disputed islands that China claims as its own.A new defense secretary who was more in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking could be an opportunity for China, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University.Under Mr. Mattis, the Pentagon appeared to act \u201cseparately from the Trump team in dealing with China,\u201d Mr. Wu said. Now that could change.\u201cCertainly Trump wants a more compliant secretary of defense,\u201d said Mr. Wu. \u201cWith China Trump, focuses on the economy, not security or geopolitics.

The S&P 500 ends the week down by 4.6 percent.By The New York TimesWhen a trade war broke out between the world\u2019s two largest economies in June, investors barely blinked. After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates \u2014 often a reason for investors to sell stocks \u2014 the markets kept climbing. As some of the world\u2019s largest economies began to slow down, American markets largely shrugged it off.Not anymore.Last week, elements of all of those combined to drive the S&P 500-stock index down by 4.6 percent, its worst weekly drop since March and one marked by stomach-churning price swings. Stocks are now down 1.5 percent this year.More volatility could be in store, as investors assess the allegations by prosecutors that President Trump directed illegal payments to ward off a potential sex scandal, and the possibility that he sought to secretly do business in Russia during his 2016 campaign for the White House.\u201cEvery eye is going to be focused on every piece of commentary on this trade deal,\u201d said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, which manages over $6 trillion in assets. \u201cBecause the impact on growth is so significant.\u201dWhile the large market swings on trade-related news underscore some investors\u2019 view that a resolution to the impasse between the United States and China will be crucial to the survival of the economic expansion, there are other political and economic risks as well. They include the fallout from the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the relentless staff churn in the Trump administration, the efforts to negotiate Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, and social unrest in France.\u201cThe fact is that politics is driving the economy to an extent that is very atypical,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, an institutional brokerage firm. \u201cWe would say probably to the greatest extent that we\u2019ve seen in our investing lifetime.\u201dLast week, markets whipsawed on headlines related to the trade war. On Monday, stocks jumped 1.1 percent on word that President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed to a 90-day halt on any new tariffs to provide space to negotiate key trade issues.The selling continued on Friday, when stocks fell 2.3 percent.The trade war has already taken a toll on large chunks of the global economy. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, is growing at its slowest rate in nearly a decade. The export-driven economies of Japan and Germany \u2014 the third and fourth biggest economies in the world, respectively \u2014 both contracted in the third quarter.The United States has so far been an outlier. Thanks in part to a burst of deficit-fueled stimulus, a large chunk from the tax cut, the American economy this year is on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2005. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a near 50-year low. Corporate profits and wages are growing at their fastest pace in years.For much of 2018, results like that helped Wall Street stand out even as major stock benchmarks around the globe tumbled. Chinese stocks are down more than 20 percent this year, and shares in Germany are down 16.5 percent. In Japan, stocks are down about 5 percent, and in Britain they\u2019re down more than 10 percent.But even in the United States, there are emerging pockets of weakness, particularly in parts of the economy that are sensitive to rising borrowing costs. Pending home sales have declined for eight straight months, as interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have climbed. Monthly auto sales have plateaued, prompting job cuts at General Motors and Ford.Worries about global economic growth, trade and the strength of corporate America have been battering stocks. While that\u2019s cause for concern, it is important to put slides like this in context.The stock market has mirrored those concerns since the summer. Shares of carmakers and auto-parts manufacturers are down more than 25 percent this year. Shares of homebuilders have slumped nearly 30 percent.And investors are growing more concerned about the outlook for corporate profits next year, despite third-quarter results that showed that profits at S&P 500 companies rose at the fastest pace since 2010. Instead of the strong results, investors zeroed in on commentary from executives about whether next year might signal the beginning of the end for the second-longest business cycle expansion on record.\u201cWe\u2019re very mindful once again where we\u2019re at in the cycle,\u201d Gregory Carmichael, chief executive of the Cincinnati-based lender Fifth Third, said at a conference last week. \u201cWe\u2019re well positioned to deal with the downturn in the economy, and we\u2019ll be very cautious.\u201dThat very caution from corporate America could itself sway the economy, should lenders pull back financing, or large businesses slow their growth plans.There are other risks to the economy, too, and high on many investors\u2019 lists of these is the Federal Reserve. The central bank has been raising interest rates and winding down other financial crisis-era stimulus that helped drive a global investment boom over the past decade. These higher rates pinch stock investors by making government debt a more appealing alternative, particularly in uncertain times, and also mean companies that binged on low-cost loans will have to spend more to cover their obligations.The market tumult, coupled with the increasingly uncertain path for the global economy, is part of the reason Mr. Rieder, of BlackRock, said he believed that the Fed might decide not to lift interest rates at its next meeting on Dec. 18-19.\u201cThe Fed should slow down and now take a step back and look at what has happened,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

This has been the case since the 1970s, when Edward Heath, the prime minister at the time, had to rely on Labour votes in Parliament in order to bring Britain into the European Economic Community, the European Union\u2019s predecessor.Most of Mrs. May\u2019s problems since she took office in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum stem from her dogged determination to secure an exit from the European Union that simultaneously restores Britain\u2019s control over migration, but without tanking the economy and necessitating a hard border in Ireland. (Indeed, she\u2019s done little else in her tenure.)Believe it or not, most Conservatives are in broad agreement. When it comes to the economy and the role of the state, they are all pretty much Thatcherites now. True, there are a few Conservative members of Parliament who would like to see a little more public spending and investment, a more compassionate attitude to those on welfare, and some slightly tougher regulation of business. But the differences between them and the rest of their colleagues (most of whom want to keep spending, taxes and regulation as low as possible without setting off an overwhelming electoral backlash) are largely differences of degree, not of kind.That means that there is a post-Brexit agenda that the Conservatives can unite around: free trade with as many countries that will do deals with \u201cglobal Britain,\u201d cutting red tape that supposedly suffocates small business, overcoming the obstacles that have stymied the growth of homeownership under a party that has long lauded its commitment to a \u201cproperty-owning democracy,\u201d and health and education provisions lean enough to ensure that tax-funded spending on public services doesn\u2019t crowd out the private sector. Time and time again, after fights that might have broken other parties \u2014 the vicious arguments over free trade in the 1920s is perhaps the most apposite example \u2014 the Tories have prevented seemingly permanent splits from becoming fatal.Clearly, it\u2019s proving incredibly hard right now to fulfill the decision to leave the European Union. But because there\u2019s still more that unites the Conservative Party than divides it \u2014 particularly when it comes to keeping taxes and regulation low, keeping capital flowing, and keeping a socialist Labour Party out of power \u2014 even Brexit, in the end, is unlikely to tear it apart.And who knows. With the clock ticking louder and louder, and with Mrs. May now apparently safe, this underlying agreement might still combine with the party\u2019s traditional will to power to allow her, after all, to oversee a smooth departure from the European Union next March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Prices Plummet 7% on Fears of a Glut", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Oil prices tumbled more than 7 percent on Tuesday, falling to their lowest levels in more than a year, after investors learned that Russia and the United States were pumping a lot more oil than had been expected.The American benchmark fell below $47 a barrel for the first time in 15 months, capping a slide that has brought prices down by more than a third since early October.Bountiful, cheap oil supplies are an unanticipated holiday bonus for American consumers. The average price of regular gasoline has fallen to $2.37 a gallon, according to the AAA motor club, 26 cents lower than a month ago. For most of the year gasoline prices were rising, but the recent decline in oil prices has driven gasoline down by about a nickel a gallon compared with a year ago.Oil prices had stabilized earlier this month when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed to slash production by 1.2 million barrels a day. But Russia announced on Monday that its output had increased to more than 11.4 million barrels a day, a record, putting in doubt its commitment to coordinate policies with Saudi Arabia and other oil producers.On the same day, the Energy Department reported that the United States was producing 11.6 million barrels of crude oil a day, nearly a million barrels more than a year ago. The department projects that shale-oil production will climb to record levels this month, and increase by 134,000 barrels a day in January.A shortage of pipelines has driven down oil prices from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most productive American oil field. But the completion of a series of pipelines in late 2019 should benefit producers and increase exports, adding even more barrels to the global glut.The oil industry has struggled since prices plummeted to below $30 a barrel in 2016. Hundreds of small producers and oil-services companies sought bankruptcy protection, and more than 160,000 jobs were cut. As prices increased in 2017 and earlier this year, the industry regained some of that lost ground \u2014 a recovery now under threat.\u201cIt sure will hurt if it lasts very long,\u201d said Tom Dunlap, president of Tripledee Drilling of Ardmore, Okla. Mr. Dunlap said a price of $60 to $70 a barrel was typically needed to drill a new well profitably in his state.Oil companies have become more efficient by relying on robotics and other technologies to replace workers, enabling them to explore and produce at lower prices. Those adjustments could come in handy as businesses are forced to cut back again in the coming months.\u201cThese organizations have had to figure out they need to make a profit at $50 to $60 oil,\u201d said Thomas M. Siebel, chief executive of C3, an artificial-intelligence software company that works with Royal Dutch Shell. \u201cTo do that they need to lower the cost of production, lower their exploration costs, lower their drilling costs; costs of operation have to be more efficient.\u201dSo far, there are few signs that companies will meaningfully reduce exploration in 2019, though that could change if prices keep falling and the economy slows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Said Amazon Was Scamming the Post Office. His Administration Disagrees.", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump spent much of last spring accusing Amazon of pulling a \u201cscam\u201d on the American taxpayer and ripping off the United States Postal Service. On Tuesday, his administration delivered its own verdict: Not so much.Commercial package delivery is not profitable enough to offset the revenue losses the Postal Service is suffering, however, as Americans mail fewer and fewer first-class letters, and the Treasury Department task force outlined several recommendations to help shore up its finances.\u201cShould be charging MUCH MORE!\u201d he wrote.But the report did include some recommendations that made online retailers uneasy. One would push the Postal Service to price package delivery to maximize profits, instead of maximizing delivery volume. Another would force the service to create separate accounting books for letters and for packages, which retailers fear could lead to an increase in package rates.It also called for steps to reduce the service\u2019s labor costs, including eliminating collective bargaining over pay for postal employees. And it recommended lifting caps on how much the service can charge for letter delivery and giving it power to reduce the number of days it delivers mail \u2014 which most likely would mean ending letter delivery on Saturdays.The task force also proposed creating a complicated new system of pricing for packages, in which it could cost less to send a box of prescription drugs than to send a board game. It would also allow the postal system to charge other delivery services for access to Americans\u2019 mailboxes; under current law, the Postal Service holds a monopoly on what can actually be delivered to a mailbox.Amazon and many other retailers formed an advocacy group on postal issues this year, called the Package Coalition. Its chairman, the former Army secretary John M. McHugh, said on Tuesday that the coalition was \u201cconcerned that some of the task force recommendations, including the recommendation to create a separate package business, would needlessly reduce efficiency and force the Postal Service to raise prices on American businesses and consumers.\u201dAdministration officials played down the report\u2019s links to Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent Twitter complaints about Amazon. \u201cNone of our findings relate to any one customer of the Postal Service,\u201d a senior administration official said on Tuesday afternoon, in a briefing call with reporters. \u201cWe based our analysis on the needs of all our economy.\u201dInstead, they cast the report as a needed set of reforms for a service that has been losing money for a decade, and is projected to lose tens of billions over the next decade.\u201cWe believe these are the first steps forward,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, wrote to Mr. Trump at the beginning of the report, \u201cin creating a sustainable business model under which the U.S.P.S. can continue to provide necessary mail services for all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But exactly what the federal government and provinces can or should do is unclear, and there are few obviously effective approaches at hand.In the past, early retirement was often a ready \u2014 and sometimes welcome \u2014 prospect to major layoffs in the auto sector. But the wave of layoffs that followed G.M.\u2019s bankruptcy a decade ago means a majority of workers at the company today are nowhere near retirement age, according to Unifor, the workers\u2019 union.Retraining has already been raised. General Motors said on Thursday that it will set up a program with schools in Oshawa to turn assembly line workers into mechanics for car dealerships. But while there is certainly a shortage of qualified mechanics, it seems unlikely that dealerships will need more than 2,500 of them.\u201cI think we have to view with suspicion plans to retrain employees, because we\u2019ve heard that story before,\u201d Scott Aquanno, a political scientist at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, who has studied previous G.M. layoffs, told me. \u201cThe opportunities for high-paying jobs are slim.\u201dAnd while Oshawa, like many Canadian cities, is trying to turn itself into a hub for technology industries, Mr. Aquanno said even if that effort is successful, it\u2019s unlikely to help many G.M. workers.Beyond retraining, Mr. Ford has asked Mr. Trudeau to extend federal jobless benefits by five weeks: a measure likely welcomed by workers, but well short of a solution.The Oshawa shutdown doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Canada\u2019s auto industry as a whole is doomed \u2014 at least, not immediately. There was relatively little attention paid earlier this year when Toyota announced it would spend 1.4 billion Canadian dollars (including 200 million in government money) to add hybrid versions of its best-selling RAV4 compact sport vehicle to its factory in Woodstock, Ontario.But Toyota\u2019s Woodstock plant, which opened 10 years ago, is the last new car factory Canada has seen. Since then, all new plants from carmakers around the world intended mainly to serve the North American market have popped up in the United States or Mexico.The closing of Oshawa\u2019s plant, expected to happen roughly a year from now, will be a drag on the city\u2019s economy, and painful for the many people who work there. The challenge facing Mr. Ford and Mr. Trudeau until the closing is to make sure those people aren\u2019t left behind.Esi Edugyan, who lives in Victoria, recently won her second Giller Prize for her latest novel, \u201cWashington Black.\u201d This week, the editors at The Times Book Review declared it one of the 10 Best Books of 2018, describing it as \u201ca wondrous tale of exploration and discovery.\u201dAlso this week, Margaret Atwood announced she\u2019s penning a sequel to her award-winning novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d \u2014 an idea she had previously rejected.Advertisement"}

And some contain their share of Trump-friendly declarations that do not necessarily track with the truth: \u201cThe Russia collusion investigation is over,\u201d Ms. Pirro wrote in her book. (It\u2019s not.)Mr. Scalise and authors like him are understandably tickled to be a part of the president\u2019s book club.\u201cI appreciate President Trump sharing with others how much he enjoyed \u2018Back in the Game,\u2019\u201d Mr. Scalise said Friday in a statement. \u201cBut most of all, I\u2019m grateful for the friendship and encouragement he\u2019s shown me and my family throughout my recovery.\u201dYet the question remains: Has Mr. Trump read any of the titles he has asked Americans to read? He has been upfront about the lack of time and attention he can give to reading, and he has gone back and forth between publicly declaring his love of reading but also telling the world he does not read much.People who have observed him over the years are skeptical of his interests in the literary realm.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t read at all.

O\u2019Brien, who wrote \u201cTrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.\u201d \u201cHe lacks the patience, curiosity and self-awareness to be a good reader, and that\u2019s why aides and advisers know the best way to communicate complex thoughts to him is with pictures and charts, or simply verbally.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s habit of critiquing books but not reading them is just another way he differs from many of his predecessors, several of whom were also authors, and who espoused a love for reading.Mr. Trump, a TV obsessive, operates differently, though he has frequently bragged about his own literary prowess.The White House did not respond to questions about what Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite takeaways were from, say, Mr. Scalise\u2019s book, or whether he has read all of the titles he has promoted. But two people familiar with his presidential reading habits, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that he does not really have any.Instead, those people said, Mr. Trump prefers visual aides like charts and graphs \u2014 all the better for imbibing information and moving on to the next topic. A recently praised author agreed.\u201cI was told by some friends at the White House that he\u2019s kind of looked it over,\u201d Stephen Moore said of \u201cTrumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy,\u201d which he co-wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s aware of some of the charts and things like that in the book.\u201dMr. Trump gave a thumb\u2019s up to the book in his official Twitter review, describing it as \u201ca terrific read of a really interesting subject!\u201dInstead of actually cracking a new book, Mr. Trump watches his favorite authors defend his policies on television. He will call them if they say something that displeases him, and then follow up with a comment on Twitter.\u201cI will get calls from Trump if I say something he doesn\u2019t like,\u201d said Mr. Moore, also a CNN analyst. \u201cHe\u2019ll call me and say, \u2018Why did you say that?\u2019\u201dMr. Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said that he supports many of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, including his work on tax reform.

{"Headline": "Syria Faces Brittle Future, Dominated by Russia and Iran", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Turkey is threatening to invade Syria to eradicate Kurdish fighters. Syrian forces are rolling toward territory the Americans will soon abandon. Israel is bombing Iran-backed militias deep inside Syria. And Russia could soon move to crush the last vestige of the Syrian anti-government insurgency.The Syria that the United States military is vacating on President Trump\u2019s orders is a Balkanized version of the country that plunged into a calamitous civil war nearly eight years ago.Now, with the American troop withdrawal and the demise of the insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad, Iran and Russia will be even freer to flex their power in Syria.A look at the changing complexities of the Syria conflict:After years of bloodshed set in motion by the Arab Spring protests that had inspired hope for democratic change, the most likely Syrian future, Middle East analysts project, is a far more brittle version of what existed before the war: Mr. Assad leading a repressive government puppeteered by Russia and Iran.Both countries are longtime allies of Mr. Assad\u2019s. By rescuing him with Russian airpower and Iranian manpower, they have embedded themselves even further.Shiite Iran, which competes with Sunni powers led by Saudi Arabia for influence across the region, has sent tens of thousands of Iranian and proxy fighters to Syria. It is building Shiite shrines and strengthening Shiite militias that it hopes to use as leverage against Israel.Russia, which already exerted considerable political influence in Syria, holds sway over its foreign policy, military and security services. That is part of the price Moscow exacted for having protected Mr. Assad, a brutal autocrat once described by Western leaders as finished.Although they may find staying in Syria costly, frustrating and unpopular back home, Russia and Iran have secured an advantage from outlasting the United States: regional clout.Two thousand Americans were deployed in northeast Syria, collaborating with Kurdish-led forces to wipe the Islamic State from the area. But that partnership angered neighboring Turkey, which sees the autonomy-minded Kurds as a dangerous enemy.How \u2014 or even if \u2014 the fight against the Islamic State in Syria will now proceed remains unclear. An estimated 30,000 Islamic State adherents are believed scattered in the country.Many experts anticipate that a hasty American pullout could spawn another major battle, either as Turkey moves to crush its Kurdish foes, or as Mr. Assad\u2019s forces retake the northeast, or both.It is possible that the Kurds and Mr. Assad could come to a deal first. If not, a new round of fighting could send new waves of refugees \u2014 Kurds and others \u2014 fleeing toward Iraq in a new round of mayhem that could also help incubate the Islamic State\u2019s revival.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks Syria\u2019s war via a network of citizen monitors, said on Sunday that the Syrian government had dispatched thousands of fighters toward the Islamic State\u2019s last patches of territory in the northeast.The last major redoubt of the rebels opposed to Mr. Assad are crowded into Idlib Province in northwestern Syria, neighboring Turkey. Russia may help Mr. Assad\u2019s forces retake the province eventually. But Russia also is expected to first negotiate with Turkey, which has supported anti-Assad groups and has a vested interest in what happens along its border with Syria.Israel has made clear it will not tolerate an increased threat from Syria, which the Israelis demonstrated on Tuesday with airstrikes near Damascus.The Russians, who have good relations with Israel, have tacitly allowed it to conduct such operations in the past. Still, the Kremlin protested on Wednesday what it called Israel\u2019s \u201cgross violation\u201d of Syrian sovereignty.The Iranian-led Shiite partnership in Syria faces a basic shortcoming: few Shiites in a Sunni-majority country. Still, Iran has extended its influence among both Syrian fighters and civilians.In some parts of Syria, Iran has distributed cash to pay for housing to people displaced by the war; in others, it has established Shiite shrines that, according to the Observatory, have drawn visitors from Iran, Iraq and Syria.Defying the Syrian government\u2019s historic secularism, Iran and Hezbollah have infused parts of the country with a strikingly religious tint. It was rare in the past, for example, to see celebrations for Ashura, a major Shiite holiday, in non-Shiite areas of Damascus. Now, however, Ashura parades and rituals are much more visible.Some soldiers in the historically secular Syrian army have become more religious after joining Iran-backed Shiite militias. Others have switched to such militias for nonreligious reasons. Fighters in Iran-backed groups receive better pay and more days off than the army offers, and joining a Shiite militia does not necessarily mean converting to Shiism. But it is a marked shift from the old way.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer purely secular,\u201d said Ali Rizk, a Beirut-based analyst who writes about Iran. He said Iran and Hezbollah have spread their Shiite beliefs among some of the Syrian forces. \u201cIt\u2019s only human \u2014 after all, these units were coordinating with each other, fighting side by side.\u201dRussia has cemented ties with Syrian leaders, strengthened relations with Turkey and eclipsed the United States as the power to contend with in the Middle East.The Russians have also demonstrated a canny understanding of Syrian sensitivities \u2014 dispatching military policemen from Russia\u2019s predominantly Sunni Muslim Chechnya region, for example, to negotiate rebel withdrawals and keep the peace in Sunni areas retaken by Mr. Assad\u2019s side.On a visit to the formerly insurgent-held southern suburbs of Damascus in October, three Russian military policemen were patrolling with a green armored vehicle that bore the Russian flag. Syrians greeted them in Arabic, sometimes throwing in a \u201cprivyet\u201d \u2014 \u201chi\u201d in Russian.Many have welcomed the Russians, preferring them to the government\u2019s security enforcers or to Shiite militiamen backed by Iran. Those in the area who still opposed the government said they were heartened in the spring, when a YouTube video showed Russian military policemen arresting Syrian soldiers accused of looting. Then, in June, when Shiite militiamen arrested two Sunni men, the Russians pressured the militias into releasing them, residents said.The incidents helped persuade residents that Russia has no interest in stoking Sunni-Shiite frictions, and could counter any moves by Mr. Assad\u2019s forces to exact revenge on the opposition.\u201cIran has a sectarian project,\u201d said Ahmed al-Buqa\u2019a, 55, who had three sons fight with the rebels, \u201cbut Russia doesn\u2019t care about people\u2019s ethnic and religious backgrounds.\u201dIran and Russia are already in a competition, with Russia wanting a self-supporting Syrian government weaned from Russian military and financial help, and Iran preferring something weaker, analysts said. Both countries have already begun placing advisers in Syrian security agencies, said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East program director for the International Crisis Group.But both face challenges to staying in Syria. Neither can afford Syria\u2019s reconstruction, which by some reckonings could exceed $200 billion.The Russians \u201cwant to find an exit from Syria basically, militarily, leaving in place their two bases and their own people within the security apparatus, and Russian companies to help with reconstruction,\u201d Mr. Hiltermann said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to get bogged down militarily.\u201dBoth patrons may find Syria\u2019s stability hard to re-establish under Mr. Assad. Already, peaceful protests against him have been staged in areas where he has reasserted control, analysts said.\u201cPeacetime will present challenges that the war let him paper over,\u201d said Alexander Bick, a lecturer and research scholar at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who oversaw Syria issues at the National Security Council under the Obama administration.\u201cThe Russians are very keenly aware,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Assad\u2019s position is fragile, the economy is totally destroyed, and politically it\u2019s a mess.\u201dReporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, and Marjorie Olster and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Tries to Balance Anger Over Huawei Arrest With Warmer Trade Ties", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s leadership is trying to strike a delicate balance between outrage and necessity, as it seeks to maintain a recent thaw with the United States while lashing out at the arrest of a top Chinese tech executive.Earlier in the day, People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, warned of \u201cserious consequences\u201d against the Canadian authorities who arrested Ms. Meng on an American warrant. She was detained in Canada more than a week ago on suspicion of fraud involving violations of United States sanctions in Iran.\u201cOnly by correcting its mistake, immediately ending its violation of a Chinese citizen\u2019s lawful and legitimate rights and giving the Chinese people a due explanation, can Canada avoid paying a heavy price,\u201d the editorial said.But at a high-level conference on Sunday at Tsinghua University in Beijing that included four Nobel laureates in economics from the United States, a senior adviser to the Chinese leadership opened his remarks by praising the two countries\u2019 broader economic relationship and avoiding any mention of the arrest.\u201cThe economies of China and the United States are integrated,\u201d said the adviser, Ma Jianting, a vice president of the Development Research Council, the policy advisory unit of China\u2019s cabinet. \u201cThere is no parting of the ways.\u201dMr. Ma\u2019s remarks were the latest of many signs that the Chinese government was trying to compartmentalize the Huawei issue, while still taking an assertive enough stance to satisfy nationalistic anger in China.On Thursday, hours after word of Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest in Canada spread publicly in China, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, said that Beijing was \u201cfull of confidence in reaching a deal in the 90 days.\u201d He also confirmed for the first time a White House assertion that China would be buying American food, energy and cars following the truce, but declined to provide any details.Mr. Trump agreed in Buenos Aires to defer plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion a year in Chinese goods on Jan. 1.In the United States on Sunday, Robert Lighthizer, the trade representative who is leading the American talks with China, made clear that he considered March 1 \u201ca hard deadline\u201d for the negotiations. \u201cWhen I talk to the president of the United States, he is not talking about going beyond March,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d adding, \u201cIf there is a deal to be gotten, we want to get it in the next 90 days.\u201dMr. Lighthizer also said that the trade talks should not be affected by the arrest of Ms. Meng. \u201cThis is a criminal justice matter. It is totally separate from anything that I work on or anything that the trade policy people in the administration work on.\u201dChina\u2019s leaders are coincidentally preparing to observe this month the 40th anniversary of the country\u2019s post-Mao economic overhaul by calling for a series of moves to open up the economy to more trade and foreign investment, people familiar with Chinese policymaking said.The anniversary, heavily promoted in official propaganda and the subject of Sunday\u2019s conference at Tsinghua University, offers Mr. Xi a chance to take market-opening measures sought by the United States without seeming to give in to American pressure.The final list of moves is still the subject of considerable discussion within the Chinese bureaucracy. But some options under serious consideration include further reducing tariffs on imports from all over the world and encouraging broader foreign investment in the slowing Chinese economy.China made some moves in these directions this year, however, and it is unclear how much further the Beijing leadership is willing to go. By Beijing\u2019s calculation, China\u2019s average tariffs have already fallen to 7.5 percent from 9.8 percent at the start of this year. By comparison, average tariffs in the United States are 3.5 percent, while the European Union\u2019s are 5 percent.Ms. Meng\u2019s detention has considerably complicated China\u2019s economic relations with the United States. It has ignited anger and astonishment in China, where Huawei, one of the country\u2019s largest and most internationally successful private companies, is a source of national pride.One reason for the outrage is that few people in China are aware that their government has quietly been blocking some Americans from leaving the country without filing charges against them or accusing them of wrongdoing.A Canadian judge then issued a warrant for Ms. Meng on Nov. 30, after it became known that she would change planes in Vancouver on her way to Mexico from Hong Kong. By the end of Friday, no bail had been set. The hearing is set to continue on Monday morning.Huawei has said it has no knowledge of wrongdoing by Ms. Meng. In a statement released after the hearing on Friday, a company spokesman said, \u201cWe have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion.\u201dBut coming in a year of tariffs and other measures aimed at curbing China\u2019s efforts to upgrade its technological capabilities, Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest has reinforced the feeling among many people in China that Washington is using every means at its disposal to hold back their nation\u2019s economic ascent. That feeling makes it harder for economic reformers in China to support trade compromises with the United States.\u201cChina will not stir up trouble. But it is also not afraid of trouble,\u201d People\u2019s Daily said in its editorial. \u201cNobody should underestimate China\u2019s confidence, willpower and strength.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In fact, McKinsey\u2019s involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke China\u2019s transition from an economic laggard to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. But as China\u2019s growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijing\u2019s signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.It turns out that McKinsey\u2019s role in China is just one example of its extensive \u2014 and sometimes contentious \u2014 work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments \u2014 companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian government\u2019s energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.In August, VEB Bank \u2014 which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions \u2014 hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s autocratic leadership.Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the world\u2019s most admired companies.In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies \u2014 the ones carrying out some of the government\u2019s most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with China\u2019s state-owned companies, McKinsey\u2019s role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asia\u2019s most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the company\u2019s values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations \u2014 that change is best achieved from the inside.\u201cSince 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u201cTens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,\u201d it added.\u201cLike many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,\u201d the company said, \u201cbut we do not support or engage in political activities.\u201dStill, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinsey\u2019s role in a different light.While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights \u2014 sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of America\u2019s biggest rivals.\u201cIt is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,\u201d said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.\u201dHis bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.McKinsey\u2019s role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics \u2014 before discarding much of it after becoming president.On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the world\u2019s most important corporations.That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.Mr. Manafort\u2019s job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different \u2014 an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was \u201ca strong McKinsey supporter,\u201d while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides \u201cto work directly with McKinsey experts.\u201dDiplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might \u201csing a song one moment and knife someone the next.\u201dThere were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for \u201cmobsters and oligarchs,\u201d noting that it might be trying to shed that image.Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey \u2014 and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy \u2014 one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinsey\u2019s work was well received.But the promise of a better future didn\u2019t last long.The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded \u2014 without achieving its goals \u2014 just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.\u201cWhen we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,\u201d McKinsey said in a statement.Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will \u201cto embrace the reform agenda.\u201dBut critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovych\u2019s image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych \u201cwas about power and robbery.\u201dMcKinsey\u2019s role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s downfall. \u201cWe build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraine\u2019s major companies, its economy and society,\u201d the company wrote on its website.In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.It is supposed to be a railway \u2014 part of China\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.\u201cThat is not good for us,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said in September. \u201cMalaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.\u201dBut for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China \u2014 \u201cbuild the nation-to-nation relationship\u201d \u2014 because of its importance in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a \u201cgame changer\u201d elsewhere in the region.It isn\u2019t hard to see where McKinsey\u2019s enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.Dominic Barton, McKinsey\u2019s managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.McKinsey\u2019s in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports \u2014 widely cited in the Chinese state news media \u2014 extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.Mr. Barton \u2014 who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand China\u2019s global influence.\u201cThe world is waiting for the \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,\u201d Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the company\u2019s Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinsey\u2019s enthusiasm to work on it.The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.In 2016, McKinsey\u2019s client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinsey\u2019s clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss China\u2019s sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.\u201cOur firm\u2019s rigorous internal policies and procedures\u201d ensure that \u201cwe bring an independent perspective\u201d to help each client \u201cpursue its own strategic goals,\u201d McKinsey said.But the political backdrop \u2014 a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks \u2014 should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.\u201cThey were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,\u201d Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the world\u2019s biggest insurers.McKinsey\u2019s success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it \u2014 unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends \u2014 into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the People\u2019s Republic of China.Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the country\u2019s vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became China\u2019s premier, putting him in charge of running the government.Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at China\u2019s banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he \u201cnever worked on any projects for the firm\u2019s Chinese clients,\u201d and that it would be \u201cmisleading\u201d to connect him with McKinsey\u2019s work for Ping An.McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.\u201cAny suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,\u201d the company said.And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firm\u2019s last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.McKinsey\u2019s name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the company\u2019s Chinese name.McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like \u201cSmart Cities,\u201d worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen China\u2019s surveillance state.The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.\u201cPolice patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,\u201d McKinsey wrote in a report in June.\u201cIt is about political control,\u201d said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that \u201cthrough the \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019 plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced industries.\u201dMcKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on \u201cMade in China 2025.\u201d But earlier this year, China\u2019s government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinsey\u2019s reports also stopped mentioning the policy.\u201cThey sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the People\u2019s Daily,\u201d George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. \u201cObviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way \u2014 sometimes not so subtle.\u201dAnd the bank is a McKinsey client.In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy \u2014 one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.Sberbank \u2014 a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump\u2019s Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 \u2014 is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.McKinsey\u2019s work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia \u2014 or anywhere in the world \u2014 only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.\u201cBut what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia \u2014 in all three of those instances \u2014 that belief has not proven to be true,\u201d he said.China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there \u201chave nothing to point to\u201d showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.In some cases, McKinsey\u2019s work may have made things worse.The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.\u201cThe world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,\u201d said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending \u201ctheir reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.\u201dFor 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls \u201cthe black box of authoritarian governance.\u201d\u201cEven if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,\u201d Ms. Jones wrote.Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.\u201cIn the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,\u201d she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.\u201cThey engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,\u201d she said. \u201cThey self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.\u201dOutside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as \u201cthe number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.\u201dThe expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs \u201clike bats leaving a cave.\u201dReporting was contributed by Mark Rachkevych from Kiev, Ukraine; Chris Buckley from Kashgar, China; Krishnamoorthy Muthaly from Bentong, Malaysia; Hannah Beech from Bangkok; Matt Apuzzo from Brussels; David Barboza from Boston; and Andrew Kramer from Moscow.

{"Headline": "Finding Harmony in Ribera del Duero", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesAfter gaining a reputation for oaky, exaggerated, powerful red wines, producers in this Spanish region are beginning to take a more balanced approach. In Ribera del Duero, the people traditionally drank clarete, a pink wine made by blending white and red grapes. A high percentage of those red grapes were tempranillo, or tinto fino, as it is known there. Other grapes were used as well, including garnacha and bobal among the reds and albillo among the whites.These wines are the modern face of Ribera del Duero. The wines received high praise from critics and found favor in the United States, where they often received top scores for their inky potency.If Rioja to the northeast, which also makes tempranillo-based reds, drew its inspiration from Bordeaux, Ribera del Duero, it was said, was more a Spanish version of the Napa Valley.It was a convenient formulation. But much has changed in wine in the last decade. Regions that were known for extracting as much ripeness, power and fruitiness as possible in making their red wines were pulling back in the direction of harmony. It has happened all over California, even in Napa Valley.What about Ribera del Duero? As one who prizes the qualities of restraint, balance and refreshing acidity, which were in short supply in Ribera del Duero, I have not often gravitated toward the region\u2019s wines. Yet I could not help but wonder whether this region, which had achieved such success with this particular style, had also evolved away from power toward more graceful, tense wines.Before the tasting, we debated briefly how to judge the wines. Was there such a thing as a typical wine from Ribera del Duero? Were we looking for wines that fit those characteristics, whatever they were?These wines did not represent the slow evolution of a region\u2019s character over generations, but rather were the products of conscious choices by their producers that coalesced into a dominant style. Ribera del Duero excels at producing wines in this mode, though the wines are more a product of international tastes than of regional traits.For me, harmony and balance are universal qualities that I want to see in fine wines, regardless of their styles. Ribera del Duero is typically hot and dry in summers, and so I would expect wines of ripe, muscular fruit flavors \u2014 sunnier versions of Rioja, so to speak.But, at high altitude, 2,500 feet above sea level, Ribera del Duero experiences big temperature swings between day and night. And many of the vineyards are on limestone. Theoretically, at least, this combination of altitude and soil can help to preserve acidity in the grapes, allowing the region to make wines that match ripeness with freshness, which gives them tension.\u201cSome are big and powerful \u2014 that is Ribera,\u201d Gabriela said. \u201cBut they can be balanced.\u201dThe best had spicy fruit flavors rather than the sweetness that might come from overripe grapes, and a sort of earthiness that one might infer was typical of warm-climate tempranillo.At $17, the Finca Torremilanos was our best value, though many wines could have filled that role, including our No. 3 bottle, the firm yet fresh 2016 Vi\u00f1a Solorca Barrica at $15, and our No. 7 bottle, the spicy 2016 Torremor\u00f3n at just $13.At No. 4 was an outlier, the 2017 Joven de Vi\u00f1as Viejas from Goyo Garc\u00eda, a wine made naturally, with minimal intervention, from old vines. If I were to choose one of these bottles to drink tonight, I would pick this juicy, pure, spicy and refreshing wine.In the fifth spot was the 2016 Mibal Joven from Hornillos Ballesteros, concentrated and rich, yet balanced and earthy, while No. 6 was the firm, resonant 2015 from Dominio del Soto.Also worth noting were the clear, pleasantly rustic 2015 Finca Villacreces, the heady and tannic 2016 Antidoto and the energetic yet oaky 2016 Roble from Valdrinal.Perhaps one reason we were impressed by our top 10 was that they were from the cheaper end of the spectrum, where long aging in barrels of new oak is often considered too costly. The three most expensive bottles in the tasting, all over $50, were rejected as either too oaky, too sweet tasting or simply too too.Nonetheless, we all took it as a good sign that we could find so many wines to like. It was an indication that the wines of Ribera del Duero are heading in a more exciting direction.Juicy, polished and medium-bodied, with fresh, expressive flavors of earthy minerals and sunny fruit. (Skurnik Wines, New York)Best ValuePure and harmonious, with firm tannins and fresh aromas and flavors of flowers and dark fruits. (Skurnik Wines)Firmly tannic, with fresh aromas and flavors of red and dark fruits. (Spanish Acquisition, Wilmington, Del.)Juicy, pure and refreshing on the palate, with rich, earthy aromas of spicy fruit. (Jos\u00e9 Pastor Selections/Llaurador Wines, Fairfax, Calif.)Concentrated, balanced, deep and rich, with earthy flavors of dark fruits and flowers. (Bonhomie Wine Imports, South Orange, N.J.)Young and firm, with resonant, lingering flavors of spicy dark fruits and menthol. (Sera Wine Imports, New York)Tannic yet balanced, with flavors of red and dark fruits and a not unpleasant earthy, metallic tang. (Ol\u00e9 Imports, New Rochelle, N.Y.)Pleasantly rustic tannins, with clear, pure flavors of red and dark fruits. (Eric Solomon/European Wine Cellars, Charlotte, N.C.)Quite tannic, with bold heady flavors of spicy dark fruit and notes of oak. (The Rare Wine Company, Brisbane, Calif.)Powerful, energetic flavors of ripe fruits, with plenty of oak. (Vintage Wines, Staten Island, N.Y.)Wintry weather and holiday parties call for celebratory food to share. In Ribera del Duero, the Spanish countryside north of Madrid, the weather can easily take on an Alpine chill. Game is popular there, so instead of the more typical beef, lamb, pork or poultry roasts, I opted for venison for this pairing recipe. The wines offered spice and fruit. I picked up on the spice with cumin and pepper for the venison and its sauce. But I avoided the usual tart-fruit component so the spices would have less competition, and I seared some shallots to go alongside. For venison, the rack is the easiest cut to prepare, and in a hot oven, it is quickly done. The meat is hearty and succulent, with just the faintest hint of gaminess. Be sure to cook it only to medium-rare or it will toughen. Unless you know a hunter, you\u2019ll need to buy ranch-raised American or New Zealand venison. It can carry a hefty price tag, and you do not want to be disappointed. FLORENCE FABRICANTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Housing Boom Is Already Gigantic. How Long Can It Last?", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWe are, once again, experiencing one of the greatest housing booms in United States history.How long this will last and where it is heading next are impossible to know now.But it is time to take notice: My data shows that this is the United States\u2019 third biggest housing boom in the modern era.That means, on average, a house that sold for, say, $200,000 in 2012 would bring over $300,000 in September.Even after factoring in Consumer Price Index inflation, real existing home prices were up almost 40 percent during that period. That is a substantial increase in less than seven years.The No. 1 boom occurred from February 1997 to October 2006, when real prices of existing United States homes rose 74 percent. This was a period of intense speculative enthusiasm \u2014 for houses and for financial instruments based on mortgages as investments \u2014 and it was also a time of great regulatory complacency. The term \u201cflipping houses\u201d became popular then. People exploited the boom by buying homes and selling them only months later at a huge profit.That boom ended disastrously. Soaring valuations collapsed with a 35 percent drop in real prices for existing homes, ushering in the financial crisis that enveloped the world in 2008 and 2009.Booms and busts are rooted in popular narratives with complex social-psychological roots. This boom centered on a war-induced housing shortage, an enormous increase in the number of new babies and families who would need housing after the war, and the 1944 G.I. Bill, which subsidized home-buying by veterans. Home prices did not fall significantly after this boom ended.Today, signs of weakness in the housing market are being taken by some as a signal that the prices of single-family homes may fall soon, as they did sharply after 2006. The leading indicators, which include building permits and sales of both existing and new homes, have all been declining in recent months.But with few examples of extreme booms, we cannot be sure what such indicators mean for the current market.Low interest rates \u2014 imposed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in reaction to the financial crisis \u2014 are the most popular culprit in the current boom. There is some apparent merit to this view, since these three biggest nationwide housing booms all included very low interest rates.But the market reaction to interest rates is hardly immediate or predictable. The housing market does not react as directly as you might expect to interest rate movements. Over the nearly seven years of the current boom, from February 2012 to the present, all major domestic interest rates have increased, not decreased. So, while interest rates have been low, they have moved the wrong way, yet the boom has continued.Another explanation is simple economic growth. But, as a matter of history, prices of existing homes \u2014 as opposed to the supply of newly built homes \u2014 have generally not responded to economic growth. There was only a 20 percent increase in real prices of existing homes in the 50 years from 1950 to 2000 despite a sixfold increase in real G.D.P.The simplest narrative being given for the current boom is just that the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the so-called Great Recession are over and home prices are returning to normal.But that explanation does not cut it either. In September they were 11 percent higher than at the 2006 peak in nominal terms, and almost as high in real terms. This is not a return to normal, but a market that appears to be rising to a record.It is difficult to assess the contribution of President Trump to the current boom.Even without major further interest rate increases, there would seem to be a limit on how much the prices of existing homes can increase. After all, people must struggle to cover a range of living expenses, and builders are supplying fresh new offerings to compete with the existing houses on the market.Perhaps the home price increases are now a self-fulfilling prophesy. As John Maynard Keynes argued in his 1936 \u201cGeneral Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,\u201d people seem to have a \u201csimple faith in the conventional basis of valuation.\u201dIf the conventional basis is now that home prices are going up 5 percent a year, then sellers, who would otherwise have no idea what to ask for their houses, will just put a price based on this convention. And likewise buyers will not feel they are paying too much if they accept the convention. In the United States, we may believe that the process is all part of the \u201cAmerican dream.\u201dIt can\u2019t go on forever, of course. But when it will end isn\u2019t knowable. The data can\u2019t tell us when prices will level off, or whether they will plunge catastrophically. All we do know is that prices have been roaring higher at a speed rarely seen in American history.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Teacher\u2019s Long Road to Student Loan Forgiveness (and a $4,500 Surprise)", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyPublic service debt waivers require 120 payments, meticulous attention to detail and, for a teacher named Jed Shafer, an appeal to a new program.Jed Shafer\u2019s wife, Mary, riffled through the mail on Nov. 29, no longer expecting any unwelcome news.For a couple of years, that daily sorting of papers had been fraught: The couple had been mired in the federal public service loan forgiveness program\u2019s appeal process. Mr. Shafer\u2019s attempts to get credit for qualifying payments that he was sure he had made became a twisting saga, and they never knew what sort of bad news might turn up in the mailbox outside their home in Eugene, Ore.But earlier in November, Mr. Shafer had received word that he was among the first beneficiaries of a pot of money that Congress had set up to help many people like him. His loan servicer had wiped away all his remaining loan payments. So he and his wife weren\u2019t expecting any more surprises, of any sort.And so the saga of Jed Shafer, which I\u2019ve chronicled twice before, comes to a happy end. But for untold numbers of other public servants, the struggles have only just begun.The entire story began in 2007, the dawn of the public service loan forgiveness (P.S.L.F.) program. Not a lot of people knew about it at first, and the servicers that the federal Department of Education hired to process student loans did not always give public servants the best advice about how to become eligible for the program.Over the last year or two, many of the early adopters realized that they were doing it wrong. Some (or all) of their payments had not counted toward that total of 120, and they complained \u2014 loudly \u2014 to the Education Department, their servicers and their elected representatives. Plenty of them say they took the advice of their loan servicers only to discover, years later, that the advice had been wrong.When I first encountered Mr. Shafer in October 2017, the longtime teacher (he helped 124 dropouts get their general education diplomas last school year) had discovered that years of payments he had made were ineligible, because he was in what\u2019s known as a \u201cgraduated\u201d repayment program. All along, various servicers had told him that he was on track, he said.There\u2019s a catch, though: Your last payment before you put in for the new temporary program and the payment a year before that generally have to have been higher than what they would have been if you had been enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan.Got all that?Despite the complicated requirements, Mr. Shafer thought he might qualify, so he applied. In early September, he received a confusing rejection notice. Now, his servicer was tracking his eligibility in two ways: Under the P.S.L.F. column, his eligible payments had somehow been wound back to the mid-20s. But on the same page, there was a T.E.P.S.L.F. count as well. That one was at 116, four short of forgiveness.Something was working! And after a bit more correspondence and some additional paperwork and further adjustments, he got word on Nov. 19 that he was done and that his balance was zero. \u201cWe\u2019re now going to mindfully stimulate the economy in any small way that we can,\u201d he said. The couple\u2019s second car dates to the 1990s, but that will soon change.So about those checks. Mr. Shafer was persistent enough that his servicer seems to have ultimately determined that his good-faith effort to enter P.S.L.F. dated back 129 payments, not 120. And so it refunded those extra payments, one by one, check by check, in separate envelopes that showed up on the same day.Was there any warning? Any explanation? \u201cNope,\u201d Mr. Shafer said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to look at the man behind the curtain.\u201d\u201cThere are thousands and thousands and thousands of people like me out there,\u201d said Mr. Shafer, who now also counsels the frustrated public servants who find their way into his email box, desperately hoping to get the loan forgiveness that the law says they deserve. \u201cWhatever the amount of battle,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s been worth it if some other people can get that letter, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "These 5 Numbers Explain Why the French Are in the Streets", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it\u2019s not apparent that this single concession can clear the streets.The Yellow Vest movement \u2014 whose followers wear or display high-visibility vests used in emergencies \u2014 has morphed into a collective outcry over deeper problems that have plagued France for years: declining living standards and eroding purchasing power. Both of which have worsened in the aftermath of Europe\u2019s long-running financial crisis.Here are some numbers that explain why France has erupted.Many of the Yellow Vest demonstrators are protesting how difficult it is to pay rent, feed their families and simply scrape by as living costs \u2014 most notably fuel prices \u2014 keep rising while their household incomes barely budge.It wasn\u2019t always this way.Living standards and wages rose in France after World War II during a 30-year growth stretch known as \u201cLes Trente Glorieuses.\u201d Pay gains for low- and middle-income earners continued through the early 1980s, thanks to labor union collective bargaining agreements.The rich got richer, as top earners saw income gains of around 3 percent a year. Increasingly generous executive pay for very high earners has helped tip the scale.France is the third biggest economy in Europe after Britain and Germany, and the world\u2019s sixth largest before adjusting for inflation. Visitors to Paris can come away with the impression that the glitz of the French capital means the rest of the nation is just as well off.The quality of the recovery has been uneven. Large numbers of permanent jobs were wiped out, especially in rural and former industrial areas. And many of the new jobs being created are precarious temporary contracts.The growth slowdown makes it harder to resolve another French problem: the large numbers of people out of work.Unemployment in France has been stuck between 9 percent and 11 percent since 2009, when the debt crisis hit Europe. Joblessness has drifted back down to 9.1 percent today from 10.1 percent when Mr. Macron was elected. But it is still more than double the level in Germany.Mr. Macron promised to lower unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022, and has acknowledged that a failure to do so could fan the flames of populism.But to achieve that, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory, an independent research group.Mr. Macron has tried to re-energize the French economy.As part of his plan to stimulate the economy, Mr. Macron cut taxes for France\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers during his first year in office, including by creating a flat tax for capital income.But the centerpiece of the tax package, and the one that has drawn the most ire from protesters, did away with a wealth tax that applied to many assets of France\u2019s richest households, replacing it with one that applied only to their real estate holdings.That lowered by \u20ac3.2 billion, or $3.6 billion, the amount of revenue the state received this year.Even before the Yellow Vests took to the streets, Mr. Macron realized that support was withering, and his government tried to pivot toward those left behind in the previous round of tax cuts.While polls show that the Yellow Vests have the backing of three-quarters of the population, questions have swirled about how much pain the protesters are really experiencing \u2014 or how much of the outpouring can be chalked up to a centuries-old culture of demonstrating against change.France protects citizens with one of the most generous social safety nets in the world, with over one-third of its economic output spent on welfare protection, more than any other country in Europe.In 2016, France spent around \u20ac715 billion on health care, family benefits and unemployment, among other support.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JD.com Chief Richard Liu Will Not Be Charged With Sexual Assault", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe county attorney\u2019s office said it did not find enough evidence to pursue a case against Mr. Liu, a 45-year-old internet tycoon who was arrested in the early morning of Sept. 1 but released within hours and allowed to return to China.The decision could bring Mr. Liu, who founded and leads JD.com, back to a more visible role at his e-commerce behemoth. JD.com\u2019s stock has slumped since the accusations were revealed, and Mr. Liu, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, has skipped several public engagements.\u201cAs is the case in too many sexual assault incidents, it was a complicated situation,\u201d Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, said in a statement. \u201cIt is also similar to other sexual assault cases with the suspect maintaining the sex was consensual.\u201dJD.com said in a statement that it was pleased with the decision. Jill Brisbois, Mr. Liu\u2019s lawyer, reiterated in a statement her \u201cstrong belief from the very beginning that my client is innocent,\u201d adding that \u201cMr. Liu\u2019s reputation has been damaged like anyone falsely accused of a crime\u201d because of \u201cmisinformation and speculation that has been widely circulated.\u201dWil Florin, a lawyer for the woman, said he was considering bringing a civil case, adding that prosecutors had made their decision having never met or spoken with his client. Chuck Laszewski, a spokesman for the county attorney\u2019s office, declined to comment on Mr. Florin\u2019s claim.Also present that evening was a 21-year-old woman, a Chinese student who was volunteering for the doctoral program. As she later told police, she had been invited to the dinner by another Chinese executive in the program, who asked her to sit next to Mr. Liu.She told police that she got into a car with Mr. Liu after the dinner, and he began to touch her without her consent. She asked to be taken back to her apartment, where he forced himself upon her, despite her pleas, she told police.But Ms. Brisbois, in an email, said the woman was being \u201cflirtatious\u201d in the car and agreed to the contact with Mr. Liu. Ms. Brisbois said that the woman invited Mr. Liu into her apartment building and that \u201cwhat happened in the room was entirely consensual.\u201d\u201cThe woman was an active and willing participant and at no time did she indicate in any way that she did not consent,\u201d Ms. Brisbois said. The following day, the woman sent text messages to friends saying that Mr. Liu had raped her.Police were called to the apartment by a friend and fellow student, according to the county attorney\u2019s office.Ms. Brisbois said she spoke with the woman after Mr. Liu\u2019s release, at the woman\u2019s request. Over several phone calls and texts, the woman \u201cmade repeated demands for money, and threatened to make her allegations public and to sue Richard if her demands were not met,\u201d Ms. Brisbois said.Mr. Florin, the woman\u2019s lawyer, said that a lawyer for Mr. Liu initiated contact with the woman about a settlement. Mr. Florin added that many of Ms. Brisbois\u2019 descriptions of events are \u201cdirectly contradicted by eyewitness testimony.\u201dThe Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s sex crimes unit conducted a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d into the case, the county attorney\u2019s office said, followed by a \u201cmeticulous review\u201d by four sexual assault prosecutors, a group of three men and one woman. They determined that \u201cthere were profound evidentiary problems which would have made it highly unlikely that any criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201dInvestigators reviewed surveillance video, text messages and witness statements. Among the evidence was footage from a body camera worn by an officer that recorded conversations between Mr. Liu and the woman at her apartment after police arrived.The county attorney\u2019s office declined to provide more detail, saying prosecutors \u201cdo not want to re-victimize the young woman.\u201dIn his statement on social media, Mr. Liu apologized to his wife, Zhang Zetian, and said he felt \u201cdeep regret and remorse.\u201d\u201cI will continue to try in every possible way to repair the impact on my family and to fulfill my responsibility as a husband,\u201d he said.JD.com is a proud emblem of China\u2019s rising consumer class, and a major partner to global brands, like Adidas and Samsung, that use the platform. Walmart, Google and the Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent are all JD.com shareholders. And Mr. Liu is a celebrity tycoon whose rise from humble means to internet riches is the subject of many admiring books and television programs.The company\u2019s shares have lost around 60 percent of their value since early this year as it grappled with the accusations against Mr. Liu and slowing economic growth in China.The rape allegation against Mr. Liu has weighed on JD.com in part because he has never indicated who might succeed him as chief executive. Mr. Liu controls nearly 80 percent of shareholder votes at the company, thanks to a special class of stock with 20 times the voting power of regular shares.That appears to be changing, a little. In a November conference call, Mr. Liu told analysts that he would focus more on strategy and new businesses at JD.com in the future, leaving more of the management of mature businesses to subordinates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Shutdown for Weeks? Washington Merely Shrugs", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a partial shutdown of the federal government entered its second day on Sunday and the prospect of a quick resolution to a dispute over President Trump\u2019s border wall slipped further out of grip, a normally fevered Washington found itself mustering little more than a collective shrug.Ringing in the new year with the government shuttered? So be it.That sense of resignation \u2014 and the decision to lay down political cudgels mere hours into the shutdown \u2014 was all the more striking when compared with the modern playbook for such crises, perfected in the 1990s but already put to use twice this year: use every tool at your disposal to pin blame on the other side, and then maximize the political pain to get your way.Instead, on Saturday, with Christmas approaching and the president unmoved, the Senate simply adjourned, choosing to leave the political battlefield unoccupied until at least Thursday afternoon. Negotiations between Senate Democrats and the White House essentially ceased on Sunday, with the two sides still at loggerheads over Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for a $5 billion down payment for a wall along the southern border.And though a few Democrats and Republicans traded obligatory barbs on the Sunday morning talk shows, some Republicans had a hard time keeping up the fire on Democrats after Mr. Trump\u2019s 11th-hour decision late last week to turn away from a bipartisan agreement in the Senate to punt the issue into the new year.\u201cThis is really much ado about very little,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWe have an impulsive president; we know that,\u201d he conceded, lamenting that the shutdown was \u201ctaking away focus from where it should be, from a really strong economy.\u201dSenator Bob Corker, a retiring Republican of Tennessee, has made no secret that he views the shutdown as an unnecessary and illogical farce, calling it, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d \u201ca made-up fight, so the president can look like he\u2019s fighting.\u201d\u201cCandidly, it\u2019s juvenile,\u201d he said.Even Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest allies, who helped push him to reject the bipartisan agreement in the Senate to avert the shutdown, described the dispute as essentially \u201ca rounding error\u201d in government funding and cautioned against poking too hard into Democrats\u2019 eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t think that raising the political pain is an appropriate negotiating strategy,\u201d he said.If there is any shift from the pugilistic tone that has defined Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington for two years, it seems to be at least in part attributable to exhaustion and the quiet conclusion among Republicans that there may yet be a bridge too far when it comes to following the president\u2019s lead.But there are other more tangible reasons as well. While some 800,000 federal employees from nine of the 15 cabinet-level departments will be deprived pay \u2014 either working without it or sidelined from work altogether \u2014 Congress, unlike in past cases, had already passed bills funding three-quarters of the federal government, including the Defense and Veterans Affairs Departments. That considerably reduces the impact of a prolonged shutdown.At the same time that Mr. Trump has tried to build support for his insistence on the wall, he has torn open a deep rift with fellow Republicans over his pullout from Syria and drawdown in Afghanistan, which many in the party and in cable news control rooms have deemed a more consequential break.And, unlike in earlier shutdowns, when lawmakers have worked through the night to try to bridge policy differences, Democrats on Capitol Hill see little reason to compromise, given that the president went back on his word to avert the shutdown and that they will gain even more negotiating leverage come Jan. 3, when they take control of the House.Mr. Trump has made a somewhat bigger effort to fan the flames, though with mixed results. He canceled a holiday vacation to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and on Saturday convened a handful of the archconservative lawmakers who had pushed him into the shutdown for a private lunch in the White House residence.\u201cHe is not going to yield,\u201d Mr. Meadows, who attended the lunch, said in an interview. \u201cAt some point he in some way is going to get money to support our border. He is resolved in that, and I looked him in the eyes yesterday, and I can tell you that he is firm.\u201dBut by Sunday, increasingly isolated inside the White House with no public schedule, Mr. Trump had outwardly moved on to other issues. On Twitter, he announced the expedited departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said he had spoken with the Turkish president about Syria, expressed condolences to tsunami victims in Indonesia, said the news media had not given him his due for criminal justice and farm legislation, and mocked Mr. Corker.Mr. Trump, who calls himself a master dealmaker, has made no effort to directly negotiate with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, who would have to agree to any wall funding. Instead, he has left the job to aides, dispatching one of them, Mick Mulvaney, the budget director and incoming chief of staff, to appear on television on Sunday morning to tamp down expectations that a deal could be coming anytime soon.\u201cIt\u2019s very possible the shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201dAs the comments suggested, negotiations between the White House and Senate Democrats have delivered nothing fruitful in the last several days.On Saturday, Mr. Mulvaney and Vice President Mike Pence asked Democrats to support a deal that would include about $2.5 billion \u2014 half of Mr. Trump\u2019s public demand \u2014 for border security, including new fencing, and $400 million for other immigration measures, according to people familiar with the offer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWe moved off of the 5, and we hope they move up from their 1.3,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said, referring to previous offers from Senate Democrats for $1.3 billion for border security.However, Democrats, while generally supportive of enhanced border measures but opposed to a wall, are finding little reason to budge because they see little political risk to anyone other than Mr. Trump over the shutdown. They goaded him into admitting as much at a White House meeting this month.\u201cIt really is in the president\u2019s hands to decide,\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cHe says it is an issue of border security. I think we know better it\u2019s an issue of his own political insecurity. When the right-wingers start screaming at him, he just backs off and dissembles in front of us.\u201dUnder the current circumstances, any deal to reopen the government will almost certainly not be voted on until Thursday, when the Senate is scheduled to reconvene.More likely at this point, Democratic and Republican aides said, is that the government will simply remain shuttered until Jan. 3, when Democrats take over the House and, most likely, elect Nancy Pelosi to be speaker. At that point, Ms. Pelosi could use her majority to approve a measure to fund the government for a year without additional allocations for a wall.That would shift pressure onto Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who would have to decide whether to take up the House bill over the president\u2019s objections or dig in and fight. And it would leave Mr. Trump further on his heels.That may explain why Mr. McConnell has been uncharacteristically restrained toward Democrats in recent days. Stopped by reporters on Saturday, Mr. McConnell, who controls the Senate floor, said that \u201cthe talks that matter\u201d were the ones between the White House and Senate Democrats.\u201cI\u2019m pulling for them,\u201d he added.Catie Edmondson and Katie Rogers contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Breaks for Charity: Who Benefits?", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersShould the tax law on donations be changed? Some say yes; others think that philanthropists may spend their money better than the government would.To the Editor:The tax code is written, in part, to incentivize certain behaviors. Lots of things may need fixing, but removing the incentive for charitable giving can\u2019t be one of them.To the Editor:It would make sense, therefore, for tax breaks to be classified into three categories. For genuine charity, the compassionate sort, given quietly and without fanfare, there would be the full break. Larger gifts for real needs such as the operating costs of hospitals or school tuitions would get a break of lesser magnitude.Self-aggrandizing philanthropy for the construction of egotistic monuments \u2014 especially museums \u2014 would merit only a minimal tax break, if any. The narcotic high of seeing one\u2019s name over a building in Harvard or a medical industry in New York should be sufficient compensation.To the Editor:To the Editor:I have a simple question for the gentlemen: Have you ever met any of the people who sit on congressional appropriations committees?I have. Once you watch them in action, it\u2019s clear that giving them more tax money to waste is a bad idea. The federal appropriations process is hopelessly corrupt.The one thing that might help would be to reduce the size and scope of the federal government so that more spending decisions are made at the local level. The closer to home the decision-making, the greater the possibility of fiscal discipline. The average taxpayer knows there is no accountability for congressional decisions made thousands of miles away.To the Editor:This would ultimately reduce the tax burden on individuals, but, even more important, it would finally yield that holy grail, a tax return the size of a postcard, thus freeing up an entire army of accountants to do real, productive work for the economy instead of extracting millions of dollars from taxpayers to help them file returns every year.Of course charitable organizations will fight this initially, but I believe that the elimination of the tax deduction will not keep people from giving.

But in Guatemala, the unceasing flow of citizens out of the country is seen as an indictment of their own government and its failure to provide opportunity, particularly for the indigenous groups that make up at least 40 percent of the population.On paper, Guatemala is not poor; the World Bank classifies it as an upper-middle income country. But those statistics mask profound inequalities, the legacy of centuries of racism and economic control by powerful groups that even now resist attempts to soften the sharp edges of the country\u2019s systemic discrimination.Guatemalans have always looked to migration to escape the entrenched divisions of their homeland. In the past few months, though, apprehensions at the United States\u2019 border with Mexico suggest that still more Guatemalans are attempting to cross.Jakelin\u2019s father, Nery Caal, 29, was part of that exodus. He left for the United States because he believed that, with little formal education and a parcel of land too small to support the family, he had no hope of improving their lot.Mr. Caal\u2019s decision to leave Raxruh\u00e1, his impoverished municipality, was not in and of itself unusual. There has always been a steady flow of people migrating from there, with maybe 10, 20 or 30 people leaving every month, said C\u00e9sar Castro, the mayor.But in less than two months, Mr. Castro said, 200 families have left. He cannot explain the sudden spike, but he offered one theory.\u201cSomebody came and tricked people and told them, \u2018I will get you political asylum \u2014 and take a child with you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Castro speculated. \u201cIt\u2019s a new tactic, and people believe it because of their poverty.\u201dMr. Caal\u2019s family said he decided to take Jakelin with him because the young father and his lively, determined daughter were especially close.But Mr. Caal, like so many other migrants, may well have heard \u2014 from others who made the trip, or from the smuggler he paid to take him to the border \u2014 that he would have a better chance of remaining in the United States if he arrived with a child.There is little to counter the information provided by smugglers.Nobody has a television in the village, much less internet access, though the mayor\u2019s press officer has just begun broadcasting a news segment on community radio in Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 in which he warns people about the risks of traveling to the United States.Still, from time to time, villagers get good news: Someone has made it across the border to the United States. When that happens, the residents of San Antonio Secortez, the Caal family\u2019s community, set off firecrackers.In San Antonio, families eke a living from the land, growing corn and beans, and raising goats, chickens and pigs. For subsistence farmers in a cash economy, every quetzal counts, and Domingo Caal, the 61-year-old family patriarch, calculates his expenses in terms of how much corn he would have to sell to pay for them.During the country\u2019s civil war, which lasted from 1960 to 1996, Domingo Caal helped organize a small group of Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 farm laborers who pressed for their own land, maneuvering between leftist guerrillas and the military government, which waged a brutal war against many indigenous communities in the early 1980s.\u201cYou had to watch your skin,\u201d he said.The army carried out some of its deadliest massacres under the presidency of Gen. Romeo Lucas Garc\u00eda in the department of Alta Verapaz, where the Caal family lives, and neighboring departments. The names of the targeted villages are seared into Guatemala\u2019s memory.The fields no longer yield what they once did, Mr. Caal said. He is unsure whether changing weather patterns or declining soil quality may be to blame, or perhaps something else. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of God or if it\u2019s our own fault,\u201d he said.As the forest to the north is overtaken by oil palm plantations, there are fewer wild deer and boar to hunt and the large catches of river fish have dwindled, he said.\u201cThen the family grew,\u201d said Mr. Caal, whose one-room dirt-floor wooden house is the center of the family\u2019s activity. At one end, the women cook over an open wood stove. The family eats at a long wooden table.Family members gathered there agreed that it has become harder to get by.\u201cThere is no space, no opportunity,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Caal Cuz, 33, Domingo Caal\u2019s eldest son.Still, a few services do make their way to San Antonio Secortez. When a traveling nurse, Arnoldo Quib Che, made his monthly visit on Monday to check on the village\u2019s children and pregnant women, Ms. Maquin brought in her 6-month-old daughter, Angela, Jakelin\u2019s sister, concerned about the baby\u2019s slight fever.Although almost 50 percent of Guatemala\u2019s children are malnourished, in San Antonio Secortez babies are breast-fed and there is no money for junk food. Families eat mostly what they raise themselves, including chicken and eggs, said Deysi Amarilis Alvarado, an auxiliary nurse.Jakelin\u2019s medical records, brought out by Ms. Alvarado, show the girl had been growing normally.Despite her grief, Ms. Maquin does not want her husband to come home and help her raise the couple\u2019s three remaining children: Audel, 9, Elvis, 5, and Angela. Mr. Caal is staying at a migrant shelter in El Paso, while the El Paso County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office conducts Jakelin\u2019s autopsy.Over the past few days, she consented to photos and interviews because, she said, she hoped it would help her husband win the right to stay and work in the United States.Ms. Maquin sees no other route out of her poverty \u2014 now increased by their debt to the smuggler who took her husband and Jakelin to the border. The family will not say how much they paid, but Mr. Castro estimated it at between $5,000 to $10,000.Ms. Maquin said her husband had not decided to make the trip lightly.\u201cHe had been talking about going for awhile,\u201d she said. \u201cThe land here just isn\u2019t enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Policy Gyrations Threaten Fragile Republican Coalition", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s near-simultaneous decisions this week to force a government shutdown over his demand to fund a border wall and withdraw American troops from Syria and Afghanistan have imperiled the fragile Republican coalition, exacerbating the party\u2019s fears about what may become of his presidency \u2014 and its own electoral prospects in 2020.By placating the far right on immigration, embracing his instincts on foreign policy and unnerving investors with his trade wars and policy gyrations, Mr. Trump is elevating the nativist and noninterventionist elements of his party. In doing so, he is deeply straining his most important links to mainstream Republican governance, and the national security hawks and conservative business executives who have long been pillars of the right.And by disregarding the counsel of seasoned advisers, Mr. Trump demonstrated that he does not grasp how damaging his impulsive behavior was to his party in last month\u2019s elections, when his party lost 40 seats in the House, senior Republicans said Friday.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve fixed the problems that caused the midterm losses yet, and I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re on a trajectory to do so,\u201d said Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican who lost his re-election bid because of the suburban backlash.Choosing to shut down the government after conservative media personalities belittled him for caving on his demand for border funding, the president proved that he remains more fixated on pleasing his base than winning back moderate voters he has alienated.Yet inside the Senate, Republicans were on edge because the president\u2019s approach to national security was both rash and anathema to long-held G.O.P. views on America\u2019s global leadership. After musing during his campaign about pursuing noninterventionist policies, Mr. Trump has now decided to embrace his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach \u2014 to the alarm of some traditionalists in his party.\u201cPeople are becoming significantly concerned,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have issues on the domestic side. When you start willy-nilly foreign policy moves that are against U.S. interests, that is a wake-up call for people in the Senate.\u201dMr. Corker, who has repeatedly clashed and reconciled with the president in recent years, raised doubts about Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for the job and whether he would even seek re-election.\u201cI question whether he runs again,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cHe\u2019s having difficulty handling the situation. I don\u2019t think he understands the seriousness of what he just did in Syria.\u201dBy the end of this week, even some Republican lawmakers who generally support Mr. Trump were voicing concern about what they suggested was a careening presidency. The departure of Jim Mattis as defense secretary, in particular, has deeply shaken senior Republicans who saw him as the single most stabilizing force in an erratic administration.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both leveled unusually sharp critiques, at least by their standards, after the Syria decision and Mr. Mattis\u2019s subsequent resignation.Mr. McConnell, who rarely rebukes the president in public, issued a statement stating he was \u201cparticularly distressed\u201d that Mr. Mattis had quit. And Mr. Graham took to the Senate floor, where he called the withdrawal from Syria \u201cdisastrous\u201d and a \u201cstain on the honor\u201d of the United States while accusing Mr. Trump of peddling \u201cfake news\u201d by announcing the defeat of the Islamic State.The shutdown, capricious foreign policy moves and the Mattis resignation all came against the backdrop of the deepening investigations into Mr. Trump and his 2016 campaign that are enveloping his White House.\u201cI\u2019m just concerned about the disarray,\u201d added Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. \u201cThings have got to calm down.\u201dSenator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, was just as blunt about the specter of more Trumpian turmoil.\u201cIf this continues for two years obviously it\u2019ll be problematic,\u201d he said, before offering a more hopeful, if still revealing, note: \u201cHe has a habit of responding to his impulses but then those are tempered.\u201dYet that unpredictable behavior is what has so many Republicans alarmed at the impending departures of Mr. Mattis and the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly.For the first half of this administration, traditional Republicans and many mainstream G.O.P. voters had been able to assuage their reservations about Mr. Trump by looking at the economy\u2019s steady growth, the president\u2019s growing bond with congressional Republicans and, perhaps most important of all, the sturdy team of military officers guiding him on national security.But those totems of normalcy disappeared this week, or seemed to, as Mr. Trump suddenly signaled troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan, Mr. Mattis resigned in protest, the federal government headed toward a shutdown and the stock market fell sharply.Perhaps no Republicans are more on edge than those who will be on the ballot with the president in 2020. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, perhaps the most vulnerable Republican senator up for re-election, suggested the president needed to recognize the damage he was inflicting with the suburban voters who are so pivotal to the party.\u201cI think conduct matters and I think message matters and we need to do a better job,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institution fellow who advised Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012, said Mr. Trump was sorely testing the strength of his political support. Mr. Chen, who counsels a number of influential congressional Republicans, said Mr. Trump\u2019s drastic shift in the national security arena had the potential to be destabilizing on the right.\u201cThe change in policy in Syria really highlighted the tension that exists between mainstream conservatives and elements of the Trump coalition,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known these tensions were there, but now we\u2019re actually seeing it in a very visceral way.\u201dMr. Chen also noted that the president had erased his chance to claim a signature bipartisan victory on criminal justice reform, stepping on a celebratory bill signing in the Oval Office on Friday by predicting the country could be facing \u201ca very long shutdown.\u201dStill, Mr. Chen noted that Mr. Trump retained overwhelming support from House Republicans, especially after nearly all of the chamber\u2019s Republican Trump skeptics were defeated for re-election last month, leaving the G.O.P. caucus smaller and even more committed to hard-line politics.To some Republicans already smarting from their electoral losses in November, Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior this week was an all-too-disturbing echo of the final weeks of the midterm campaign. The president insisted on campaigning on an alarmist message about the border, stoking the anger of his white, rural base but driving more moderate voters away from his party.Some long-serving Republicans in once-safe districts went down to defeat. Polling analysis conducted by both parties after the election found that a sizable share of voters who routinely voted for Republicans in the past had defected to the Democratic side.At the same time, Mr. Trump failed to trumpet a growing economy during the midterms; now that the markets are sliding, he may face an increasingly serious political challenge.David Winston, a Republican pollster who earlier this month released an unsparingly critical analysis of his party\u2019s midterm messaging, warned that voters were highly attuned to the fluctuations of the Dow Jones industrial average because of its implications for their retirement savings. Even voters in Mr. Trump\u2019s base would not be immune to dismay about an economic slowdown, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a priority to his coalition,\u201d Mr. Winston said of the economy. \u201cRepublicans, independents \u2014 the economy is important to everybody.\u201dOr as Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and adviser to Mr. McConnell put it, \u201cI know we\u2019re talking about the shutdown and Mattis, but to me the most real conversation we need to be worried about is how are these people viewing the free-fall in the stock market.\u201dStill, it was Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic behavior this week on national security \u2014 ignoring the pleas of his most senior aides and not even consulting his military advisers, let alone Congress \u2014 that startled veteran Republican lawmakers.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about what happened in Syria and then the comments about Afghanistan,\u201d said Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \u201cTo me these are two decisions that, No. 1, probably should have been discussed with me and others and, No. 2, I don\u2019t think were good decisions.\u201dHe said he planned to talk to Mr. Mattis on Friday and called Mr. Trump\u2019s decision not to take the counsel of his military advisers \u201cinappropriate.\u201dSenator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican and former Marine, said he was \u201cvery worried about a policy that has an American presence to stabilize that particular area and then leave suddenly.\u201dThe way it was done, Mr. Roberts said, \u201cwas not wise.\u201dAsked if he was still comfortable with the president and his conduct, the 38-year lawmaker, who is planning to spend the holidays deciding whether he will run for re-election, raised his voice.\u201dComfortable?\u201d Mr. Roberts asked. \u201cComfortable? Comfortable is not a word I would describe the situation today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Young Women Have to Play Catch-Up in Retirement Savings", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Lindsay Corner, 25, saving for retirement has a greater urgency than for many of her peers.\u201cNone of my girlfriends talk about it, but I feel fairly confident about managing money and finances,\u201d Ms. Corner said. \u201cI learned about it from my parents and, in college, I studied accounting and finance and took a personal finance class.\u201dMs. Corner, a senior tax analyst from Durham, N.C., began setting aside funds as soon as she graduated in the spring of 2015. \u201cMy first employer offered a 401(k) retirement plan and matched 3 percent of my contribution. I contributed 15 percent of my salary,\u201d she said.She has since increased that amount to 18 percent. \u201cRetirement does not seem like too far away to be saving for,\u201d Ms. Corner said. \u201cI can see why people my age might have that perception, but for me that wasn\u2019t the case. Taking these classes in school really opened my eyes up to it. We would see examples: If you save this much now, this is how much it\u2019s going to be worth later, and you would be, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I would be crazy not to start to save early.\u2019\u201dSaving is a habit for Ms. Corner. \u201cI don\u2019t see the money that goes into my 401(k) account, so it\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even miss it.\u201d\u201cSixty-one percent of women would rather talk about their own death than money,\u201d said Maddy Dychtwald, co-founder of Age Wave. \u201cAnd only 46 percent of millennial women say they are confident in investing.\u201dThat\u2019s a problem when you consider the future for many women. Women typically live longer than men \u2014 81 years versus 76 years \u2014 according to statistics from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. By age 85, women outnumber men by 2 to 1 and a majority of centenarians are women, according to the Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study. This means that women are more likely to be on their own financially as they age.An early start to retirement savings can help change that crystal ball for younger women today, but for many women in their 20s, debt can be a stumbling block to savings.The pay gap, however, is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to the significance of increasing the savings of millennial women. An average woman spends 44 percent of her adult life out of the work force compared with 28 percent for a man, according to the Age Wave calculation.When a woman reaches retirement age, she\u2019ll have earned a cumulative $1,055,000 less than a man who has stayed continuously in the work force, because of the accumulated lifelong pay gap and work force interruptions to care for children, aging parents or a spouse, according to the Age Wave computation based on figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In part, the setback for both women and men in their 20s is the rise of the gig economy, and access to and eligibility for an employer retirement plan. While more than 94 percent of millennials like Ms. Corner, who are eligible for a workplace retirement plan, are saving, many don\u2019t have access to an employer plan.Ms. Blandin had a retirement fund with one of her former employers. \u201cThen I moved on to a different job, and I took that money out\u201d \u2014 about $7,000, she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the craziest thing? I knew it was a bad idea, but I didn\u2019t have an option. I needed to pay off the last of my student loans and credit card debts that had built up from buying furniture for my apartment and purchasing nice office clothes \u2014 I didn\u2019t even have dress pants.\u201d\u201cThe biggest challenge, honestly, is getting started,\u201d Ms. Blandin said. \u201cYou get to this point when you are on your own, and you want to be responsible and put money away, and you realize it\u2019s important, but knowing how to do that gets really complicated. There is all this financial jargon that is hard to understand and you kind of get stuck.\u201dBut about 63 percent of women ages 18 to 29 say \u201cfinancial planning is too difficult to even think about,\u201d Ms. Dychtwald said.One way Ms. Blandin is seeking extra funds to open a Roth IRA is \u201ca side hustle,\u201d she said. \u201cI do sports and concert photography. A lot of my girlfriends do side hustles. One of my friends cooks vegan food, and she caters events. There are people who pick up bar shifts. It\u2019s nice because you can do it within your passion.\u201dDeveloping a contract side gig through an online freelance marketplace like Upwork or Fiverr, or selling craft items on eBay or Etsy, \u201cis a great way to have an incremental pot on the side to use for savings,\u201d Ms. Braxton said.And Ms. Blandin makes it a point to negotiate her salary. \u201cI revisit my pay with my boss regularly and set time aside to discuss everything that I\u2019m doing.\u201dNegotiating for higher pay can make a big difference in the amount young women can set aside for retirement. \u201cI am encouraged by what I see,\u201d Ms. Braxton said. \u201cI have several 20-somethings who have sought me out for help. I encourage them to negotiate as much as they can for salary because more money means more resources all the way around for the rest of their lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Metal Is Worth More Than Gold, and It Scrubs Your Car\u2019s Exhaust", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPalladium, a silvery-white metal used in cars and sometimes jewelry, has topped gold in commodities trading for the last three days. Gold was long the most valuable of precious metals, until, suddenly, it wasn\u2019t.Palladium hit a record high on Wednesday before settling in at $1,255.12 an ounce at the market close in London on Thursday, according to data from SP Angel, an investment research firm. Gold was $1,243.02 an ounce.It is an impressive dethroning aided by economic shifts, antipollution legislation, union campaigns by mine workers and global trade negotiations. Until recently, palladium was perhaps best known for sharing a name with several popular entertainment venues and for powering the fictional arc reactor mechanism hooked up to Iron Man\u2019s heart.Its primary purpose is far less glamorous: More than 80 percent of the world\u2019s palladium is used in the catalytic converters that help vehicles manage their pollutant output.For at least the near future, palladium will most likely remain in high demand and short supply, experts said. Here, we explain how a metal usually ignored in favor of gold, silver and platinum has recently eclipsed them all.Palladium was discovered in the early 1800s by William Hyde Wollaston, a British scientist. It was named after Pallas, a recently identified asteroid. Recently, Ms. Windler was buying platinum online and noticed a price chart that listed palladium as more expensive.\u201cI thought, \u2018that can\u2019t be right; it must be some kind of typo,\u2019\u201d she said.Increasing efforts to regulate tailpipe emissions in the 1970s paved the way for palladium\u2019s gradual popularity.The metal, along with platinum and rhodium, helps keep toxic exhaust in check by reacting with carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide to make them less harmful. For decades, palladium has been a major, but largely unseen, component of cars. \u201cThat\u2019s collectively weighing on demand for new cars,\u201d said Rohit Savant, the director of research at the commodities research firm CPM Group.Demand for palladium has steadily increased for eight years and is expected to outstrip supply by 1.2 million ounces in 2018, and Metals Focus has forecast \u201cfurther, sizable deficits to come.\u201d As supply tightens, palladium\u2019s price has climbed. Sibanye-Stillwater, a South African company, runs the only commercial palladium-generating mines in the United States and expects to produce 468,000 ounces this year from its Montana facilities.A growing percentage of palladium comes from recycling. The metal is usually stripped from old catalytic converters and electronics, smelted and refined for reuse.Most palladium is sent straight from the mine into the automotive supply chain. Although the federal government began issuing an official one-ounce palladium coin last year, palladium is \u201cnot a big bar-and-coin market,\u201d said Philip Newman, the director of Metals Focus.Even as the prices for most other metals struggled this year, palladium hit high after high. Experts expect it to stay elevated for at least a few months.But coming investments by mining companies and shifts in clean-air technology could cause the price to slip. \u201cThe last thing any of these companies want is huge swings in prices,\u201d Mr. Savant said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Official Tries to Soothe Nervous Investors", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A senior Federal Reserve official sought to soothe financial markets on Friday, emphasizing that the Fed is paying attention to investors\u2019 concerns that the economic expansion is weakening.But he said plans were not promises and that, if the economy weakens, the Fed will adjust.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go into the new year with eyes wide open, willing to read the data, listen to what we\u2019re hearing, reassess our economic outlook and take the right policy decisions that will keep this economy strong,\u201d Mr. Williams said in an interview with CNBC that aired shortly after markets opened on Friday.The contrast between the apparent strength of the domestic economy and the downturn in stock prices partly reflects the weakness of economic growth in foreign markets, where American companies reap a large share of their profits. It also reflects a striking divergence in views about the economic outlook.The Fed expects economic growth to continue next year. Many equity investors appear to disagree.The index is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, and the latest reading indicates the central bank is likely to undershoot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the seventh straight year.Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said pessimism in financial markets was strikingly at odds with the latest economic data. \u201cThe consumer is on fire,\u201d Mr. Stanley wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIf the stock market is trying to signal that the U.S. economy is crumbling, Mr. Market is wrong.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Stanley said that investors were also unduly concerned about the impact of the Fed\u2019s rate increases. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is now in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, a level that Mr. Stanley said was still likely to provide a little stimulus to economic growth.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Fed is tapping the brakes yet,\u201d he said.\u201cI would not concur with Peter,\u201d Mr. Hassett told CNBC. \u201cI think the appropriate position for an economist in the White House is to respect the independence of the Fed and not comment on their policies.\u201dMr. Williams\u2019s appearance on Friday morning was carefully calibrated. Fed officials are barred from speaking publicly about policy on the day after a policy meeting, so Friday offered the earliest opportunity to address the market\u2019s reaction to Wednesday\u2019s decision.Mr. Williams is also the vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee, and a close adviser to the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, giving his words added weight.The content of his remarks closely resembled the views that Mr. Powell offered at a Wednesday news conference that sent markets tumbling. He said that the Fed thought the economy was strong, and would remain strong, and that most Fed officials expected the central bank to raise rates twice in 2019.But there was a marked difference in emphasis. Mr. Williams said several times that the Fed was aware that many investors had a bleaker outlook, and that economic conditions would dictate the Fed\u2019s decision.\u201cWe are not sitting there thinking we know for sure what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.Mr. Williams also sought to make the case that investors had overlooked some of the nuances in the policy statement the Fed released on Wednesday. He noted that in previous statements the Fed said it \u201cexpects\u201d to continue raising interest rates, while in the most recent statement it used the word \u201cjudges.\u201d This was intended to reflect increased uncertainty about the outlook, Mr. Williams said.The Fed also included new language saying it would \u201ccontinue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The forces driving the recent swings \u2014 which have resulted in an 8 percent drop in the S&P 500 over the last two months, with some teeth-rattling ups and downs for stocks, bonds and major commodities along the way \u2014 are not anything new.First, three years\u2019 worth of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are finally starting to pinch interest-rate-sensitive sectors, particularly housing, the auto industry and companies with heavy debt loads. After years in which the economy has become heavily tilted toward industries that depend on low interest rates, a potentially painful rebalancing is underway.Second, investors worry that the trade war between the United States and China could start to pinch corporate earnings and economic activity more than it has to date. But that conflict has been building throughout 2018.Third, the tax cut that has lifted corporate earnings and economic growth in 2018 won\u2019t be repeated in 2019, meaning a harder slog for companies seeking higher profits. Growth will slow unless companies develop ways to extract greater productivity from their (increasingly hard to find) work force, which would be great for long-term economic prospects, but isn\u2019t the kind of thing you want to count on.So the answer to the first question, of why markets have become so turbulent when the economy is strong, is the simpler one. Markets look forward, and the risks looking forward seem increasingly ominous even as everything continues to go swimmingly, especially in the labor market, as 2018 nears its end.The consensus economic projections of Fed officials published one year ago show that they expected the economy to grow 2.5 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019. If anything, they were too pessimistic about 2018, which now looks likely to be north of 3 percent.But slower growth in 2019 and 2020 has been expected among mainstream economic forecasters ever since the tax legislation took shape a year ago.\u201cNothing in economics and markets happens in a straight line or without lags and feedback effects,\u201d said Blu Putnam, chief economist at the CME Group. \u201cThere are some big headwinds all coming from events in 2018 that we know about, but whose impacts are yet to be fully felt or appreciated.\u201dAnd knowing something bad will probably happen is not the same as knowing when. It evidently took another confusing series of developments in economic diplomacy between the United States and China for it to become clear.\u201cMost economists are good at analyzing fundamentals, but they know better than to forecast direction and timing in the same sentence,\u201d Mr. Putnam said.Part of the agita on financial markets in the last few weeks has come from fears that the Fed has been underestimating these risks, and is dead set on raising interest rates several more times next year even as the economy is still trying to adjust to the early rounds of increases.Those fears have eased some as Fed officials have signaled open-mindedness and flexibility about the path ahead in the last few days. But a tricky period for the Fed is only beginning.The optimistic case for 2019 is that a rebalancing of the economy is underway that will create both losers (interest-rate-sensitive industries and those that rely heavily on trade with China) and winners (everybody else).The risk is that this handoff doesn\u2019t happen as smoothly as an economic textbook might predict. There are always frictions that can leave certain regions and certain workers in a bad spot for extended periods.The tricky thing for the Fed is that it must set its policies for the whole of the United States; it can\u2019t set one interest rate for the service sector in big coastal cities and another for farm equipment makers in Iowa.With the unemployment rate at its lowest level since 1969 and average hourly earnings starting to rise a bit more rapidly, all the traditional signals point to continued interest rate increases being justified.So what markets have right is that this is shaping up to be a perilous time for the economy, in which bad luck or bad policy could easily create a major slowdown or recession. And that\u2019s the case no matter how strong things look at the end of 2018, or how long it\u2019s taken markets to reckon with that reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sri Lanka\u2019s Disputed Prime Minister Will Step Down", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s political crisis appeared to edge toward a resolution Friday when one of the two men claiming to be the country\u2019s rightful prime minister agreed to step down.On Thursday, Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that the dissolution of Parliament had been unconstitutional, striking the final blow to Mr. Sirisena\u2019s and Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s plans to take over the government.The legally recognized prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is expected to be sworn in again as premier on Sunday, members of his and Mr. Sirisena\u2019s inner circles said Friday night.The political upheaval has weakened both the president and Mr. Rajapaksa ahead of a presidential election next year and a general election in 2020. The Rajapaksa family was expected to return to power through both elections, but the turmoil has angered many Sri Lankans and hurt the already fragile economy as the important Christmas tourism season approached. Many tourists canceled their reservations as the political malaise deepened and the national currency shed its value.Namal Rajapaksa said his family\u2019s political party would work with Mr. Sirisena\u2019s party to form a broader coalition in Parliament. While Mr. Rajapaksa is expected to renew his demands for an early election in his address on Saturday, the family will probably enter any race with considerably less popular support than it had just seven weeks ago, seen as the chief architects of the recent turmoil.Members of the Rajapaksa family have admitted privately that the crisis has hurt their electoral chances in urban areas and that they were surprised when they were unable to secure enough votes in Parliament to form a government.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name and surname of Sri Lanka\u2019s current president. He is Maithripala Sirisena, not Mathirpala Sirsena. Maria Abi-Habib reported from New Delhi, and Dharisha Bastians from Galle, Sri Lanka.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Yellow Vests Confront Macron With a New Reality", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Emmanuel Macron\u2019s presidency was battling a crisis less than two weeks ago, blindsided by the gathering strength and fury of the \u201cYellow Vests\u201d protests sweeping the country. On the streets of Paris, demonstrators shouted for Mr. Macron\u2019s resignation or denounced him as an arrogant president of the rich.Now, after last weekend\u2019s protests turned out to be smaller and more restrained \u2014 partly because of quick economic relief promised by Mr. Macron, as well as a shift in the national mood following a terror attack in Strasbourg \u2014 he seems to have gotten a reprieve. The survival of his presidency may no longer be at stake, but its shape and direction seem certain to change.He was elected in 2017 in part on his promise to bring a revolution to France \u2014 in the economy, in the job market, in France\u2019s social welfare model. He has already confronted unions, rewritten labor laws and cut taxes for companies and the rich, in the name of spurring economic growth.But even if the ultimate impact of the Yellow Vests is hard to foresee, the movement already has forced Mr. Macron to backtrack on some tax increases and move to put more money in the pockets of the poorest workers. It also will force him to rethink his upcoming proposals to change laws on pensions and unemployment, politicians, pollsters and economists said.\u201cHe will have to change not only his approach but the content,\u201d predicted Mr. Cautr\u00e9s, who like many others say that the Yellow Vests movement is fueled by mix of financial inequality, failures in France\u2019s electoral system and frustration from a sense of being unheard.Taking to the streets and the highway entrances to towns and villages, and the free-for-all space of the internet, the Yellow Vests describe to anyone who will listen their sense that France\u2019s leaders are ignoring them. They take their name from the florescent jackets that motorists are required to keep in their vehicles for emergencies.Many mayors and other elected officials who have begun reaching out to local Yellow Vest members say Mr. Macron has little choice but to accept the project of trying to respond to the movement.They say that the emergence of the Yellow Vests reflects enduring problems in the French system \u2014 economic and political \u2014 but also say Mr. Macron has himself to blame.He came to the presidency without ever having been elected to political office. But rather than recognizing that he lacked an ear to the ground, critics say, Mr. Macron eschewed meetings with mayors and elected officials and refused offers by unions to work with him.Instead he surrounded himself with advisers who may have been smart but shared a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about the changes that real people could accept.\u201cBut in part it was unjustified because it was an accumulation of anger that built up over a long time, \u201c he added.Richard Ramos, a member of Parliament from Loiret in central France, where he still serves as a city council member, generally supports Mr. Macron. But like many mayors, he said that Mr. Macron had erred by not listening to local politicians before he moved ahead with his economic plans and his cancellation of a surtax paid by France\u2019s wealthiest people.Mr. Ramos said most Yellow Vests members he had encountered are wage earners or small business owners who want to pay their employees more but cannot afford to.\u201cThis crisis of confidence cannot be resolved with a 13-minute speech by the president,\u201d Mr. Ramos said.\u201cBut what makes it complicated is that the Yellow Vests do not recognize us any more as representatives of the nation,\u201d he added. \u201cThey say to us, \u2018You don\u2019t listen to us.\u2019 So before we can even talk, we have to renew their confidence.\u201dEveryone seems to have advice now for the president: on his personal style, on how to make citizens feel like he is hearing them, on how to formulate policy.\u201cYou cannot do a project, build something without sharing it, creating it with the people who live there,\u2019\u2019 said Jos\u00e9phine Kollmannsberger, the mayor of the small town of Plaisir, who was among a group of mayors who met with Mr. Macron this month. \u201cAnd I think the president has to function like that with the French people, otherwise he\u2019s not going to pull through.\u2019\u2019Some people are reminding Mr. Macron that although he won the election, in some respects he does not represent the majority.Mr. Cautr\u00e9s, the political scientist, sees Mr. Macron\u2019s election as a paradox of French democracy, in which legitimately elected politicians may not necessarily enjoy majority support.In France, presidential candidates compete in two rounds of voting, and the top two vote getters in the first ballot face each other in a runoff. In the first round Mr. Macron won 24 percent of the vote, primarily from people who really believed in his reforms, but in the second round, when he was up against the far-right Marine Le Pen, he got 66 percent.However, many voters among his second-round supporters were casting ballots against Ms. Le Pen, not for Mr. Macron and his agenda. That made his mandate for an overhaul shallow at best. He zoomed ahead anyway.\u201cHe said \u2018revolution\u2019, but many people did not agree,\u201d Mr. Cautr\u00e9s said.So now pressure on him has intensified to change both his style and the content of his proposals. Otherwise, political pollsters and local politicians say, larger protests likely loom, with a reproach at the ballot box that risks sending the far right to power.A poll released Sunday by IFOP for the Journal Du Dimanche found that if the first round of the election held in 2017 were held today, Mr. Macron would do slightly better than he had then, but that Ms. Le Pen would do significantly better, pulling ahead of Mr. Macron in the first round, and that the two would again face a runoff.Although Mr. Macron announced tax breaks and spending in his Dec. 10 speech to help the poorest workers and those on fixed incomes, and already had halted a planned increase in the fuel tax, he has not backtracked on his most consequential reform to date: an overhaul of the labor code. Nor has he retreated on the package of tax changes that included eliminating a tax paid by the very wealthy.The left has berated him for failing to reinstate the wealth tax while the right has taken comfort in his standing firm on the changes he already has made.However, Mr. Macron came to office proposing a half dozen major reforms. The ones he has yet to make will be the ones most affected by the Yellow Vests upheaval. They include an overhaul of the unemployment insurance system and of social security payments, and a downsizing of government.For Philippe Aghion, an economist who worked with Mr. Macron during the campaign and who teaches at Sciences Po, the problem is that reforming the labor market, which injects uncertainties into people\u2019s lives, should not be done without helping the middle class and working poor.\u201cThey liberalized the labor market, but they did not put the social protections in place at the same time,\u201d said Mr. Aghion, who believes when governments undertake structural changes to the economy, they must help people through them.Now Mr. Macron must do more to prove that he has the concerns of the Yellow Vests in mind, Mr. Aghion said. He said the president should be more generous on unemployment insurance, for example, and ignore advisers who are telling him to decrease it over time.The Yellow Vests are not going away.Pierre-\u00c9tienne Billot, 40, who was protesting with the Yellow Vests in Paris last weekend, said that for Mr. Macron the Yellow Vests were \u201ca bit like head lice\u201d that require multiple treatments.\u201cOne day they will come back,\u201d Mr. Billot said. \u201cHe will not be able to get rid of them.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hope and Betrayal of Blockchain", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsThis is the most revolutionary and innovative aspect of blockchain. But its promise could be undermined.Trust \u2014 the basis of social and commercial interactions \u2014 has been guaranteed for centuries by institutionalized trust providers, such as hierarchically organized companies and other third-party authorities. These trust mechanisms have worked for offline business models, but they are becoming obsolete in our hyper-connected digital world.In the past few years, however, some open platforms, such as Twitter, have become increasingly restrictive. Things have turned sour, as developers and early users feel betrayed. They had been promised open platforms but that dream was snatched away.Moreover, incidents involving several tech giants, such as Facebook, eBay, Uber and Experian, have shattered their credibility as reliable keepers of our data. Our fear of surveillance and data misuse has grown.Thanks to blockchain, people are now able and eager to take on the platform owners by engaging directly with one another via peer-to-peer, or P2P, distributed networks that run on a commonly agreed-upon set of rules. The resulting machine-driven trust allows users to avoid the fallout from centralized trust mechanisms, such as third-party control or unauthorized surveillance.In fact, the large centralized trust enforcers may soon give way to decentralized trust systems and P2P network-enforced reputation systems that blockchain makes possible.Under such systems, algorithms confirm the authenticity of each transaction and can record each party\u2019s identity, along with their trust and reputation rating, in the blockchain, which acts as a kind of ledger. Misbehavior is prevented because it is impossible to tamper with or falsify the ledger, and accountability is improved because all actions can be independently audited by any participant.It is Uber without Uber, Airbnb without Airbnb.This evolution is already happening. Payment and financial services providers like PayPal are being challenged by Ripple or Circle. Social media and networking services like Twitter and Facebook face competition from decentralized platforms such as Steemit or Akasha. Decentralized apps \u2014 software making decisions and acting autonomously \u2014 can be created and deployed on different blockchains like Ethereum or EOS. These are just a few examples.This beguiling transformation seems too good to be true, and distributed systems based on blockchain face a conundrum.In modern large-scale P2P markets, trust and growth are at odds: The more a network grows, the less trust users often place in it. But user growth is essential to the success of the P2P platform economy.This problem can be solved by making it harder to join the network (reducing user growth) or by centralizing control to a handful of trusted coders or nodes (reducing decentralization). Unfortunately, the blockchain community seems to favor increased centralization.Apart from business-to-business platforms, which generally run on top of private blockchains where governance is centralized by design, the fastest, most secure and most rapidly growing P2P platforms are based on public blockchain networks \u2014 which are all centralized. A handful of people make and enforce the rules.For Ethereum, the largest public blockchain stack, adopted by thousands of P2P platforms, the situation is even worse. The top five mining pools secure as much as 80 percent of the transactions in the ledger. The developers are concentrated as well: 20 percent of Ethereum\u2019s core code was written by the same coder.Machine-driven trust is about to jump from systems controlled by tech giants to systems controlled by a small group of anonymous tech gurus.If only a few members have the ability to edit the system\u2019s ledger and control the protocol, where are the open, transparent, free-to-use and universally accessible blockchains that so many hoped would bypass third-party control and surveillance?Ultimately, this new frontier of managing trust in the digital world presents a rather stark choice: Either we bargain away our privacy to centralized but accountable trust providers or we keep direct \u201ccontrol\u201d of our data via a trust machine run by a limited group of anonymous people who could go rogue.These governance problems undermine the credibility of blockchain as a trust machine for the new P2P economy. It seems that synthetic trust among peers is not supported by a solid set of principles. This lack of trust inevitably atomizes the community and fragments group solidarity, as evidenced by the many chains that have forked off from the original protocols of Bitcoin and Ethereum.For the time being, there is warfare to control those blockchain systems, and not a new common good that the technology still has the potential to deliver.Paolo Tasca is executive director of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies.Advertisement"}

He moves regularly, staying at each place anywhere from a couple of days to a few months. \u201cThe sharing economy has been transformative for me,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it has enabled me to live my digital nomad lifestyle.\u201dThe entrepreneur takes advantage of every kind of group-share service imaginable: home sharing, bike sharing, car sharing and more. Co-working spaces with reliable Wi-Fi have been particularly vital to him and his business. \u201cI\u2019m only as good as I am connected,\u201d Mehra says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to interact with other people who are out there hustling and working remotely like me.\u201dMehra recently got married in Portugal, and now the couple is back in the Washington, D.C., area for a short stint. But they plan to start traveling again as soon as they can. \u201cSharing other people\u2019s homes, cars and workspaces around the world has given me the ability to basically live like a local in so many of the places I\u2019ve visited,\u201d Mehra says. \u201cThat makes a big difference.\u201d\nHe was happy at how smoothly it all worked. \u201cI\u2019ve been renting out this car almost every weekend,\u201d Lower says. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful program.\u201d Maven takes care of everything from installing keyless entry technology to vetting drivers to a $1 million liability coverage during reservations. Lower only has to remember to keep the car clean, set the pricing and update the availability calendar. \u201cIt\u2019s a truly turn-key system,\u201d he says.Sharing the car helps him offset the costs of keeping it while Julia is away at college, Lower says. Another perk? He can tap into the Maven network and find an affordable rental for himself. \u201cEvery year I get mulch for my garden,\u201d he says. \u201cSo now I can use Maven to get a pickup truck for a day.\u201d And the best part is that whenever Julia comes home from college for holidays and internships, she still has a car to use.Now that he uses Maven, Lower has upgraded his plans for the family\u2019s next vehicle. \u201cOne day I thought: \u2018Aha! Maybe I'll get a sporty Camaro or a Cadillac ATS to share with everyone,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cCar-sharing makes you think about things differently.\u201d\nA sports merchandise analyst for a department store chain, Maben typically would go to a fast-fashion store and buy an affordable outfit that she would wear only a few times. This time, however, she took a different approach. Inspired by a co-worker who had recently signed up for Rent the Runway, a sharing service that provides designer clothes for a fee, Maben decided to give it a try.\u201cI was able to experiment with clothing that\u2019s more fashion forward, made by designers I normally couldn\u2019t afford,\u201d Maben says. \u201cIt made me step outside of my comfort zone in a good way, and I had fabulous clothes for my trip.\u201d\nMaben didn\u2019t cancel her membership when she returned home. She continues to use it to elevate her wardrobe, borrowing four pieces at a time and switching them out whenever she\u2019s ready for a new look.Besides saving money, sharing clothes has paid off in other ways. \u201cIt sounds corny, but you know the quote, \u2018Dress for the job you want, not the job you have?\u2019\u201d Maben says. \u201cI am wearing things that are more executive level.\u201dAbout four months after starting with Rent the Runway, Maben got a promotion. She won\u2019t say that her new role is a result of her new wardrobe, but she does feel that the clothes boosted her self-confidence. \u201cWhen I get dressed in the morning and I look at what I\u2019m currently wearing, it makes me really feel like, \u2018Oh, yeah. I\u2019ve got this.\u2019\u201dThis is not the only sharing service Maben uses: She taps into home-rental sites when she\u2019s on vacation and ridesharing apps when she needs to get around New York. The sharing economy has given Maben access to a world of opportunity that previously seemed unattainable. \u201cIt opens your mind to new possibilities, new ideas and new experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my entire lifestyle.\u201d\nPhotography by Heather Sten, runway image by Belish/ShutterstockThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Manhattan Real Estate Slows After Years of Record Activity", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s like we came off the autobahn: It feels very slow relative to the last three to four year years, but historically it\u2019s not.\u201dBut while brokers, developers and industry observers forecast more of the same for 2019, they aren\u2019t too concerned. The overall market remains healthy, they say, as does the local economy. Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, agreed with that assessment. \u201cSince 2009, the market has gone on a very aggressive ride, and I think it\u2019s normal that we see a bit of a slowdown.\u201dComparatively speaking, \u201csales are not low \u2014 they are just not unusually high,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we came off the autobahn: It feels very slow relative to the last three to four years, but historically it\u2019s not.\u201dIndeed, the average price for a condominium in Manhattan has risen 58 percent since 2008, according to CityRealty, which tracks unit sales, and the average price per square foot is 35 percent higher.During 2018, six apartment sales broke the $50 million mark, and nearly three dozen more closed above $25 million (though some were \u201clegacy contracts,\u201d signed during construction when the market was stronger). \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable by any objective measure,\u201d said Daniel Levy, CityRealty\u2019s chief executive.The year\u2019s biggest closings were two similarly configured duplexes at the just-opened 520 Park Avenue tower on 60th Street. The priciest property sold for nearly $74 million to James Dyson, the founder of the British home-electronics maker Dyson. The other duplex at 520 Park sold for $62 million. And downtown (which CityRealty defines as south of 30th Street) posted a record with the $59 million sale of a penthouse at the new Getty building at 503 West 24th Street, in Chelsea.Brokers say demand continued at all price levels, if not quite as insistently at the super high-end. But largely absent were the bidding wars of recent years and the rushed purchases from floor plans. Many buyers became more discerning as inventory, particularly in new developments, expanded. Others were more hesitant because of higher mortgage rates (which hurt the starter market in particular) and uncertainty about the new tax law. By Mr. Miller\u2019s account, there were 12 percent more housing units for sale in Manhattan than there were in 2017.As a result, developers have had to be more strategic to stay competitive. \u201cYou need to build in the right neighborhood for the right buyers, or offer something totally unique and in great demand,\u201d said Kenneth S. Horn, the founder of Alchemy Properties. He said sales at 250 West 81st Street, one of several new projects, have gone especially well because \u201cit was a new condo and there are not many new condos in that area.\u201dIndividual sellers, however, were slower to adapt to the changing marketplace, and saw their properties linger. As of the fourth quarter, it took an average of 152 days for a listing in Manhattan to go into contract, up from 101 days the same period in 2017, according to Garrett Derderian, the director of data and reporting for Stribling & Associates.Over all, the average Manhattan apartment price slid nearly 5 percent from 2017, to $2.06 million from $2.16 million, according to a year-end market report by CityRealty. (The drop would have been steeper without the pricey new-development sales.) Closed transactions for all condos and co-ops were projected to total 10,354, the report said, with sales reaching $21.3 billion. That\u2019s down from the 13,295 transactions and $25.7 billion in sales in 2017.\u201cThe larger story is volume,\u201d Mr. Levy said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s down, it\u2019s not falling off a cliff.\u201d Several luxury condominiums filled up in 2018, though the pace of sales and the average closing price declined significantly from the year before. \u201cPurchasers have more opportunities to select among many properties \u2014 they know they have choices, so they\u2019re taking their time,\u201d said Susan M. de Fran\u00e7a, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman Marketing. Developers also had to contend with fewer international buyers, who in past years were active in the new-construction sector. Some foreign buyers now face tighter restrictions for moving money out of their home countries, particularly in China.Within the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group\u2019s portfolio of new developments, for instance, about three-quarters of the deals were negotiated, on average, for 7.4 percent below the asking price, said Kelly Kennedy Mack, the group\u2019s president. Less common were purchases during early stages of construction (with the exception of the higher-profile buildings), she added.Developers were also willing to offer more incentives, Ms. de Fran\u00e7a said, absorbing some closing costs or adding in \u201ca storage room or a wine cellar in the top of the market.\u201d In recent weeks, Extell Development even offered to pay three to five years of common charges for purchases made by year\u2019s end.The CityRealty report projected that in 2018, 1,050 units would be sold in Manhattan\u2019s two dozen or so new developments, reaching $5 billion in total sales \u2014 a drop from the 1,848 units and nearly $9 billion in sales in 2017. The average price fell to $4.54 million from $4.79 million in 2017, and a record $5.16 million in 2016. Among the year\u2019s most active developments was 160 Leroy Street in the West Village, where nearly all 57 residences sold. Its priciest sale was to Michael Rubin, the chief executive of the e-commerce company Kynetic. He bought a penthouse for $43.5 million, which was below the $51 million list price. Also, One West End Avenue, on the Upper West Side near 60th Street, saw more than a quarter of its 246 units sell. Notable buyers included the actor Bruce Willis and the New York Yankees pitcher Aroldis Chapman; each acquired a four-bedroom for more than $7 million.While many top sales in 2018 were at brand-new developments, there were several pricey closings at buildings that have been around for a while.A penthouse on the 85th floor of One57, at 157 West 57th Street in Midtown\u2019s Billionaire Row, sold for nearly $54 million \u2014 though below its original $70 million price from 2017.At 432 Park Avenue, also on Billionaires\u2019 Row, between 56th and 57th Streets, two separate buyers, including the prominent art collector Hillel Nahmad, each paid a total of $60 million for pairs of half-floor apartments, presumably to combine them. The building, completed in 2015, remains the city\u2019s most expensive building, with the average price per square foot at nearly $6,000.And at 15 Central Park West, another Robert A.M. Stern limestone condominium, a duplex owned by the British musician Gordon Sumner, a.k.a. Sting, sold for $50 million, after a year on the market and an 11 percent price cut. (Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, are reportedly buying a place at 220 Central Park South.) Among other celebrity closings: The rocker Jon Bon Jovi sold a duplex at 150 Charles Street for $15 million, and the comedian Seth Meyers sold an apartment at 302 West 12th Street for $4.4 million. Both are in the West Village.For all of Manhattan, the average sale price for an existing condo unit fell to $2.91 million from $3.05 million in 2017, according to CityRealty\u2019s projections (though it\u2019s still more than $1 million above the average 10 years ago). \u201cIn some parts of the market, it is definitely a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d said Steven James, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman New York City. But he noted that sellers still have the upper hand in some neighborhoods, particularly downtown. In the West Village and NoHo, for example, prices per square foot were up around 10 percent from a year ago, according to CityRealty.Co-ops, which make up a major chunk of Manhattan\u2019s housing stock, also saw weakened sales volume in 2018, although average prices were slightly higher than the previous year.A total of 5,838 units were expected to close through the end of the year, according to CityRealty, a 15 percent drop from the 6,267 closings in 2017. The average price was $1.40 million, up from $1.37 million.Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage, said co-ops were better positioned in 2018, after price adjustments the previous two years. \u201cThey came down roughly 15 to 20 percent,\u201d during that time, he said. \u201cThey were increasingly a value compared to the condos.\u201dThe year\u2019s most expensive co-op sale was at 995 Fifth Avenue, across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, at 81st Street. An apartment encompassing the 15th floor was sold for $35 million by Joseph J. Plumeri, the vice chairman of the board of directors at First Data, a financial services company.There were numerous other notable closings. At 1 Fifth Avenue, near Washington Square Park, in Greenwich Village, the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards sold a $9 million duplex, while the actress Jessica Lange was poised to create one after paying $3.3 million for a unit above her apartment there. On the Upper West Side, Mr. Willis sold a duplex at 271 Central Park West, at 87th Street, for $17.8 million. And across town, the record and film executive David Geffen sold a unit at the Park V, at 785 Fifth Avenue, between 59th and 60th Streets, for $24.5 million.The Beresford, at 211 Central Park West, between 81st and 82nd Streets, also saw plenty of activity. The hedge fund manager William Ackman deeded to his former wife a duplex valued at $15 million, as part of an apparent property settlement. And Bob Weinstein, the younger brother and business partner of the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, sold a duplex for $20.5 million.Some of the year\u2019s most expensive closings were at townhouses, but like condos and co-ops, many of the transactions came with discounts.The biggest sale, at $40.25 million, was a 36-foot-wide house at 110-112 East 76th Street. The structure, originally listed for $51 million, was the largest of a trio of townhomes created from six brownstones by the developer Joseph Chetrit.Among the many other Upper East Side sales, the former Vanderbilt mansion, at 16 East 69th Street, sold for $39 million. And the six-story mansion at 4 East 74th Street, once home to the pop star Michael Jackson, was sold for nearly $32 million by Marc Lasry, the billionaire hedge fund manager and co-owner of the N.B.A.\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks.And Roman Abramovich, a Russian oligarch who owns the Chelsea Football Club of London, transferred four townhouses on 75th Street to a former wife. He also threw in two co-ops in a deal totaling $92.3 million.Downtown, a Greek Revival house at 37 West 10th Street in Greenwich Village sold for $37.2 million. In the West Village, Harvey Weinstein sold his townhouse at 13 Bank Street for $25.6 million.\u201cBrooklyn has been one of the hottest submarkets in New York,\u201d Ms. de Fran\u00e7a of Douglas Elliman said, adding, \u201cSome people who are priced out of Brooklyn are coming back to Manhattan.\u201dIn Brooklyn Heights, a townhouse sale at 140 Columbia Heights tied the record for the highest price paid for a single residence in the borough, at $15.5 million. The buyers were believed to be the actors Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany.A neighborhood record was also set in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where the brownstone at 247 Hancock Street sold for nearly $6.3 million, above the $6 million asking price.Brokers saw strength in new Brooklyn condos, too. Ms. Mack of Corcoran Sunshine noted, for example, that Cobble Hill House, one of several new projects in the Cobble Hill neighborhood, was 60 percent sold just two months after sales began in September.Emerging markets like Bushwick and Greenpoint are also showing strength, added Rory Golod, the New York general manager for Compass, and are likely to rise in value in future years.Looking ahead to the coming year, the market will \u201ccontinue a slow price correction,\u201d said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist of Terra Holdings, parent of Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. At the same time, he said, New York City should remain fiscally sound with low unemployment, as it enters a 10th consecutive year of economic growth.CityRealty forecasts that average apartment prices in Manhattan will rise slightly in 2019, to around $2.2 million, based on units under contract and anticipated closings in buildings like 220 Central Park South. Several other much-anticipated condominiums will officially open, among them: 15 and 35 Hudson Yards; Waterline Square; One Manhattan Square; and 111 West 57th Street.An earlier version of this article included a photograph that was published in error. The pictured showed 21 West End Avenue, not One West End Avenue, where several notable sales occurred.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chase for Talent Pushes Tech Giants Far Beyond West Coast", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This generation\u2019s biggest technology companies \u2014 including Apple, Amazon and Google \u2014 have long been tied to their hometowns. Now these giants are increasingly outgrowing their West Coast roots.Driven by a limited pool of skilled workers and the ballooning cost of living in their home bases of Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as President Trump\u2019s shifting immigration policies, the companies are aggressively taking their talent hunt across the United States and elsewhere. And they are coalescing particularly around a handful of urban areas that are already winners in the new knowledge-based economy, including New York City, Washington, Boston and Austin, Tex.\u201cThey\u2019re expanding out,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cTech talent is in very short supply. So if these tech companies want to grow and flourish, they need to find talent in other parts of the country.\u201dThe chase for tech talent has been global for decades, and Silicon Valley\u2019s older companies have had big offices all over the world for years. Intel, for example, has far more employees in Oregon than it does in California. Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies three years ago, has had large outposts in Idaho and Oregon.Amazon, Apple and Google are now increasingly adopting the same strategy as they hire for growth and pursue the brightest minds in new technologies, in an effort to outmuscle one another. Over the past two years, Amazon\u2019s work force has doubled to 613,300 employees; Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, has increased its head count by 35 percent, to 94,300; and Apple has grown nearly 14 percent, to 132,000 workers.Like Cambridge, England, some cities in the United States have also become known for a particular area of tech expertise, in what has become a modern remake of the country\u2019s industrial era, when cities came to specialize in the production of cars, steel and coal.The search for talent outside Silicon Valley and Seattle has also been prompted by issues in the companies\u2019 hometowns, which have not built enough housing to keep up with their growing work forces. San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Seattle are the four most expensive major cities in the country based on home values, according to data from Zillow. The median home in San Francisco is valued at almost $1.4 million and more than $733,000 in Seattle. Questions also abound over the quality and funding of the areas\u2019 public school systems.\u201cEvery day as a C.E.O., you have employees coming to you saying, \u2018I don\u2019t make enough to buy a house for my family,\u2019 and you already feel like you are paying through the nose,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the real estate site based in Seattle. \u201cAlmost everyone is looking at other affordable places where you can open an office.\u201dThat has helped push some tech companies into building major outposts in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economics professor, said that even if H-1B workers were to come through in abundance, it would still make sense to put them in cheaper cities, like Austin. He said, \u201c$100,000 goes a lot further in Austin than in Silicon Valley.\u201dMore than 44 percent of all digital-service jobs in the United States were located in just 10 metro areas last year, including Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, as well as New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston, according to research by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 2015 to 2017, only nine metro areas increased their share of the nation\u2019s tech work force, including the West Coast tech hubs, as well as Austin and Denver.\u201cThe tech industry concentrates in very few markets,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cOur biggest concern is how do we make sure more cities, particularly midsized cities in the middle of the country, can be players in the tech economy?\u201dAmazon, which has about 45,000 people at its Seattle headquarters, has also opened 16 tech hubs in the United States. About 85 percent of those satellite employees are in six booming, highly educated urban areas \u2014 the Bay Area, Washington region, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. Each has at least 1,000 workers.(The bulk of Amazon\u2019s North American work force is made up of the more than 250,000 people who are dispersed in the company\u2019s roughly 110 warehouses around Canada and the United States and who make less money than their white-collar colleagues.)Apple, which has been criticized by President Trump for not creating more domestic jobs, said on Thursday that its plans for Austin included a new 133-acre campus that will initially have 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations and other functions. It will ultimately be able to accommodate up to 15,000 workers.Apple already has about 6,000 workers in Austin. The company said it applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County.A person familiar with Apple\u2019s decision to expand outside Cupertino, Calif., where it just opened a new $5 billion headquarters, said the move into Austin was partly driven by the extreme housing prices in the Bay Area, as well as its aim to find more talent and add more diversity and military veterans to its work force.The company added that it also planned to open 1,000-worker operations in Seattle, San Diego, and Culver City, Calif., and to add hundreds of employees in Pittsburgh, Boston, New York and Boulder, Colo., over the next three years.\u201cIn a sense, what we\u2019re seeing is tech becoming a normal industry,\u201d Mr. Glaeser said, \u201can industry that\u2019s not located in one incredibly expensive place.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco and Karen Weise from Seattle.

{"Headline": "What Students Are Saying About: Wartime Journalism, Lessons from Athletes and Accepting Compliments", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationPlease note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.__________When journalists are covering war-torn countries, should they ever help those who are suffering \u2014 say, by offering them money, giving them food or rescuing them from imminent danger? Would doing so compromise the integrity of their story? If you were a wartime reporter, what would you do?Reporters are there to \u201cbear witness\u201dIn a food-deprived world, reporters are sent to assess the situation and report it. They bear witness to suffering people going through unimaginable pain, yet they do nothing about it. Should the reporters do something to help the people? Personally, I think they shouldn\u2019t. In a way, they are helping them with their news stories by spreading awareness to those in need. News reporters help indirectly; however, they shouldn\u2019t help directly. There are other people whose jobs help directly. Those are the people who should help, not the reporters. \u201cReporters are trained to bear witness.\u201d They are the ones who see it happen and inform us. The news they report let\u2019s the readers be the ones to help the people in needWartime journalists have to maintain a neutrality in order to provide the public with an informative report of the conflict. Showing compassion to one side may have led to critics saying that they had a bias because of their kind actions. Even though the New York Times journalists were unable to save or help Amal Hussain and her family, they were able to tell her story. The general public has a better understanding of the conflict in Yemen and how it affects families all over the country. Journalism may leave out the empathy people have, but the stories they tell speak louder and explore the deeper truths of the human experience.We\u2019d all like to say how we would give so much to assist the one poor soul who they were reporting on but what about the rest of the population that is starving? Instead of giving a little money here and there, the reporters are doing so much more by giving people stories to cry about, and if someone really takes it to heart and starts a charity fund for the reported community, the good that comes out of it would be because of the same person who didn\u2019t assist those in need at the time, but in a long term.This is a morally ambiguous gray area, a question that perhaps has no true answer. Reporters are trapped between their commitment to the truth and their humanity. Should they remain dedicated to the truth, recording events without interference or embellishment, or should they strive to change the suffering they report on?\u2026 However, reporters are not leaving the people that they cover with nothing. The publicity they provide gives the plight of many, for instance, the Yemeni, the worldwide attention they need to fix the persisting issues with their country\u2019s politics and economy. The fact that this very conversation exists is evidence in support of this idea. While it may not be direct help, the coverage given by reporters is an invaluable resources that has aided countless people. It is unfair to force reporters risking their lives for stories to contend with the additional foe of their own conscience. They do their jobs well, and in the long run, they do help people.Making a difference, no matter how smallThis situation reminds me of a story that I am very fond of. The story feature as a man walking along a beach with thousands upon thousands of starfish washed upon the shore. As he walks, he continues to throw them into the water. A young boy sees him doing so and asks him why, pointing out that there are too many starfish to make a difference. The man looks at the boy, picks up a starfish, and throws it into the water. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cit sure made a difference to that one.\u201dIn the article, Walsh points out that it might not be fair to \u201csingle out one person or family for help.\u201d Although it may seem unfair to other families, it will make an enormous difference to the family they elect to help. Although it may seem small, a helping hand can leave a huge impact on those families both physically and emotionally.Journalists should always help the people they are reporting on if they know they are able. There have been many times in my life in which I have been watching the news or seen footage online of news reporters in situations where they could have done more than just document it. While documentation of important events especially in war times, there is often always, even if it is small, something that could be done to help. If nothing at all is done, it can be hard not to be angered by the situation. After all, it is a reporter\u2019s job to be in a place when important events are happening. If these events are bad and something could be done, it should be!While reporters shouldn\u2019t be putting out fires or performing CPR it would not be wrong for a reporter to give food to a homeless person or help get an injured person to a hospital \u2026 In this situation, no matter what you are doing, continuing to do that, especially when you are filming seems incredibly disrespectful to not only the injured people but others helping them. No matter what your job description is, being a good person should always be at the top of your list of priorities.While I firmly believe in selflessness and helping those in need, the decision to help a person remains circumstantial: a journalist would need to consider culture, urgency of the situation, and other surrounding factors to make a just decision.In a situation where starving children in Yemen are being covered, I believe that journalists can \u201ctake the picture AND provide assistance.\u201d By choosing both routes, the children can be helped and the picture can raise awareness and funds to further assistance for them and others who are suffering similar issues. But in a country where men are dominant and women suffer domestic violence, it can be potentially dangerous to step in and help a woman; it may result in increased abuse from the husband that may lead to permanent disability, rape, or torture.Ultimately, journalists are responsible for informing the world of a dark reality that individuals are experiencing, and should also care for those individuals; but in a tough situation, one would have to fight the tension between consequences and moral principles to reach a conclusion.Life lessons \u2014 on and off the courtAthletes that use sports as way to stand for something more important than their sport. LeBron James for going back to his hometown and not only winning a ring for them but creating new opportunities in his community like the school he built with free tuition. Colin Kaepernick standing up for what he believe is right while being on the sport platform. Deion Sanders,even though he was cocky, he showed how to have faith and God and just live in the moment and love yourself even if no one else did.I have even learned from the bad like Ray Rice, Ezekiel Elliot, and recently Kareem Hunt that people are always watching your every move and that move could cost you and add more stress in your life then ever. Those athletes and others displayed how football is more than just football, basketball is more than just basketball, and baseball is more than just baseball.Ever since the 2012 Olympics in London, I have admired Aly Raisman. In the beginning it was just because she was a strong and entertaining gymnast who I loved, because she was Jewish, just like me. Now, I respect her for so much more. In January of this year, Aly Raisman came out about being sexually assaulted by the former U.S.A. Gymnastics national team doctor, Larry Nassar \u2026I learned so much from Aly\u2019s strength and determination to do the right thing. I know now, that if I want to make a change in my life or the world, I need to stand up and do something about it. I can\u2019t just sit back and wait for something to change. I need to fight for what I believe in and make sure that justice is served.Personally, I have been affected by professional athletes like Tom Brady, who was always doubted, and always told he wasn\u2019t good enough. Thanks to his incredible work ethic, he has risen to be the greatest in the world at what he does, and has a huge audience. I have never met him, but that doesn\u2019t mean he-and many other athletes- haven\u2019t had a positive influence on not only my life, but millions worldwide.Everyday role modelsProfessional athletes in the modern world are given a profound opportunity to influence the next generation. Millions of kids idolize their favorite athletes, viewing them as the pinnacle of human ability, larger than life. This unprecedented power allows professional athletes to affect the lives of their young fans as they mature \u2026Jarrett Allen is the ideal example of this form of mentorship. His efforts to improve his community by teaching children math rather than basketball are admirable and unprecedented for an NBA player. He understands that playing sports professionally is a rarefied experience that many try for, but few achieve. Instead of focusing on athletics, Allen asks children to improve themselves intellectually. This results in scholars, with realistic and attainable goals, not kids chasing a pipe dream.This sort of leadership should be noticed and exemplified more in professional athletics, because athletes can be great leaders and examples for us all. Athletes should undoubtedly serve as mentors for those who look up to them, because of the profound and public nature of the influence they carry. They simply must understand this, and use it to make the world around them better.Professional athletes are in a unique position to influence public opinion, especially of the youth. Usually, athletes give lessons in things like grit or perseverance or the value of hard work (many coaches and players have written their own books, Tim Tebow even wrote a pretty good religious devotion book).Athletes can (and do) teach us many life lessons, but not usually intellectual lessons like those of Jarrett Allen. I believe Allen has taken a step in the right direction, though; if athletes begin to encourage stem education, it could influence young children to pursue more ambitious careers and education than they ever would have alone. Because Allen\u2019s success in the N.B.A., he is able to create fantastic lessons\u2014such as his grocery store math lesson\u2014that encourage children to succeed and pursue higher education.Athletes are a big part of the world we live in today and many young kids grow up wanting to be just like them. They are huge role models for kids and I think that they can teach us a number of important lessons. They can teach us that hard work and dedication really can pay off and you nothing is handed to you or gotten easily but is accomplishable through hard work and dedication. I think that Mr. Allens real life math lesson was a great idea because it made the kids think while having a reason to want to do it. I have always had respect for some athletes that are good people on and off the court despite their fame and wealth. I think that athletes should be mentors because so many people look up to them and will respect their ideas.__________Why we dwell on failureIn today\u2019s generation, unimaginable pressures are put on teenagers to get perfect grades, perfect test scores, and to have a perfect resume to apply to the most elite schools possible. We experience so much stress about acing every test and exam, that we frequently forget about the things we succeed in.As a sophomore in high school, I am taking a selection of honors and AP courses, and I often ignore my good grades in one class if I am struggling in a different subject. I tend to perform strongly in my math classes, but need to study and work much harder in my English and history courses. I frequently will spend all my time worrying about these more challenging courses, and rarely acknowledge my higher scores in math classes. In the future, I will be working on having pride in my stronger grades, and not dwelling on the scores that are not as high as I would hope.As students, I think a lot of us tend to forget that we had to start from somewhere to get to where we are today. We might complain about the pressure from a higher level class, but if you think about it, it\u2019s a personal success to even reach such a high level.Personally, I tend to push off my successes as \u201cexpectations.\u201d I usually think that what would be considered a success isn\u2019t because it\u2019s what I should be doing, or should have in the first place. This is definitely relevant to me for grades. I often focus on the lower grades I have in my classes, but I do forget that all of my classes are difficult to even get to, and the rest of my scores are high. I should start recognizing the fact that already being in these courses and having a pretty decent grade is a success, even if it\u2019s not the highest I could get.This generation has many pressures put on them, stemming from school, our parents, friends, and social media. We\u2019re expected to succeed, so we\u2019re never praised for doing our best. Instead, the things that stick out, our bad grades or mistakes, are focused on and criticized. Never being praised for doing something right can make you discouraged and lead to lower performance \u2026Nowadays, we compare ourselves to so many other people, it can become overwhelming and cause us to developed insecurities and anxiety. We should instead do our best and not worry about what others are completing or accomplishing. Living in your own lane promotes self-love and the understanding that not everyone\u2019s perfect, which is something we all need to learn.I don\u2019t think that people today realize how talented they actually are and dwell more on the bad things that happened to them and the mistakes they made more so than the positive accomplishments they made \u2026I think that people are too afraid to look like they are bragging so they stay quiet about their accomplishments and begin to think that they are insignificant. This may make them think they are insignificant and then they won\u2019t do the best they can and it will be a cycle.Another reason this may happen is because you feel good when you do something good but when something bad happens then it gets stressed over and the stress will last until the situation goes away. This may make the person remember the stress more than the accomplishment as well. This is why keeping a list of accomplishment, as the author suggested, would be a good idea to help you realize that good things do happen everyday but you may not appreciate them or yourself enough.Learning to celebrate ourselvesSuccess can be defined in many different ways. The definition of success will be defined differently by certain types of people. Someone who doesn\u2019t achieve success as often as others will be more proud of a small success than someone who has many large accomplishments. To me success can come in many different \u201csizes\u201d. I give myself a lot more credit for large accomplishments than I give myself for the small accomplishments. To me, the bigger the success the more credit I give myself \u2026Recently, I lettered in academics at my high school. When I told my friends and family they were all so proud. Some told me in person, and some called or texted. I never actually did anything to celebrate my achievement, but I still feel really happy with myself! I think that we all, including me, should learn to be a lot more happy with our successes than our failures.I love achieving things. Don\u2019t you? Especially when it\u2019s recognized by yourself or others. That good feeling you get afterwards always makes it worth it \u2026 People are worried about being arrogant, but I say don\u2019t worry about what anyone thinks. Accomplishments are something to be proud of !I do tend to dwell all my failures more than my success, I don\u2019t know how to give myself any credit. Even though all I want in the world is to be recognized and praised for my work I am not a person to be arrogant or try to make sure people know of my successes.Recently, I have achieved a GPA of above a 4.0. I got congratulations and such from friends and family, but I did not know how to react. I should have celebrated more, for example I was offered a gift but I politely denied it. I should be more accepting towards people being happy about my success.Advertisement"}

But days later the Saudi coalition admitted that an aircraft had \u201cwrongly targeted the location.\u201dThe coalition \u201cexpresses regret over the mistakes, extends its sympathies, condolences and solidarity to the families of the victims,\u201d a statement said.\n  Saudi Arabia and its allies have been waging a ruinous war on neighboring Yemen for three years, with support from the United States. Armed with powerful fighter jets and warships, the Saudi-led coalition has employed tactics that minimize risk to its troops. But it has killed thousands of civilians and dealt a crushing blow to Yemen\u2019s fragile economy.\n\n  The architect of the war, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, initially promised a swift victory against his Houthi foes. But the effort quickly bogged down.\nSAUDIARABIAOMANSparselypopulatedregionHouthi     ControlYemenSanaHudaydahRedSeaGulf ofAdenAdenSparselypopulatedregionSanaYemenHouthi    ControlAden\n  The Saudis and their chief ally, the United Arab Emirates, fight principally from the air. Armed with American-made warplanes and bombs, they have carried out thousands of airstrikes on Houthi targets but also on hospitals, weddings and funerals.\n\n  Their pilots typically fly high to avoid enemy fire, which reduces the accuracy of strikes. They regularly ignore a voluminous no-strike list.\n\n  The United States backed the coalition from the start with sales of weapons and bombs, midair refueling of warplanes over Yemen, and intelligence. After the funeral attack in 2016 killed 155 people, the Obama administration blocked sales of precision-guided munitions. But the United States continued to refuel coalition warplanes. In May 2017, the Trump administration overturned the missile ban, amid a new weapons deal.\n\n  Mr. Trump said he did not want to lose the benefit of multibillion-dollar arms sales for the American economy. But the war was ravaging the economy of Yemen.\nYemen has always been poor, with high rates of malnutrition and disease. But the three-year war has ground its economy into the dust.Yemen\u2019s agriculture cannot support the population so reliance on imports is high: About 70 percent of food is imported. As the war continued, the coalition imposed blockades and restrictions.\n  Blockades, bombing, currency manipulation and a decision to stop paying public servants in Houthi territory crushed Yemen\u2019s economy.\nThe economy peaked in2014, the year beforethe war began.$30  billion(U.S. dollars)Yemen\u2019s GrossDomestic Product$10 billion1990\u2019952000\u201905\u2019102016The economy peaked in 2014, the year before the war began.$30 billionYemen\u2019s GrossDomestic Product$10 billion1990\u2019952000\u201905\u2019102016\n  The war pits some of the richest countries in the Middle East against the poorest.\n\n  Yemen has modest reserves of oil, unlike Saudi Arabia, whose economy is 38 times larger. But the war sent Yemen spiraling into an economic catastrophe.\n\n  Millions are jobless. Factories have been destroyed. This year the currency plunged sharply, causing inflation to soar. The Central Bank of Yemen printed vast amounts of new currency, making things worse.\n\n  For ordinary Yemenis, that means soaring food, fuel and medicine prices. The cost of a basket of basic food has doubled since the start of the war. People have exhausted their savings and sold their cars, land or houses. Many are going hungry.\n\n  The United Nations estimates that 16 million Yemenis, over half the population, are seriously food deficient \u2014 despite international humanitarian assistance.\nYemen\u2019s hunger crisis is nearing catastrophic proportions. At least 85,000 children have died. Food insecurity projections show that, without urgent action, a national famine is looming.\n  At least 6,500 civilians have died from airstrikes and other war-related violence, including some likely war crimes. But the greatest threat to most Yemenis is harder to see.\n\n  The economic devastation that pushed millions to the brink of famine and created the worst cholera epidemic in living memory is no accident of war: It is the product of deliberate policies by the warring parties.\n\n  The Saudi-led coalition, with its warplanes, blockades and vast economic power, bears a large share of the blame. But the Houthis are also at fault. They have manipulated relief aid, recruited child soldiers and planted vast numbers of land mines, according to aid workers and human rights groups.\n\n  Peace talks in Sweden in December offered a faint glimmer of hope for an end to the war. A shaky cease-fire in the key port of Hudaydah is holding.\n\n  But if politics fails, many fear that Yemen could lapse into even worse fighting. Famine could become a reality.

{"Headline": "Trump Names Mick Mulvaney Acting Chief of Staff", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced on Friday that he had selected Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to serve as acting White House chief of staff, putting a halt \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to his consideration of a parade of possible candidates, including several who turned him down, to take over one of the most important positions in the federal government.In Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Trump made a safe choice for a Republican administration \u2014 a hard-line conservative and former congressman from South Carolina with a deep understanding of how Congress works and a personal chemistry with the president. Among some senior White House officials, Mr. Mulvaney had long been considered the \u201cOriginal Plan B.\u201dMr. Trump made the announcement on Twitter, one week after his first choice for the job, Nick Ayers, a Georgia political operative who is now Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, took himself out of the running, citing family considerations. The sometimes chaotic search process that went on in between served as another measure of the often frenetic manner of decision making in the Trump White House.I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management & Budget, will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff, replacing General John Kelly, who has served our Country with distinction. Mick has done an outstanding job while in the Administration....\u201cFor the record,\u201d the president tweeted later Friday evening, \u201cthere were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff. Mick M will do a GREAT job!\u201dAt the beginning of the week, the president said there were 10 to 12 candidates actively vying for the position, but that list seemed to shrink by the day during what was often a highly public audition. Just hours before the announcement about Mr. Mulvaney, Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, whom the president was strongly considering, took himself out of contention.Mr. Trump met with members of his family and one of his top political advisers, Brad Parscale, before making his decision on Mr. Mulvaney.For whatever period he serves, Mr. Mulvaney will be trying to succeed where John F. Kelly, the current chief of staff, and Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s first, struggled. Mr. Kelly is set to leave the White House by the end of the year.While Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine general, was initially seen as someone who could work well with Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Mulvaney has a reputation as a sharp-elbowed partisan, who as both the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau pursued a strongly conservative agenda.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said Mr. Mulvaney was \u201chardly the kind of peacemaker\u201d needed to smooth relations between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill.\u201cWhat he did at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was destroy an agency and undermine its mission,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. \u201cHe seems to be a Trump surrogate with a clear agenda, and my fear is he will exacerbate divisions at a time when they need to be bridged.\u201dMr. Mulvaney quickly went to work on the president\u2019s mission. He seemed to relish his role at the agency, where he tried to vastly curtail its activities, including virtually freezing new investigations and changing its well-known name in an attempt to unbrand it.When he first took over, he promised to split his time between the budget office and the consumer bureau, which is within walking distance of the White House. But as the months dragged on, he spent less time at the bureau and toward the end of his tenure there employees reported seeing him no more than once or twice a week.Mr. Mulvaney was one of the few prospects for the chief of staff job who was seen as openly campaigning for it over most of the year. At one point, he told the president he was right for it because he was the only person in the administration leading a department that was not mired in scandal, according to a person familiar with the discussion.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Mulvaney was not resigning from his job at the budget office, but would spend all of his time as chief of staff. He will turn over running the department to Russ Vought, the office\u2019s deputy director, at a somewhat precarious time. The budget deficit widened to $305 billion in October and November, compared with $202 billion from the same period last year, the Treasury Department reported on Thursday.During Mr. Trump\u2019s first full fiscal year in office, which ended in September, the deficit surged to $779 billion, the largest since 2012, when the economy and federal revenues were still recovering from the depths of the recession. It is on track to hit $1 trillion before 2020.The deficit has surged in large part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut and the spending increases enacted by Congress, which have contributed to the government paying out more than it takes in. Mr. Trump has told federal agencies to start finding spending cuts to help reduce the deficit, a process that will require the budget office\u2019s involvement.Allowing such red ink to mount under his stewardship has been uncomfortable for Mr. Mulvaney, a self-proclaimed deficit hawk who envisioned enacting deep cuts across the federal government upon assuming the role of budget director.Similarly, many of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s budget proposals have pleased Mr. Trump only to be rejected outright by his former Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chose not to include Mr. Mulvaney in many of his budget negotiations, opting to work directly with Mr. Trump\u2019s former legislative affairs director, Marc Short.On Friday, a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there would be no end date to Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s role despite his \u201cacting\u201d title.\u201cThere\u2019s no time limit. He\u2019s the acting chief of staff, which means he\u2019s the chief of staff,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe got picked because the president liked him \u2014 they get along.\u201dIn withdrawing his name from consideration on Friday, Mr. Christie said in a statement that it was not \u201cthe right time for me or my family to undertake this serious assignment.\u201d An old friend of the president who campaigned for him in 2016, Mr. Christie was summarily dismissed as Mr. Trump\u2019s transition chief after the election and has been thwarted in getting the one job he has said he wanted \u2014 attorney general.Another possible choice \u2014 and the only person who said publicly that he was interested in the job \u2014 Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, was ruled out on Tuesday by the White House, with Mr. Trump saying he preferred for Mr. Meadows to stay in Congress.\u201cIf the president asks you to be chief of staff, the answer is yes,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cDo I think I would be good at it? I have no idea.\u201dReporting was contributed by Glenn Thrush, Alan Rappeport, Annie Karni, Nicholas Fandos and Katie Rogers.Advertisement"}

Or is it time to cut and run? More comments from readers are below. They have been edited for length and clarity.I\u2019m from Appalachia, where getting into the working class was an aspiration. I was raised \u201cup the holler\u201d and know the culture intimately. You have no idea of the amount of anger, self-righteousness, bigotry and willful ignorance you\u2019re dealing with. I have seen a blighted small town use a corrupt sheriff and judge to run off a business owned by a black man. I have been present when an entire community looked the other way when a gay couple was burned out of their home. I was born in a tiny central Illinois town. When I was in third grade, my parents made the decision to move to Champaign-Urbana, Ill., so that my brother and I would have the opportunity for a much better education. It\u2019s ironic that small-town and rural folk take so much pride in self-sufficiency yet won\u2019t move to improve their prospects. In the 1930s the government began implementing economic policies intended to move people off farms and into manufacturing, such as mines and timber mills. Small-town factories kept rural areas afloat for a while but were among the first to close in the \u201970s and \u201980s. At the same time, the farms kept getting bigger. We are seeing the culmination of all that now. A bison commons would not be a stretch. Ecological restoration is an urgent need across vast stretches of rural America that have suffered from poor land use, extraction industries, invasive species, loss of native biodiversity and a blighting of the rural landscape. There are huge opportunities for employment in restoration: native plant and seed nurseries, stewardship of nature preserves, creation of native pollinator habitats, hunting properties, sustainable farming and outdoor recreation facilities are just some. All it takes is a vision to \u2018Make America Beautiful Again.\u2019 And, of course, a reassessment of our values as a nation. Advertisement"}

The Swiss Have Their Doubts.", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As he prepares to become Switzerland\u2019s economics minister, Guy Parmelin is facing widespread criticism of his skills \u2014 in speaking English.The Federal Council, the Swiss executive body, announced last week that Mr. Parmelin would be the next leader of the Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research, a job that involves negotiating accords with other countries and with bodies like the European Union.The news prompted a wave of commentary from news outlets and on social media, much of it mocking \u2014 a reflection of how thoroughly English has become the language of international diplomacy and business. Among world leaders, a command of English is often taken for granted, even when translators are present.Critics recalled what Mr. Parmelin, a former grower of wine grapes, told reporters before he joined the Federal Council in 2015. \u201cI can English understand but\u2026\u201d he said in English, before switching to his native tongue to add, \u201cI prefer responding in French to be more precise.\u201dUrs Widmer, a spokesman for Mr. Parmelin, told Swiss news outlets that he was surprised by the reaction to his boss\u2019s language skills. He said that Mr. Parmelin, a member of the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party, had conducted almost all bilateral discussions on cybersecurity in English during his time as defense minister.Switzerland prides itself on being a country with four official languages: German, French, Italian and Romansch. Most people speak German or French as a first language \u2014 many speak both \u2014 and nearly all children take English classes in school.Traditionally, federal officials who primarily speak either German or French have been expected to understand, but not necessarily to speak, both languages. Mr. Parmelin has also been criticized for his weak German skills.In meetings people often speak French and German in the same discussion, depending on which one they feel more comfortable with.But Mr. Parmelin \u201cis not the first or the last of the federal councilors who was made fun of for his deficient language competences,\u201d said Daniel Kubler, a professor of political science at the University of Zurich.Language skills became an issue this fall for another politician, Hans Wicki of the liberal party FDP. Campaigning for a seat on the federal council, he was asked about his command of French and attempted to answer in that language.The article quoted Micheline Calmy-Rey, a native French speaker who has been foreign minister for almost a decade.

Meetings, events and courses often take place in English.\u201cEnglish has become a requirement, and especially for smaller countries, which tend to have a more open economy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the language of business is English nowadays.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Have Seen Many Crises\u2019: Steel Magnate Stands Firm as Turmoil Hits Turkey", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "Despite being hurt by inflation, a falling currency and import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Fuat Tosyali, a Turkish industrialist, plans to expand production.Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 In a prominent spot on a shelf close to his desk, Fuat Tosyali keeps a reminder of what his life was like long before he became a steel magnate and one of the richest people in Turkey, with a penthouse office outside Istanbul and a Mercedes limousine parked out front.It is a black and white photograph of a young man polishing a stovepipe.The young man is Mr. Tosyali, and in many ways the photograph tells the story of how far the Turkish economy has come. Mr. Tosyali\u2019s road from poverty to wealth mirrors Turkey\u2019s journey from tattered former empire to Mediterranean powerhouse with growth rates to rival China, at least until the economy took a steep dive last summer.In an interview in his office, which is furnished with ample couches covered in beige leather and a polished black coffee table the size of a double bed, Mr. Tosyali professed confidence despite a downturn that has been exacerbated by the punitive tariffs imposed on Turkish steel by the United States.\u201cThis is my 51st year in the business,\u201d said Mr. Tosyali, 55, who began helping out his father\u2019s metalworking shop before he was old enough to go to school. \u201cI have seen many crises.\u201d\u201cThe economic turbulence is temporary,\u201d he said in a follow-up telephone interview. \u201cAs a company, we are aware of our strength. We know our country\u2019s economic strength, too.\u201dMr. Tosyali\u2019s bravado may sound odd given the events of the past year, when he and other Turkish business executives have been forced to cope with a plunge in the value of the lira, a sharp decline in consumer demand, and President Trump\u2019s 50 percent levies on steel imported from Turkey \u2014 twice the size of tariffs imposed on Europe and other American allies.The problems have put Turkey, which has the world\u2019s 17th-largest economy, high on the list of places where the next global financial crisis could start.Many of Mr. Tosyali\u2019s peers are becoming more pessimistic. In growing numbers, Turkish entrepreneurs are leaving the country or transferring their wealth overseas because they fear that the country\u2019s economy could get much worse, or that their assets and freedoms could be seized by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian government.Not Mr. Tosyali. He said he planned a major new investment in steel production, although he declined to give details. \u201cIt is unforgivable to hide the money you made in Turkey by taking it abroad,\u201d he said.Until recently at least, Turkey has been viewed as an economic success story, despite episodes of harrowing financial and political turmoil. Since the beginning of this century, poverty has fallen by half. The average resident of the country lives a quarter-century longer than his counterpart in the 1960s. The economy has grown more than a third since the 2008 financial crisis. In 2017 growth was more than 7 percent, putting Turkey on the cusp of becoming what the World Bank classifies as a \u201chigh income.\u201dEntrepreneurs like Mr. Tosyali have benefited from the growth and helped generate the jobs and investment that kept it going.The company now known as Tosyali Holding began in the Mediterranean port city of Iskenderun, near the border with Syria. The family metalworking shop was so tiny, Mr. Tosyali said, that it would take up only a corner of the office he occupies today in a neighborhood outside central Istanbul where the hills are dotted with new luxury apartment complexes.Mr. Tosyali said that his father, Serif Tosyali, was illiterate and deeply ashamed of it. But he understood numbers and could gauge a piece of steel\u2019s thickness to a fraction of a millimeter just by holding it between his fingers.When Fuat Tosyali was not in school \u2014 his father insisted his children get an education \u2014 he and his younger brothers Ayhan and Fatih helped hammer scrap metal into parts for stoves and boilers. Later, the family began producing enameled steel for the washing machines that more and more Turks could afford, and pipes for homes that increasingly had modern heat.In 1994, the Tosyalis bought a factory in Iskenderun that produced iron used in construction. The acquisition positioned them to profit from a sustained building boom, started a steel-making empire that now includes 18 factories in Algeria, Montenegro and Turkey and helped transform the family\u2019s business into Turkey\u2019s biggest producer of steel pipes.Mr. Tosyali attributes the success to hard work. He received a reporter on a Saturday morning and said he planned to spend the rest of the weekend visiting factories.\u201cWe are working nonstop seven days, 24 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only me, all of my family.\u201dAfter one of the country\u2019s most difficult years in two decades, it is unclear how the current chapter in the story of Turkey\u2019s rise will end. Will it fall victim to economic mismanagement by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s increasingly repressive government? Or will Turkish entrepreneurs like Mr. Tosyali once again demonstrate their instinct for survival?Most economists expect things to get worse before they get better. \u201cEveryone is anticipating a recession,\u201d said G\u00fcven Sak, who leads the Economic Policy Research Foundation, a think tank based in Ankara.There are a few hopeful signs. The lira, which was in danger of falling below 7 to the dollar in August, has recovered somewhat and was trading at about 5.30 to the dollar on Monday. Still, the Turkish currency lost 28 percent of its value in 2018.In another positive development, inflation is retreating from the astronomical levels it had reached. The annual rate, which had climbed above 25 percent, fell below 22 percent in November after the Turkish central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to 24 percent.The lira\u2019s decline is not all bad for steel makers. They earn revenue from exports in dollars but must pay many of their bills in devalued liras. That gives manufacturers a potential advantage in export markets, although those benefits are partly canceled out by the higher prices they must pay for imported raw materials.But the drop is dangerous for Turkey\u2019s financial system. It is also a source of anxiety in Europe, where analysts and bank regulators fear that loans to Turkish businesses might not be repaid, which could destabilize banks like UniCredit of Italy that have significant holdings there.In many cases Turkish banks have issued loans to businesses that must be repaid with dollars or euros. Banks are already reporting increases in troubled loans because companies that do not rely on exports and earn revenue in liras are having trouble servicing these foreign currency debts.The Turkish economy began slowing markedly around the middle of 2018 in reaction to the financial stress. Economic output is expected to shrink 0.4 percent in 2019, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The government has responded with temporary measures like tax incentives for people who buy furniture, large appliances, cars and homes.\u201cSome precautions are being taken for industry,\u201d said Mr. Sak of the Economic Policy Research Foundation. \u201cBut these are Band-Aids, not the remedy.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s policies are also weighing on the Turkish economy. In August, he set the tariff on steel imported from the company at 50 percent after Turkey detained Andrew Brunson, an American pastor. But the tariffs were kept in place even after a Turkish court freed Mr. Brunson in October.Like many Turkish business leaders, Mr. Tosyali is reluctant to discuss politics.\u201cWe truly respect the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we would like to be there. If they don\u2019t want to buy our products we will respect that.\u201dAs Mr. Tosyali sees it, the rough period now facing Turkey is another opportunity for entrepreneurs to demonstrate their fortitude. Tosyali Holding, he said, planned to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs to expand and put itself in position to gain market share when the crisis is over.Other bosses \u201cput their feet on the brakes, they cut the work force,\u201d Mr. Tosyali said. \u201cWe do the opposite.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rania Youssef, Egyptian Actress Who Dressed to Impress, Could Be Jailed", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 When an Egyptian actress strutted down the red carpet in Cairo last week, twirling and smiling in a revealing lace dress, she had hoped to turn heads in the movie world.Instead, she now faces criminal charges that could potentially land her in prison.Three Egyptian lawyers known for using the courts to engage in moral vigilantism filed a lawsuit against the actress, Rania Youssef, accusing her of wearing an outfit at the Cairo International Film Festival that constituted \u201cincitement to debauchery.\u201dA trial has been scheduled for January, and Ms. Youssef, who is in her 40s, could face a possible five-year jail term if convicted.The case is the latest in a series of high-profile prosecutions targeting celebrities in Egypt under the authoritarian rule of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. They are often brought by lawyers claiming to police public morals by regulating attire, behavior and even jokes under the guise of protecting a brittle version of Egyptian nationalism.But sometimes the charges stick, resulting in prisons sentences for entertainers convicted of breaching public morals. The prosecutions have had a chilling effect on free speech at a time when Egypt\u2019s news media is largely under the sway of Mr. Sisi, and his government has engaged in a harsh crackdown on the gay community.Egypt\u2019s overcrowded prisons currently include a singer who was imprisoned for making lewd gestures in a pop video, and a female human rights activist who had broadcast a profanity-laced video on Facebook about being sexually harassed in public.Women\u2019s dress has always been a fault line in the culture wars of Egypt, where the tradition of belly dancing inspires both admiration and revulsion.The dress that Ms. Youssef wore at the film festival \u2014 a semitransparent outfit that exposed most of her legs \u2014 led some Egyptians to support her prosecution.Others said the case revealed the mind-set of the men who had brought the charges, using a law that allows one Egyptian to file a lawsuit against another for vague crimes like immorality and \u201cinsulting\u201d the nation.Ms. Youssef apologized for wearing the dress and stressed that she respected Egyptian cultural and moral values. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this reaction, and if I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have worn this dress,\u201d she said in a statement.Mr. Sabry, who supports Mr. Sisi, has also brought lawsuits against the president\u2019s political opponents, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood.In 2013, many Egyptians supported the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power out of fear that the Muslim Brotherhood, whose leader, Mohammed Morsi, was ousted from power, would restrict women\u2019s rights and social freedoms. On Sunday, some noted acerbically on Twitter that those same rights had been eroded under Mr. Sisi.Charges against public figures involving morality or nationalism often move at a brisk pace \u2014 Ms. Youssef is due in court on Jan. 12 \u2014 while political prisoners or detained journalists languish in jail for years, awaiting trial in cases that proceed at a crawl.It also overshadowed the Cairo film festival, which was celebrating its 40th year and awarded its Golden Pyramid prize to the film \u201cA Twelve-Year Night.\u201dAs for Ms. Youssef, she will most likely hope that her coming court case does not become an example of life imitating art.Mohamed Ezz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going, Going, Gone: Explaining Auction Houses\u2019 Executive Exodus", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s been a memorable year in the art world, not for what happened, but for who left.Mr. Gouzer is the third prominent auction house executive whose departure has been announced recently. On Nov. 21, Christie\u2019s said that Francis Outred, its head of postwar and contemporary art in Europe, would be leaving. On Dec. 3, Sotheby\u2019s said that Adam Chinn, its chief operating officer, would also be stepping down, with his role eliminated.Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive of Christie\u2019s, said in an email to The New York Times that the auction house would \u201cprimarily count on our existing teams in Europe and in New York\u201d to replace Mr. Gouzer and Mr. Outred. \u201cI strongly believe the real stars are the brand and the team,\u201d Mr. Cerutti added.\u201cThe equation is more complex today than ten years ago and even than five years ago,\u201d said Mr. Cerutti. \u201cWinning deals or convincing the owners to sell has become more sophisticated.\u201dChristie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, as well as their would-be rival Phillips, frequently find themselves competing to offer the most generous possible terms to finance-savvy owners of multimillion dollar artworks.Sellers at this level are not charged commission, leaving the auction houses to tempt them with higher valuations and bigger percentages of the fees they charge buyers. Increasingly these complex arrangements are pegged to a minimum price guarantee, with the guarantor earning a share of the profit if the work sells above that figure. It is a risky business, and auction houses like to pass on that risk to a third party, who guarantees the sale with a so-called \u201cirrevocable bid\u201d at the auction.Ed Dolman, chief executive of Phillips, said that third-party guarantees have \u201cchanged the dynamics\u201d of big-ticket auctions. \u201cYou prearrange the sale and execute it at the auction. Buyers are locked into deals, so they don\u2019t have the flexibility to bid on other lots,\u201d he added.Because of this, the risk of offering high-value lots that don\u2019t have guaranteed bidders has risen. In October, at Christie\u2019s in London, a Gerhard Richter skull painting and a Jeff Koons \u201cCracked Egg\u201d sculpture \u2014 both seemingly \u201cblue-chip\u201d contemporary masterworks, one estimated at $15 million and the other at $13 million \u2014 failed to sell.Sotheby\u2019s also took financial hits on third-party guarantees in May, when the $157.2 million Modigliani sold below its published estimate, and in June, when a Picasso undersold at $36 million.Official figures have yet to be released. However, Christie\u2019s (which, being a private company, doesn\u2019t have to report profits or losses in the way a listed company would) said it raised a total of $6.2 billion at auction in 2018, a 6 percent increase on the previous year. Total auction sales at Sotheby\u2019s were at least $5.2 billion, 13 percent up on 2017.\u201cNext year we\u2019re going to see a lot of recalibration,\u201d said Evan Beard, an art adviser in the wealth management unit of Bank of America. Mr. Beard said that the auction houses were already \u201cdampening down\u201d the expectations of sellers.\u201cThey\u2019re uninfluenced by interest rate rises and other things that happen in the wider economy,\u201d said Mr. Beard. \u201cTheir arbitrage unlocks the capital that allows the top end of the market to continue,\u201d he added, estimating that the most influential \u201cmega-collectors\u201d amounted to a group of about 40 individuals. \u201cIt\u2019s a small club.\u201dAnd that club isn\u2019t going anywhere.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect auction total for the objects comprising the David and Peggy Rockefeller Collection. The total reached $835.1 million, not $832.6 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing Defeat, Theresa May Delays Brexit Vote in Parliament", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s embattled Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday postponed a critical parliamentary vote on her proposal for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, a humiliating retreat that left the country\u2019s economic and political future uncertain, and revealed her tenuous hold on power.British lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the agreement Mrs. May had reached with the bloc for Britain\u2019s withdrawal, or Brexit. In changing course so late, Mrs. May has left the country without any clear way forward after an agonizing battle over an issue that has gripped British society for nearly three years.The question facing the United Kingdom remains as straightforward \u2014 and yet as divisive \u2014 as it was when a small but clear majority of voters called for breaking with the European Union: Is it possible to have a smooth and orderly divorce from Europe that will not cause a sudden break in all political and economic ties, and also spare the British economy?The answer, for now, seems to be a resounding no. And the country\u2019s future is as uncertain as ever.But the opposition to her plan is also a rebuke to Mrs. May herself.After years of talking the talk of a hard-liner, insisting that no deal was better than a bad deal, Mrs. May showed up with a compromise that seemed to anger everyone on all sides of the debate.While a strong prime minister with reserves of political capital might also find it impossible to escape the political quicksand that is Brexit, Mrs. May has few allies even among her own party and is facing constant speculation that she could confront a no-confidence vote. She is hanging on only because her party cannot agree on an alternative.In this reality, no plan and political paralysis means Britain could be staring at a hard break on March 29.That would mean that suddenly, in one dramatic moment, Britain\u2019s time would run out and it would lose much of its economic and political links to Europe. Banking, trade, travel, the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland \u2014 all would possibly change overnight.With the news of the postponed vote, the British pound lost about 1 percent of its value against the euro and the United States dollar, falling to its lowest level in more than a year and a half.\u201cThis delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people & businesses,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s time they make up their mind!\u201d\u201cIf we went ahead and held the vote tomorrow the deal would be rejected by a significant margin,\u201d Mrs. May told Parliament, adding that she wished to defer the vote \u201cand not proceed to divide the House at this time.\u201dYet, by opting to try to enter more negotiations, both before and at a summit meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, Mrs. May effectively has placed her fate in their hands.The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said Mrs. May\u2019s government had \u201clost control of events and is in complete disarray.\u201dAlmost every major cabinet minister and some less senior figures are being mentioned as a possible leader or jockeying for position.The opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s plan had crystallized largely over objections to contingency plans for dealing with the Irish border that pro-Brexit lawmakers say could potentially leave the United Kingdom tied to some of the bloc\u2019s rules.Presently, Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, are within the European Union and there are no customs or other regulatory checks on goods passing between them. That could change after Brexit, or not.Mrs. May\u2019s plan, for example, could mean the whole of the United Kingdom would be part of a European-wide customs union. But Brexit supporters fear that could leave the United Kingdom indefinitely tied to many European rules.Lawmakers themselves, though, do not agree on an alternative to Mrs. May\u2019s proposal. Some would prefer a Brexit plan that might keep closer ties to the European Union, while others hope to reverse the whole process by holding a second referendum.European Union officials have insisted that Mrs. May\u2019s deal, reached last month after lengthy negotiations, is their final offer.\u201cThe Brexit withdrawal agreement is the only deal on the table between the E.U. and the U.K. and is not open to renegotiation,\u201d the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, declared.What Mrs. May seems to be angling for is a formal declaration or assurance from the European Union that the plan for the Irish border \u2014 keeping it open for the flow of goods \u2014 will not be permanent.The president of the European Union, Donald Tusk, extended an olive branch of sorts on Monday, writing on Twitter that although the bloc \u201cwill not renegotiate the deal,\u201d it would \u201cdiscuss how to facilitate U.K. ratification\u201d while also discussing preparations for \u201ca no-deal scenario.\u201dMrs. May acknowledged that \u201cthere remains widespread and deep concern\u201d over plans for the Irish border.But she insisted that her plan was \u201cthe best deal that can be negotiated.\u201d She said she wanted to win more assurances from Brussels to help sell her proposal to skeptical lawmakers.Most analysts believe that European leaders are highly unlikely to reopen the 585-page, legally binding withdrawal deal. And so Monday\u2019s move could simply delay the inevitable reckoning over an agreement that has united significant numbers of lawmakers of different views in their opposition.Steve Baker, a member of the European Research Group, an alliance of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, said postponing the vote would amount to \u201cessentially a defeat\u201d of Mrs. May\u2019s agreement with the European Union.Mrs. May did not say when she wants to hold a new vote on her plan.Her only hope, a slim one, is that some new declaration from Brussels \u2014 or, perhaps, a scary drop in the pound or the financial markets \u2014 will persuade her rebel lawmakers to fall into line.The financial effects of the uncertainty are being felt already. As the pound sterling fell on the international currency markets, Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry warned that \u201cunless a deal is agreed quickly, the country risks sliding toward a national crisis.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s announcement came hours after the European Union\u2019s highest court ruled that Britain could legally cancel its decision to leave the bloc and remain under its current terms, throwing a lifeline to those who still hope to reverse the withdrawal.But the European Court ruled that Britain could withdraw its Article 50 submission before the March 29 withdrawal date, as long as it did so in accordance with the country\u2019s democratic and constitutional arrangements, and communicated the decision in writing. The reversal would not require the approval of the 27 other member countries, the court said.Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whiplash on Wall Street as Tension About Global Economy Mounts", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, as concerns about the global economy, trade tensions and interest rates kept markets on edge.Stocks fell around the world after the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive intensified concerns that China and the United States, the world\u2019s two largest economies, could be entering a risky new chapter in their trade dispute. But Wall Street recovered most of those losses in an afternoon rally predicated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve may slow down on interest rate increases next year.At one point in the day, the S&P 500 was down as much as 2.9 percent, mirroring steep declines in Asia and Europe. A recovery late in the trading day, however, left the index down only about 0.2 percent at the closing bell.The dueling messages continued on Friday morning in Asia, where markets were mixed and futures that predict Wall Street\u2019s opening showed a modest drop.But the arrest of Ms. Meng, the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, threatened to open a riskier new chapter in a fight that investors increasingly see as a threat to financial markets and the economy.\u201cThis is going to continue to be a headwind at a time when people are worried about global growth,\u201d said Dan Clifton, a head of policy research with the analysis firm Strategas.For most of the year, the United States \u2014 less reliant on trade than most wealthy nations \u2014 had been a global standout, thanks in part to a burst of fiscal stimulus from the Trump tax cuts, while the trade war caused trouble in the rest of the world\u2019s financial markets.In China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost a decade, stocks have slumped more than 20 percent. Export-based economies that are closely tied to China \u2014 like Japan and Germany \u2014 have started to struggle too. Growth in emerging markets, which often supply the commodities that have fueled the Chinese boom in recent decades, has also been hurt.But in recent weeks, worry about the trade war has begun to take hold in the United States as well. Since its peak in late September, the S&P 500 has declined by 8 percent, as investors grew concerned about the outlook for corporate profits, the potential costs of the trade spat and rising interest rates, which are traditionally viewed as a negative for stocks.The rally did little for investors in energy shares. The sector has been hard hit by a slump in crude oil prices in recent weeks and was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500 on Thursday.Elsewhere, yields on government bonds dropped sharply early in the day as investors flocked to the safety of Treasury debt. But the declines in yields moderated late in the day, in tandem with the shift in stock trading.Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, tend to drop as investors downgrade expectations for growth and inflation.Those lower yields can crimp the profitability of banks, which charge interest rates that are based on government bond yields. The threat of such pressures has hammered American financial stocks in recent days. The S&P 500 financial sector index was the second-worst-performing part of the market on Thursday, dropping 1.4 percent.And while few expect a hasty end to the economic expansion in the United States, the recent swings in stocks suggest investors are increasingly worrying about any threats that could worsen growth forecasts.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a growth slowdown in place,\u201d said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock. \u201cThis is a very different environment from where we were this time last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top 10 Cheap Eats of 2018: A World of New York Stories", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUNGRY CITYLigaya Mishan lists her favorite places, and celebrates their links to countries around the globe. A dish may be delicious, but that lasts only for a moment. The amazing tamale you had one night out of the back of a truck under the elevated train could never be as amazing as the story of the person who made it.So as I put together this list of my favorites among the restaurants I reviewed in 2018 (in descending order, although truly, I loved them all), I\u2019m grateful to the owners and chefs for sharing their stories. Gulshat Azimova started cooking at age 12 alongside her mother in the village of Zhalpaktobe in southern Kazakhstan. She and her husband, Damirzhan Azimov, are Dungans, descendants of Muslim traders who plied the Silk Road in the seventh century, married Han Chinese and settled in northwestern China until the late 1800s, when their great-grandparents fled government persecution and found a new home across the Tien Shan mountains.In all the world, there are only about 100,000 Dungans, and in Brooklyn, too few for the census to register. How lucky, then, that we have the Azimovs to introduce us to Dungan food, which here unravels in noodles upon noodles, manifesting as pliant coils stretched long and thin; wide floppy sheets; raggedy drops made by rubbing the dough swiftly between the palms; and two-feet long lariats, looped in on themselves and fried to a snap.There was only one dish ever available when I visited this food truck parked north of Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens. But it was the only dish I needed: momos \u2014 dumplings from the Himalayas, with sheer skins in a swirl of pleats \u2014 made by Thubten Amchok, a former Buddhist monk from Amdo in eastern Tibet. While momos are common currency in this neighborhood that is home to many Tibetan and Nepalese immigrants, sold everywhere from minimalist modern storefronts to shambolic basement dining rooms, Mr. Amchok\u2019s are the ones I return for.His recipe is simple: meat (ground beef graced with scallions, salt and a dewdrop\u2019s worth of soy sauce) and dough pressed flat until you can almost see through it, then pinched tight so the meat\u2019s juices have nowhere to go, until you take a bite and they run down your fingers, hot, almost burning, and sublime.At his new, diminutive spot on the Lower East Side, as at Izakaya, almost every dish comes with a brief narrative on its origins or making, quietly and effortlessly told. By night, the specialty is oden, a winter stew with a base broth that is constantly replenished and grows more potent with time; by day, the space turns into a kissaten (coffee shop), serving slabs of toast as thick as cake under a spackle of sweet red beans and butter.From the front, this unassuming restaurant suggests a cafeteria, but at the back are cushions for lolling, essential after the stupor of a meal. Ismail Bourrich and his wife, Bouchra Salmi, both immigrants from Morocco, took over what had been a Chinese-Mexican restaurant in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and brought in Malika Hakmoun, from Marrakesh, as chef, to recreate the expansive flavors of home.The procession of plates is dizzying: lamb shank like a gauntlet thrown down among swollen prunes and slivered almonds; chicken wallowing with fleshy green olives and mellowed arcs of preserved lemon; bastilla, a flaking meat pie under a drift of icing sugar; m\u2019smen, a many-layered flatbread with secret caches of butter. And at the end, Chinese gunpowder tea with a bouquet of mint leaves thrust into the pot, poured from a great height.A year ago, Enver and Jeudy Perez, two brothers born in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic and raised in the Castle Hill section of the Bronx, opened this lively canteen in a squeeze of a storefront that can now hardly contain its crowds and verve. Merengue tumbles from the speakers; Spanish carries from one table to another.Everyone, it seems, is family. Their older brother, Freddy Perez, oversees the floor; their mother, Maritza Reynoso, makes the house hot sauce (and holds the recipe close). Two aunts keep the steam table brimming over with smoky barbecued ribs and a seemingly endless supply of moro (rice and beans). And Yudelkys Paniagua, the chef, cooks dishes to order, like chimi, the Dominican street burger, reimagined as sliders but still gorgeously sloppy, anointed with pink mayo-ketchup whose snap comes from Country Club frambuesa (raspberry) soda.To enter Belarussian Xata is to be swept up in the onrush of other lives, mid-revel. Every table is or might as well be celebrating something \u2014 perhaps the simple fact of existing \u2014 with carafes of birch sap and horseradish-spiked vodka, and some of the richest food I\u2019ve ever tried: kerchiefs of cured fatback; potato cakes armored in crackle that ooze cheese when pierced; deep-fried hog ears; a monumental pork knuckle sloughing panels of fat.Marat Novikov, the owner, left his hometown, Minsk, the Belarusian capital, for Brooklyn three decades ago, when the Soviet Union was verging on collapse. Here, he has recruited a fellow Minchanin, Ilya Frolov, as chef, and created a pastoral fantasia, as if in homage to the primeval forest that still covers much of their native land, with embroidered linen towels flung over tables and pitchers inverted on fence posts made of naked branches.If I could eat in only one neighborhood, it would be Elmhurst, Queens, where every year more Thai restaurants appear, often opened by young, recently arrived Thai immigrants with both a sharp eye for design and an uncompromising approach to the food of their childhood. Arada Moonroj, the chef of this small but mighty restaurant, mines her mother\u2019s recipes from Lampang in northern Thailand.Rather than tame or transform ingredients, she gives them full expression, from the meatiness of green jackfruit to raw red weaver-ant larvae, which break in a tiny gush on the tongue, to the iron-rich pork blood that suffuses a mound of rice, purple as a bruise. As for the Thai bird chiles that intimidate some American diners, she deploys them matter-of-factly, as a necessity of life, and at moments in the meal they make the world spin.Once Little House Caf\u00e9 was just a bakery, and it still looks like it, with ad hoc tables, beat-up tile and shelf after shelf of bread and cakes. Slowly, Michael Lee and his wife, Helen Bay, began adding savory dishes, reminiscent of the food at the restaurants they used to run in Malaysia, before they moved to Queens eight years ago and started over from scratch.The Lee children pitch in: Jackson, the oldest, handles marketing; Joanne works the cash register between classes and another job; and Jeremy, their youngest, cooks at his parents\u2019 side. The fragrance of each dish announces it long before it arrives, be it the smoke wafting off char kway teow, a dark heap of broad rice noodles, raggedy eggs, pork, shrimp and charred rings of squid, or the pungency of fish paste sealed between crispy sheets of tofu skin in a heady bowl of curry mee.Little House Caf\u00e9, 90-19 Corona Avenue (90th Street), Elmhurst, Queens; 718-592-0888; no website.After closing it in 2011, she missed it. So in January, her children, Alex, Jennifer and Nestor Jazmani Dutan, gently coaxed her into taking over a former dry cleaner\u2019s by the elevated train and turning it into a showcase for Ecuadorean cuisine. The menu reaches from the highlands to the sea, with earthy llapingachos, achiote-stained potato cakes with gooey hearts of mozzarella, served alongside encebollado, a stew of barely poached tuna, leaching brine.Maximo Ojeda spent his childhood in Cienega de Zimatl\u00e1n, a village in Oaxaca, Mexico, with a population of 9,000, no electricity or running water, and a single phone that everyone had to share. When he arrived in the United States two decades ago, he found a job as a dishwasher and worked his way up, all the while homesick for the tortillas that every house in his village made in the morning.In 2012, he and his wife, Eva Mendes, opened a bodega in Corona, Queens, offering a few dishes out of the cramped back kitchen. Two years later, his mother-in-law, Margarita Perez, flew in and took charge of the menu. Her specialty: tlayudas, great wheels of tortillas a foot wide, slaked with asiento \u2014 pork lard rendered through the slow cooking of carnitas \u2014 and black beans simmered with avocado leaves. You choose toppings as on a pizza, but the tlayudas are just as lovely with nothing more than quesillo and a scattering of shredded cabbage. The utilitarian aura of a bodega persists, despite vivid murals painted by a friend from church. \u201cWe don\u2019t answer the phone sometimes, we\u2019re so busy,\u201d Mr. Ojeda said. \u201cWe try to do the best we can.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.-China Friction Threatens to Undercut the Fight Against Climate Change", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe biggest threats to the planet are the lack of U.S. climate leadership at home and the unwillingness of the U.S. to engage with China,\u201d said Joanna Lewis, a China specialist at Georgetown University. \u201cThe rest of the world looks to the U.S. and China for leadership, and it has become clear that, as the alliance has waned, global momentum to address climate change has slowed.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine a worse time for the world\u2019s two behemoths \u2014 the United States, traditionally representing the rich world in climate negotiations, and China, representing the developing countries \u2014 to be locked in a cycle of intense distrust at the highest levels.For China\u2019s part \u2014 even though its emissions have grown in the last two years, mainly because of continued coal use \u2014 the country is on track to meet its modest, self-imposed Paris target, which is to reach peak emissions by 2030. In fact, it appears on track to do so ahead of schedule, according to independent analysts. It is also ramping up renewable energy sources faster than any country in the world. The emissions intensity of its economy, geared to manufacture goods for the rest of the world, is declining. At the same time though, coal plants have not closed down as fast as some had expected. Much more worrying, China is exporting coal technology abroad, with its powerful state-owned companies proposing to build coal-fired power plants from Kenya to Pakistan, effectively exporting its carbon footprint.\u201cThey plan their work and work their plan,\u201d Mr. Gore said. \u201cI expect them to continue on the journey they mapped out regardless of what the U.S. does.\u201dSo far, there is no evidence that China is reversing course. Still, the United States posture, and the concerns over a continued slowdown of the Chinese economy give ballast to Chinese promoters of heavy industry, some China analysts say, putting President Xi Jinping under considerable pressure. \u201cPeople are widely concerned that this trade dispute will lead to some unemployment,\u201d said Zou Ji, the Beijing-based head of the Energy Foundation of China, a group that calls on China to transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. \u201cI feel the pace of emissions abatement could become slower.\u201d Three key issues pit the United States and China against each other in the climate negotiations, where American negotiators are participating pending the country\u2019s formal exit at the end of 2020. First, the United States wants robust rules across the board for all countries to account for their own emissions and be subject to outside scrutiny. China insists on different reporting rules for developing countries. China has India on its side on this demand, though not other vulnerable poor countries, who are wary of looser rules for China. \u201cWe are basically designing, in Katowice, a whole set of rules that will bind China but that will not cover the United States,\u201d said Mr. Li of Greenpeace Asia. \u201cIt creates a fundamental sense of unfairness in the Chinese mind.\u201dSecond, the United States, under the Trump administration, has pulled back from helping poor countries adapt to the ravages of climate change. China, which considers itself the leader of the world\u2019s developing countries, is goading the rich world to pony up \u2014 and be held accountable for it.And third, perhaps most importantly, the test for China is whether, in the face of an American retreat, it will ramp up its ambition to cut emissions in the coming years. The consequences for the world\u2019s 7.6 billion people are enormous. \u201cIt takes the pressure off of greater ambition and faster action,\u201d said Alex Wang, a University of California Los Angeles law professor who follows China\u2019s environmental policy, of the United States-China tensions. \u201cIf you\u2019re coming from the perspective that we\u2019re already way behind, then the current dynamic is bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Congress also zeroed out the health law\u2019s penalty for not being covered, starting in 2019.But Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that \u201cenrollment remained steady through HealthCare.gov.\u201dThose numbers came despite a decision on Friday by a federal judge in Texas that invalidated all of the Affordable Care Act, causing confusion about the future of health insurance.

More than 4.3 million people signed up last week, compared with 4.1 million in the final week of enrollment last year.Trump administration officials expressed satisfaction on Wednesday.\u201cThis administration has taken strong steps to promote a competitive, stable health insurance market,\u201d and the new numbers show that the administration\u2019s efforts are working, Ms. Verma said.She suggested that the strong economy was a factor in the drop.\u201cWith the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years,\u201d Ms. Verma said, \u201cit\u2019s possible that more Americans have employer-based coverage and don\u2019t need exchange plans.\u201dIn the 39 states using the HealthCare.gov platform, employment increased this year by two million, the administration said.Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, declared the Affordable Care Act \u201cfar from dead and remarkably resilient.\u201dStill, the number of people selecting plans this year was substantially lower than in 2015, when 9.6 million people signed up, and in 2016, when 9.2 million did so.Among states using the federal insurance exchange, the largest numbers of sign-ups this year were in Florida (1.8 million), Texas (1.1 million), North Carolina (502,500) and Georgia (460,100).The number of people signing up increased this year in five states: Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Wyoming. Among the states showing declines of more than 15 percent were Louisiana and West Virginia.With stable premiums and more insurers offering coverage this year, the number of people signing up might have been expected to increase. In many counties, people of modest means could get insurance for free, as federal subsidies would pay the entire premium for some policies.But sign-ups were lagging for most of the 45-day enrollment period this year. Several factors may have initially discouraged enrollment.The Trump administration cut back funds for public education, advertising and consumer assistance. Ms. Verma kicked off open enrollment on Nov. 1 with a Twitter post that disparaged the available options.\u201cThe BIG SECRET no one reports: #Obamacare\u2019s skyrocketing premiums are destroying affordable options for the unsubsidized, including people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Ms. Verma wrote.Administration officials said on Wednesday that they had found more effective, less expensive ways of reaching consumers. The administration sent more than 700 million emails and text messages to remind people of open enrollment.In some states, insurers have been selling short-term insurance plans, which the Trump administration portrays as a low-cost alternative to comprehensive coverage. The short-term plans \u2014 sold outside the health insurance exchange \u2014 do not have to comply with the Affordable Care Act, generally provide fewer benefits, often refuse to pay for the treatment of pre-existing conditions and tend to attract healthier people.Congress also zeroed out the tax penalty for people who go without insurance, effective in 2019, and as a result some people may feel less pressure to obtain coverage. But a survey last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most Americans were unaware of the change, so it is unlikely to explain much of the decline in enrollment.\u201cRepeal of the individual mandate added to the uncertainty, but it is the carrot of the subsidies rather than the mandate\u201d that leads many people to buy insurance in the marketplace, said Ana Gupte, a health care analyst at Leerink Partners in New York.Many Democrats won midterm elections this year by promising to protect the Affordable Care Act. Having won control of the House, they plan to push legislation to achieve that goal.The numbers released on Wednesday show activity in states that use the HealthCare.gov website run by the federal government. In other states, which operate their own marketplaces, deadlines vary.Consumers are still able to enroll in California, Connecticut, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Rhode Island.\u201cInsurance has to be sold, which is why we will continue promoting enrollment with robust marketing and outreach efforts well into the new year,\u201d said Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the state-run exchange in California, where open enrollment continues through Jan. 15.Joshua Peck, who was the chief marketing officer for HealthCare.gov in the Obama administration, said the number of people renewing coverage on HealthCare.gov this year was impressive.More than three-fourths of the people signing up this year \u2014 more than 6.4 million people \u2014 were renewing coverage.An overwhelming majority of the people who obtain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace receive financial assistance to help defray the cost. The tax credit now covers 87 percent of the average premium \u2014 $519 of $596 \u2014 leaving the beneficiary to pay an average of $77 a month.Under the law, subsidies generally increase with insurance premiums. This linkage protects many consumers, but causes acute distress for Trump administration officials because, they say, it means that taxpayers bear the cost of premium increases.\u201cThe law\u2019s skyrocketing subsidies have kept subsidized insurance enrollment fairly steady,\u201d said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services. \u201cBut Americans who make too much to receive subsidies have begun to opt out of the insurance market en masse.\u201dMs. Verma said that \u201cmany Americans don\u2019t qualify for subsidies on HealthCare.gov and remain priced out of the insurance market.\u201dFor some of them, the administration says, short-term insurance policies, which can run up to 36 months, may be the answer.Ms. Verma claimed vindication.But she pointed to New Jersey, which she said had banned short-term plans and adopted its own version of the individual insurance mandate, and still had an 8 percent drop in the number of people signing up for marketplace coverage this fall.Advertisement"}

First, Macau\u2019s Gaming Inspection & Coordination Bureau said that gaming revenue for the Chinese gambling center had increased more than expected in November.Wynn could gain because of the thaw. Wynn generated nearly three-quarters of its revenue this year from its casinos in Macau, a special administrative region of China and a gambling haven for Chinese high rollers.Tariffs between China and the United States were unlikely to affect Wynn\u2019s revenue directly, but investors worried it could be hit by any retaliatory measures China took in response to the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Those could include potential restrictions on travel to Macau as well as license renewals.Wynn\u2019s exposure to China also meant that it was susceptible to a slowdown in China\u2019s economy and the impact that might have on wealthy Chinese gamblers. Wynn\u2019s shares tumbled 13 percent in early November after Wynn\u2019s chief executive, Matt Maddox, warned on the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings conference call that it had experienced a recent slowdown in its Macau business.Wynn\u2019s shares slid through the spring and summer as trade tensions between the two countries continued to escalate.

{"Headline": "Modi\u2019s Party Is Trounced in India\u2019s \u2018Semifinal\u2019 Elections", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Is India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, in trouble?With his white beard and booming speeches (and supposedly 56-inch chest), Mr. Modi swept into power four years ago by promoting a populist brand of politics that mixed brawny Hindu nationalist views with lofty economic promises.But on Tuesday, his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, got walloped according to elections results just released from races held across five states.The party, widely known by the initials B.J.P., suffered its worst defeat in recent years, losing more than 100 legislative seats, a result that shook the political establishment and left many wondering if Mr. Modi is in danger of losing next year\u2019s national election.The elections were held over the past several weeks, but results were not announced until Tuesday. Indian pundits described the races, held in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh and Telangana, as the \u201csemifinals\u201d of Indian politics. In just a few months, this country of 1.3 billion people who speak dozens of languages and live across an incredibly varied landscape from Himalayan mountaintops to tropical isles is set to hold national parliamentary elections.It appears that Mr. Modi, who seemed so invincible not long ago, may be vulnerable as his brand loses its luster. At the same time, the leading opposition party, the Indian National Congress, once considered comatose, has suddenly woken up.\u201cThe competition is neck to neck,\u201d said Narendra Kumar, a political scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, the capital.Indian voters are famous for passionately embracing a party or politician in one election and then enthusiastically voting them out in the next.Among the complaints against Mr. Modi: He has ignored farmers. He cannot deliver on his party\u2019s promises, including creating one million jobs a month, which economists said was impossible. The cost of living has sharply increased. And, not least, the B.J.P. has been criticized as too soft on violent Hindu extremists, including mobs that have lynched people for slaughtering cows, a revered animal in Hinduism.\u201cThe common man does not support mob lynchings,\u201d said Anil Verma, the head of the Association for Democratic Reforms, a nonpartisan organization in New Delhi.Analysts say more Indians are growing upset with Mr. Modi\u2019s party for not cracking down on the mobs, who often twist Hindu nationalist messages espoused by B.J.P. leaders and use them to justify violence. Vigilantes have killed dozens of people, most of them Muslim or lower caste Hindus, in the name of protecting cows.\u201cIndians by and large are not happy with the killing of their fellow men,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cThat should be a message for the prime minister before the 2019 elections.\u201dThe five states that just held elections \u2014 mostly rural and representing India\u2019s heartland \u2014 are considered a bellwether. But experts have warned against extrapolating too much from these state races to national elections, noting that Mr. Modi still commands a loyal following in many quarters.He is seen as a champion of a bigger, stronger India, whose economy is now sixth-largest in the world. (A decade ago, it was not even in the top 10.) He also remains a compelling orator, able to stir crowds with his booming baritone voice. Mr. Modi rose to power by embracing Hindu nationalist politics, and his base remains firmly behind him because they see him as a protector of their values.Most experts say that if the next election were purely a popularity contest between Mr. Modi and Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress and scion of a long political dynasty, it would be Mr. Modi\u2019s to lose.But Indian elections do not work that way. The country is a parliamentary system, and local issues affect the national bottom line. Political alliances are crucial, and this could be a problem for Mr. Modi.Most analysts expect Mr. Modi\u2019s party to lose many seats next year; the question is whether he will be able to win a thin majority in Parliament.On Tuesday, the Indian National Congress was on track to pick up more than 100 of the 678 total seats across the five states.And something even bigger may be happening. Across India, economic worries are becoming a pressing issue that Mr. Modi will have trouble sweeping away. He raised high expectations, promising to attract huge China-style export factories and create millions of high-paying jobs.India\u2019s annual growth rate has been over 7 percent, but Mr. Modi has not turned India into the next China. The amount of red tape in India remains stultifying, and many parts of the country\u2019s manufacturing sector, such as textiles, have suffered widespread layoffs.\u201cModi will definitely be hurt in the parliamentary elections next year \u2014 even more so if the opposition can sharpen the focus of the campaign to stress farm distress,\u201d said Arati Jerath, a columnist who writes about politics for some of India\u2019s biggest newspapers.Even so, Tuesday\u2019s election results were not all good news for the Indian National Congress. Once a powerful brand in the northeast, the party lost its majority in the last state it controlled in that region, Mizoram.But the results in India\u2019s agrarian, Hindi-speaking cow belt, where the B.J.P. has dominated or been highly competitive for the past decade and a half, must have been even more deflating to Mr. Modi and his team.His party\u2019s headquarters in New Delhi appeared deserted on Tuesday, while wild celebrations broke out at those of the Indian National Congress.Even Mr. Modi\u2019s usually super-confident allies admitted to being concerned.\u201cThis has been a very intriguing election,\u201d said Seshadri Chari, a member of the B.J.P.\u2019s national executive committee. \u201cModi is going to be personally worried.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What if that means sacrificing the story you were going to write?Should journalists ever provide help or assistance in the lives of the people they are reporting on? Why or why not?SANA, Yemen \u2014 At a restaurant in the Yemeni capital, Sana, a waiter brought bowls of slow-cooked lamb served with mounds of rice. For dessert there was kunafa, the classic Arab dish of golden brown pastry filled with cheese.An hour later I was back at work, in a hushed hospital ward filled with malnourished children with skeletal faces, hanging between life and death for want of money and a good meal.If that juxtaposition strikes you as jarring, even distasteful, it felt that way to me, too.Crisis zones are often places of stark contrast, but in Yemen the gulf is particularly uncomfortable. The problem isn\u2019t a lack of food; it\u2019s that few people can afford to buy what food is available.Years of blockades, bombs and soaring inflation have crushed the economy. A crushed state means there is no safety net.As a result, beggars congregate outside supermarkets filled with goods; markets are filled with produce in towns where the hungry eat boiled leaves; and restaurants selling rich food are a few hundred yards from hunger wards filled with desperation, pain and death.For a reporter, that brings a dilemma. Journalists travel with bundles of hard currency, usually dollars, to pay for hotels, transport and translation. A small fraction of that cash might go a long way for a starving family. Should I pause, put down my notebook and offer to help?Many were touched by a powerful photograph by Tyler Hicks of Amal Hussain, an emaciated 7-year-old girl whose haunting stare brought the war\u2019s human cost into shocking focus.And many were devastated to learn that, soon after we left, Amal\u2019s mother brought her back to the shabby refugee camp they call home, where she died a few days later.Some, in their anguish, turned the focus back on us.Why didn\u2019t we do something to save Amal\u2019s life, they wanted to know.

Reporters are trained to bear witness; aid workers and doctors have the job of helping people.Donating money, or other forms of assistance, can be fraught with ethical, moral and practical complications.

{"Headline": "In Gupta Brothers\u2019 Rise and Fall, the Tale of a Sullied A.N.C.", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "An Indian family rose to the heights of power and fortune in South Africa with the help of eager officials in the legendary party of Nelson Mandela.Supported bySAHARANPUR, India \u2014 India\u2019s most influential guru joined thousands of believers four years ago as the temple\u2019s first stone was set in the ground.It was a glorious day for its builders, the Gupta brothers, the sons of a local shopkeeper who had risen, almost magically, to become one of the richest families a world away in South Africa.The three brothers had flown back on their private jet to start work on the temple, a 125-foot monument of pink sandstone and white marble that would tower over the tiny place where their father used to ride his bicycle to pray every day.But one morning last month, as the sun struggled to break through the smog in Saharanpur, their hometown in India\u2019s north, the giant yellow crane raising the temple stood still \u2014 in limbo, like the brothers themselves.The Guptas are now in self-imposed exile in Dubai, evading arrest in South Africa, where they stand at the center of a scandal that has already brought down the nation\u2019s president and exposed staggering amounts of corruption in the once-legendary party of Nelson Mandela.Even here in India, the family\u2019s legacy \u2014 so large that it has been elevated to myth \u2014 faces collapse. The new temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva in their father\u2019s honor, is now being investigated for the same kind of self-dealing and fraud the family is accused of mastering in South Africa.The rise and fall of the Gupta brothers is so improbable that in Saharanpur their story is told like a parable.They began by selling shoes in South Africa and swiftly became central figures in the nation\u2019s post-apartheid history, outsiders who broke into the very pinnacle of political power. Seemingly overnight, they joined the ranks of South Africa\u2019s most influential families, playing a leading role in one of the biggest dramas after the end of apartheid: Who is getting rich, and how?Mr. Mandela\u2019s election as president in 1994 set off a scramble by leaders in his party, the African National Congress, to amass wealth. The early ones succeeded through ties with rich white South Africans. Many others turned to the brothers from Saharanpur.The Guptas found eager partners at all levels of the A.N.C., from bureaucrats to a sitting president, Jacob Zuma, according to dozens of interviews by The New York Times, as well as government investigators, international auditors, emails from a Gupta company, financial records and court documents.Seizing on a chance encounter with a South African official in India decades ago, the three brothers cultivated ties to the governing party so expertly that it became difficult to draw the line between their business empire and the president\u2019s office.They made one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s sons a business partner, enabling them to buy a coal mine through government intervention and set up a media business that the president helped guide himself, according to officials, company emails and people involved in the ventures. The president responded in kind, handing them control over strategic cabinet selections and the boards of state-owned enterprises.The Guptas recruited other senior A.N.C. officials by giving them secret cuts of lucrative contracts from the state\u2019s utility and rail companies, government investigators say. They acted as fixers for multinational companies, like the German software giant SAP, which paid them kickbacks in return for government business, documents show.Even in far-flung rural corners of South Africa, they found A.N.C. officials ready to divert money meant to help the poor.But the story of the Guptas \u2014 who landed in the country a year before the end of apartheid in 1994 and left with Mr. Zuma\u2019s fall \u2014 is also the story of South Africa under the A.N.C.\u201cThe Guptas were so egregious and big-time that they are a story on their own,\u201d said R.W. Johnson, a historian of South Africa. \u201cBut the thing that amazes is that this is only 20 years on from an African nationalist revolution, and here are all these guys happily selling their country down the river.\u201dThey flew everywhere: across oceans in their own planes, to their own helipad here in Saharanpur, to Hindu temples in the Himalayas.And they became so powerful that they clashed with the Oppenheimers \u2014 the family that once owned the De Beers diamond company and the mining giant Anglo American \u2014 whose influence in South Africa had been unrivaled for a century.But as the Guptas brandished their power, they incited a backlash, not only from ordinary South Africans, but also from a far more powerful constituency: the white-led business establishment and its allies, both increasingly worried that the brothers were putting the country\u2019s economic health at risk.The Guptas\u2019 intimate role in steering the nation helped set off an electoral revolt that has already cost the A.N.C. control over South Africa\u2019s biggest cities and could jeopardize its hold on the presidency.From his self-imposed exile in Dubai, Ajay Gupta, 53, the oldest brother, denies all wrongdoing. As newcomers to South Africa, he said, he and his brothers have been turned into scapegoats.He points out that they face no criminal charges in South Africa, adding that their family empire is now bankrupt.But nothing angers him more than the temple.Far more than a gift to their hometown and a testament to their humble beginnings, the $28 million Shivadham Temple is now being investigated by the Indian authorities as the cornerstone of an elaborate scheme to launder \u201cillicit money\u201d from the Gupta fortune in South Africa.\u201cIt\u2019s a 1,000 percent lie,\u201d Mr. Gupta said in his first extensive interview since fleeing South Africa. \u201cI\u2019ll kill the person and I\u2019ll kill myself before I use a cent for this kind of a thing.\u201dIt all started with a few shirts.The father of the Gupta brothers, Shiv Kumar Gupta, owned a tiny shop that sold government rations, or subsidized food, here in Saharanpur. He was a pious, somewhat idiosyncratic man, who tossed bread to stray dogs from the basket of his bicycle on his way to the old temple every day, and he often spent nights meditating in its crematory.But he nurtured grand ambitions. One day, Mr. Gupta called over his oldest son, Ajay, to recount a newspaper article on the war between Iran and Iraq. The price of rice had skyrocketed there because, he told his son, all the traders had left the countries.\u201cBut somebody is going in,\u201d Ajay recalled his father saying. \u201cHe\u2019s getting this advantage because there\u2019s no competition.\u201dIn the 1980s, few people in Saharanpur left to seek their fortunes in places like China, Russia or South Africa. Most went to big cities like New Delhi, or to Britain or Canada.But to people who knew the family, the father\u2019s mind-set reflected that of the family\u2019s caste, the Banias, or traders. The brothers spoke proudly of their background, explaining why they were such good businessmen.So Ajay, who had already set up a computer import business in New Delhi, followed his father\u2019s advice and went looking for opportunities in Russia, China and Singapore.The middle brother, Atul, went to South Africa in 1993, right before it became a democracy. He kept going back, despite his family\u2019s misgivings.\u201cHe alone was the bullish one,\u201d Ajay recalled. \u201cHe loved the place.\u201dIn the years before and after the end of apartheid, South Africa, rattled by violence and political killings, seemed to be slipping into civil war. Many people with means, especially white South Africans, were packing into planes to London or Perth.But others \u2014 exiled South Africans and fortune-seekers \u2014 were flocking in. True to his father\u2019s teaching, Atul settled in Johannesburg and sold shoes downtown. Then he started a company \u2014 Sahara, named after the family hometown \u2014 importing computer parts and assembling them for sale.And by chance, he made a personal connection to the A.N.C. that would prove far more consequential.During a trip home to India, Atul met a South African of Indian origin in New Delhi: Essop Pahad, the right-hand man of Thabo Mbeki, who was then Mr. Mandela\u2019s deputy.In an interview, Mr. Pahad recalled that he had ordered some tailor-made Nehru-style shirts. But he had to return to South Africa before they were ready. Atul volunteered to pick them up and personally deliver them to Mr. Pahad\u2019s office in Johannesburg. After that, they ran into each other at functions at the Indian consulate.\u201cHe talked about Ajay a lot,\u201d Mr. Pahad said. \u201cThen I said, \u2018Who is this Ajay of yours?\u2019\u201dBy then, Ajay was head of the whole family.With their early ventures overseas, the Gupta brothers had found some success and bought their father his first car: a creamy white Contessa, the biggest made in India.But their father died a year later. Only Ajay made it back home in time to say goodbye. An hour before Mr. Gupta died, he gave his watch and ring to Ajay, who wears them to this day.With the responsibility of the family on his shoulders, he eventually moved everyone to Johannesburg.When Mr. Pahad finally met Ajay, he was immediately impressed. Ajay got the big picture in South Africa, and seemed to understand that there was a place in it for the Guptas.In fact, the opening was vast, and Ajay exploited it masterfully.In the late 1990s, as Mr. Mbeki prepared to become president, the A.N.C. government was worried about the enduring power of white South African businessmen and dependence on Western nations. Forging ties with countries like India and China could lessen their influence, Mr. Pahad said.Black South Africans had gained political power. But the white business elite, led by officials at Anglo American, had protected its own interests in the new South Africa.Long before the end of apartheid, Harry Oppenheimer, the head of the mining company, had led efforts to create \u2014 and co-opt, some historians say \u2014 a black elite.Mr. Mandela was particularly close to Mr. Oppenheimer, who gave him money, said Michael Spicer, a former executive at the company.\u201cHarry would say, \u2018It\u2019s important for the country that Mandela not be fussed with all of these problems,\u2019\u201d Mr. Spicer said.But nothing was free.Mr. Oppenheimer put together a team of economic advisers for Mr. Mandela called the Brenthurst Group \u2014 named after the Oppenheimers\u2019 palatial estate in Johannesburg. In meetings, A.N.C. leaders joined the country\u2019s top white businessmen to set the nation\u2019s post-apartheid economic course, Mr. Spicer said.Soon enough, Mr. Mandela, who had supported nationalizing the economy, endorsed pro-business policies. Some historians argue that the policies contributed to South Africa\u2019s income inequality, and to an economy still based on cheap black labor.But after becoming president, Mr. Mbeki moved to dampen the power of white businesses. He created his own group, which met at his residence each month, Mr. Pahad said. It included cabinet ministers, top businessmen, rising stars in the A.N.C. and an unknown figure: Ajay Gupta.Ajay said he enjoyed the meetings. Mr. Mbeki sometimes even dropped by for lunch.Only a few years after settling in South Africa, Ajay had forged links to the highest levels of the A.N.C., thanks to his friendship with Mr. Pahad.Mr. Pahad said that he had appointed Ajay to the group to help build ties to India, but that he had asked nothing of the brothers.After leaving government, however, Mr. Pahad acknowledged receiving favors from the family, including a loan of about $140,000 for a house, seats on the boards of two Gupta companies and help in starting a magazine.As the brothers\u2019 ties to the A.N.C. strengthened, their businesses began flourishing.In the early 2000s, they got their first big break: They won a large government contract to set up computer laboratories in schools in the nation\u2019s richest province.Then they went on a buying spree, acquiring a struggling information technology company that helped them become one of the biggest computer distributors in South Africa.They later bought a uranium mine, a steel manufacturer and other businesses.By the time Ajay was invited to join a separate advisory group \u2014 this one established by the Oppenheimers\u2019 foundation \u2014 he had a private plane, an eight-seat Hawker, said Mr. Spicer, who once hitched a ride aboard it.\u201cThe Guptas\u2019 plane flew in, the Oppenheimers\u2019 plane flew in,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cAnd, yes, there was always a bit of whose is longest.\u201dEven as the Guptas thrived off their ties to Mr. Mbeki\u2019s allies, they were reaching out to his archrival, Mr. Zuma, the No. 2 in the party.The two leaders fought bitterly. So Mr. Pahad, Mr. Mbeki\u2019s right-hand man, was surprised to learn that the Guptas had cultivated ties with the other side.\u201cThey were having some function at their home, and Ajay said to me, \u2018Do you mind if we invite Zuma?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pahad recalled.Money was an unspoken dynamic in the battle between Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Zuma: Who in the A.N.C. had gotten rich since the end of apartheid? And, perhaps more important, who had not?Mr. Mandela and some others \u2014 including South Africa\u2019s current president, Cyril Ramaphosa \u2014 became wealthy, in part through connections to white business leaders.During Mr. Mbeki\u2019s tenure, his allies got their chance, often by directing the course of the country\u2019s Black Economic Empowerment policies, which required white businesses to take on black partners.So when Mr. Zuma became president in 2009, it was his faction\u2019s turn.But Mr. Zuma, plagued by personal and political scandals, was distrusted by the white business establishment. And more than a decade after apartheid, many white businesses felt they had done enough to help \u2014 a sentiment that angered people close to Mr. Zuma.\u201cShould Anglo be allowed to say, \u2018We\u2019ve assisted Cyril Ramaphosa, so exonerate us?\u2019\u201d said Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane, Mr. Zuma\u2019s former mining minister. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201dCHINASaharanpurPAKISTANNew DelhiINDIAArabianSeaBay of BengalSRI LANKABy The New York TimesOne path to riches was still clear, though: government coffers.The Guptas hired or became business partners with the sons of powerful A.N.C. politicians, like Mr. Zuma\u2019s son Duduzane, and Tshepiso Magashule, the son of Ace Magashule, the party\u2019s current secretary general.It fell to the youngest of the Gupta brothers \u2014 the friendly and easygoing Rajesh, nicknamed Tony \u2014 to keep the sons happy. They went to nightclubs together and hung out in the family\u2019s compound in Johannesburg.The politicians\u2019 sons flew first class to Dubai and India, staying in the best rooms at high-end hotels, all at the Guptas\u2019 expense, according to emails from a Gupta-owned company leaked to South African news organizations and examined by The Times. One December, they joined the Gupta family on an extended vacation to Delhi, Dubai, New York and Venice, the emails show.In an interview, Mxolisi Dukwana, then Mr. Magashule\u2019s provincial minister of economic development, recalled how he and his boss went to visit Tony in Johannesburg. The president\u2019s son, Duduzane, was also there, he said.Tony asked Mr. Dukwana to endorse a large-scale development project in the province, promising him a monthly cut, Mr. Dukwana said.Tony added that he and the other two men in the room had a similar arrangement in a mining project, Mr. Dukwana said. He recounted Tony\u2019s saying that he \u201cpersonally gave\u201d monthly payments of about $71,000 each to Mr. Magashule and to the president\u2019s son.\u201cThen he asked them, \u2018Have I ever failed you?\u2019 And they both said no,\u201d Mr. Dukwana said.The three of them \u2014 Tony Gupta, Duduzane Zuma and Mr. Magashule \u2014 declined interview requests.Mr. Dukwana said he turned down the offer and thought he would never see Tony again.But a few years later, after Mr. Dukwana had left government, he said Tony invited him to Johannesburg. He sensed that Tony was hedging his bets \u2014 leaving open the possibility of a future relationship.Tony ended the meeting by handing him about $1,100, for \u201cpetrol.\u201d\u201cSo I took it,\u201d Mr. Dukwana said, \u201cand that was it.\u201dThe Guptas also gained great influence over the president and his affairs.According to witnesses in the government inquiry into the Zuma years, the Guptas had a say in choosing ministers, or even offered positions to candidates directly.When Mr. Zwane was appointed Mr. Zuma\u2019s mining minister in 2015 \u2014 one of the most important positions in the government \u2014 other politicians and industry officials were taken aback. He had been unknown on the national stage, and had no experience in mining.The Guptas, who had a stake in the project, sponsored a trip to India for Mr. Zwane and his church choir, according to the Gupta company emails. They paid for his first-class flight to Dubai and his stay at a five-star hotel.Then, as soon as he became mining minister, Mr. Zwane went to extraordinary lengths to help the brothers land a mining deal.The Guptas, along with Mr. Zuma\u2019s son as their business partner, had been trying to buy a troubled coal mine from Glencore, the Swiss commodities giant. Glencore had rejected the family\u2019s offer until Mr. Zwane, as mining minister, got directly involved.In Zurich in late 2015, Mr. Zwane and Tony Gupta met with the head of Glencore and persuaded him to sell the mine to the Guptas. After the meeting, Mr. Zwane flew out on the Guptas\u2019 private jet, according to the Gupta company emails. A Glencore spokesman declined to comment.Mr. Zwane\u2019s trip was an effort to \u201cunfairly and unduly influence a contract\u201d for the president\u2019s son, according to a report by the Public Protector\u2019s office, a government body that investigates corruption.But Ajay Gupta denied any \u201cinterference by Zwane.\u201d He said that his brother Tony had happened to be in Zurich on vacation and joined the meeting with Glencore.\u201cIt was a coincidence that my brother was there,\u201d Ajay said.In an interview, Mr. Zwane also denied improper ties with the Guptas, declining to answer questions about his trip to Zurich.But the relationship was so close that a Gupta employee coached Mr. Zwane after he was appointed minister, the leaked emails show.Days before Mr. Zwane was scheduled to address the South African news media, an executive at a Gupta company sent an email with detailed advice.If questioned about his role in the coal mine deal, he should call it a purchase \u201cby a black-owned consortium of which the Guptas form a part,\u201d enabling him to change \u201cthe complexion of the mining industry.\u201dDuduzane Zuma, the president\u2019s son, also helped the Guptas expand beyond mining. They started a newspaper and a television news station, ANN7, that thrived on government advertising, which their political connections easily secured.As in other projects, Duduzane Zuma was the Guptas\u2019 Black Economic Empowerment partner in the venture. But it was clear he was simply a proxy for the president, said Rajesh Sundaram, an Indian journalist who worked directly under Atul Gupta to start the channel.In meetings that Mr. Sundaram attended with the Guptas and the president, Mr. Zuma was intimately engaged in the network\u2019s launch, giving advice on everything from the background set for news presentations to the tone of the coverage, he said.At one meeting, the president expressed satisfaction with video of a rival politician getting out of a helicopter because it made him look \u201ccorrupt,\u201d Mr. Sundaram said.\u201cIt was actually Zuma who was acting like a business partner, not Duduzane,\u201d Mr. Sundaram said. \u201cHis son was there just goofing around, cracking jokes.\u201dSeeing how close the Guptas were with Mr. Zuma, Mr. Sundaram said he once asked Atul, \u201cWhat if Zuma goes?\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got everyone in our pocket,\u201d Atul replied, Mr. Sundaram recalled. \u201cMany in the A.N.C. are waiting and are desperate to get in touch with us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not fools to put all our eggs in one basket,\u201d Mr. Sundaram recounted Atul saying.Atul Gupta and Mr. Zuma declined to be interviewed.As the Gupta brothers prospered, they flaunted it.They enlisted a top Bollywood actor, Anil Kapoor, to produce a 2007 movie they financed, \u201cGandhi, My Father,\u201d touching on Gandhi\u2019s time in South Africa. Both Mr. Mandela and Mr. Mbeki publicly showered the Guptas with praise.But two events \u2014 both, as it turned out, related to planes \u2014 contributed to their undoing.In 2013, the brothers chartered a plane with about 200 guests from India to attend the extravagant wedding of a niece in Sun City, South Africa\u2019s Las Vegas. They invited relatives, friends, businessmen and politicians, mostly from India.\u201cThey needed to shout from the roof, \u2018Hey, we have arrived,\u2019\u201d said Amar Singh, a political figure in the Guptas\u2019 home province in India.But the brothers miscalculated. Using their political connections, they landed the plane near Sun City \u2014 at a military base. Its use by a private family set off a government inquiry, turning the Guptas into a favorite target of opposition politicians eager to expose corruption under Mr. Zuma.Ajay Gupta said he followed the rules to get permission and did not regret the lavish wedding.\u201cAfter that, we hand over the girl to the other family,\u201d Mr. Gupta said, tears welling in his eyes.Soon enough, the Guptas were embroiled in another drama, one that pitted them against the Oppenheimers, the family dynasty that had been South Africa\u2019s most powerful for a century.But the Oppenheimers couldn\u2019t get permission to handle international flights. Despite countless letters and calls to A.N.C. officials, the Oppenheimers were getting nowhere.Eventually, they sued the government, accusing the Guptas of using their political influence to stall the business. The brothers, the Oppenheimers said, wanted in on the terminal.According to court documents, the Guptas sent a message to the Oppenheimers that they had \u201cthe wrong B.E.E. partner\u201d \u2014 referring to the Black Economic Empowerment program. If the Oppenheimers chose a partner endorsed by the Guptas, the documents said, their \u201cproblems would go away.\u201dThe last straw was another appointment: In late 2015, Mr. Zuma chose an unknown lawmaker \u2014 considered close to the Guptas \u2014 as finance minister.Alarmed, the business establishment and its A.N.C. allies struck back, forcing Mr. Zuma to remove the minister after only four days.Within weeks, a major South African bank cut ties with the Gupta family. The country\u2019s other big banks followed.With the Guptas increasingly shut out of South Africa\u2019s economy, an Indian bank handed them a lifeline.For more than a decade, the Guptas had fostered relations with the South African branch of the Bank of Baroda, India\u2019s second-biggest national bank.When the bank\u2019s chief executive in South Africa asked for an internship for his son, the family obliged and even sent a round-trip ticket, according to the Gupta company emails. When the bank\u2019s employees needed help getting work visas from the South Africa bureaucracy, the Guptas obliged.After South Africa\u2019s banks cut ties with the Guptas, Baroda continued to do business with the brothers. Its chief executive in South Africa issued a letter of support when the Guptas moved to buy the coal mine from Glencore \u2014 without telling his superiors in India.In an interview in Mumbai, the bank\u2019s chief executive, P. S. Jayakumar, said branch employees did not collude with the Guptas.\u201cBank of Baroda is an Indian bank,\u201d Mr. Jayakumar said. \u201cGuptas are Indian. So there was a connection made and a lot of heightened observations made, all of which are not true.\u201dBut an investigation by the South African Reserve Bank, the nation\u2019s central bank, found that Baroda\u2019s internal systems had flagged about 4,000 suspicious transactions in the Guptas\u2019 accounts. Employees dismissed nearly all of the alerts \u201cwithout adequate reasons being provided,\u201d according to a confidential report by PwC, the international auditing firm, that was reviewed by The Times.Baroda announced this year that it would leave South Africa, but said the decision was unrelated to the Guptas.Here in Saharanpur, questions also emerged around the family\u2019s temple. A separate series of complicated bank transfers \u2014 intended, experts say, to hide the source of the money \u2014 was financing the construction, according to the Gupta company emails.Pressure from South Africa drove the Indian authorities to investigate. Officials raided the Guptas\u2019 properties in Saharanpur, saying they had information that the family had brought \u201cillicit money\u201d to India.The Guptas were getting nervous. Their most powerful ally, Mr. Zuma, was scheduled to step down as the A.N.C.\u2019s leader in late 2017. The brothers would soon find out whether they had eggs in more than one basket.Mr. Dukwana, the former official in Free State, said that right before the party election he got a call from Tony Gupta, who had given him gas money at their last meeting.Sounding \u201cbubbly,\u201d Tony told him he was calling from Dubai, Mr. Dukwana said.\u201cThey needed some friends,\u201d Mr. Dukwana said.The Gupta empire was getting squeezed. Locked out of banks, the brothers could not pay their employees or debts. Their only public company was delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange. South African companies, big and small, refused to do business with them.Cornered, they sold a mining company and their media empire in quick succession. Many of their remaining companies filed for bankruptcy protection and are now managed by outside supervisors.Mr. Zuma technically had more than a year left as South Africa\u2019s president. But it became clear he would be forced out much sooner.South Africans, predicting the end of the Guptas, began tracking the family\u2019s prized Bombardier Global 6000 jet as it traveled to Dubai, Russia, Switzerland and elsewhere.On Feb. 4, the Guptas turned off the jet\u2019s GPS tracking device, according to Canada\u2019s export credit agency, which had lent the Guptas $41 million to buy the Bombardier. The agency sued to get the plane back, saying the Guptas might use it \u201cto escape justice.\u201dSpeculation spread that Ajay Gupta had fled aboard his private jet. A South African pilot, who had supposedly refused to take off, briefly became a hero on Twitter. But they were just rumors.In fact, most of the family and their private jet were already in India for a wedding, Ajay said.And on Feb. 6, as the battle in the A.N.C. raged, Ajay boarded an Emirates red-eye flight to Dubai, airport officials later confirmed.On his last flight out, Ajay said, he kept to his normal routine, avoiding meals and movies. He closed his eyes and drifted off.Outside it was cloudy and windy. The plane banked north and flew up the continent\u2019s eastern coast, taking him out of Africa.Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d to promote entrepreneurship across the United States and seed investments in cities often overlooked by venture capital funds. In doing so, the two men have recruited a list of who\u2019s who in business, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Charles and David Koch of Koch Industries, to be part of their investment fund.The fund is part of a larger movement to reimagine company towns, and a challenge for venture capital funds to look beyond California, New York and Massachusetts \u2014 the three states that receive 75 percent of venture capital in the United States.\u201cIt takes a set of ingredients, including a comfort with new ideas and diversity,\u201d said Walter Isaacson, the authorized biographer of \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d and a history professor. \u201cIt takes a willingness to take risks and even to fail at times.\u201dThat is the magic of her city, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said in conversation with Mr. Isaacson and Mr. Case at the Cities for Tomorrow conference. The city reimagined itself from the 1962 World\u2019s Fair and is the home of Amazon, Nordstrom, Microsoft, Starbucks and Costco \u2014 what Ms. Durkan called \u201csmall mom-and-pop companies that stay below the radar until they\u2019re not.\u201dBut on the conference stage, the discussion shifted from the benefits of rising cities to the reality of one rising sector.\u201cEven in the successful cities, the success masks this other part of the city that hasn\u2019t risen,\u201d Ms. Durkan said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen that in Seattle, with the huge growth of tech and the new economy, but it masks some real displacement, some real lack of opportunity.\u201dThe elephant in the room was Amazon. Two-hundred-thirty-eight cities across North America applied to be home for the company\u2019s next headquarters, and last month Amazon selected Long Island City, Queens, and Crystal City, Va., for HQ2.Mr. Case pointed to the other 236 cities as ones with real opportunities also awaiting them. Those are the cities that can really rise, he said.\u201cMy hope is that the 236 that lost, if they take half of the energy they put into rallying their community, driving collaboration, and half of the dollars they were putting on the table to lure them, and refocus that on their start-up community, they might create the next Amazon,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accelerate Like a \u2018Speeding Freight Train\u2019 in 2018", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreenhouse gas emissions worldwide are growing at an accelerating pace this year, researchers said Wednesday, putting the world on track to face some of the most severe consequences of global warming sooner than expected.Scientists described the quickening rate of carbon dioxide emissions in stark terms, comparing it to a \u201cspeeding freight train\u201d and laying part of the blame on an unexpected surge in the appetite for oil as people around the world not only buy more cars but also drive them farther than in the past \u2014 more than offsetting any gains from the spread of electric vehicles.The new assessment is the third major scientific report in recent months to send a message that the world is failing to make sufficient progress to avoid the worst effects of climate change.Even as coal has fallen out of favor in some markets, the rise in emissions has been driven by stronger demand for natural gas and oil, scientists said. And even as the use of renewable energy like solar and wind power has expanded exponentially, it has not been enough to offset the increased use of fossil fuels.\u201cWe thought oil use had peaked in the U.S. and Europe 15 years ago,\u201d Dr. Jackson said. \u201cThe cheap gasoline prices, bigger cars and people driving more miles are boosting oil use at rates that none of us expected.\u201dMore investment will be needed in the transportation sector to cut pollution, said Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, a professor of climate change science and policy at the University of East Anglia and lead author of one of the new studies. \u201cWe have electric cars, but we need charging points, we need to lower the costs of electric vehicles,\u201d she said.China produces 27 percent of global emissions, according to the report. The United States accounts for 15 percent of emissions, the European Union 10 percent and India 7 percent.China\u2019s emissions are projected to rise 4.7 percent in 2018, the report said. The country is stimulating manufacturing to counterbalance its slowing economy, allowing more coal-based manufacturing that it had avoided in the past, Dr. Jackson said.United States emissions are expected to rise 2.5 percent this year after several years of declines, and despite a shift away from coal toward cleaner sources of energy. Dr. Jackson attributed part of the increase this year to a colder-than-normal winter in some parts of the country and a hotter summer in other parts, which inflated demand for heating and cooling.In India, a projected emissions increase of 6.3 percent is linked to the country\u2019s effort to provide electricity to 300 million people who currently lack it.Emissions in the European Union are expected to decline by 0.7 percent this year, but the bloc averaged a 2.2 percent annual decline last decade. The weaker number was attributed to an increase in oil consumption linked to transportation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Hits New 2018 Lows as Fed Decision Looms Over Markets", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street notched a new low for the year on Monday, as worries about the economy continued to dog investors ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve decision on interest rates later this week.It was the latest in a string of volatile trading sessions that has left investors limping through the last weeks of 2018. Since stocks reached a record high in September, the market has been buffeted by a range of concerns, from signs that the trade war between China and the United States is beginning to weigh on global growth to worries that higher interest rates will eat into corporate profits.It made for a shaky day in the markets. Crude oil dove. Corporate bonds were lower. Stocks dropped almost across the board, with shares of tech, health care and small companies as well as blue-chip corporations all lower.When the dust had cleared, the S&P 500 was down 2.1 for the day and 4.8 percent for the year. Should the market fail to recover, 2018 would be Wall Street\u2019s worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago.Asian markets followed Wall Street\u2019s drop. By midday on Tuesday, shares in Tokyo, China and Australia were down 1 percent or more, as investors expressed disappointment over a lack of specific proposals in a closely watched speech by President Xi Jinping of China. Still, futures contracts tracking Wall Street suggested that it could open higher on Tuesday morning.The sell-off came after another indication that the American economy, while still strong, is showing signs of slowing. The Empire State manufacturing index, a somewhat limited gauge of economic sentiment among manufacturers in New York State, tumbled sharply. A survey of American homebuilders also showed sentiment continuing to fall in an area of the economy where rising mortgage rates have hurt affordability and sales.\u201cEvery part of the market has been acting like things are a lot slower,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth. \u201cEverywhere, every market is telling you the same thing.\u201dPresident Trump sent a Twitter message on Monday calling \u201cincredible\u201d the widespread expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when it concludes its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed to stop a rate-increase cycle that started in December 2015.Fed interest rate increases are traditionally viewed as a negative for stock prices, and as evidence mounted in recent weeks that the global economy was starting to slow, investors have increasingly attuned to comments about the Fed\u2019s plans. Many financial market analysts date the start of sharp slump for stocks to comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, in early October that seemed to suggest that the central bank was intent on raising interest rates further than many had expected.In late November, Mr. Powell sent stocks up sharply when he said the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate was \u201cjust below\u201d the neutral level, which many saw as a sign the central bank might not be as aggressive in raising rates as initially thought.Most investors still expect the Fed to lift its key interest rate when the central bank concludes the two-day meeting on Wednesday, but expectations are growing that the central bank will somehow signal that it is aware that conditions in financial markets have deteriorated sharply, and could reflect real risks for the economy.The Fed\u2019s decision is likely to be one of the last major events for markets in what has been a difficult year for investors. If investors are disappointed by the Fed\u2019s decision, the market slump could get worse.\u201cIf monetary policy doesn\u2019t change its direction, you will have a significant meltdown on this,\u201d said Steven Ricchiuto, chief United States economist with Mizuho Securities. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot riding on it.\u201dThe pain on Monday was not limited to stocks. In the commodities markets, prices for benchmark American crude oil fell close to 4 percent, tumbling below $50 a barrel.Investors moved to the safety of Treasury bonds, pushing yields \u2014 which move in the opposite direction of prices \u2014 on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.85 percent, the lowest level since early September. Typically, falling yields are associated with softening economic conditions. Borrowing costs in corporate bond markets rose, as investors shied away from risk.This year\u2019s sell-off is nothing like the collapse of stocks a decade ago, when the S&P 500 fell more than 38 percent. But in its own way, 2018 is emerging as a remarkable year for financial markets, with almost every type of investment and asset class \u2014 stocks, bonds, commodities, even safe Treasuries \u2014 posting negative or minuscule returns.Until recently, shares of health care companies had been something of an outlier against that backdrop. The S&P 500 health care sector had rallied after the November midterm elections as investors figured that threats to the Affordable Care Act would fade after the Democrats retook control of the House.Centene, an insurer based in St. Louis that has built a large business servicing government-funded Medicaid programs, fell 4.8 percent as trading volume surged. The hospital chain HCA also fell sharply, as any change to the law that resulted in lower levels of insurance would most likely result in higher costs for the hospitals. The S&P 500 health care sector fell 2.1 percent.Carlos Tejada contributed to this report.Advertisement"}

But after Cambridge Analytica gave her the boot without so much as a kind word or her last paycheck, she finally understood that money bought self-respect. Without self-respect, she was nothing.She returned to her auction site on the dark web. Still no action. Her reserve price had surfaced the four whales. Would she be showing weakness or, worse, desperation sending them a reminder? No, she was in charge, and she would demonstrate that with a final prod, a do-it-or-lose-forever stick-in-the-eye. Above all else, her bidders could not abide losing. Nor could they afford to.She began with Saeed, her Iranian contact. Micro-targeted spear phishing would be much more potent than the SQL injection and DDoS attacks they had used to cripple American banking websites. Her database would provide a rash of entry points for their malware to take down Saudi oil fields.Sal\u00e2am alaikum. Our auction ends in 4 minutes. Just between us, the Chinese are coming in with a billion at the close. I\u2019d rather you win AND stick it to the American infidels by paying me with their hostage ransom money. Are you going to let their crippling sanctions and the Israeli destruction of your priceless centrifuges go unanswered?She waited for a reply, but heard just the drumming of her own heart. She moved on to Pak, her North Korean connection. Their Reconnaissance General Bureau was at least 5,000 hackers strong and adept at brute force cyberattacks. Their email hack of Sony Pictures for the lampooning of their supreme leader had devastated the company. With Sofie\u2019s database, they could take down more financial institutions and military agencies, keep themselves on the world stage and finance their feeble economy at the same time.\uc815\uc2dd\uc5ec\ubcf4\uc138\uc694. Billion dollar bid just came in from your neighbor. Show your rivals you are no laughingstock. Long live North Korean strength, unpredictability and wily intelligence!Her laptop pinged. She pumped her fist: Her two messages were just opened.Three minutes and counting. Sofie forged ahead and considered how best to rile Misha. He represented a coalition that included the Russian government, wealthy oligarchs and criminal gangs. Should she emphasize the financial gain possible with the pairing of her database and the massive storehouse of credit card information that their mafia had already amassed? The opportunity to disrupt Western military, electrical and banking infrastructures? The ability to misinform, divide and reshape Western opinions? She went for the highest stake.\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0442. Auction for the weapon of the century is ending. The Chinese have sent in a kill bid. I\u2019m obligated to take it, but hey, I make the rules. I\u2019d prefer my database be used to change elections and blackmail hypocritical, holier-than-thou American politicians. And smarmy British toadies. And German rats. You have 90 seconds to win this.With less than 2 minutes left, she considered ignoring Lao Da. The Chinese had ticked her off with two insultingly low \u201cfill-or-kill\u201d bids and then threatened to walk away. They returned each time though, unabashed. They had more resources than all of the other bidders combined and were above spear phishing for petty gains. By combining Sofie\u2019s database with the 22 million U.S. Office of Personnel Management files in their possession, they could steal intellectual properties and military secrets at will for their industrial and state-owned operations.The Russians have come to play with a cool billion. Can you do better??? You have 30 seconds to enter your final bid.Watching her clock tick down, Sofie dug the tip of her father\u2019s lucky Montblanc \u2014 the one he reserved for his second set of books \u2014 into her thigh. She smiled picturing him tossing his apartment for it and cursing her.At 00:30, her message box began to ding. She was right. Auctions happened in the last seconds. Her body went limp with relief.$525 million final bid, $530 million, $505 million and $509 million.The bastards were colluding. Not only did they disregard her billion-dollar threat, their bids were obscenely close. Someone had unlocked the multilayer state-of-the-art security on her site and contacted their rivals. Of course they did. She was dealing with the best hackers in the world. Sofie\u2019s head pounded with rage.She should invalidate the auction and start over. The thought depressed her. It had taken her nearly a year to disguise her identity, set up her site, get the word out, vet all the players and create an airtight verification process. Moreover, portions of her data were time sensitive.By colluding, they would all get her database, so why shouldn\u2019t they each pay her price? They had invalidated the auction. A new game was in play.A corner of her lip crooked upward as Sofie crafted her message. She congratulated each player for winning the auction at their submitted bid and enclosed an OAuth token \u2014 good for 1 minute only \u2014 that would unlock the encryption keys to her database upon the transfer of funds. One way or another, she would get her billion dollars.Maggie Shen King is author of \u201cAn Excess Male,\u201d published by Harper Voyager in 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former U.N. Secretary-General Urges China to Increase Presence on World Stage", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareBan praises country\u2019s efforts to maintain global peace, tackle climate change and eradicate poverty.Ban Ki-moon, former U.N. secretary-general, summarized China\u2019s 40 years of reform and opening up by using one of his favorite phrases \uff0d \u201cWith great success comes great responsibility.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe the phenomenal changes and development China has made with the reform and opening up of Chinese society and the economy since 1978.\u201dDescribing China\u2019s economic achievements during the past four decades as \u201ca miracle\u201d, Ban said that in addition to making its own people richer, the country\u2019s contribution to the world has been to set a development model for other developing nations.He noted that in 1978, the year the policy was adopted, China\u2019s GDP accounted for just 2 percent of the global total, and many people in the country were living below the poverty line.However, economic and social development in China has grown by leaps and bounds as a result of the policy.According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China\u2019s GDP rose by 6.9 percent to $12.06 trillion last year, one-fifth of the global total and surpassing the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan to retain the country\u2019s position as the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Moreover, the monthly per capita disposable income of China\u2019s urban workers rose to $5,245, 104 times higher than in 1978, while rural monthly per capita net incomes rose to $1,935 from $20.\u201cOne of the greatest achievements of China\u2019s economic growth is that it has lifted more than 700 million people out of absolute poverty, accounting for 70 percent of global poverty reduction during the period,\u201d Ban said.Stressing the importance of China\u2019s poverty alleviation efforts, he added that the country has also made a commitment to accept more responsibility within the international community.Nearly two years after leaving the U.N., the 74-year-old still appreciates China\u2019s continued leadership and multilateral engagement within the organization in support of resolving regional and global challenges.Ban held office from 2007 to 2016, and during his tenure he was a keen promoter of tackling climate change and other global challenges.\u201cDuring my two terms as U.N. secretary-general, I am proud to have prioritized and expanded the importance of the organization\u2019s global development efforts,\u201d he said.In 2015, the U.N. and its 193 member countries passed the 2030 Agenda and its 17 sustainable development goals. Ban said the goals offer the world a way to confront the most critical issues of our time, including poverty reduction, education, inequality, climate change, improvements in public health, and gender equality.The initiative called for \u201cmultistakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries\u201d, Ban said.He added that in the three years since the goals were adopted, progress remains uneven and some sectors and regions are moving faster than others. However, he also noted that cooperation between the U.N. and China has accelerated, and said the country\u2019s crucial role in advancing the goals at home and abroad is providing a better quality of life for the world.China released its national plan for implementing the goals in 2016, which Ban said \u201cperfectly incorporated its domestic development plan with an international commitment\u201d.Ban said he pays a lot of attention to climate change because it is altering the Earth\u2019s character and creating dire risks and instability.\u201cFrom record-breaking heat waves and wildfires, to hurricanes and flooding of historic intensity, climate change is no longer a debate. It is clearly here right now. The extreme weather events of just the last few months alone point to a bleak and dangerous future,\u201d he noted.\u201cThis summer, California has been engulfed in flames and smoke from historic wildfires. Intense and prolonged heat waves claimed dozens of lives in Japan and the Korean Peninsula. And near Greenland, the Arctic\u2019s thickest sea ice broke up for first time on record. These events no longer seem like anomalies; rather, they appear to be the new normal.\u201dHe added that the necessary steps should be taken to combat climate change, otherwise these turbulent shifts will continue to bring dangerous scorching heat waves to cities and rural areas, which will drive displacement and seriously threaten entire communities and countries.The agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, set viable targets to limit rising temperatures, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and spur climate-resilient development and green growth.\u201cTo achieve these goals, we need to keep working together,\u201d Ban said, adding that he is deeply disappointed that the United States has withdrawn from the agreement, and that the move isolates the U.S. from every other country in terms of climate policy.\u201cIt is scientifically wrong and economically irresponsible, and it will be on the wrong side of history. I greatly hope that this decision is reconsidered and reversed,\u201d he said.However, he believes that there are still many reasons for optimism.He said China\u2019s growing climate leadership in these difficult times for the planet has the potential to positively affect the Asian region and the world at large. The country\u2019s decision to set a deadline to completely phase out sales of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles is a sterling example in this regard, he added.Ban said he also greatly values China\u2019s contribution to U.N. peacekeeping pledges, adding that the country\u2019s contribution of troops for U.N. missions in complex and challenging environments is \u201ca role model for other countries\u201d.He listed China\u2019s contributions to the promotion of peace and security in Syria, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sudan and South Sudan, and encouraged the country to remain focused on these issues.\u201cThis shows not only that China is a peace-loving country, but it is also taking more responsibility to bring peace to other places in the world,\u201d he said.Born in the Republic of Korea in 1944, Ban witnessed how the Korean War (1950-53) destroyed buildings, separated families and damaged economies.\u201cI grew up in war, and I saw the U.N. help my country recover and rebuild. That experience was a big part of what led me to pursue a career in public service,\u201d he said.Established in 1945, the U.N. was designed to provide an international forum for the maintenance of global peace and security in the wake of the war. Although the U.N. had numerous critics at the time, Ban said the organization offered all nations and peoples an alternative to the bombs, guns and destruction of World War II.He added that China\u2019s work to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula has been noted by the people of the area.\u201cNever in the history of the ROK and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea have we seen such an exciting process of reconciliation between the two countries,\u201d he said.\u201cChina\u2019s efforts cannot be neglected. It has played a very important role by engaging with the DPRK leader Kim Jong-un three times this year. It\u2019s very important that Kim understands and learns from China\u2019s rapid industrialization and development through reform and opening up. I think Pyongyang could gain a lot by opening up and engaging in the denuclearization process.\u201dBan has long been actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relations because his ties to the U.N. date back to 1975, when he worked for the ROK foreign ministry\u2019s U.N. division.His work expanded over the years, with assignments that included serving as chairman of the preparatory commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization and chef de cabinet during the ROK\u2019s presidency of the U.N. General Assembly in 2001-02.China\u2019s reform and opening up had synergies with the country\u2019s due role and proper influence in the U.N., Ban said, stressing that the thing he most appreciated was China\u2019s vision of \u201cmutual prosperity and coexistence\u201d.\u201cMy country, the Republic of Korea, is also benefiting from this Chinese philosophy,\u201d Ban said, adding that China\u2019s support was instrumental in the ROK\u2019s gaining U.N. membership in 1991.In April, Ban began work as chairman of the Boao Forum for Asia. He said his future career goal is to work with China and many other countries at the forum to fight more global challenges: \u201cOur world is going through pronounced changes, and this is resulting in elevated uncertainties and new risks.\u201dHe said unilateralism and protectionism have become the main threats to the world, and while China continuously contributes to global financial and economic development, it can make a greater contribution.\u201cChina should feel a sense of responsibility for global economic and financial development as a whole,\u201d he said, adding that the country\u2019s achievements are the result of multilateral trade liberalization, which has been the major factor in bringing about global prosperity, peace, and stability since the end of WWII.He said he has seen more moves by China that are aimed at resisting the anti-globalization trend and deepening the country\u2019s integration with the global market. As an example, he pointed out that the first China International Import Expo, held in Shanghai last month, demonstrated the country\u2019s determination to expand opening up and work with the international community on tough global issues.\u201cThe expo was a great occasion to stress the importance of free trade and market liberalization, which should be learned by other countries,\u201d he said.Ban also highlighted the Belt and Road Initiative, which will not only benefit people in participating countries but also build a community with a shared vision for mankind.At the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province in April, President Xi Jinping promised the nonstop continuation of reform and opening up and a commitment to an open economy, which, according to Ban, \u201cwas significant for domestic development, as well as that of the international community\u201d.\u201cBecause China is not going out on its own, it also sets an example for, and brings benefits to, other countries,\u201d he said.Pan MengqiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

Now, they are speeding up.Faced with a volatile stock market and the prospect of an economic downturn next year, the ride-hailing services have moved more urgently toward an initial public offering, said four people with knowledge of the companies\u2019 plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly.\u201cCompanies that were talking about 2020 have been told that the window may not be open as long as previously thought,\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who advises on I.P.O.s. He said that he was telling companies that \u201cif an I.P.O. is in your plan, I would probably be getting ready now.\u201dThose attitudes have shifted as investors and tech employees have increased pressure on the companies to go public so that they can cash in their shares.\u201cThe forcing factor is, how do you deal with issues of employee retention?\u201d said Rick Heitzmann, a managing director at FirstMark Capital, which is an investor in unicorns such as Pinterest and Airbnb.But the seesawing stock market, a trade war with China and other countries and uncertainty over the direction of the economy are all now weighing on I.P.O. decision-making. Few executives want to take their companies public when investors\u2019 appetite for shares may be ebbing.\u201cCompanies that were waiting for everything to be perfect before going public might have been better off going when things were good enough,\u201d Mr. Heitzmann said.Sandy Miller, a venture capitalist at IVP, said several companies were meeting with potential investors far ahead of filing for an I.P.O., in what are known as pre-roadshow events. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way to really know what kind of receptivity you\u2019re going to have\u201d from the public markets, he said.Mr. Miller said that he expected a robust year for I.P.O.s next year, but that companies may not want to wait until too late in the year to file. \u201cThere are certainly some storm clouds on the horizon,\u201d he said.Inside Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, has raced to prepare the company to go public. Over the past year, the company has overhauled many of its internal processes, from items as small as creating more formal systems for expense reports to global safeguards that ensure legal compliance in every area where Uber operates.Going public sooner could give Uber a number of advantages. It would mean raising fresh outside capital, providing the company ammunition to pursue acquisitions and other opportunities. And it would enable Mr. Khosrowshahi to potentially reshape Uber\u2019s board because current members can be asked to leave when there is a liquidity event like an I.P.O., according to the company charter. Uber\u2019s board has grappled with a history of infighting.Any offering would be \u201csubject to market and other conditions,\u201d Lyft said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Slows Sharply, in Challenge for Xi Jinping", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow badly this hurts him could depend on the extent to which Chinese workers like Yu Hong find their jobs disappearing. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Yu, 46, was boarding a train home, to Hubei Province in central China, for a nearly three-month unpaid holiday. The lamp factory in Dongguan where he works had drastically reduced pay and cut hours.\u201cThe whole environment is different now,\u201d Mr. Yu said. \u201cFor migrant workers like us, we just want to earn more money.\u201dGauging the magnitude of the slowdown is difficult, given the unreliability of China\u2019s economic data. But there are signs that the country\u2019s problems are deepening.\u201cXi Jinping has likened China to an ocean that no storm can disturb, but the tempest now hitting it is by far the biggest\u201d in years, said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics in London, who estimates that growth has fallen even lower than during the crisis.Mr. Xi now faces more of a diplomatic balancing act. The Chinese authorities have detained two Canadian nationals, in apparent retaliation for Canada\u2019s arrest of a top Chinese telecommunications executive at the behest of Washington. But Chinese officials have struck a quieter tone with the Trump administration over the arrest and separate allegations of hacking, since a sharp escalation in the trade war could seriously damage the economy.President Trump already senses an advantage. \u201cChina just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them,\u201d he tweeted on Friday. (The slowdown began before the imposition of the tariffs, but they have hurt both business and consumer confidence and will probably pinch even more if they linger or intensify.)Thanks to the government\u2019s tight hold on important industries and the financial sector, it has more levers to pull in case of a downturn than practically any other country. Beijing\u2019s efforts in the spring to wean the economy off debt, a major cause of the slowdown, are now being reversed.Already, China has ramped up the sort of government-led spending that bailed out its economy in the past. At Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant that supplies many highway and rail builders, sales have jumped 50 percent from a year ago, said Wang Min, the company\u2019s chairman.But China\u2019s options for juicing the economy aren\u2019t as effective as they used to be.A small but notable rise in defaults in China has made some lenders nervous. Rules adopted since the financial crisis make China\u2019s bank managers responsible for life for loans that aren\u2019t repaid, and that has them more leery of extending financing to keep troubled businesses afloat. Government-led spending adds to the huge debt pile, making that long-term drag on growth even worse.But beneath the surface, a sharp slowdown is building. Foreign investment plunged last month. Auto sales over the past three months have fallen by record percentages. Floor space completed, one gauge of the housing market\u2019s health, has slumped this year. Sentiment among Chinese purchasing managers has soured.\u201cWe don\u2019t have much to do, so I decided to go home and rest,\u201d said Li Shulian, a 46-year-old worker at a Dongguan plastics factory, as she stood at a train station with her husband, her teenage daughter and several suitcases. Their factory gave them a week off in October and nearly a week in November, both times with almost no pay. Overtime pay also vanished, so Ms. Li\u2019s monthly earnings were nearly halved to $435.Told early this month that the three of them would be working \u2014 and paid \u2014 only on alternate days, they quit and bought tickets on the nearly 12-hour train back to their hometown in central China.\u201cI haven\u2019t gone home this early for the holidays since I left my hometown in 2005,\u201d Ms. Li said.Businesses say they are cutting hours as demand has slowed. In part, they have room to cut back because many factories were previously running full out.\u201cYou quite easily can reduce overtime,\u201d said Jochem Heizmann, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group China, which directly and through joint ventures employs 100,000 Chinese workers.The slowdown is palpable in southern China\u2019s manufacturing capitals of Guangzhou and Dongguan.\u201cThis year, people are just going home earlier than before,\u201d said Judy Zhu, who runs a small shop selling cheap plastic suitcases outside a Dongguan train station. Her busiest time is usually January, when the Lunar New Year holiday typically begins, but this year her sales picked up early.Li Xiaohong, a 50-year-old construction worker, stood near a job recruitment storefront on the outskirts of Guangzhou. Handwritten signs advertised low-wage jobs, but most had age limits. None went up to 50.Mr. Li said he had worked only two weeks in the past month, as real estate developers across China ran low on cash.\u201cI used to be very busy working 12 hours a day, with only three to five days\u2019 rest in a month,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cNow, we don\u2019t have much work to do.\u201dEmployers are becoming more cautious about whom they hire, government and private sector surveys show. Not surprisingly, fewer people appear to be job-hopping.\u201cThey do not dare to quit without being able to find another one,\u201d said Lei Kaifeng, a labor recruiter at a hiring hall in Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southeastern China.The big question is what will happen next year, particularly in coastal areas dependent on exports to the United States.Many supply chains to the United States are stuffed with extra inventory thanks to stockpiling, so American importers may need fewer goods in the months ahead.\u201cI am still panicked now, afraid of facing a winter for business next year,\u201d said Cyril Liu, a 23-year-old engineer in southeastern China, who was recently sent home for a nine-day unpaid vacation because his employer, a manufacturer of printed circuit boards, has few orders. \u201cMany friends in small businesses are worried about their jobs next year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Huawei Arrest Shows Trump Has No Game Plan Against China", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy escalating tensions over national security, the United States may be hurting its own position in trade talks.The administration is going to face many more difficult moments like this as its steps up competition with China, but its actions thus far suggest that it doesn\u2019t have a fully formed plan for how to manage the task.While it appears that the timing of Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest was coincidental, this is not the impression in Beijing, where the move is seen as a political play to create leverage on trade or cripple Chinese technology companies. If this is not the case, the administration needs to come out much more clearly with a solid message about Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest and where it fits within broader American goals toward China.Moreover, the fact that American officials allowed the summit to play out without raising the issue \u2014 or informing Mr. Trump, apparently \u2014 sends another muddled message to Beijing. Does it suggest the administration will continue to throw curveballs regardless of what China brings to the table? Or does it simply reveal a team that is hopelessly divided between factions with competing goals? Either way, if China concludes that the United States will pursue a barrage of punitive actions no matter what steps China takes to address American concerns, this will leave Beijing with little appetite to make meaningful concessions.If Ms. Meng and Huawei violated the law, then the United States has every right to seek her arrest and bring her to trial. Suggesting that this principle is for sale would cheapen the idea that the United States cares about playing by the rules. It would also signal to American allies and to China that American concerns about technology theft or violations of sanctions against Iran can simply be traded away for other priorities. Using the arrest for political ends could also encourage China and other nations to employ more heavy-handed tactics against American businesses in the future.Moreover, continued moves against Chinese technology firms will have long-term implications for America\u2019s interests abroad. The administration is right to be concerned about America\u2019s technological prowess and protecting sensitive infrastructure. But if our actions lead China to accelerate its plans to achieve self-sufficiency in key technologies \u2014 a likely development \u2014 we will be creating a more formidable competitor.

{"Headline": "Vietnam\u2019s Sad Hunt: 300,000 Missing Souls ", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDecades after the war with America ended, Vietnamese families continue to search for the remains of their kin who are still missing in action. Mr. Babcock, a teacher of writing, is working on a book about contemporary Vietnam.On July 27, the day a collection of remains believed to be those of American soldiers lost in the Korean War were flown out of North Korea, I was driving from Hanoi to Vietnam\u2019s rural northern province of Yen Bai. My host that morning was Ngo Thuy Hang, the 42-year-old vice director of Marin, a local nonprofit devoted to helping Vietnamese families locate the remains of their loved ones.More than 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers are still missing from the war with America, a heartbreaking statistic that reverberates across thousands of Vietnamese families, mostly in the north. And though Vietnam\u2019s government has made scattered efforts to search for remains, the resources devoted to finding the missing Vietnamese are a small fraction of those devoted to recovering the 1,600 Americans still listed as M.I.A. from the same war.Having a missing family member is particularly traumatic in Vietnam\u2019s culture of ancestor worship, which dictates that if the dead aren\u2019t found and buried along with other ancestors in their hometown, where relatives can pray and honor them, the dead person becomes a lost soul, wandering homeless and hungry, in a kind of permanent purgatory.We were headed to a small village outside of Yen Bai\u2019s sleepy main town to visit Nguyen Thi Sinh, 96, who lost two sons in the war with America. In 2014 the government made her one of 40,000 Heroic Mothers of Vietnam, an official title given to \u201cmothers who have made numerous contributions and sacrifices for the cause of national liberation,\u201d the sacrifices being losing more than one son, losing an only son or losing one son and having another return wounded. The younger of Ms. Sinh\u2019s two sons killed in the war, Binh, died in 1973 near the city of Hue; his body was recovered and buried in the family cemetery. Her older son, Ky, who reportedly died in 1968 in the southern-central province of Binh Dinh, is still missing.\u201cI try not to worry because worrying doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Ms. Sinh said, smiling, \u201cbut it would be great if my son could come home by the end of this year.\u201dTo the right of where we sat was a large, carved wood altar holding fruit and incense. On the wall above the altar hung pictures of Binh and Ky in military uniform.A volunteer from Ms. Hang\u2019s group sitting next to Ms. Sinh took her hand and said the process took time, with a lot of old paperwork to sort through and people to contact.\u201cYes, yes, I know,\u201d Ms. Sinh said, her voice wavering a bit but still firm. \u201cReally, I am happy to just hear any news at all about my son.\u201dBack in Hanoi, Ms. Hang runs Marin from a two-bedroom apartment in a leaky building on the city\u2019s outskirts. The apartment doubles as her home. Marin is financed by small, individual donations and operates on an annual budget of about $10,000. \u201cYou need to call the local military office in Ninh Thuan province and find out where and how he was killed,\u201d she told a caller who was looking for his uncle.After 15 years of helping families track down missing soldiers, Ms. Hang has become an expert on the minutiae of military records and arcane government paperwork. The families seeking her help usually have little more information than that on the official death notice \u2014 name, birth date, enlistment date, date and place of death (which is often recorded simply as \u201cThe Southern front\u201d). For many families, Ms. Hang is their only hope.Since the fighting between Americans and Vietnamese ended in 1975, the Vietnamese government has taken some steps to recover the bodies. Shortly after the war ended, official remains-gathering teams traveled to the central provinces, to the sites of some of the worst battles, to dig up hastily buried or abandoned soldiers. The task of identifying the remains was complicated by the brutal nature of the war; the artillery used by Americans and their Southern Vietnamese allies was so powerful it often obliterated everything in its path. Even when the search teams found a corpse or a set of bones, identification was difficult because North Vietnamese soldiers weren\u2019t issued dog tags as their American and South Vietnamese counterparts were.It wasn\u2019t until the early 2000s, when Vietnam\u2019s economic situation had improved after market reforms in the 1990s, that families began to search in earnest for their missing loved ones. In overwhelmingly self-financed efforts, they pooled resources and began to travel from the north to the central provinces to search for the bodies of relatives. Though the Vietnamese government has made overtures of support for gathering and identifying remains, its efforts continue to be mostly limited and often inept, according to volunteers and families with whom I spoke.\u201cIn theory,\u201d one Hanoian who had spent 10 years looking for the body of her uncle told me, \u201cmy family could make an application and request the army to go find the body of my uncle, but I knew it would take lots of time and not be much help.\u201dThe Vietnamese government has focused its search efforts mostly on mass graves and offers help only to families who already know the exact place where their loved one died. The thousands and thousands of other families who don\u2019t have this information are on their own.In 2014, the Vietnamese government announced that it would invest about $25 million in a huge DNA identification project \u2014 a joint venture with a German biotech firm named Bioglobe. But little has been done so far. \u201cThey say they\u2019re building something, but we never know,\u201d the woman who was still looking for her uncle said, adding that she assumes any funds actually set aside for identifying remains would just end up in the pockets of corrupt government officials.The United States spends about $100 million annually on efforts to find its own 1,597 service members who are listed as missing in Southeast Asia. Since 1991, the United States has maintained an office in Hanoi dedicated to finding its missing; today it operates as an outpost of the Defense P.O.W./M.I.A. Accounting Agency on Tran Phu, one of downtown Hanoi\u2019s most beautiful leafy streets.In the Vietnamese government, there is no similarly centralized office devoted to finding the missing Vietnamese soldiers. There is, though, a centralized government office devoted to finding missing American soldiers. The missing Vietnamese soldiers are hardly forgotten, though. The search for remains has become something of an obsession for the public. Remains-gathering stories are the subject of TV specials, postwar literature and local newspaper stories. \u201cIt\u2019s just normal to us,\u201d a Vietnamese friend remarked.One night, I started chatting with a taxi driver, Tuan, and found out that two of his uncles were killed in the war and listed as missing. The family had gone on multiple search trips, driving all day down to Quang Ngai province, to look for the bodies. They\u2019d managed to find one set of remains, but the other, his uncle Thanh, was still missing.A few days later I visited Tuan at home to get the rest of the story from his mother and father, veterans themselves. Tuan\u2019s mother, Minh, recounted the last search trip, when the family had come up short and been forced to drive back to Hanoi empty-handed.What will you do now? I asked.Minh stared at me for a second as if the answer was obvious.\u201cKeep looking,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, we\u2019re already planning a trip for next year.\u201dReporting for this article was made possible by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Joseph Babcock teaches writing at the University of California, San Diego, and is working on a book about contemporary Vietnam.Advertisement"}

They pick oranges in Florida, strawberries in California and vegetables in Ohio. And they have built new subdivisions in Phoenix, Atlanta and Charlotte.For years, policymakers have talked about shutting off the influx of undocumented workers. But the economy has grown to rely on them.Ending illegal immigration, say many of those who have studied the issue, could mean that American workers would lose their jobs, companies would close and the economy would contract.In recent years, though, border security has tightened considerably, a strong economy has driven down unemployment, and many employers, particularly those offering low-paid jobs, say there are few alternatives to hiring workers without legal documents.President Trump, it turns out, is caught on both sides of the balance between border security and economic prosperity.The president has vowed to erect a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants and has ramped up the deportation of those already in the United States. His administration has conducted payroll audits and workplace raids, which have resulted in the arrest of thousands of workers.The Trump Organization has vowed to terminate any undocumented workers it finds on its payroll, and the fate of any of its workers who do not have legal working papers remains unclear. What is clear, however, is that at a time of extremely low unemployment, 3.7 percent nationally, Mr. Trump\u2019s golf club might struggle to recruit legal workers to replace any undocumented workers who are terminated.\u201cOur economy has absorbed these workers and employers would like more of them, given the low unemployment rate,\u201d said Madeline Zavodny, an economist at the University of North Florida who is an expert on the economics of immigration.Undocumented immigrants are overrepresented in low-skilled jobs such as farming, construction and child care.Often, these are jobs their employers have trouble filling with American workers.Anabele Garcia, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, toils in the vineyards of Sonoma County in California, earning about $15 an hour. When the season ends each year, she finds work cleaning houses and wine estates, earning about $20 an hour. Her husband, Jorge Romero, works in the cow pastures nearby.\u201cWe are here to do any work,\u201d said Ms. Garcia, 39. \u201cThere are no Americans in the fields.\u201dWhat would happen if all the undocumented immigrants went away?Steve Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports curbs on immigration, believes that wages would rise and motivate many chronically unemployed Americans to get back to work.But wage rates are not the main issue, some economists say, because there still would not be enough Americans willing to do blue-collar jobs.Expectations and status play a role, said Chris Tilly, a labor economist at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cNot everybody will do dirty work,\u201d he said.They might prefer to make a low wage working inside an Amazon distribution center to putting shingles on a roof.A survey conducted in late 2017 by the Associated Contractors of America found that 70 percent of construction companies were having difficulty hiring roofers, bricklayers and electricians, among others. The accommodation and food services sector reported a record number of vacancies this October.Historically, the regulation of the border with Mexico, the main source of migration, \u201chas always been driven by the needs of the economy,\u201d Mr. Tilly said.That\u2019s less true now, under the Trump administration, which has sought to check illegal border crossings by all means possible.Giovanni Peri, an economist who studies immigration labor at the University of California, Davis, said that with a true cutoff in illegal immigration, the economy would contract. The impact, he said, would fall not just on immigrants \u2014 because their work sustains sectors that employ many Americans.\u201cSome sectors, like construction, agriculture, housing and personal services would be drastically reduced,\u201d Mr. Peri said. \u201cThere would be companies closing and relocating. There would be jobs lost. There will be towns and cities that would see half their population disappear.\u201d\u201cIt definitely would trigger a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about a lot of job loss.\u201dIt is very unlikely that weak, vulnerable American workers would benefit from jobs previously held by immigrants because some of these jobs themselves would disappear, he said.\u201cVery few of the jobs these immigrants have would be taken by these Americans,\u201d Mr. Peri said. \u201cThe ones who are not employed have complicated circumstances like drug addiction, alcohol addiction or criminal records.\u201dEspecially at a time of low unemployment, he added, \u201cThis would be the worst time to lose them. There are no unemployed Americans ready to do their jobs.\u201dIn some sectors, \u201cthere might be people who would do these jobs at much higher wages,\u201d said Ms. Zavodny, the economist in Florida. \u201cBut it is not clear those jobs would exist at much higher wages.\u201dIn the lettuce fields of California\u2019s Salinas Valley, a new machine plies row after row of romaine lettuce, doing the backbreaking work, long performed by people, of lobbing heads of romaine lettuce from the field. It saves time and human labor.Still, more than half of all field workers are undocumented, according to the Farm Bureau, which has said that their sudden disappearance would deal a catastrophic blow to American agriculture.Since the 1990s, undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America have flocked to towns like Dalton, Ga., to work in the carpet mills. Across the South and in fast-growing cities like Denver, hundreds of thousands have been absorbed by the construction industry as roofers, painters and bricklayers.In states like Georgia and North Carolina, their presence has grown rapidly to represent 5.4 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, of the labor force.In all but four states, service occupations, such as being a waiter, dishwasher or maid, together draw the largest number of undocumented immigrants, the Pew report found.About 31 percent of all undocumented immigrant workers were in service occupations in 2016, according to the estimates, which were based on data gathered by the Census Bureau.Unauthorized immigrants represent about 24 percent of all workers in farming, fishing and forestry and 15 percent of those employed in construction, which is the industry that uses the most undocumented immigrant workers overall, at 1.35 million.Nearly one quarter of restaurant workers in 2016 were foreign-born compared with 18.5 percent for all sectors, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compiled by the National Restaurant Association. A large share are likely undocumented, economists say.\u201cThese workers are often long-tenured and skilled,\u201d said Craig Regelbrugge, senior vice president of industry advocacy and research at AmericanHort, which represents the nursery industry. \u201cThey are nothing short of vital to farms, businesses, and rural economies.\u201d\u201cEach job they perform sustains two to three jobs in the surrounding economy, so even though few Americans seek this field and farm work, the jobs of many Americans and many communities are sustained by their contributions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The numbers further inflamed worries among investors that the trade war between the United States and China is beginning to slow global economic growth. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, had reported a slowdown in trade and economic growth in recent weeks. But the numbers on retail sales and industrial output suggested that the slowdown deepened in November.\u201cPeople are just worried,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist for the institutional brokerage firm JonesTrading in Greenwich, Conn. \u201cThe trade war is starting to hurt, and you haven\u2019t been rewarded for chasing the rallies and people are getting a little more defensive here.\u201dTech shares were big losers on Friday, with Apple and Microsoft dropping more than 3 percent and the sector falling 2.5 percent over all. Tech stocks have grown increasingly sensitive to headlines surrounding the trade war, a reflection of their reliance on a large network of subcontractors and factories in Asia, many in China.But the sell-off in health care stocks was even worse. The S&P 500 health care sector fell 3.4 percent, making it the worst performing part of the market. Health shares were dragged down by a more than 10 percent loss for Johnson & Johnson, after Reuters reported that the company had kept the presence of carcinogenic asbestos in its baby powder from regulators and consumers.Friday\u2019s decline in the S&P 500 erased its gains for the week. The benchmark index is now down 2.8 percent for the year.\u201cEverything is taking a toll here,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. \u201cWhen the market falls as far as it has, it\u2019s going to have knock-on effects, negative knock-on effects, for the economic outlook next year.\u201dUntil September, Wall Street had been faring better than markets around the world, as the United States economy continued to show signs of robust growth and job creation. But gains through late September \u2014 stocks were up 9.6 percent for the year on Sept. 20 \u2014 faded quickly as investors began to assess the potential for trade concerns, economic uncertainty and rising interest rates to erode corporate profit growth.Earlier this week, shares were buoyed by signs that Beijing and Washington were making progress toward a deal to end their trade war. Developments on that front continued Friday, with China pledging to suspend additional tariffs on imports of American-made cars for three months starting in the new year.Automakers\u2019 shares rose on the news. But as the week came to a close, investors turned increasingly defensive, opting to dump stocks.Earlier Friday, markets across Asia dropped. The SSE index in Shanghai ended trading down 1.5 percent, while stocks in Shenzhen were off 2.5 percent. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index fell 2 percent, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 1.6 percent.Mrs. May\u2019s continuing troubles also appeared to taking a toll on the pound, which slid through the day.Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He loved decorating trees, singing songs like \u201cSilent Night\u201d and watching the annual Christmas pageant recounting the birth of Jesus.On Christmas Eve, Mr. Gu, 31, a rice seller, went to the only safe place to worship that he knew: a friend\u2019s home, where he recited hymns and prayed for the two dozen Early Rain members that are in detention. Fearing that he and his friends might be arrested, Mr. Gu used encrypted chat apps to share information about surveillance and harassment by the police.\u201cWe will not forfeit our faith because of suppression by the authorities,\u201d Mr. Gu said.As millions around the world gathered to celebrate Christmas, China is capping a year in which the government of President Xi Jinping has led an unrelenting campaign against unofficial churches in China, which by some estimates serve as many as 30 million people.RUSSIAMONGOLIAXINJIANGBeijingCHINAChengduSICHUANGuangzhouINDIAMYANMAR500 MilesBy The New York TimesRenee Xia, international director for China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, described the effort as targeting the \u201cheart of the underground Christian resistance.\u201d The government has focused its campaign on unofficial Christian churches that promote ideas like social justice or have been critical of the party\u2019s grip on society.\u201cThe message,\u201d Ms. Xia said, \u201cis that Xi can\u2019t be messed with.\u201dThe crackdown escalated in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The police this month shut down the 40-year-old Rongguili Church in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshipers. And in September, the authorities in Beijing ordered the closing of the 1,500-member Zion Church, one of the largest unofficial churches in the capital.The government requires religious groups to register, though many still worship in unofficial churches, sometimes called underground or house churches.Many in the party believe Christianity, which by some estimates is China\u2019s fastest-growing religion, promotes Western values and ideals like human rights that conflict with the aims of China\u2019s authoritarian government and Mr. Xi\u2019s embrace of traditional Chinese culture and Confucian teachings that emphasize obedience and order.But the government\u2019s heavy-handed efforts to obliterate several high-profile churches have been met with resistance among Christians.On Christmas Eve, the authorities posted a sign at Early Rain\u2019s former headquarters saying its 23rd-floor sanctuary had been converted into office space for the local government.Li Shuangde, a teacher in Chengdu who has been part of Early Rain since 2011, said that church members had been asked by the authorities to sign letters stating that they no longer believe in Christianity. He said Early Rain had no choice but continue to exist in secret. \u201cWe have moved underground,\u201d he said.Members have continued to hold Sunday services, sometimes on the banks of a river near the church\u2019s former headquarters in a downtown high-rise. They have called for the release of detained leaders, including Wang Yi, the pastor of Early Rain, and his wife, Jiang Rong.\u201cThe Communist regime\u2019s persecution of the church is an extremely vicious crime,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a pastor of the Christian church, I must strictly and publicly condemn such crimes.\u201dMr. Wang had been scheduled to deliver a Christmas Eve sermon at Early Rain titled \u201cThe God Who Bestows Peace.\u201d Instead, hundreds of Early Rain members on Monday scattered across Chengdu for services inside the homes of friends and relatives or at welcoming churches.At Chengdu Xishuipang Reformed Church, a Protestant church with close ties to Early Rain, more than 100 people gathered inside a worship hall on the 16th floor of an apartment building.A children\u2019s choir sang \u201cSilent Night,\u201d and a small Christmas tree, decorated with snowflakes, was on display near the lectern.The anxieties brought on by the recent arrests hung over the ceremony.\u201cIf you see the police, national security or community workers, greet them with gentleness,\u201d Wen Hongbin, an elder at Xishuipang, told the congregation. \u201cIf they try to grab the microphone, I ask the brothers sitting in the front row to please stop them.\u201dWhile he did not explicitly mention Early Rain, Mr. Wen asked those in attendance to remember \u201cthose who are criminally detained.\u201d Then he began a sermon about the meaning of Christmas and the sacrifice made by Jesus.Officials in the United States have denounced the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to limit the spread of Christianity.\u201cChina\u2019s Christians and other faith communities are under siege and treated as enemies of the state for daring to worship and peacefully live out their faith,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey said in a joint statement condemning the recent detentions.But China\u2019s growing influence in world affairs has shielded it from some criticism.Despite Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts to expand the officially atheist party\u2019s control of worship, religious life in China is flourishing.While official figures are imprecise, experts believe there are about 60 million Christians in China, with roughly half worshiping at state-sanctioned churches and half at unofficial churches.Independent churches like Early Rain, with more than 500 members, have attracted large followings in recent years, especially among white-collar workers seeking an escape from rampant materialism at the center of modern Chinese life.While sermons at state-sanctioned churches are often tightly scripted, independent churches boom with searing indictments of corrupt officials and rousing calls to protect the rights of the poor.Early Rain, which Mr. Wang founded in 2008, was among the most daring. Mr. Wang called Mr. Xi a sinner, held prayer sessions each year to mark the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations around Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, and organized a fund to support relatives of political prisoners in China.Mr. Gu, the rice seller, began attending services two years ago after finding videos of Mr. Wang\u2019s fiery sermons online. He felt Mr. Wang\u2019s concern for the poor was in line with his own view that the government was abusing workers and violating human rights by destroying their homes to make way for expensive developments. Mr. Gu was baptized last year.\u201cI saw injustices in society,\u201d Mr. Gu said. \u201cI saw that the government\u2019s promotion of China as a just country that enforces laws in a civilized manner was all a lie.\u201dWorried for his own safety, Mr. Gu recently closed his business, hoping to avoid government scrutiny. He said he has grown fearful as he has watched the police arrest his friends.Mr. Gu has turned to the Bible in recent days for support. Sometimes, he recites a verse from the Book of Proverbs: \u201cThe path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apollo Theater to Build New Performance Spaces", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe resulting Apollo Performing Arts Center, announced on Tuesday, will be used to incubate works by up-and-coming artists, particularly performers of color, who might not be ready for the main theater\u2019s 1,500-seat auditorium, Apollo executives said.\u201cIt continues to solidify the Apollo Theater as a vital civic and economic cornerstone of Harlem,\u201d Jonelle Procope, the president and chief executive officer of the Apollo Theater Foundation, said in an interview. She added that she saw the new venue as Harlem\u2019s equivalent to Lincoln Center or the Brooklyn Academy of Music.In the late \u201990s, the team behind the Apollo was given the chance to develop the Victoria, a former movie theater built in 1917. But after the Sept. 11 attacks and the economy\u2019s souring, the board chose to focus only on the main auditorium.It\u2019s unclear how much the new venues will cost the Apollo. Ms. Procope declined to give exact numbers, but said that much of the capital had come through fund-raising.\u201cWe raised the money we needed to get into the space,\u201d Ms. Procope said, adding that she expects the yearly operating budget to increase to $20 million in the next five years.The new black box theaters are scheduled to open in the fall of 2020; programming at the main Apollo stage will not be affected by the construction.Kamilah Forbes, the executive producer of the Apollo, said the new space will allow the Apollo to commission and develop the art, rather than just showcase it.There will be an emphasis on workshops as well as on producing more diverse pieces than the main stage, such as conceptual performance art. In addition, the new theaters will allow for more partnerships with smaller cultural organizations in the area that otherwise wouldn\u2019t see their works associated with the Apollo name.\u201cGiving artists a space, time and resources to create, to take their work several steps further, this is something we simply cannot facilitate by having only a large 1,500-seat theater,\u201d Ms. Forbes said. \u201cThese smaller spaces are really going to allow us to support artists at the early stages of development.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Floods and More Droughts: Climate Change Delivers Both", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore records for both wet and dry weather are being set around the globe, often with disastrous consequences for the people facing such extremes, according to a study published Wednesday that offered new evidence of climate change\u2019s impacts in the here and now.Extreme rainfall, and the extreme lack of it, affects untold numbers of people, taxing economies, disrupting food production, creating unrest and prompting migrations. So, factors that push regions of the world to exceptional levels of flooding and drought can shape the fate of nations.\u201cClimate change will likely continue to alter the occurrence of record-breaking wet and dry months in the future,\u201d the study predicts, \u201cwith severe consequences for agricultural production and food security.\u201dJascha Lehmann, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and the lead author of the study, compared extreme weather events to a high roll of a die. \u201cOn average, one out of six times you get a six,\u201d he said. \u201cBut by injecting huge amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, humankind has loaded the dice. In many regions, we throw sixes much more often with severe impacts for society and the environment.\u201dWhile much climate research relies on complex models to make projections, this new work interprets already-observed monthly rainfall data from 50,000 weather stations around the world. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say models are not good,\u201d Dr. Lehmann said in an interview, but his observational data \u201cfits what we expect from physics and what models also show.\u201dClimate models have long predicted that because of the greenhouse gases human activity has pumped into the atmosphere and the warming that results, the world\u2019s wet regions are likely to grow wetter. Warmer air causes greater evaporation from oceans and waterways, and warmer air can hold more moisture.Regions that tend to be dry, by contrast, are expected to grow even more parched as higher temperatures dry the soil and air. \u201cClimate change drives both wet and dry extremes,\u201d Dr. Lehmann said.To conduct the study, which appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, Dr. Lehmann\u2019s team searched the databases of an authoritative repository of rainfall measurement, the Global Precipitation Climatology Center in Germany. Given natural weather variability, some extreme weather events were to be expected, so the researchers tried to determine how many events would have occurred without the influence of global warming.The researchers determined that one-third of the record-dry months recorded in the African regions under study would not have occurred without the influence of climate change.The report said that climate change made last year\u2019s drought in the northern Great Plains of the United States and a pounding six-day monsoon in northeast Bangladesh far more likely. Out of 146 research findings in the series of papers, only about 30 percent did not find a substantial link between an extreme event and climate change.Stephanie C. Herring, a climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and an author of the report, said that, over the years, the attribution work has helped to establish the present-day effects of climate change.\u201cWe\u2019re taking out that factor of \u2018climate change might impact us someday,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cClimate change is impacting us now.\u201dThe message of the studies is \u201cpainfully clear,\u201d said Heidi Cullen, a climate scientist with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. \u201cBurning fossil fuels is making our weather worse right now,\u201d with greater likelihood of deadly heat waves, wildfires, droughts and floods, she said. \u201cAnd the more we burn coal, oil and gas, the worse it will get.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the findings of a report by Munich Re, a reinsurance company, on damages caused by tropical storms in 2018. The company reported that tropical cyclones had caused $51 billion in losses worldwide, not that the hurricane season caused $51 billion in losses in the United States. Additionally, the long-term annual average of $34 billion in losses, as calculated by the company, is for tropical cyclones worldwide, not hurricanes in the United States.Advertisement"}

I realize this is not great. Partly, I blame procrastination. I also don\u2019t like crowds.But I also hate the way searching for the perfectly priced present reminds me that for many Americans, especially African-American shoppers, prices are never going to be perfect.I saw this for myself when I walked into a holiday sale at Rent-A-Center in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Oversize flat-screen TVs lined the walls and overstuffed couches filled the floors. The large \u201cNo Credit Needed\u201d sign on the window made me feel as if I might actually be able to afford something.While walking me through the season specials, a sales representative pointed out an advertisement selling Beats by Dre headphones for $20 a week. It sounded reasonable enough until I read the fine print that explained after a 61-week payment plan the headphones would cost $1,219.39.You can buy the headphones outright for $349.95 or less. So that\u2019s not just an exorbitant markup. In some states it could be illegal.I have not been tempted to finance an Xbox this way, even though I grew up in black neighborhoods south and east of Atlanta \u2014 areas with no shortage of rent-to-own stores. I was lucky, though, to hear this simple advice from my dad from an early age: Spend cash, not credit.This is what he taught on our Saturday-morning shopping trips. Whether we were on the way to buy a new refrigerator or look at a used car, the lesson was the same: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough to buy it cash, don\u2019t buy it,\u201d he\u2019d tell us.Mom\u2019s lessons were equally sober. She had a few credit cards but hated them all. Whenever she finally paid one off, she\u2019d call us into her room. There, she asked us to help her demolish the card. We twisted it. We bent it. We folded it until the blue and red plastic turned white along the creases. Then, finally, we\u2019d snip it to pieces. It was a ceremony of sorts. The itinerary concluded in a lecture about the evils of interest and how we were now free from the shackles of another company. By the time I reached the age of 18, my approach to finance was \u201cJust say no.\u201d\u201cNo, I do not want to sign up for a store credit card.\u201d\u201cNo, I do not want to finance a computer over several payments.\u201dNo. No. No.I had internalized the distrust my parents taught me, but it wasn\u2019t until I went to college that I began to better understand where they were coming from.It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Black neighborhoods can support legitimate stores.In the void, many urban black neighborhoods are left with few alternatives. Online shopping is a good option for some people. But a lack of reliable internet access and the necessity of having a credit or debit card prevent many low-income people from participating in this digital economy. Not everyone lives in a neighborhood where packages and presents can sit safely on a stoop while they are at work.My dad\u2019s advice was simple \u2014 spend cash, not credit. But that advice is not easy to follow when the gift-giving season is here and every store in your neighborhood is promising a way to be Santa for just $20 a week.Advertisement"}

But if You Step Back, It\u2019s Still Riding High.", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementThe S&P 500-stock index has entered what the financial world calls a correction, technically defined by a decline of at least 10 percent from the market\u2019s peak. It\u2019s a relatively arbitrary threshold, but it\u2019s often seen as a symbol of souring investor sentiment.Lately, the markets have been rattled by the prospect that a protracted trade war with China could begin to take an economic toll at a time when global growth is slowing.Viewed over a longer period, however, corrections often begin to look less severe.Even after the current sell-off, for instance, the S&P 500 through Friday\u2019s close was up by nearly 15 percent since President Trump\u2019s inauguration and more than 21 percent since Election Day 2016.Over the long run, the markets have risen since the economy came out of recession a decade ago. During that time, there have been a half-dozen corrections, and the declines didn\u2019t presage more significant downturns in the market or the economy.In the last 20 years, there have been 10 corrections. Only two turned into a bear market, defined as a decline of 20 percent from its high, amid the recessions that began in 2001 and at the end of 2007.Of course, corrections can be early indicators of a severe downturn in the stock market. And given concerns about the age of the current bull run, some are wondering if the recent selling indicates that an end to the nearly decade-long rally is near.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Thwarts U.S. Effort to Promote American Culture on Campuses", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The American ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, wanted to make what in most nations would have been a routine trip.One of his favorite schools, Iowa State University, had opened a center to promote American culture in an inland Chinese province, and the laid-back former governor of Iowa was eager to take questions from Chinese students.But Henan Normal University, a campus set on the Yellow River with a prominent statue of Mao Zedong out front, denied Mr. Branstad permission to visit the center this fall \u2014 and offered no explanation.The rebuff underscored how the United States and China compete not only in trade and technology, but also over the values and beliefs that define their societies, an echo of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.In China, such programs provided a window into American culture outside the filter of the Communist Party, and their unwinding could deepen the divide between the societies of the world\u2019s two largest economies.The center that turned down Branstad was one of more than 20 that the State Department opened in the past decade on college campuses across China to promote American culture and counter anti-American propaganda by offering English lessons, screening movies and hosting visiting music and dance performances.Today, the American centers have closed after the Chinese authorities denied American officials entry to them and state security agents interrogated an American academic working on a Chinese campus.\u201cIt became clear after a while that the centers were no longer an asset to the Americans and became a terrible liability,\u201d said Jennifer Tarlin of the University of North Dakota, who served as director of an American center at a Shanghai university from 2011 until this summer.The program\u2019s start coincided with a rise in nationalist sentiment in China. Shortly after he came into power six years ago, President Xi Jinping rolled out a campaign against Western values, investing Communist Party members in academia with the power to redline even the most innocuous and apolitical expressions of American culture.And funding American culture in China became particularly unpopular in Washington as the Trump administration worked to distance the countries and anger built over Beijing\u2019s propaganda in America.China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.When the American centers opened a decade ago, they bucked a trend. Promoting American culture abroad, once a high point of American foreign policy, was considered obsolete, an idea that was dispensed with at the end of the Cold War.But China was a special case. The American government was concerned about negative depictions of the United States in China\u2019s tightly controlled state media.In 2011, only five roughly equivalent American places existed in China \u2014 at American embassies or consulates, sites that are closely watched by Chinese security and forbidding for local residents to enter.The Obama administration felt compelled to act.By 2012, the State Department had made individual grants of $100,000 to more than two dozen American universities to open centers on Chinese campuses. To distance itself, it urged the centers to seek extra funds from private American sources and stayed away from decisions about programming.William Brustein, then-vice provost for international affairs at Ohio State University, recalled meeting the American ambassador, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., in Beijing in 2011.The ambassador told Mr. Brustein about the State Department\u2019s new venture.\u201c\u2018They\u2019re like the Confucius Institutes \u2014 this is America\u2019s answer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brustein recounted the ambassador saying. \u201c\u2018You should open a center \u2014 try to pick a place that is not Beijing or Shanghai.\u2019\u201dOhio State prided itself on its already large number of fee-paying Chinese students, and the university thought the center would attract more. Many students came from Hubei Province, so it was easy for Mr. Brustein to persuade Wuhan University, a major university there, to agree to host a place that would showcase American themes.The center opened in 2012 in a loft-like space with a kitchen and English-language cookbooks, and was led by an English teacher at Ohio State, Bob Eckhart, who brought jazz groups and dance ensembles over for performances.The most successful gig was a group of African-American step dancers, Mr. Eckhart said. \u201cWe stressed that we were presenting authentic American culture and that we were not just cheerleaders for America.\u201dOther centers opened at campuses across China.Often the programming was quirky. At the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Ms. Tarlin invited American musicians who played Depression-era folk. She staged a workshop production of the opera \u201cScarlet Letter\u201d with a libretto by the feminist writer Carol Gilligan.Strict edicts announced by the education minister, Yuan Guiren, in early 2015 signaled the official disfavor. Books highlighting Western values had no place in the classroom; Chinese universities must ensure that Mr. Xi\u2019s ideology was front and center, Mr. Yuan said.Suddenly, university officials barred American cultural groups and speakers. The Chinese homed in on the ties with the State Department, suspicious that the United States was using the centers as a cover for spreading democratic ideas, former and current diplomats said.In Nanjing, Chinese state security officials summoned a dean of the New York Institute of Technology, Monique Taylor, for questioning for several hours in 2015.Ms. Taylor was responsible for the American center sponsored by the institute at the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; she was also in charge of a separate academic program with faculty from New York City on the Nanjing campus.The interrogation rattled the American university, according to three people familiar with the episode. A spokeswoman for the university declined to comment.After the episode, the university declined a new State Department grant and deleted the word American from the center\u2019s name. It was renamed Campus Commons.In the 2000s, as the Confucius Institutes flourished in the United States, those who wanted to promote American soft power eventually prevailed with the opening of the centers in China. But American diplomats responsible for culture could never get the centers to take off: In Washington, the economic relationship was considered far more important, former diplomats said.As secretary of state, John Kerry took up the cause of the centers with Liu Yandong, who was a vice premier until this year and China\u2019s top culture czar.The Chinese dismissed Mr. Kerry\u2019s complaints, said Richard Stengel, who was under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs at the time.\u201cIn my experience, the Chinese project, rationalize and then minimize,\u201d Mr. Stengel said, explaining that senior Chinese officials denied any problems. \u201cThey first say, \u2018You do it, too.\u2019 Then they say: \u2018It\u2019s not my responsibility, it happens on the local level.\u2019 And finally: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter much anyway.\u2019\u201dIn all, the State Department spent $5.1 million on 29 centers, though about 10 of them never opened. The inspector general\u2019s report concluded that the effort had been \u201clargely ineffective.\u201dThe State Department said it had stopped funding all of the centers.Mr. Branstad was not the first American envoy to run into trouble over one of them.Mr. Kerry complained to the Chinese ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, that the American ambassador at the time, Max Baucus, had also been prevented from traveling to one.According to Mr. Stengel, who was in the conversation, Mr. Kerry turned to Mr. Cui and asked: \u201cHave we ever limited where you can go?\u201dMr. Cui replied: \u201cNot yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In all, companies raised $209 billion globally through I.P.O.s, up 6 percent from a year ago, according to Dealogic.The biggest I.P.O.s of the year happened on exchanges in Asia. SoftBank raised $21.3 billion floating shares of its mobile unit in Tokyo.

Investors piled into the biggest tech companies, pushing the market values of Amazon and Apple above $1 trillion. But soon investors were dumping tech shares, sending the Nasdaq into a bear market for the first time since the financial crisis. Companies handed back more than a $1 trillion to investors through buybacks and dividends. But markets were also whipsawed by fears of slowing global economic growth, rising interest rates and trade wars.Despite it all, Wall Street analysts predict that the S&P 500 will rise next year.But there are still reasons to be pessimistic. Here\u2019s what could spook investors next year:A lot went right for banks in 2018. They were big beneficiaries of the tax overhaul enacted at the end of 2017. The Trump administration started what may become a bonanza of deregulation for them. The economy grew. Interest rates increased, bolstering profit from lending. Over all, banks\u2019 earnings are expected to surge 34 percent in 2018. In June, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, talked about \u201ca golden age of banking.\u201d\u2022 If the Fed raises interest rates by more than expected and the economy slows, banks could be hit hard. Wall Street business would suffer, demand for loans would decline and more borrowers could default, causing losses for banks.\u2022 If the Fed manages to set rates at a level that keeps the economy growing at close to current rates, and inflation is dormant, bank earnings should hold up. But as 2018 has shown, that may not be enough for investors.The short answer: probably.

{"Headline": "U.S. Oil Exports Are Rising. So Is the Trade Deficit.", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States exported more oil and fuel than it imported last week for the first time in 75 years, a significant milestone in the resurgence of domestic energy production that comes as the Trump administration pushes to increase energy exports even further.To President Trump, increased sales of oil and gas are a way to rebalance trade and close the gap between what the United States buys from foreign countries and what it sells. So far, however, that strategy is not working.In theory, the rise of domestic energy production was supposed to help narrow the trade gap. Edward L. Morse, a prominent energy economist at Citigroup, predicted in 2012 that the annual trade deficit would be reduced by 60 percent by 2020. \u201cThe energy sector in the next few decades could drive an extraordinary and timely revitalization and reindustrialization of the U.S. economy, creating jobs and bringing prosperity to millions of Americans,\u201d he wrote.Instead, the size of the trade deficit has continued to grow.The basic explanation is that the United States\u2019 appetite for foreign investment, including the financing of the federal debt, is driving the country\u2019s consumption of imports. The dollars that the United States borrows from foreign countries are the dollars that the United States spends on foreign products.Under Mr. Trump, the combination of tax cuts and spending increases is causing a rapid expansion in the government\u2019s borrowing. \u201cIt is pretty much a recipe for increased trade deficits,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who previously served as the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The rise in the dollar\u2019s value reduces the relative cost of foreign goods and services while increasing the relative cost of domestic goods and services. The effect is to discourage foreign customers from buying American products, while encouraging American customers to buy foreign products.Since spending on foreign oil is falling, it follows that other industries are bearing the brunt.A wide range of companies outside the oil sector have warned that the dollar\u2019s recent strength is likely to reduce profits, including the appliance maker Whirlpool, Carnival Cruise Line and Coca-Cola.Investment growth under Mr. Trump has leaned much more heavily on oil and gas than it did under his two immediate predecessors. Under President George W. Bush, investment in resource extraction accounted for about 8 percent of total investment growth in the United States economy. Under President Barack Obama, the figure was about 10 percent. Under Mr. Trump, it is running at about 30 percent.And the administration is seeking to intensify the trend. Larry Kudlow, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said in a recent interview that the administration is drawing up a new proposal for infrastructure development that revolves around expanded construction of oil and gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas export terminals and other energy projects.\u201cI want a lot of the infrastructure build out to be based on the energy industry,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cOil and gas pipelines. Coal transportation. L.N.G. terminals. Things that the private sector will finance, but will add to our energy dominance.\u201d He cast the effort in both economic and national security terms, predicting that it would be a \u201cgigantic\u201d job creator and that it would allow the United States to \u201cundercut the Russians\u201d in selling natural gas to European allies such as Germany.Mr. Trump, said Mr. Kudlow, was enamored of the plan: \u201cThe president loves this stuff.\u201dThe emphasis on oil- and gas-related investment partly reflect the weakness of investment in other parts of the economy. During Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure, year-over-year capital investment growth has averaged 5.9 percent per quarter. Excluding mining investment, that growth falls to 4.6 percent.As part of the administration\u2019s efforts to expand energy exports and find new markets for its products, the Treasury Department has started reaching nonbinding agreements with Latin American countries, including Chile, Argentine, Panama and Jamaica, to offer technical assistance on energy infrastructure projects.The initiative \u2014 known as \u201cAmerica Crece,\u201d a Spanish phrase meaning \u201cThe Americas Grow\u201d\u2014 is aimed at increasing demand for American energy exports, and to create opportunities for American firms to work on infrastructure projects, said David Malpass, Treasury\u2019s under secretary for international affairs.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter: @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is Qatar Leaving OPEC?", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision to leave the oil cartel is aimed at reinforcing the country\u2019s autonomy from its Persian Gulf neighbors.Mr. Ulrichsen is the author of \u201cThe Gulf States in International Political Economy.\u201dThe surprising declaration by Qatar about leaving OPEC on Jan. 1 is a strategic response by the country to a changing energy landscape and the 18-month old ongoing boycott of Qatar by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. Qatar\u2019s decision to move away from a regionwide consensus among the Gulf\u2019s OPEC members is a reminder of the regional tensions arising from the assertiveness of Saudi Arabia, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. By becoming the first of the energy-rich Gulf States to withdraw from OPEC, Qatar has signaled its disapproval with an organization perceived to be subject to increasing Saudi interference.Qatar made a strategic decision to direct national resources toward gas rather than oil as the backbone of its energy policy. While the country discovered oil in 1939, a year after Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and joined OPEC in 1961, it never became a major player in global oil markets because its oil exports remained small by Persian Gulf standards.In the 1970s, Qatar discovered vast quantities of natural gas in the offshore North Field, which straddles the maritime border between Qatar and Iran, with the largest part of the field in Qatari waters. The North Field remains the largest non-associated gas field ever found, with more than 130 years of reserves at current production rates of 77 million tons a year.Since the early 1990s, Qatar has invested heavily in creating the infrastructure to export gas both through pipelines and as liquefied natural gas. By 2007, Qatar was the largest exporter of LNG in the world, with production plateauing in 2010 at 77 million tons a year. In contrast, its average oil production of 607,000 barrels per day in 2017 is less than 2 percent of OPEC\u2019s total output.During his term at Qatar Petroleum, Mr. Kaabi had lifted the moratorium on increasing gas production in the North Field. In his new ministerial position, Mr. Kaabi has been entrusted by Emir Tamim to oversee the next phase in Qatar\u2019s gas development. Plans include a range of new upstream developments and international partnerships intended to cement the country\u2019s position as the world\u2019s leading supplier of LNG.Having displayed their resilience in the face of the Saudi-led blockade, Qataris seem to signal their determination to move on from OPEC and carve their own approach to global gas markets.Those deals, along with Qatar honoring its natural gas commitment to the Emirates despite the rift, have reinforced the post-blockade effort to portray Qatar as a reliable energy partner and a responsible member of the international community.Thus, Qatar\u2019s decision to withdraw from OPEC is consistent with the strategic evolution of its energy interests that plays to their strength as a gas superpower and fits into existing plans to upscale significantly LNG infrastructure and production capacity.It makes strategic sense to focus on a sector in which Qatar holds more than 30 percent of the global market share than on its far smaller and declining oil output. By also reinforcing Qatar\u2019s autonomy from its Persian Gulf neighbors, the move exemplifies the failure of the 2017 blockade to force Qatar to clip its wings and return to a Saudi-led regional fold.With neither Saudi Arabia nor the Emirates willing to back down or concede defeat, the Gulf rift is reshaping regional and institutional partnerships and increasing the degrees of separation among the parties to the dispute.Kristian Coates Ulrichsen is a fellow for the Middle East at the Baker Institute for Public Policy, Rice University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hate Amazon? Try Living Without It", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy dad was a longtime labor activist. He despises what Jeff Bezos built, but he can\u2019t quit it. Ms. Willis Aronowitz is a writer and critic.Sharing an Amazon Prime account with loved ones is surprisingly intimate. You\u2019re privy to one another\u2019s impulse buys, fondness for corny \u201990s comedies and preferred brands of vaginal suppositories. Like many families, mine shares a login for the ubiquitous delivery behemoth. Every time my dad or my sister orders an item, I see a cheerful red badge pop up on my app: \u201cYour Amazon.com shipment is on its way!\u201dLately, those red badges have started coming several times a week. In 2018 alone, my family has spent nearly $7,000 on Amazon.My dad, a former professor with an impressive library, used to buy only books on the site. Now nearly everything he needs comes from Amazon: physical therapy balls, elevated toilet seats, a better wheelchair than Medicare can cover, cheap tubs of protein powder, even staples like kitty litter and T-shirts.My sister Kim faces this irony, too. Last year, just before her 60th birthday, she found out she had breast cancer. The chemo wreaked havoc on her immune system, and she took a seven-month leave from work. Afraid of making her health worse during a historic flu season, she barely left the house and started ordering the most prosaic products on Amazon Prime in bulk: tissues, a fleece jacket, a lemon squeezer, dinner forks, deodorant. As her cancer treatment ramped up, the red badges signaled other items: wig caps, pill organizer, the Book of Common Prayer, a St. Peregrine patron saint of cancer medal. When her chemo resulted in a raging case of hemorrhoids, she was grateful not to have to ask our brother, who was caring for her, to fetch her sitz bath salts and witch hazel pads. After her reduced disability pay began to catch up with her, she used Amazon for the discounts. She once ordered 27 rolls of toilet paper for just $16.97.My sister spends her days as a social worker in hospice, giving her a front-row seat to the travesty of end-of-life care in the United States. A bleeding-heart liberal, she\u2019d been known for fierce Facebook posts on things like President Trump and gay marriage. When she was going through treatment, her heart was bled dry. \u201cWhen I was in survival mode, I couldn\u2019t think of anything else but feeling better,\u201d Kim told me. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t thinking globally.\u201dIf I wanted to quit the service forever because it offends my values, I could probably do that without upending my life. But even for someone like me, who isn\u2019t sick or disabled or poor or living in a rural area, Amazon Prime helps alleviate the pressures of a sped-up economy. I don\u2019t use it just because I\u2019m lazy and love to stream \u201cTransparent.\u201d I use it (and other timesaving apps like Seamless and Uber) because I\u2019m overworked and one-click ordering spares me time. Yet, as Kim observed, it\u2019s hard to care about the big picture when you\u2019re simply putting one foot in front of the other. Because of seemingly remote forces \u2014 an inaccessible elder care system, insufficient health coverage, stagnant wages, long work hours \u2014 those of us who see corporate monopolies as detrimental to this country nevertheless rely on them for anything from dish soap to our paychecks.The Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne famously warned that the government will break your legs, then hand you crutches. Mr. Browne, an ardent fan of the free market, could have been describing the economy of cheap convenience. Amazon is the clearest example of a corporation exploiting the precariousness created by capitalism \u2014 precisely by soothing some of its pain.Nona Willis Aronowitz is a writer and editor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Punishing Blockade? \u2018We\u2019ve Moved On,\u2019 Qatar Says", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDOHA, Qatar \u2014 For signs of how Qatar has adapted to the blockade imposed by its neighbors, you need to go no further than the Al Meera grocery in a strip mall across from a mosque, in a residential part of the capital. Shelves where local products were once rare now hold Qatari milk, Qatari tissues and Qatari cucumbers.\u201cThis is Qatari. This is Qatari. This is all Qatari,\u201d a supervisor said, pointing out Qatari-made laundry detergent, dish soap and disinfectant.Producing such products at home may be business as usual for many countries, but for Qatar it was one of many defensive shifts made to survive a political and economic assault by its neighbors.Qatar has beefed up its military, pursued deeper ties with neighbors like Iran, and doubled down on the maverick behavior that rankled its Arab neighbors in the first place, like breathlessly covering their scandals on its Al Jazeera satellite network.Many countries would have collapsed under the type of restrictions imposed on Qatar by its larger and more powerful neighbors, who accused it of financing terrorism, interfering in their domestic affairs and growing too close to Iran. They were especially incensed by Qatar\u2019s support for a range of activists across the Arab world, including the political Islamists that other Gulf monarchs consider a threat to their rule.Qatar\u2019s leaders deny the allegations of interference and financing terrorism, and say what really angered their neighbors was the country\u2019s independence, its refusal to march in lock step with the Saudi and Emirati leaders who have long called the shots in the region.The country\u2019s vast wealth cushioned the blow of the blockade. Qatar dipped deeply into its $340 billion reserve funds to establish new trading partners, build up domestic industries and, in some cases, create new ones from scratch.\u201cIt seems that the Qataris, the people as well as the government, have closed the door a bit on trying to get back into the G.C.C. at all costs,\u201d said Andreas Krieg, an assistant professor of security studies at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThey want to get this resolved, but the threshold for finding a solution to the crisis is very low.\u201dQatar would like progress on certain issues, like being able to use its neighbors\u2019 airspace and some easing of travel restrictions for families separated by the crisis, he said.\u201cNothing else is itching or hurting them anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pain they thought they would feel they don\u2019t feel.\u201dIn a meeting with New York Times editors last month, Foreign Minister Thani said Qatar was no longer spending its reserves to adjust to the new reality.\u201cWe are over the blockade,\u201d he said, adding that, perversely, it had helped Qatar by pushing it to open new markets.Economists, however, say the blockade has sapped Qatar\u2019s economy as the government has marshaled its reserves to airlift in supplies and stabilize banks. Tourism income and real estate prices have fallen, they say, and consumer prices have gone up, cutting into the budgets of the foreign workers who make up 88 percent of the country\u2019s 2.4 million people.The Doha Forum pointed to Qatar\u2019s new direction. The government flew in hundreds of businessmen, researchers, journalists and officials from Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America for the event. Len\u00edn Moreno, the president of Ecuador, gave opening remarks, and Hassan Ali Khaire, the prime minister of Somalia, spoke on a panel. While previous editions of the conference featured speakers from Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, this time Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran was given his own session.Foreign Minister Thani said that the Khashoggi killing lifted the veil on Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cimpulsive\u201d leadership.\u201cThe world is starting to see what Qatar has seen for the last 18 months,\u201d he said.Qatar\u2019s foes have taken aim at Al Jazeera, demanding that Qatar take it off the air for its often critical coverage of Arab leaders and its sympathetic treatment of dissidents and political Islamists. But that demand has been a nonstarter, too.\u201cAl Jazeera continues its business as normal,\u201d Abdulla al-Najjar, an executive at the channel, said in an interview.The channel had been outlawed and blocked on digital platforms in the blockading countries, he said. But it is still widely watched across the Arab world, even in countries where it is banned, by viewers with VPNs.\u201cWe speak truth to power,\u201d Mr. Najjar said. \u201cThis is why most of the Middle Eastern governments don\u2019t like us.\u201dQatar\u2019s biggest concern with the rift is security, which has led to increased investment in the military. Qatar recently extended mandatory military service to one year from three or four months for Qatari men and began allowing voluntary service for Qatari women. It has been buying top-of-the-line fighter jets from the United States, and is expanding Al Udeid, the largest American military base in the Middle East, which Qatar hosts.For many Qataris, the biggest blows have been social and psychological, as they have come to terms with their closest neighbors branding them as enemies and waging a propaganda campaign against them.\u201cThe biggest damage was to the social ties,\u201d said Hizam al-Qahtani, a Qatari law student sitting down to a steak in the glitzy district of Pearl Qatar with three friends. All four had relatives on the other side of the blockade, they said. Some of the relatives had cut off all but basic communication, fearful of being accused of disloyalty by their governments.

{"Headline": "George Bush, Who Steered Nation in Tumultuous Times, Is Dead at 94", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeorge Bush, the 41st president of the United States and the father of the 43rd, who steered the nation through a tumultuous period in world affairs but was denied a second term after support for his presidency collapsed under the weight of an economic downturn and his seeming inattention to domestic affairs, died on Friday night at his home in Houston. He was 94.But he proved resilient each time. In 2013 he told well-wishers, through an aide, to \u201cput the harps back in the closet.\u201dMr. Bush was a skilled bureaucratic and diplomatic player who, as president, helped end four decades of Cold War and the threat of nuclear engagement with a nuanced handling of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the liberation of Eastern Europe.The elder Mr. Bush entered the White House with one of the most impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of any president. He had been a two-term congressman from Texas, ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, United States envoy to China, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and vice president, under Ronald Reagan.And he achieved what no one had since Martin Van Buren in 1836: winning election to the presidency while serving as vice president. (Van Buren did so in the footsteps of Andrew Jackson.)A son of wealth and a graduate of Phillips Academy in Massachusetts and Yale, Mr. Bush was schooled in the good manners and graciousness of New England privilege and civic responsibility. He liked to frame his public service as an answer to the call to duty, like the one that had sent him over the Pacific and into enemy fire as a 20-year-old. (\u201cThe cockpit was full of smoke and I was choking from it,\u201d he told his parents in a letter from the submarine that had plucked him from the sea.)22 Photos\u201cThat is my mission,\u201d he concluded, \u201cand I will complete it.\u201dAs the elder Mr. Bush watched troubles envelop the eight-year presidency of his son, however, what had been a source of pride became a cause of distress, friends said. The contrast between the two President Bushes \u2014 41 and 43, as they came to call each other \u2014 served to burnish the father\u2019s reputation in later years. As the younger Mr. Bush\u2019s popularity fell, the elder Mr. Bush\u2019s public standing rose. Many Americans came to appreciate the restrained, seasoned leadership the 41st president had displayed; in an opinion poll in 2012, 59 percent expressed approval. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, praised the father as a way of rebuking the son.He was particularly critical of Mr. Rumsfeld. \u201cI don\u2019t like what he did, and I think it hurt the president, having his iron-ass view of everything,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cRumsfeld was an arrogant fellow and self-assured, swagger.\u201dMr. Bush and his sons did not attend the Republican National Convention that nominated Donald J. Trump as its presidential candidate in 2016, and he pointedly did not endorse Mr. Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton.During the primary, Mr. Trump had repeatedly belittled Jeb Bush as \u201clow energy.\u201d Mr. Bush, who had entered the contest as the son of a president with an inside track for the nomination, was forced to withdraw by February.Until these undertakings, Mr. Bush had made little effort to mask his disdain for Mr. Clinton, but they forged an unlikely, almost familial, bond, growing so close that Mrs. Bush described her husband as the father Mr. Clinton never had.The two former presidents became a symbol of bipartisanship in an increasingly partisan age. If Mr. Bush\u2019s embrace helped scrub Mr. Clinton\u2019s reputation of some of its tawdrier aspects, Mr. Clinton helped transform Mr. Bush\u2019s image from that of a vanquished one-term president who had never fully escaped the shadow of his popular predecessor, Reagan, to one of a respected elder statesman.\u201cGeorge H. W. Bush was the best one-term president the country has ever had, and one of the most underrated presidents of all time,\u201d James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and Mr. Bush\u2019s closest adviser for nearly 50 years, said in an interview in 2013. \u201cI think history is going to treat him very well.\u201dIraq was not an unalloyed victory. Mr. Bush felt compelled to defend his decision to suspend the assault before it could topple Mr. Hussein, and his critics questioned his earlier effort to give Mr. Hussein financial aid and intelligence data. Still, foreign policy successes were the hallmark of his presidency. Not so his domestic record.By the midpoint of his term, leaders of both the Republican and Democratic Parties complained that in the midst of the worst economy any American president had faced since the end of World War II, Mr. Bush had no domestic agenda. Many questioned his sensitivity to the worries of ordinary Americans. Though stung by the criticism, he did little to dispel that perception on a visit to an economically reeling New Hampshire during his re-election campaign, when he announced in January, \u201cMessage: I care.\u201dThat promise had been delivered to roars of approval in his acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans, and the turnabout provoked a chorus of reproach. Conservative Republicans revolted. Democrats found an opening for a bruising attack. And the stage was set for an unexpectedly strong third-party challenge by Mr. Perot, a fellow Texan who had made his fortune in computers. \u201cIt did destroy me,\u201d Mr. Bush told Mr. Meacham years later as he assessed the damage he had suffered from breaking his 1988 campaign pledge.By any yardstick, Mr. Bush was an aristocrat, a product of moneyed Greenwich, Conn., where he was instilled with an enduring sense of noblesse oblige.As a candidate, he was known to ask his Secret Service detail to stop at traffic lights. He wrote enough thank-you notes, courtesy cards and letters of sympathy \u2014 Mr. Bush seemed to know someone in every town in America \u2014 to fill a book, literally.\u201cHelp me with the question, and I\u2019ll try to answer it,\u201d the president said.Moments afterward, he watched as Mr. Clinton strode eagerly across the stage to engage the woman and, some said, win over much of the electorate.Aware of his boarding-school image, Mr. Bush liked to point to his earthier chapters: his years in the Texas oil business, his wartime service. He reminded listeners that he did not wear button-down dress shirts or striped ties, thank you very much, and that he liked country music, horseshoes and pork rinds.His courteousness was often taken \u2014 mistaken might be the better word \u2014 for docility. In 1987, Newsweek put his picture on the cover with the headline \u201cFighting the \u2018Wimp Factor.\u2019 \u201d (\u201cThe cheapest shot I\u2019ve seen in my political life,\u201d Mr. Bush fumed in his diary.) But he could be fiercely competitive in both politics and play. He ran a harsh campaign to beat Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988. He did not simply play golf, he played what the White House physician called \u201caerobic golf,\u201d a mad rush from green to green.Yet for all these moments, Mr. Bush could exhibit a gracious charm and authenticity. He was that rare figure in Washington: a man without enemies \u2014 or with very few, at any rate.\u201cYou don\u2019t see anybody trashing this president,\u201d Mr. Baker said in the 2013 interview. \u201cWhether they agreed with him on certain policy positions or not, people respected him and liked him.\u201dMr. Bush remained physically and mentally robust well into his later years, pursuing a retirement seemingly as active as his career had been. At Kennebunkport, when not golfing, he could be found piloting his speedboat, grinning as it roared atop the waves while often terrifying passengers who had dared to join him.The children grew up sheltered from the Depression, tended to by maids and a driver. George enrolled at Greenwich Country Day School and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. They spent summers in Kennebunkport.Mr. Bush\u2019s high school yearbook testifies to his ambitions and energy: He was president of the senior class, chairman of the student deacons and captain of both the baseball team and the soccer team.If his father set the tone for Mr. Bush\u2019s career, his mother shaped his values. His daughter, Ms. Koch, wrote in a memoir that he had been admonished to eschew self-promotion. \u201c \u2018Nobody likes the big I am, George,\u2019 my grandmother would say to him,\u201d Ms. Koch wrote. \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t be talking about yourself.\u2019 \u201dMr. Bush once boasted to his mother that he had scored three goals in a soccer match. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, George,\u201d his mother replied, \u201cbut how did the team do?\u201dSix months before he graduated from Phillips Academy, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. \u201cI could hardly wait to get out of school and enlist,\u201d he wrote years later.At 18, a handsome and strapping young man, Mr. Bush did enlist, as a seaman second class in the Navy\u2019s flight training program. Soon he was flying combat missions in the Pacific. In September 1944, on a bombing run from the aircraft carrier San Jacinto, his plane was hit near the island of Chichi Jima by antiaircraft guns. He looked out and saw the wings on fire.\u201cI headed the plane out to sea and put on the throttle so as we could get away from the land as much as possible,\u201d he told his parents in a letter. \u201cI turned the plane up in an attitude so as to take the pressure off the back hatch so the boys could get out. After that I straightened up and started to get out myself.\u201dTwo men on the plane died in the attack. Mr. Bush hit his head bailing out, he said, but landed safely in the ocean. He floated on a raft for hours, \u201cviolently sick to my stomach,\u201d until a submarine rescued him. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross.He returned home on Christmas Eve 1944. Days later, he married a young woman he had met at a dance three years earlier: Barbara Pierce, the daughter of Marvin Pierce, the publisher of Redbook and McCall\u2019s magazines. Discharged from the Navy as a lieutenant junior grade, Mr. Bush enrolled at Yale, where he was admitted to the exclusive Skull and Bones club. With the arrival of the couple\u2019s first child, their apartment in New Haven became the home of two future presidents.By 1963 he was living in Houston, and his thoughts turned to politics. There was a contest to lead the Harris County Republican committee, and, by his account, local Republicans pressed him to jump in to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from taking over.Night after night Mr. Bush drove across the county to make speeches, with Mrs. Bush typically sitting behind him onstage, crocheting. He won, and the victory caught the attention of state Republican leaders, who urged him to challenge Senator Ralph Yarborough, a Democrat seeking a second term in 1964. Mr. Bush agreed.It was not the easiest way to begin a career in elective politics. Mr. Yarborough had ridden in President John F. Kennedy\u2019s motorcade at the time of the assassination in Dallas the previous year, and the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, a fellow Texan who was heading for a landslide election victory, supported him.In February 1966, Mr. Bush resigned as chairman and chief executive of Zapata to run for Congress in a wealthy Houston district. Surveying his electorate, he began moving to the center; he now spoke well of the Johnson agenda, declaring in a speech, \u201cI generally favor the goals as outlined in the Great Society.\u201d He told his minister: \u201cI took some of the far-right positions to get elected. I hope I never do it again. I regret it.\u201dMr. Bush won the House seat handily, with 67 percent of the vote. In Washington, he was one of 47 Republican freshmen in a Democratic-controlled Congress. In his telling, his most consequential vote there was for the open housing bill of 1968, an extension of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which he had campaigned against. He still had concerns about the act\u2019s constitutionality, he wrote about his evolution, but the \u201cproblem of discrimination troubled me deeply.\u201dMr. Bush was re-elected without opposition in 1968. The next spring, President Richard M. Nixon encouraged him to challenge Mr. Yarborough again for a Senate seat, although it would mean giving up a safe House seat and a post on the Ways and Means Committee. With Mr. Yarborough appearing more vulnerable this time, Mr. Bush took the challenge for the 1970 election.His nomination drew a tide of criticism \u2014 his qualifications, as a former two-term congressman, were not immediately apparent \u2014 but Mr. Bush won confirmation in February 1971.In 1972, after the break-ins at the Democratic Party offices at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, Nixon had a more urgent need for Mr. Bush: to lead the Republican National Committee. He took the job, he wrote, certain of Nixon\u2019s innocence in the scandal, and he defended Nixon, though it was not easy.Meeting with editors and reporters of The Washington Post at the newspaper\u2019s offices, he talked about the pressures he felt even from within his own party. \u201cI had two stacks of mail,\u201d he said. The first asked, \u201cHow come you\u2019re not doing more to support the president?\u201d The second asked, \u201cHow come you\u2019re keeping the party so close to the president?\u201dBut as the scandal deepened, his support for Nixon began to erode, particularly after the Supreme Court ordered the president to turn over 64 tapes, including one that recorded him ordering Mr. Haldeman to block an F.B.I. inquiry into the break-ins. \u201cThis was proof the president had lied,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote in \u201cAll the Best, George Bush.\u201d\u201cThe man is amoral,\u201d he said of Nixon in his diary.Mr. Bush went instead to China, as head of the United States Liaison Office, serving as an unofficial ambassador at a time when the two countries did not have full diplomatic relations. He would describe the period as a sabbatical, free of stress and obligations.Ford brought him back for another assignment in 1976: to lead the C.I.A., which was still reeling from accusations that it had abused its power under Nixon, including plotting to assassinate foreign leaders and overturn governments. Mr. Bush was credited with restoring morale at the agency, but it was another short-lived appointment, lasting just under a year. Ford lost the election to Jimmy Carter that November, and Mr. Bush returned to Texas.There he turned his sights toward running for president. \u201cI am determined to make an all-out effort for 1980,\u201d he wrote to Nixon in January 1979.Mr. Bush put together a cabinet of advisers \u2014 including Mr. Baker, a Houston lawyer who had managed his 1970 Senate campaign and Ford\u2019s 1976 presidential campaign \u2014 and began traveling the country. He focused first on the Iowa caucuses, borrowing from Jimmy Carter\u2019s strategy in 1976 of using a victory there to jump ahead of the field. He succeeded in Iowa, but then lost in New Hampshire, and by May the party was coalescing around Reagan. Mr. Bush met with his advisers. \u201cA consensus was reached \u2014 the campaign had no future,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThere was only one dissenting voice. Mine.\u201dMr. Bush decided on a new goal: to become vice president. But that July he learned from television that Reagan was seeking to enlist Ford. To ask a former president to take the No. 2 spot was a surprising move, but Reagan, a former actor and California governor with hard-right views, hoped that Ford would bring to the ticket both Washington heft and political moderation. Their negotiation faltered, however, and Mr. Bush received the telephone call he had wanted.\u201cHello, George,\u201d Reagan said to Mr. Bush. \u201cThis is Ron Reagan. I\u2019d like to go over to the convention and announce that you\u2019re my choice for vice president, if that\u2019s all right with you.\u201dThat November, the Reagan-Bush ticket won in a landslide and Mr. Bush offered the new president his fealty. \u201cI will never do anything to embarrass you politically,\u201d he wrote to Reagan.Mr. Bush happily accepted his first assignment: leading a task force to reduce federal regulations. He rarely, if ever, said no to attending the funeral of a foreign dignitary, and he endured the ribbing that is the cost of being a vice president. \u201cLet \u2019em laugh,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on, and it\u2019s substantive, and I like it.\u201dEarly in 1986, wanting to shore up his shaky credentials on the right, Mr. Bush gave a series of speeches in which he backed constitutional amendments supporting a balanced budget and school prayer and restricting abortion. He also tied himself ever more tightly to Reagan by presenting himself as the rightful heir to his party\u2019s presidential nomination.Mr. Bush came in third in the Iowa caucuses, behind Mr. Dole and the evangelical preacher Pat Robertson. It was an embarrassment for a vice president in office and the presumed heir to the nomination. Stung, Mr. Bush turned his hopes to New Hampshire, where his campaign was being run by Gov. John H. Sununu.Mr. Sununu advised him to counter his image as a man of privilege. Soon the president was campaigning in a windbreaker, pumping hands at factory gates and, at one point, leaping from his motorcade to help a driver stuck in a snowbank.When Mr. Bush arrived in New Orleans for the Republican convention, Mr. Dukakis had a 17-point lead in opinion polls.Mr. Bush did not get off to the most auspicious start. Even some Republicans questioned his choice for running mate: Dan Quayle, a young, boyish-looking, little-known Indiana senator who was just finishing his first term.The day before the election, Mr. Bush was confident enough about the outcome that he decided to name Mr. Baker, his campaign manager in 1970 and 1980, as secretary of state and Mr. Sununu, who had saved his candidacy in New Hampshire, as chief of staff.His victory, on Nov. 8, was convincing: He won 40 states and 54 percent of the popular vote, to Mr. Dukakis\u2019s 46 percent. The next day, seeking to distance himself from harsher sides of his campaign, Mr. Bush assured reporters that they would never again see the candidate some had begun calling George the Ripper.The most immediate difficulty came from operating in Reagan\u2019s shadow. Mr. Bush had replaced, and would be judged against, a two-term president who had come to embody a new era of Republicanism while presiding over what was, at the time, the longest period of economic growth in history. If things went wrong for Mr. Bush, he would not be able to blame his predecessor.And clearly he did not approve of everything Reagan had done as president. The heavy budget deficit Reagan had left promised to complicate anything the new president might want to do.\u201cI could not have been more wrong.\u201dMr. Bush next nominated a popular House member for the defense secretary job: Mr. Cheney of Wyoming. But the Tower episode had taken a toll. The 41st president had not reached the benchmark first 100 days in office, yet he felt compelled to declare that his White House was \u201con track.\u201d\u201cI would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be bubbling around, that nothing is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot is happening, not all of it good, but a lot is happening.\u201dThe Soviet bloc was in even greater upheaval. Mr. Gorbachev, who had come to power in 1985, had begun a campaign for economic and democratic change, shaking the foundations of communism across Eastern Europe. Mr. Bush found himself under pressure to respond with equal boldness.He bristled at the criticism. \u201cIf we mishandle this,\u201d he said, speaking of the rebellions in Eastern Europe, \u201cand get way out looking like an American project, you could invite crackdown and invite negative reaction that could result in bloodshed.\u201dAt the time, Mr. Bush was frustrated by Mr. Noriega\u2019s resilience. In October, dissident Panamanian defense forces had been crushed in an attempted coup that received some, but not enough, American support. Mr. Noriega appeared before cameras in a taunting show of defiance.On Dec. 20, the United States invaded Panama in a swift overnight operation involving 11,000 troops; 23 Americans died. Mr. Noriega fled, eventually turning up at the residence of the Vatican\u2019s representative in Panama City before surrendering to the United States to face narcotics-trafficking charges. Mr. Atwater, the chairman of the Republican National Committee at the time, said the capture was a \u201cpolitical jackpot\u201d for Mr. Bush.Supporters of the bill called it the most significant piece of civil rights legislation in two decades. It barred discrimination against people with handicaps in places of public accommodation, transportation and employment, and mandated that many new public and private buildings be made easily accessible to people with disabilities. Similar rules applied to buses and trains.Environmental groups praised Mr. Bush\u2019s record on climate change and the environment. As president, he signed the United States to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, which led to the Paris Agreement on a plan to reduce global emissions. Mr. Bush also created the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the federal body that produces a sweeping government climate change report every four years.On the domestic front, Mr. Bush was ready to negotiate a deal on the growing budget deficit. But in doing so he opened the door to what he would come to see as the worst mistake of his presidency.\u201cWe need a deal,\u201d he wrote in his diary. \u201cI\u2019m willing to eat crow, but the others are going to have to eat crow. I\u2019ll have to yield on \u2018Read My Lips,\u2019 and they\u2019re going to have to yield on some of their rhetoric on taxes and on entitlements.\u201dMarlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary at the time, said the administration had \u201cno preconditions\u201d as it entered negotiations with congressional leaders. But Democrats, seeking to guard against Republican attacks in elections that fall, said they would not consider any tax increases unless Mr. Bush publicly endorsed such a step.The House voted down the budget proposal, 254 to 179, in October 1990. It took several weeks to reach a final deal, which included raising the tax rate on upper income earners to 31 percent from 28 percent. Mr. Bush said that he would sign it, but that he was \u201cabsolutely going to hold the line on taxes from now on.\u201dOver the next two weeks, Mr. Bush moved the nation toward war while trying to reassure leaders like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who told him, \u201cDon\u2019t go wobbly on me, George.\u201d He sent paratroopers to Saudi Arabia and ordered warships to the Persian Gulf to enforce United Nations trade sanctions against Iraq.In November, Mr. Bush nearly doubled the size of the United States presence in the Persian Gulf.Democrats in Congress were concerned. \u201cHowling in the Congress was loud,\u201d Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Mr. Bush, wrote in his memoir. \u201cWas this George Bush, whom some people criticized as a \u2018wimp,\u2019 trying to prove his manhood by starting a war?At 3 a.m. in Iraq on Jan. 16, after a midnight deadline had passed without an Iraqi withdrawal, Mr. Bush ordered airstrikes. Waves of bombers and cruise missiles hit Baghdad and targets elsewhere in Iraq and in Kuwait.The war began with a spectacular display of United States air power, as precision missile and bombing runs appeared to be inflicting grave damage on Baghdad. The White House held out hope that this assault alone would win the war, without American casualties, but Pentagon officials realized that a ground invasion was inevitable.When it came, the ground war lasted almost exactly 100 hours, with minimal American casualties. Encircled, the Iraqi Army surrendered. Mr. Bush called a cease-fire, even though it allowed members of the Republican Guard, an elite Iraqi unit, to escape, and even though it left Mr. Hussein in power.General Powell advised Mr. Bush to end the fighting. \u201cMr. President, it\u2019s going much better than we expected,\u201d he recalled saying, according to his memoir. \u201cThe Iraqi Army is broken. All they\u2019re trying to do now is get out. We don\u2019t want to be seen as killing for the sake of killing.\u201d Mr. Bush, by General Powell\u2019s account, responded, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why not end it today?\u201dMr. Bush would be called to defend that decision time and again, saying that he had been convinced that Mr. Hussein would be overthrown once the war ended. \u201cWe underestimated his brutality and cruelty to his own people and the stranglehold he has on his country,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote in February 1991, years before Mr. Hussein was actually ousted. \u201cWe were disappointed, but I still do not regret my decision to end the war when we did.\u201dThe 1992 election was still more than a year away, but Mr. Bush was considering his prospects for a second term when he took note of a governor who sought to run against him. \u201cThe stories keep saying I will be very hard to beat: The more we hear of this, the more worried I become,\u201d he wrote in his diary. \u201cBill Clinton, a very nice man, may get into the race.\u201dThen came an Election Day jolt in 1991: Harris Wofford, an obscure Democrat running for the Senate in Pennsylvania and appealing to the economic concerns of the middle class, defeated Dick Thornburgh, an attorney general under both Mr. Bush and Reagan.\u201cYou see, there\u2019s some fairly good fundamentals getting out there,\u201d he said. \u201cInflation is down. Interest rates are down. Personal debt is down. Inventories are down.\u201dBut Americans, including Republicans, were dubious. One opinion poll found that only one in four respondents approved of Mr. Bush\u2019s handling of the economy. Signaling more trouble, Mr. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, announced that he would challenge Mr. Bush for the Republican nomination.Mr. Bush\u2019s 12-day trip to the Far East opened the last full year of his presidency. The White House presented the trip, six weeks before the New Hampshire primary, as an effort to open export markets. Instead it produced what Mr. Bush saw as one of the most damaging moments of his time in office.Mr. Bush came home to a bleak domestic picture. Unemployment was at 7.1 percent, the highest level in six years. A New York Times/CBS News opinion poll found that just one-fifth of Americans thought Mr. Bush cared about their problems. When Mr. Bush visited New Hampshire in mid-January, his anxiety was evident the moment he stepped off Air Force One.\u201cI probably have made mistakes in assessing the fact that the economy would recover,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve known, look, this economy is in free fall. I hope I\u2019ve known it. Maybe I haven\u2019t conveyed it as well as I should have, but I do understand it.\u201dMr. Buchanan drew 37 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, unwelcome news for the beleaguered Mr. Bush.The president\u2019s advisers promptly sent him to 22 cities in 20 days. He attacked welfare, big government and trial lawyers, and rued the day he had agreed to raise taxes, calling his decision to renege on his tax pledge the biggest mistake of his presidency.Mr. Bush stopped his slide by solidly beating Mr. Buchanan in South Carolina. Clearly relieved, the president said he would cut back his campaign trips.But Mr. Buchanan\u2019s candidacy had highlighted Mr. Bush\u2019s political frailty, forced him to act as a candidate rather than as a president, and pushed him rightward as Mr. Clinton seized the center.There was little respite for Mr. Bush as he prepared for the nominating convention in Houston. At that point he had to deal with the prospect of a populist third-party challenge from Mr. Perot. Mr. Bush shrugged off the threat at first.\u201cPerot will be defined, seen, as a weirdo,\u201d he wrote that spring, referring to Mr. Perot\u2019s eccentric ways and folksy style. (He was drawn to conspiracy theories, among other things, and hired private detectives to chase his suspicions.) But Mr. Perot had captured the public\u2019s imagination. He presented himself as the symbol of change and did not play by the rules of traditional politics.Alarmed Republicans were blunt. At a fund-raiser in Charlotte, N.C., the president was visibly uncomfortable watching a video in which Senator Jesse Helms complained about Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign. \u201cMr. President,\u201d Mr. Helms said, \u201ctell them once again, \u2018Read my lips,\u2019 but this time with gusto.\u201dMr. Bush fixated on Mr. Clinton\u2019s political skills. Mr. Clinton was \u201cbetter at facts-figures, than I am,\u201d he wrote to an adviser. \u201cI am better at life.\u201dHe also complained to supporters that he was not getting the credit he deserved for the fall of communism, the handling of the Persian Gulf war and the arms control treaties. \u201cI have worked my heart out as president of the United States,\u201d he said.Mr. Clinton was nominated by a confident, united Democratic Party in New York in July. Republicans went on the attack, portraying him as a man of character flaws that made him unfit to lead. Mr. Clinton responded with equal force. \u201cGeorge Bush,\u201d he said, \u201cif you won\u2019t use your power to help people, step aside. I will.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s convention was a success. In a New York Times/CBS News opinion poll, he had the biggest postconvention bounce in 50 years, leading Mr. Bush 55 percent to 31 percent.Republicans despaired. Under pressure to shake up his White House, Mr. Bush pressed his old friend Mr. Baker to leave the State Department and return as White House chief of staff.Mr. Bush accepted the nomination to run for a second term with a promise to cut taxes, a pledge to curb spending, an attack on Mr. Clinton\u2019s credentials and \u2014 once again \u2014 an apology for having broken his tax cut pledge.\u201cWho do you trust in this election?\u201d he said as Republican delegates in Houston roared their approval. \u201cThe candidate who raised taxes one time and regrets it, or the other candidate, who raised taxes and fees 128 times and enjoyed it every time?\u201dThe convention was dominated by angry appeals to the party\u2019s conservative wing, notably by Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Robertson, who were given prime-time slots to speak against abortion rights and gay rights. By the end of the month, a New York Times/CBS News poll showed that Mr. Clinton still had a resounding lead of 51 percent to 26 percent.Mr. Bush remained ostensibly confident. \u201cI can make it; I can out hustle Clinton; out work him; out jog him; out campaign him; and we\u2019ll win,\u201d he wrote in his diary. But his campaign was frantic. He jumped from offering an economic plan one day to attacking Mr. Clinton\u2019s character the next, referring to Mr. Clinton\u2019s military draft exemptions, his dabbling with marijuana and his protests against the Vietnam War while a student.Mr. Bush\u2019s attacks escalated as the weather turned cold. \u201cMy dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than those two bozos,\u201d he said of Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee.But on Nov. 3, Mr. Clinton defeated Mr. Bush, 43 percent to 37 percent, with Mr. Perot drawing almost 19 percent. Mr. Bush believed he would have won were it not for Mr. Perot, Mr. Baker said. That weekend, a dispirited Mr. Bush retreated with General Powell to Camp David in Maryland, where they watched the movie \u201cEnchanted April\u201d and tried to understand what had just happened.\u201cI just never thought they\u2019d elect him,\u201d Mr. Bush told General Powell. \u201cDon\u2019t understand it. But life goes on.\u201dMr. Bush had not expected such an early retirement. He and Mrs. Bush did not even really have a place to go: Their base in Houston was a hotel suite, and the Kennebunkport retreat had not been winterized.Mr. Bush spent the rest of his life more as an observer than as a player, watching as one son was elected president twice and as another was elected governor twice before attempting his own run for the presidency. He joined Mr. Clinton in raising money for disaster relief efforts. His public profile dropped as criticism of his son\u2019s presidency mounted, and there were reports that foreign policy advisers to the elder Mr. Bush had counseled against the war in Iraq that so troubled George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.As Mr. Bush moved into the final years of his life, there were signs that time had left him behind. A handful of women accused him of inappropriately touching them as they were having their pictures taken with him. Mr. Bush\u2019s office said the gestures, he patted them on the rear, were meant in a good-natured manner, but said: \u201cto anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.\u201dMr. Bush was never a man comfortable with self-examination, but in an interview with Mr. Meacham, his biographer, he evinced some insecurity about how history might judge him. \u201cI am lost between the glory of Reagan \u2014 monuments everywhere, trumpets, the great hero \u2014 and the trials and tribulations of my sons,\u201d Mr. Bush said.At another point, he asked of those who would examine his career, \u201cWhat if they just find an empty deck of cards?\u201dBut the 41st president may have best summed up his talents and ambitions in a diary entry on the last day of 1989, as the first year of his presidency drew to a close.\u201cI\u2019m certainly not seen as visionary,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote. \u201cBut I hope I\u2019m seen as steady and prudent and able.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the percentage of the popular vote that Michael Dukakis won in the 1988 presidential election. It was 46 percent, not 35 percent.Peter Baker and Manny Fernandez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Approves Sweeping Deal on Migration, but Without U.S. Support", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 More than 160 countries adopted a sweeping international accord on migration on Monday, after the United Nations secretary general robustly defended against the \u201cmyths\u201d and falsehoods that critics had directed at the deal.The 165 countries gathered in Marrakesh approved the agreement by consensus, defying the United States and other countries that had withdrawn, citing concerns about migrant flows and national sovereignty.The decision in Marrakesh is the culmination of nearly two years of consultations and negotiations to produce an accord to promote international cooperation in handling migration. It will return to the United Nations next week to be formally adopted by the General Assembly.Mr. Guterres dismissed as \u201cmyth No. 1\u201d the idea that the accord would force countries to adopt migrant-friendly laws and regulations. The compact is not legally binding, but instead proposes a road map for cooperation that explicitly recognizes state sovereignty and governments\u2019 rights to decide their own immigration policies.Moreover, Mr. Guterres said, regulated migration is needed if developed countries are to maintain economic growth when they face declining birthrates and aging populations. Coordinated action can also combat the high human cost of unregulated migration, which is exploited by predatory smugglers.More than 60,000 migrants have died in hazardous journeys while trying to reach wealthier countries, Mr. Guterres said. \u201cThis is a source of collective shame,\u201d he added.The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, a 34-page document, asserts that \u201cno state can address migration alone\u201d and outlines 23 objectives. They include the collection of better data on the movement of migrants, the strengthening of legal paths to migration, efforts to combat human trafficking and cooperation to ease the safe return of migrants to their countries of origin.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say migration is a good thing or a bad thing, it\u2019s a thing,\u201d Louise Arbour, the United Nations official who led negotiations on the compact, told reporters in Geneva last week, emphasizing the need for the international community to address and mitigate that global reality.Work began after members of the United Nations, including the United States under President Barack Obama, approved a declaration in 2016 saying that no country could manage international migration alone, and agreed to work on a pact. But the Trump administration withdrew its support a year ago, saying that parts of the compact were \u201cinconsistent with U.S. immigration and refugee policies.\u201dSlovakia\u2019s foreign minister, Miroslav Lajcak, who presided at the United Nations General Assembly in July when the organization adopted the compact, said last week that he would resign after the country\u2019s Parliament rejected the accord.Resistance to the compact has largely fed on fears that it would force countries to throw open their borders and extend welfare benefits to new arrivals, which opponents say would draw enormous flows of people from abroad.\u201cWe are not establishing a new right to migrate,\u201d Mr. Guterres insisted on Monday. \u201cWhat we are establishing is the obligation to respect the human rights of migrants.\u201dMost migration is not from \u201csouth to north\u201d but between developing countries, he said, seeking to dispel other falsehoods and noting that there were more African migrants in other African countries than there are in Europe.Moreover, migrants provide a boost to the economies of their host countries as well as to their countries of origin, he said. Migrants spend 85 percent of their earnings in the countries where they work. They send the remaining 15 percent home in remittances, providing vital lifelines to developing countries that add up to three times the value of official development assistance from richer nations.The compact presents \u201can opportunity to fix a global approach to migration that is broken, that is failing hundreds of thousands of people every day,\u201d Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement, adding \u201cthe work starts now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "So, I Asked People in Saudi Arabia About Their Mad, Murderous Crown Prince", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe U.S. has leverage over Riyadh. Let\u2019s use it.Opinion ColumnistRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 It\u2019s awkward to find yourself in a police state interviewing people about their leader\u2019s penchant for starving children, torturing women or dismembering critics.The result is nervous smiles. And long pauses in the conversation.It\u2019s sad because on this visit, I found Saudi Arabia truly is changing under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. You feel a dynamism on the ground in Riyadh, and young Saudis are thrilled that the country finally has a bold leader trying to modernize the economy.Another awkward silence.Ah, more awkwardness.Senior Saudis privately accept that M.B.S. ordered Khashoggi\u2019s death but insist that the Saudi-U.S. relationship is more important than one man\u2019s life. For the sake of stability in the region, they say, America should stand by Saudi Arabia.To which my answer is: The problem is not only that M.B.S. is a murderer, but also that he has destabilized the region, starved Yemeni children and undermined the interests of Saudi Arabia and the United States alike. Everything he touches, he breaks.President Trump and Jared Kushner have placed their bets on the prince, and in a narrow sense they may be right. King Faisal managed to oust his incompetent predecessor, King Saud, in 1964, but I saw no sign that M.B.S. is in jeopardy of losing power.My most interesting interaction was with a group of young professionals who believe that I am getting it all wrong.\u201cI don\u2019t know why the media focuses on the bad side,\u201d protested Tariq Buhilaigah, a consultant in Riyadh. Sure there have been missteps, he said, but the most important things going on are the modernization of the country and the diversification of the economy away from oil.Felwa AlBazie, who is preparing to get her driver\u2019s license, said she doesn\u2019t know why the women\u2019s rights activists are detained but added, \u201cThe big picture I\u2019m seeing is that every woman in life benefits from driving, and women and men benefit from social progress.\u201dThe truth is that as Saudi Arabia\u2019s significance as an oil producer diminishes, we need Saudi Arabia less. In 25 years, if we\u2019re freed from the tyranny of imported oil, we may not need it at all.Some Saudis kept trying to suggest to me that if we block weapons sales to Riyadh, the kingdom will turn to Moscow. That\u2019s absurd. It needs our spare parts and, more important, it buys our weapons because they come with an implicit guarantee that we will bail the Saudis out militarily if they get in trouble with Iran.Saudi Arabia\u2019s armed forces can\u2019t even defeat a militia in Yemen, so how could they stand up to Iran? That\u2019s why we have leverage over Saudi Arabia, not the other way around.Let\u2019s use that leverage. The next step should be a suspension of arms sales until Saudi Arabia ends its war on Yemen, for that war has made us complicit in mass starvation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Paris, \u2018Yellow Vest\u2019 Protests Cut Sharply Into City\u2019s Luxury Trade", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral weekends of violent demonstrations across France have hit the capital\u2019s sellers of high-end goods hard during the year\u2019s most important shopping periodTourists and local residents alike, many of them wearing fur or cashmere and laden with bags, hurry into glittering temples of French heritage like Chanel and Dior, Longchamp and Ladur\u00e9e to stock up on holiday gifts. The luxury-goods industry, one of France\u2019s top export categories and a major driver of tourism in Paris, has been hit hard during its most important month of the year. A police lockdown and fears of widespread vandalism prompted executives at several high-profile companies to close their Paris stores, and their mouths, after some protesters seized on French fashion logos as symbols of inequality and elitism. Some chief executives, however, did stick their heads above the parapet.\u201cThis time of year is the most important selling period for Lanvin, with December counting for at least two regular months of full-price sales,\u201d Mr. Hecquet said. \u201cOne could say that our online business could cover our losses, but when it comes to shopping for luxury ready-to-wear, physical stores remain very important.\u201d Dior, Burberry and Kering all declined to comment on how the protests were affecting sales. Chanel confirmed only that its stores had been closed as a safety precaution, although Karl Lagerfeld, the creative director, noted in an interview with New York magazine last week: \u201cI like the moment we are living through, but not the \u2018yellow raincoats\u2019 in the street.\u201dSome people in the industry expressed concerns that luxury brands could become targets in a workers\u2019 revolt against the increasingly unpopular Mr. Macron.Fears are growing that Paris could enter a sharp downturn similar to the one that followed the terrorist attacks of 2015.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to shop at Louis Vuitton on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es when cars are burning on the street,\u201d said Mario Ortelli, managing partner of the luxury advisers Ortelli & Company. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to walk around with an Herm\u00e8s bag when there\u2019s a violent protest happening.\u201dMarc-Andre Kamel, the head of Bain\u2019s retail practice for Europe, Africa and the Middle East, said that while sales elsewhere might help luxury brands with global footprints offset the losses in Paris, department stores like Galeries Lafayette and Printemps were more likely to experience a blunt impact from the protests, since regional stores outside Paris are affected by disruption in other cities.\u201cIt is a grim situation for those retailers,\u201d Mr. Kamel said. \u201cJust how bad will be seen when sales figures are released early next year.\u201dUntil the protests began, Mr. Kamel said, \u201cit had been a relatively decent year\u201d for luxury spending. \u201cFor France as a brand, for luxury players, who are a major reason many people travel here, these are nerve-racking times,\u201d he added.Yet, there a quiet sense of defiance was in evidence on some street corners. Around the Place Vend\u00f4me, a hub of luxury jewelry shops and designer stores, rioters had smashed windows and built barricades on recent weekends. Many of the shops had boarded their windows up entirely, blocking everything inside from view. Other stores, like Louis Vuitton, created giant, clear barriers instead, allowing a showcase for sparkling Christmas trees framed by expensive shoes, handbags and accessories, a reminder that those dream purchases were still available, if out of reach for many.Jean Cassegrain, the chief executive of Longchamp, said some of his Paris stores were closed and security had been added at others. But he emphasized that luxury brands were not the primary object of the protesters\u2019 ire.\u201cThe protests did not target luxury stores specifically: bus stops, cafes, construction sites, cars were also damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a moment in the life of the city. Paris remains a great and enjoyable city for residents and for tourists.\u201dNevertheless, for an industry that builds itself on trading in branded aspiration and fantasy, the recent upheaval in luxury\u2019s capital city has undeniably tarnished that image. Just how badly will only become clear in the coming weeks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "German Army Considers Recruiting Foreign Citizens", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Concerned about filling its ranks seven years after abolishing mandatory military service, Germany is looking into recruiting foreigners for service, according to reports released on Thursday, though there were conflicting accounts of the extent of those plans.Gen. Eberhard Zorn, the chief of defense, said the military, or Bundeswehr, was considering enlisting foreign citizens for highly specialized roles, like doctors and information technology specialists.\u201cIn times of skilled labor shortage, we have to look in all directions,\u201d he said in an interview with the Funke Media group, which was widely reported by other German news organizations.Hours after his comments appeared, the newsmagazine Der Spiegel published an article about a leaked government report indicating that plans to recruit citizens of other European Union countries were broader and more concrete than the narrow, tentative notion aired by General Zorn.A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the authenticity of the leaked report, but said that any plans under consideration were limited to highly trained recruits for clearly defined roles.The armed forces have about 180,000 troops, about one-third as many as the former West Germany had in 1990, but the government has committed to expanding the military in the next few years.There has already been some public debate in recent years about whether non-Germans have a place in the Bundeswehr in a modern, immigrant-friendly nation that is deeply integrated in the European Union. Last July, politicians sparred over whether foreigners serving under the German flag would be given access to German citizenship.Several European countries allow citizens of other European Union members to serve in their militaries. But Germany\u2019s history of militarism and conscription of the people of conquered nations makes the idea particularly delicate.Germany and other NATO countries have clashed publicly with President Trump, who has accused them of spending too little on their own defense, and the German Army is suffering from poorly maintained equipment. According to news reports, the Bundeswehr had to scrape together everything from tanks to body armor to be able to participate in this year\u2019s NATO maneuvers in Norway.\u201cIt boils down to the question, what is the Bundeswehr?\u201d said S\u00f6nke Neitzel, a military historian at the University of Potsdam. \u201cIs it a fighting force or a corporation?\u201dAlthough there are already several German divisions that include brigades from other countries, the plans being considered would put non-German Europeans in German uniforms for the first time since World War II.After the Cold War, the demand for soldiers grew smaller as Germany intentionally shrank its military, while reunification with East Germany made the population pool larger. The minimum span of a soldier\u2019s service dropped to six months from 18. In 2011, the country ended conscription.The military has changed significantly since the Cold War. It focuses far more on cyberwarfare and special forces, the number of women in uniform has increased and as Germany has grown more ethnically diverse so has the army.But attracting professionally trained personnel has been a problem.\u201cOver half the workers hired in the recent economic expansion come from abroad,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Takeaways from Xi Jinping\u2019s Speech Defending Communist Party Control", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe meeting commemorated a Communist Party leaders\u2019 conclave in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping and other veteran revolutionaries set China toward market-friendly, pro-growth policies that would eventually transform the country into the world\u2019s biggest economy after the United States.Some economists and investors had hoped that Mr. Xi would embrace and improve on Deng\u2019s historical legacy as an economic liberalizer.Here are the key points from what he said and what they mean:Mr. Xi\u2019s speech stood out for his defense of the Communist Party as the designer and guardian of China\u2019s prosperity and stability.He has often made that case, and when his predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, spoke on the 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1978 shift, they also gave plenty of space to praising the party. Even so, Mr. Xi\u2019s comments seemed strikingly prominent, especially when many investors had hoped for a more moderate message.Summarizing what he described as the lessons from China\u2019s past four decades, Mr. Xi said, \u201cFirst, the party\u2019s leadership over all tasks must be adhered to, and the party\u2019s leadership must be incessantly strengthened and improved.\u201dIf anyone watching still expected that Mr. Xi would seek to moderate his hard-line reputation and reveal himself to be a political liberalizer, he used this meeting to send an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d The party\u2019s socialist path, doctrine and policies over the past 40 years, he said, had all been \u201ctotally correct.\u201dMr. Xi referred only obliquely to the elephant in the room: the trade war with the United States and the strain that deteriorating relations has put on China\u2019s economy.\u201cNo one is in the position to dictate to the Chinese people what should and should not be done,\u201d he said in apparent reference to demands from Washington and other capitals that China undo some of its protectionist economic policies (even as Chinese negotiators have quietly offered concessions).He reiterated China\u2019s position on subjects like Taiwan\u2019s independence, which Beijing fiercely opposes, but he emphasized that China sought to promote peace, support international development and bolster the international organizations that have helped shape and sustain today\u2019s world order.\u201cChina\u2019s development will never constitute a threat to any other country,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cNo matter what level of development China reaches, it will never seek hegemony.\u201dGiven China\u2019s embrace of market economics, China\u2019s leaders have often played down the communism part of the Communist Party. Mr. Xi made clear just how deeply committed he is to the ideology itself \u2014 adapted \u201cwith Chinese characteristics,\u201d as the phrase goes.In his remarks he exalted Marxist-Leninist principles and even quoted Friedrich Engels to make the case for promoting new forms of innovation in the 21st century.Mr. Xi\u2019s message: China\u2019s headlong plunge into capitalism over the last 40 years was not a repudiation of the Communist Party\u2019s founding ideology, but something possible only because of it.The run-up to Mr. Xi\u2019s speech aroused expectations of change, because the government had become increasingly concerned that private businesses \u2014 the engine of employment growth and innovation \u2014 have been demoralized by too much taxation, bureaucracy and barriers to bank loans.Economists and investors have criticized Mr. Xi for giving what they consider too much protection to state-owned conglomerates.But on Tuesday, those critics were probably disappointed by the absence of specifics or shifts in rhetoric.Jack Ma, the multibillionaire founder of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant, was among the 100 Chinese honored by Mr. Xi as \u201cpioneers\u201d of reform.

{"Headline": "A Look at Competition in Business Urges Us to Think Small", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesWu, a professor at Columbia Law School and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, argues that the M&A arcana that lawyers and economists haggle over have effects that spill far beyond their rarefied areas of expertise. \u201cExtreme economic concentration yields gross inequality and material suffering, feeding an appetite for nationalistic and extremist leadership,\u201d he writes, by way of introduction and warning. \u201cThe road to fascism and dictatorship is paved with failures of economic policy to serve the needs of the general public.\u201dUnlike Wu\u2019s previous books, \u201cThe Master Switch\u201d (2010) and \u201cThe Attention Merchants\u201d (2016), \u201cThe Curse of Bigness\u201d is skinny, more of a dip with a snorkel than a deep dive. But the pithiness of this new volume is ideally suited to its subject. Wu doesn\u2019t want to get into all the intricacies of antitrust law; if anything, an enormous book on the problem of enormity would only fool us into believing that the subject is more impenetrable than it really is \u2014 and stoke the confusion and apathy that have allowed decades of corporate consolidation to flourish in the first place.Wu\u2019s point is simple. Giant corporations, seeking to protect their advantage, try to turn their outsize economic power into political power. So to break their grip on American democracy, the government needs to break them up in turn. That this proposal might sound outrageously radical to certain ears is, Wu says, just one sign of how unprepared we are for our current moment. To show how busting up big businesses into smaller parts was once a veritable American tradition, he charts how antitrust law emerged in response to the grotesque inequality of the 19th-century Gilded Age.When the Sherman Antitrust Act was signed into law in 1890, it had unanimous support in the House, though the language it deployed was both sweeping and severe, stating bluntly that \u201cevery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize\u201d any area of business \u201cshall be deemed guilty of a felony.\u201dEnforcing the law turned out to be another matter. A decade later, J .P. Morgan \u2014 \u201chistory\u2019s greatest monopolizer,\u201d as Wu calls him \u2014 created the behemoth U. S. Steel by merging hundreds of smaller firms, even buying out his fellow tycoon Andrew Carnegie in 1901 for an exorbitant sum ($480 million back then) that would make Carnegie the richest man in the world.Wu is an able guide through the history \u2014 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s campaign against \u201cbad trusts\u201d all the way to the expansive bloat of AT&T and Microsoft\u2019s competition-crushing ambitions of more recent memory \u2014 but it\u2019s on the level of ideas that his book comes into its own. Similar to the tech moguls of today, the monopolists of a century ago \u201cliked to portray themselves as part of a progressive movement, striving toward a better age,\u201d Wu writes, even if the endgame they were pursuing \u2014 essentially \u201cpure economic autocracy\u201d \u2014 was a direct rebuke to the foundational values of the republic.But then competition can feel menacing \u2014 a grueling free-for-all that anyone with grand ambitions in business would prefer to do without. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel said as much in the pages of The Wall Street Journal in 2014, in an article with the piquant title \u201cCompetition Is for Losers.\u201d \u201cCapitalism and competition are opposites,\u201d Thiel declared. \u201cOnly one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.\u201dWu, who advised the Federal Trade Commission on competition issues during the Obama administration, doesn\u2019t buy all the piety; nor should he or anyone have to, he says. Trying to distinguish between gigantic corporations that bring value to consumers from gigantic corporations that don\u2019t is ultimately a mug\u2019s game. Competition is a process, and the process should be protected; to fixate too much on the other stuff is to expect the legal system to make distinctions it isn\u2019t equipped to make \u2014 pushing up the standard of proof and allowing enforcement to go slack.Against Bork\u2019s strictly minimalist idea, Wu advances another, more complex one, which was proposed in the early 20th century by the lawyer and eventual Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. Worrying about the tendency of giant corporations to \u201cexterminate\u201d the competition in their inexorable march toward domination, Brandeis believed that the economy, and the businesses that are part of it, needed to operate at a human scale.\u201cWhat Brandeis really cared about was the economic conditions under which life is lived,\u201d Wu writes, \u201cand the effects of the economy on one\u2019s character and on the nation\u2019s soul.\u201d It\u2019s a big idea for a little book, but Wu knows how to keep everything concise and contained. \u201cThe Curse of Bigness\u201d moves nimbly through the thicket, embracing the boons of being small.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Huawei Executive\u2019s Arrest Intensifies Trade War Fears", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 At dinner with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on Saturday night in Buenos Aires, President Trump celebrated their \u201cspecial\u201d relationship and all but predicted they would emerge with a truce in the trade war between the United States and China.Seven thousand miles away, unbeknown to both leaders, Canadian police acting at the request of the United States were in the process of detaining Meng Wanzhou, a top executive of one of China\u2019s flagship technology firms, as she changed planes in Vancouver.The timing of the arrest, some experts said, could feed the suspicion of Chinese officials that nationalist factions in the Trump administration were trying to sabotage the trade deal. Their mood had already soured since Saturday, when the White House announced the two sides had agreed to 90 days of talks, amid confusion over the timetable and doubts that the Chinese would agree to the trade concessions described by Mr. Trump.\u201cTo detain someone without giving clear reason is an obvious violation of human rights,\u201d said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, who demanded Ms. Meng\u2019s immediate release.For Mr. Xi, these experts said, the episode might be seen as an embarrassing loss of face.Huawei and Ms. Meng, who in addition to being the company\u2019s chief financial officer is the daughter of its founder, are at the pinnacle of China\u2019s corporate world, which will increase the pressure on Mr. Xi to demand her release. It will also increase the pressure on Mr. Trump to weigh the diplomatic fallout of detaining Ms. Meng, especially after a meeting that he hailed as a breakthrough and a testament to his friendship with Mr. Xi.\u201cIn the past, the United States has been faced with making a deal with China in one arena while being irritated or highly concerned about others, such as human rights or security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe shoe is now on the other foot, and we will have to see if China can compartmentalize this case.\u201dFor American officials and the White House, the fact that Mr. Trump went into the meeting without knowing about the arrest raised questions about whether the president was properly briefed before a sensitive meeting with a foreign leader.While the Justice Department did brief the White House about the impending arrest, Mr. Trump was not told about it. And the subject did not come up at the dinner with Mr. Xi.Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said on NPR that he knew about the arrest in advance, though he did not confirm that he was told about it before the dinner. Such notifications from the Justice Department \u201chappen with some frequency,\u201d he said, and \u201cwe certainly don\u2019t inform the president on every one of them.\u201dBut the Justice Department did give advance notification to the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and its ranking Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, according to two officials.Former American officials said the awkward timing of it was most likely a coincidence that grew out of the unpredictable travel schedule of Ms. Meng.\u201cWhen you have an opportunity to arrest a key figure in a law enforcement operation, you take that opportunity,\u201d said John E. Smith, the former director of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, who left the administration this year.Still, given the magnitude of the arrest and the country involved, Mr. Smith expressed surprise that the White House officials contacted by the Justice Department did not immediately tell higher-level officials, who could at least tip off the president.The Justice Department has not revealed what Huawei was doing to run afoul of the sanctions. Chinese companies regularly do business in Iran, and much of that trade complies with sanctions regulations. The question appears to be whether Huawei sold technology from the United States to Iran or violated sanctions in some other manner.While the case involving Ms. Meng is related to the unauthorized sale of equipment that could violate sanctions against Iran, F.B.I. counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors began building criminal cases against Huawei\u2019s leadership in 2010, according to a former department official.The effort was led by United States attorneys in offices where Huawei has facilities, including Massachusetts, Alabama, California, New York and Texas \u2014 offices that were chosen this fall to lead the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to combat Chinese national security threats.As the F.B.I. looked into Huawei, its investigators grew concerned that company officers were working on behalf of the Chinese government. By the time Mr. Trump took office, F.B.I. leaders regularly talked about Huawei almost every day, according to a former official.Mr. Trump has emphasized curbing China\u2019s rise as a technological power, increasingly linking trade with national security. The White House has restricted Chinese investment in the United States and hit China with tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, including sensitive products like parts for nuclear reactors and semiconductors.\u201cIn the past, we have dealt with these cases by interrupting the legal process to avoid offending the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general who worked on China issues at the National Security Council until January. \u201cThat is what has made geopolitics so challenging to American interests in the last 20 years.\u201dAmerican officials have raised questions about how closely linked Huawei is to Chinese security agencies and the People\u2019s Liberation Army. The founder of Huawei and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, is a former army engineer who has become one of China\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs. American officials are pressing other countries to not enter into deals with Huawei on developing fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless service networks.Lawmakers are also rallying against Huawei. In October, two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 Mr. Warner and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida \u2014 wrote Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to urge him to prevent Huawei from supplying equipment for that country\u2019s 5G network. In August, Australia banned Huawei and ZTE from providing such equipment.If Ms. Meng were extradited from Canada to stand trial in the United States, prosecutors might try to demonstrate Huawei\u2019s ties to the Chinese Communist Party and various state agencies, and to dramatize the potential security compromises related to that.The National Security Agency breached Huawei servers years ago in an effort to investigate its operations and its ties to Chinese security agencies and the military, and to create back doors so the National Security Agency could roam in networks around the globe wherever Huawei equipment was used.How Mr. Trump could have used the information about Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest in his meeting with Mr. Xi, had he known about it, is unclear. Telling Mr. Xi that the United States had asked for the arrest of the daughter of one of its most prominent businessmen would have been a drastic move, former officials said, but it might have complicated the efforts of both sides to declare a trade truce.\u201cA lot depends on the next few days,\u201d said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Hudson Institute who has advised Mr. Trump. \u201cThis is another challenge to be managed.\u201dAlan Rappeport and Adam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Fall of the Roman Republic Can Teach Us About America", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Unable to pacify the Roman Republic by treaty, Pyrrhus turned to bribery. When Fabricius, a senator widely known to be as poor as he was distinguished, arrived to negotiate a prisoner exchange, Pyrrhus offered him gold and silver so plentiful it would make him one of the world\u2019s richest men. But Fabricius refused. \u201cThe Republic of Rome provides those who go into public life with everything they need,\u201d he haughtily declared. Because even a poor man could accede to the most distinguished offices, his reputation was far more important to Fabricius than Pyrrhus\u2019 money.Taken together, Watts shows, these two speeches encapsulate the foundations of Rome\u2019s remarkable success. At its inception, \u201cthe republic provided a legal and political structure that channeled the individual energies of Romans in ways that benefited the entire Roman commonwealth.\u201d But over the following centuries, that foundation slowly weakened, and then rapidly collapsed.Since the founding fathers explicitly modeled the United States on the Roman Republic, a study that investigates the circumstances of its demise promises to hold considerable relevance for our own times. As Watts puts the point, the principal purpose of his book is to allow \u201creaders to better appreciate the serious problems that result both from politicians who breach a republic\u2019s political norms and from citizens who choose not to punish them for doing so.\u201d Does he accomplish that ambitious goal?The transformation of Rome\u2019s army compounded the challenge of growing inequality. In the early days of the republic, soldiers thought of their participation in military service as a civic duty. Commanders hoped to win great honors and perhaps to attain higher office. But by the late second century B.C., the army had essentially been privatized. Commanders knew that the plunder of new lands could garner them vast riches. Their soldiers signed up for the ride in the hope of gaining a generous allotment of land on which to start a farm. With soldiers increasingly loyal to their commanders, and commanders doing whatever it took to maximize the prospect of private profit, the Senate was no longer in charge.It took a long time for these tensions to build. But once they reached a critical point, Rome\u2019s descent into chaos and dysfunction was astonishingly swift.During the century and a half between the days of Pyrrhus and the rise of Tiberius Gracchus, there had not been a single outbreak of large-scale political violence. Then Tiberius pushed through land reforms in defiance of the Senate\u2019s veto. In the ensuing fracas, he and hundreds of his followers were murdered. The taboo on naked power politics had been broken, never to recover.Over the next years, it quickly became normal for populist politicians to set aside longstanding norms to accomplish their goals; for military commanders to bend the Senate to their will by threatening to occupy Rome; and for rival generals to wage war on one another. \u201cWithin a generation of the first political assassination in Rome, politicians had begun to arm their supporters and use the threat of violence to influence the votes of assemblies and the election of magistrates. Within two generations, Rome fell into civil war.\u201dIf we are to avoid the fate that ultimately befell Rome, Watts cautions, it is \u201cvital for all of us to understand how Rome\u2019s republic worked, what it achieved and why, after nearly five centuries, its citizens ultimately turned away from it and toward the autocracy of Augustus.\u201d In a sense, the book fails in this ambition. Especially as it progresses, Watts, a professor of history at the University of California at San Diego, abandons a careful analysis of the larger trends for a blow-by-blow account of the many conflicts that divided the republic in the last century of its existence. At times, this endless onslaught of calamities \u2014 a new violation of some traditional norm, the latest commander to threaten an invasion of Rome, one more shift in the ever-fragile constellation of power \u2014 starts to numb the mind.But in another sense, the sheer repetitiveness of the calamities that befell Rome only serves to underline the book\u2019s most urgent message. If we were to make explicit the implicit analogy that runs all the way through \u201cMortal Republic,\u201d we would most likely cast Donald Trump as a farcical reincarnation of Tiberius Gracchus. Like the original populist, Trump was propelled to power by the all-too-real failures of a political system that is unable to curb growing inequality or to mobilize its most eminent citizens around a shared conception of the common good. And like Gracchus, Trump believes that, because he is acting in the name of the dispossessed, he is perfectly justified in shredding the Republic\u2019s traditions.If that analogy is right, the good news is that Trump will, once the history of our own mortal Republic is written, turn out to be a relatively minor character. Far from single-handedly destroying our political system, he is the transitional figure whose election demonstrates the extent to which the failings of our democracy are finally starting to take their toll.The bad news is that the coming decades are unlikely to afford us many moments of calm and tranquillity. For though four generations stand between Tiberius Gracchus\u2019 violent death and Augustus\u2019 rapid ascent to plenipotentiary power, the intervening century was one of virtually incessant fear and chaos. If the central analogy that animates \u201cMortal Republic\u201d is correct, the current challenge to America\u2019s political system is likely to persist long after its present occupant has left the White House.Yascha Mounk is a lecturer at Harvard University and the author of \u201cThe People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, convinced the town \u201chasn\u2019t kept up,\u201d he has plans to reshape it.Mr. Coulombe, a 65-year-old liquor magnate, has spent the last 10 years pouring his fortune into upgrading the Boothbay region long known as a summer vacation spot where tourists wander footbridges, take boat tours and eat lobster rolls. His aim, he said, is to bolster tourism as a way of \u201chelping everyone in the community.\u201dSome residents are skeptical.But Mr. Coulombe\u2019s latest proposal, aimed at the heart of this close-knit harbor town, may prove to be the most divisive yet. At his urging, town officials are considering opening up the east side of the harbor, restricted for the past 30 years to traditional maritime uses like lobster fishing, to allow new tourist-oriented development.A planning board proposal under review would maintain the restrictions on the small portion of the harbor with piers used by lobster fishermen, buying stations and a bait supplier. But the other three-quarters of the so-called Maritime District, which is lined with modest wooden inns, which were built before the restrictions were in place. The district would be rezoned, making it possible for them to be redeveloped.\u201cThe east side should look authentic as a working waterfront \u2014 it\u2019s not supposed to look like a resort,\u201d said Ken Fitch, a spokesman for Friends of the Harbor, a group opposed to the proposal. \u201cThe sheer volume of what that man wants to do is what scares us.\u201dBut supporters of the rezoning point out that the harbor\u2019s existing fishing operations have not expanded since the district was established in the 1980s. And given the town\u2019s aging population and efforts to expand the economic base and attract young families, many say it would be foolish to forgo the tens of millions in investment that Mr. Coulombe is dangling.\u201cIt feels like it could be a missed opportunity,\u201d said Martha Gleason, a co-owner with her husband of Gleason Fine Art, a gallery situated among the dense array of shops and cafes on the west side of the harbor. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely thrilled with what he\u2019s done so far. He does very classy work.\u201d\u201cThe question Maine is dealing with is, how do we balance tourism and the working waterfront?\u201d said Monique Coombs, the director of marine programs at the Maine Coast Fishermen\u2019s Association. \u201cYes, people think the fishing industry is declining. But we shouldn\u2019t assume there aren\u2019t opportunities there. Seafood is crucial to the Maine economy, and it is a draw for tourism.\u201dOysters now grow in dozens of pillowlike floats on a two-acre section of water along the company\u2019s quarter-mile waterfront. Lobster fishing boats unload their catches on a stone pier that dates to the 1930s. Various small buildings house a bait storage room, a processing facility and a new 16,000-gallon lobster tank, with temperature controls to keep the crustaceans in hibernation until they are sold.Mr. Marsh said he was looking to further diversify through partnerships with entrepreneurs interested in mussel and kelp farming.\u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to protect something like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving people the ability to stay in place and hold on to what they\u2019ve got.\u201dIn Boothbay Harbor, a town of roughly 2,000 year-round residents, the issue is so fraught that emotions frequently spill out in public. Mr. Coulombe regularly jousts with his critics online, and he acknowledged saying some things he regretted.\u201cPaul can be brash and speaks his mind fairly readily, and I think that turns some people off,\u201d said Chuck Fuller, a supporter who owns a lobster bait and marine construction business on the east side. \u201cOn the flip side of that, most of the time we know what his opinion is. He\u2019s upfront.\u201dA native of Lewiston, a town about 50 miles from Boothbay, Mr. Coulombe sold his family-run White Rock Distilleries to the parent company of Jim Beam for $605 million in 2012. He lives in a $30 million mansion he built in nearby Southport. He estimates he has invested roughly $100 million into redevelopment efforts in the Boothbay region.Mr. Coulombe said he too valued preservation of Boothbay Harbor\u2019s existing working waterfront. But he believes it is past time for the hotels there to be upgraded. He has already begun buying up property in the district, turning the former Rocktide Inn into a hotel extension of his country club, the Boothbay Harbor Oceanside Golf Resort.

{"Headline": "For American Workers, 4 Key Retirement Issues to Watch in 2019", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringIt\u2019s going to be a busy year in Washington and state capitals for policymakers working to improve the retirement security of millions of Americans.New retirement savings options will be on the horizon in 2019 for millions who don\u2019t have access to workplace 401(k) plans. Meanwhile, Congress will try to agree on a plan to avert sharp cuts in traditional pension benefits for over a million workers. The long-running battle over regulation to protect investors will enter a new phase when the Securities and Exchange Commission issues new \u201cbest interest\u201d rules governing investment advice. And the House of Representatives could take up legislation to expand Social Security.Here is a look at crucial retirement policy topics to watch in the year ahead.Workplace retirement savings plans have proved to be the most effective route to help savers, mainly thanks to features like automatic enrollment, regular payroll deductions and matching employer contributions. Yet one-third of private sector workers had no access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan in 2016, according to the Government Accountability Office. The coverage shortfall is greatest among low-income workers and people working for small companies.But 2019 will be a turning point in covering more workers.Some states are starting programs that automatically sign up workers who don\u2019t have workplace 401(k) accounts or Individual Retirement Accounts. Over time, employers in many of these states will be required to set up automatic payroll deductions for these accounts and enroll workers, although they will not need to make matching contributions.The states that have approved plans could eventually extend coverage to 15 million workers, AARP estimates.\u201cThe goal is to make sure we stem the tide of the retirement crisis and help Californians realize the dream of a golden retirement,\u201d says John Chiang, the state treasurer. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy task, because the current marketplace has failed.\u201dMeanwhile, Congress will take up legislation next year that would make it easier for employers to band together to join a single 401(k) plan that they can offer to employees. These \u201copen multiple-employer plans\u201d would be offered by private plan custodians; the aim would be to offer employers low-cost plans featuring simplified paperwork.How quickly would these multiple-employer plans be offered if legislation were approved? \u201cPlan providers will need a year to gear up and get infrastructure in place,\u201d predicts Kathleen Coulombe, a vice president at the American Council of Life Insurers, which supports the legislation. \u201cI\u2019d expect to see plans launch starting in 2020.\u201dWhich approach is better \u2014 auto-I.R.A. or a multiple-employer plan? \u201cThey are both good ideas, and there\u2019s no inconsistency between them,\u201d says Mark Iwry, one of the architects of a national auto-I.R.A. program that he worked to enact during his time as a senior adviser to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. The national auto-I.R.A. would require employers without their own retirement plan to enroll workers.Mr. Iwry, currently a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, sees the two ideas as complementary, with auto-I.R.A.s serving as starter accounts likely to lead many more employers to adopt 401(k) plans.But Mr. Iwry said the market already had achieved much of the economy of scale and reduced costs promised by multiple-employer plans, with companies sponsoring identical plans using a single low-cost investment lineup and common record-keeping and administration. \u201cThe proposed open M.E.P. legislation is desirable and long overdue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in their potential to expand coverage, open M.E.P.s don\u2019t hold a candle to auto-I.R.A.s.\u201d That is because auto-I.R.A. programs achieve big gains in plan participation through mandatory employer participation features and automatic worker enrollment; with open M.E.P.s, takeup will depend on whether financial service providers market them aggressively, and employers\u2019 appetite to sign up. What\u2019s more, not all of these multiple-employer plans will use auto-enrollment.Mr. Iwry still holds out legislative hope for a national auto-I.R.A. program, noting that the bill\u2019s longtime lead Democratic sponsor, Representative Richard Neal, of Massachusetts, is about to become chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means committee.A special congressional committee is racing to head off an insolvency crisis, one that could lead to sharp cuts in pension benefits for over a million workers and retirees, and sink a federally sponsored insurance backup program.The problem centers on so-called multiemployer pension plans. Over 10 million workers and retirees are covered by 1,400 of these plans, which are created under collective bargaining agreements and jointly funded by groups of employers in industries like construction, trucking, mining and food retailing.Plans covering 1.3 million workers and retirees are severely underfunded \u2014 the result of stock market crashes in 2001 and 2008-9, and industrial decline that led to consolidation and sliding employment. Cheiron Inc., an actuarial consulting firm, recently forecast that 121 plans might fail within 20 years. Plans are underfunded by a total of $48.9 billion, the firm estimated. Three plans alone account for 65 percent of all unfunded liabilities, led by the Teamsters\u2019 Central States fund, which is falling short by $22.9 billion.Meanwhile, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federally sponsored insurance backstop for defunct plans, projects that its multiemployer insurance program will run out of money by the end of the 2025 fiscal year, absent reforms.Congress approved an overhaul in 2014, the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, but the legislation has faced strong resistance from retiree organizations, consumer groups and some labor unions.This year, the special congressional committee appointed to create a replacement for the pension reform act missed an end-of-November deadline to issue its recommendation. But a draft proposal raises the guaranteed minimum benefits paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation if a plan fails. It also would inject federal funds into the agency \u2014 perhaps $3 billion annually \u2014 to expand its partition program, which allows it to take on benefit payments to so-called orphans \u2014 people who earned benefits from employers who have dropped out of plans, often because they have gone out of business.\u201cIt would rely less on cutting benefits, and more on raising money from existing pension plans and taxpayers,\u201d says Joshua Gotbaum, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and a former director of the federal pension backstop.The sticking points in the discussion have included the assumptions used to measure plan liabilities, and how much respective stakeholders, including the government, should contribute to maintain a viable multiemployer system, says Karen Friedman, executive vice president of the Pension Rights Center. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping they can find a fair, comprehensive solution that can save these plans, the P.B.G.C. and protect workers and retirees.\u201dThe long-running battle to require brokers to look out for the best interests of clients will continue in 2019.The S.E.C. is moving toward adoption of a \u201cregulation best interest\u201d standard following the end this year of an advice standard created by the Obama-era Labor Department. That regulation, which required advice on retirement accounts to meet fiduciary standards, was opposed by the financial services and insurance industries, which argued that it made advising smaller investors too costly.The S.E.C. rule would require brokers to put their customers\u2019 financial interests ahead of their own, but it does not require them to act as fiduciaries. The rule also would require disclosures to clients of any potential conflicts, and it reaffirms existing higher standards for registered investment advisers.The draft regulation has come under fire from consumer advocates who note that it does not clearly define the term \u201cbest interest,\u201d and that the proposed disclosure forms are confusing for investors.\u201cThere is a real need to simplify the disclosure forms so that they communicate effectively to investors the information that they actually need to make decisions,\u201d says Cristina Martin Firvida, vice president for financial security and consumer affairs at AARP.Proposals to overhaul Social Security by progressives are likely to get a hearing in the new Democratic-controlled House.Most of the winning Democratic candidates who flipped 40 congressional seats in the midterm elections ran on expanding Social Security benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a progressive advocacy group. And the likely new chairman of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, Representative John B. Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, is the author of expansion legislation that has more than 170 co-sponsors in the House, including Mr. Neal, the incoming Ways and Means chairman.\u201cThe Larson bill certainly will get a hearing, and there\u2019s a substantial chance it will move out of committee and even get a vote on the House floor,\u201d Ms. Altman predicted. \u201cThat will really elevate the issue and put a spotlight on the Senate and the White House.\u201dMr. Larson\u2019s bill includes a 2 percent across-the-board increase in benefits, a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment and a higher minimum benefit for low-income workers. The bill would pay for the expansion by lifting the cap on wages subject to taxation and a gradual phase-in of a higher payroll tax rate.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption on this article misstated the day of a news conference at Loyola Law School.

{"Headline": "In the United States, His Problem Wasn\u2019t the Taliban. It Was Everything Else.", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarStrolling the aisles at a Kohl\u2019s department store near his home in Rochester, N.Y., Azizullah Sharifi spoke Pashto with his daughter Marwah as they picked through shorts, T-shirts and flip-flops for the summer. The father and daughter stopped to check their shopping cart, when a woman next to them muttered, \u201cSpeak [expletive] English\u201d in a low growl. Once Sharifi realized she was talking to him, he quickly pushed his cart away without responding. But he wasn\u2019t fast enough. Though she was only 7, Marwah recognized that the woman had \u201csaid something really bad.\u201d \u201cJust ignore her,\u201d Sharifi told her. It was a drastic shift from the way he was treated in his home country of Afghanistan, where American service members, with whom he had worked closely, treated him with respect. Much of his experience in the United States has been positive, but sometimes, \u201cyou feel Islamophobia, the racism \u2014 not all people, but you can feel it,\u201d Sharifi said.Sharifi, who worked as an interpreter for American forces in Afghanistan between 2004 and 2014, is one of more than 48,600 Afghans who have been admitted to the United States through the Special Immigrant Visa (S.I.V.) program. Recognizing the incredible risks taken by Afghans like Sharifi who were helping the American-led coalition during the war, Congress passed a bill in 2009 to provide special visas to interpreters and civilians who had worked for at least one year \u2014 later changed to two years \u2014 for the American government and who could prove there were imminent threats on their lives. Similar legislation was enacted for Iraqi interpreters in 2008.More than 17,000 Afghans who have applied for the S.I.V. over the years are still waiting for an answer from the State Department as their applications crawl through the grueling vetting process. About 1,240 applicants were rejected in the first three quarters of this fiscal year, mostly for insufficient proof of employment by an American company or failure to provide evidence of the\u201cfaithful and valuable service\u201d to American forces that the special visa requires. When applicants appeal, their application is moved to the bottom of the list, but half the initial denials are overturned. For those who receive a visa, the move to the United States raises a new set of problems, like finding employment, housing and a community that makes them feel welcome. While the State Department\u2019s United States Refugee Admissions Program gives refugees funding for the first 90 days after arrival, people have to rely on their own resourcefulness and on nonprofit organizations for help acclimating to a new country and culture that\u2019s vastly different from the one they fled.It took years for the State Department to approve the visa application that would grant Sharifi, his wife, Khaledah Akrami, and their three children legal residence in the United States. When they finally arrived in Sacramento, Calif., in 2014, Sharifi thought the hardest part was over, but American employers would not recognize his high school diploma or his college credits from a school in Uzbekistan. He also had to rely on public transportation and friends to get around because he did not have a driver\u2019s license. Every task of daily life raised new questions about how it was done in the United States. A few weeks after they arrived, Akrami developed a cold and fever. Sharifi knew he was supposed to call 911 if he had an emergency, but he didn\u2019t know what would happen after the call. \u201cWill they send an ambulance, and soon you\u2019ll get all the bills?\u201d he said. \u201cSmall difficulties become big.\u201d He decided against calling 911, choosing instead to walk to a hospital only to find that their insurance was not accepted and the cost of care was too high. They eventually found a pharmacist who offered an over-the-counter remedy. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about finding an apartment and applying for social services and getting a green card,\u201d Sharifi said. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning to navigate the culture, the health care system, especially when you have children.\u201dSoon he was making $300 a month \u2014 and later as much as $800 a month \u2014 working for a Defense Department contractor called Mission Essential Personnel, a company that supplies interpreters and security services to the United States Army. He traveled with military convoys and worked on Camp Black Horse and Camp Alamo in Kabul. \u201cEverything was good,\u201d Sharifi said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any life-threatening problems. I was going out, walking into the mountains. It was not uncommon to work for a foreign military.\u201d Afghans and foreigners alike believed that effective democratic governance and stability was not far off.Then in 2010, Sharifi received a warning from the Taliban. They threatened to take his property and kill him if he continued working for the Americans. Coming after several years of Taliban resurgence throughout Afghanistan, the threat alarmed Sharifi, and he decided he needed to get out of the country. He gathered reference letters from his employers, scanned copies of his security badges, outlined the threats that he and his family faced because of his job and submitted his application for the S.I.V. program. What followed were numerous emails from the State Department, in response to which Sharifi would have to track down and submit whatever documentation was missing and then wait for the application to be reviewed again.Four years later, his visa was finally approved. Sharifi paid $2,500 for his wife and children to receive the required physicals, and they left Afghanistan for Sacramento. World Relief, a resettlement organization funded mostly by government contracts that works with local churches to provide refugee and immigration services, helped the Sharifis apply for Social Security cards, green cards, Medicaid, welfare and short-term housing. But Sharifi didn\u2019t want to rely on government handouts. \u201cI was not feeling good,\u201d he said. \u201cI was praying to God to help me get rid of this assistance.\u201d Akrami, who did not speak English, quickly became depressed. She felt unsafe and worried about their family back in Afghanistan. Even going to the grocery store, where there was more variety than she had ever seen and where most of the brands were unrecognizable to her, was overwhelming. Akrami talked about returning to Afghanistan with the children, but Sharifi persuaded her to stay. After two months, they packed up the few belongings they had in Sacramento and weathered the cross-country train ride to Rochester, where cousins of Akrami\u2019s had resettled within a larger community of Afghans.While the move to Rochester helped the Sharifis feel more connected to a community that resembled home, others who settled in the area with little money struggled to adjust. Fazel Haidari, 28, came to Rochester from Afghanistan with his wife, Zufnoon, and their 6-month-old son in 2015. He had few local connections and found no employer that would recognize his business-administration degree from Kabul University. After about six months, the financial aid they were receiving from government programs was about to end, and Haidari had little in the way of prospects. It was only after he found No One Left Behind, a nonprofit organization mostly run by veterans and volunteers that helps Iraqi and Afghan interpreters settle in the United States, that he was able to find housing in an apartment complex where other Afghans lived. Ellen Smith, the Rochester chapter president of the organization, is something of a mother figure to the Afghan families settling into Rochester and nearby suburbs. In her basement, a makeshift commissary is stocked from floor to ceiling with donated dishware, towels, blankets and furniture that she gives to needy S.I.V. holders in Rochester. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let anyone fall through the cracks,\u201d Smith said.\u201cIn Afghanistan, we had a really big home, but nothing here,\u201d Haidari said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting over, one by one.\u201d After getting him into an apartment, the group helped Haidari enroll in a vocational school to become an electrician, while he worked overnight as a machine operator at a factory for $12 an hour. He didn\u2019t have any background to help him get a start as an electrician. \u201cThe only thing I had done was changed a couple of light bulbs,\u201d Haidari said. He\u2019s now an apprentice making $16 an hour. Though two of his younger brothers have also relocated to Rochester, his parents and four of his siblings are still back in Afghanistan. The eldest is stuck in the S.I.V. application backlog. \u201cI feel really bad \u2014 he\u2019s been working for the U.S. since 2007,\u201d Haidari said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. He should be here before me.\u201dAlong with job and educational placement, No One Left Behind provides families with first-month\u2019s rent and a security deposit, which typically requires a co-signer: usually one of the more than 250 volunteers Smith has enlisted in Rochester. But finding employers willing to hire Afghans has proved difficult for Smith and those under her care. One potential employer interviewed several Afghans, some of whom had worked with the Army Corps of Engineers as civil engineers in Afghanistan. But the employer never made any offers. \u201cThey were concerned about \u2018cultural differences,\u2019 \u201d Smith said, her voice rising. \u201cThese guys have been hanging out with soldiers. What are you worried about? That they don\u2019t eat pork? That they pray five times a day?\u201d According to Smith, the company argued that hiring Afghans onto a staff full of military veterans \u201cwould be like asking an American World War II soldier to work alongside a Japanese soldier,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible analogy.\u201dFor Sharifi, the late nights at a Wegmans grocery store distribution warehouse and days spent on the phone working as a certified interpreter are starting to pay off. He recently bought his first house, a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom home in a quiet suburb south of Rochester. Even if he is invited out to dinner or drinks or to play pool in Rochester, Sharifi prefers the dim light of his sparsely decorated living room and a quiet dinner of beef korma with yellow rice with his family, in the house he has worked hard to provide for his wife and children. After the years of danger he faced working as an interpreter in Afghanistan, he said, \u201cright now I just want to stay home.\u201dNext door, a house displays a Gold Star flag, typically used to signal that a family member died in combat. People in the neighborhood like Lani Bauer, who moved to the neighborhood in 1973, said that Sharifi and his family have brought a sense of fellowship and camaraderie to the neighborhood that it was missing. They met when Sharifi and his son offered to help Bauer rake the leaves piling up in her yard. \u201cHe made a tremendous impression, a very great impression,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cHe seemed naturally caring and concerned. That\u2019s something you don\u2019t encounter often. We\u2019re supposed to be more open and welcoming. Isn\u2019t that what the U.S. stands for? Or, at least, that\u2019s what it stood for.\u201dKenneth R. Rosen is a senior news assistant at The New York Times.

The majority of people who fall into these categories are nonwhite.\u201cIt is bad enough that the poor are already so stigmatized, and now we are stigmatizing them even further for the way they consume goods and services,\u201d Mr. Torres told me. \u201cI talk a lot about effective discrimination. But this amounts to intentional discrimination, because these businesses that don\u2019t accept cash know exactly who they are keeping out.\u201dProspect Street in Brooklyn, the heart of a recently manufactured neighborhood known as Dumbo Heights, is as good a place as any to observe the pretenses and contradictions of contemporary capitalism. A stretch of formerly industrial buildings, owned in part by the Kushner Companies, houses the corporate offices of Etsy, the tech-enabled craft empire, and an outpost of WeWork, where the kegs are flowing and the toil of office life has been reimagined as a party.WorkOf, a store absorbing the surrounding mood and showcasing handmade furniture and vases and key chains and lighting fixtures, all from independent designers does not, it turns out, extend its branding in intimacy to accepting cash.Neither does Bluestone Lane, with its live performances and hygge feel and turmeric sweet-potato-hummus toast, or the place next door, Mulberry & Vine, another health-food franchise. Here the motto is \u201cLive Dirty, Eat Clean,\u2019\u2019 which seems to sum up rather efficiently the prevailing ethics of the current moment: \u201cPlunder and pillage all you want, just stay away from trans fats and farm-raised salmon.\u201dWhen I visited the outpost in Brooklyn the other day, everyone behind the counter was black and everyone in front of it was white. But presumably, eating there would help make the world a better place because my fork would be recycled and the charred avocado I had eaten was dressed with non-GMO canola oil.The increasing movement away from cash, which businesses often justify as a defense against crime, even if urban crime rates in many cities are at historic lows, comes with other consequences, many of them negative.It is easier to spend more than you intend when you are paying for your lunch with a credit card, to get the fizzy grapefruit drink when, really, you\u2019d be fine with water. When cash is renounced you carry less of it, or maybe even none of it. And so you are not as prone to certain spontaneous acts of generosity \u2014 to put a few dollars in a tip jar where workers are underpaid or give money to a homeless person on a cold night on your way home from work.Forcing people to use credit cards also forces them into compromising their privacy while paradoxically making everyday exchanges feel more impersonal. Businesses see this as efficiency, and efficiency is profit. And as the recent revelations from Facebook suggest, what else matters?Advertisement"}

Second, the United States and the world will continue to rely on affordable and abundant fossil fuels, including coal, to power our economies for decades to come. And third, innovation, not new taxes or punishing global agreements, is the ultimate solution.People across the world are rejecting the idea that carbon taxes and raising the cost of energy is the answer to lowering emissions. In France, the government just suspended a planned fuel tax increase after some of its citizens took to the streets in protest. And in the United States, the results of November elections showed that these plans and other government interventions are just as unpopular. Voters in Washington State rejected the creation of an expensive tax on carbon emissions. In Colorado, a ballot measure to severely restrict drilling was defeated. And in Arizona, voters rejected a mandate to make the state\u2019s utilities much more dependent on renewable energy by 2030 \u2014 regardless of the cost to consumers. All three of these states elected liberal Democrats to Congress on election night. The nation is leading the way not because of punishing regulations, restrictive laws or carbon taxes but because of innovation and advanced technology, especially in the energy sector.Making energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs to consumers will be accomplished through investment, invention and innovation.As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I am working across party lines to support the development of new technologies that will further decrease America\u2019s carbon emissions.Washington needs to make it simpler for innovators who are building state-of-the-art nuclear reactors. These advancements in nuclear energy will create jobs, lower costs and contribute to America\u2019s energy security without additional carbon emissions.The legislation supports efforts to find profitable uses for the captured carbon dioxide. The legislation will also simplify the process for building carbon dioxide pipelines, so that we can safely move the gas to where it is needed.In addition to being used for enhanced oil recovery, carbon has the potential to be repurposed in building materials, medical supplies and manufactured goods.Citizens around the world will continue to reject climate policies that cost them personally, either by direct taxation or by undermining the competitiveness of their own economies.

Canada", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 The United States and China are embroiled in a tense trade war that seemed headed for escalation after the United States accused a top Chinese technology executive of fraud.Who has China lashed out at?Canada.Canada is in a tricky spot, boxed in the middle between its two largest trading partners, and worried about having to choose sides.After feeling burned by negotiations to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, the country is trying to strengthen trade relations with China in part to lessen dependence on economic ties to the United States. And many Canadians are wary of what they consider President Trump\u2019s capricious view of Canada.\u201cCanada is between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Wenran Jiang, a senior fellow at the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia.Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been chilly at best this year. Now, with the extradition process unfolding in the next months, Mr. Trudeau risks alienating China as well.As of Thursday evening there was no word on where China was holding the two seized Canadians, Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a writer and entrepreneur. Canadian consular officials have not been able to see them.Both face charges of undermining China\u2019s national security.China\u2019s announcement that it was holding them further complicated what has now become a crisis entangling all three countries. It arose from the bitter trade dispute between China and the United States and the American extradition case against Ms. Meng, who was arrested nearly two weeks ago.Ms. Meng, an affluent business celebrity in China, was freed on bail Tuesday by a court in Vancouver, where she was detained at the request of the United States on suspicion of violating American sanctions against Iran. When or whether she will be extradited remains unclear.Unswayed by the bail release, China has demanded that Canada free Ms. Meng immediately, seeing her arrest as a sneaky political ploy engineered by the Americans.Canada has said it was abiding by the laws governing an extradition agreement with the United States. But that reasoning has only further infuriated China.\u201cThe detention of Ms. Meng is not a mere judicial case, but a premeditated political action in which the United States wields its regime power to witch-hunt a Chinese high-tech company out of political consideration,\u201d Mr. Lu wrote. \u201cThe so-called long-arm jurisdiction of the United States, however, has no legal basis in international law.\u201dThose who accuse China of retaliatory detentions over Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, he suggested, \u201cshould first reflect on the actions of the Canadian side.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is both ignominious and hypocritical to revile China with double standards.\u201dMr. Jiang said that to many Chinese, it appeared \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 that Canada had been \u201cdoing the dirty work of the Americans, in what seems like a tactic for a U.S. trade war with China.\u201dA former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques, said the dispute would likely worsen and beckon an economic backlash by China, the world\u2019s second largest economy behind the United States.\u201cThey will start to increase pressure, canceling contracts maybe stopping shipments to China of key exports like canola, pork and beef,\u201d Mr. Saint-Jacques said.Mr. Trump implied he would intervene in her extradition if it would help land a trade deal with China. By tying the two, Mr. Trump may have inadvertently given Ms. Meng a way to avoid extradition by arguing that her arrest is a politically motivated case, in which the bar for extradition is far higher.\u201cHe\u2019s handed ammunition to Ms. Meng\u2019s lawyers,\u201d said Robert Currie, a professor of law with expertise on extradition at Dalhousie University in Halifax.Normally extraditions to the United States are not much of an issue in Canada and are mostly granted.But Ms. Meng\u2019s lawyers could argue that \u201cshe\u2019s being used as a proxy in a trade war, and we\u2019re not sure she will get a fair trial in the United States,\u201d Professor Currie said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about criminal law anymore. It\u2019s about politics.\u201dForeign Minister Chrystia Freeland of Canada clearly saw the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.\u201cOur extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice,\u201d she told a news conference on Wednesday.On Friday, Ms. Freeland is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, part of a previously scheduled dialogue that also includes the top defense officials from the two governments. The subject of Ms. Meng, the two Canadian detainees in China and pressure from the Chinese government will no doubt be discussed.The arrests in China have sent a chill through Canadians who work and travel regularly to the country. Mr. Saint Jacques said he has heard from a number professionals who have postponed business trips to China.\u201cThere is a rising fear that anyone else could be arrested at random, especially since we know China doesn\u2019t have the same definition of national security,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is pretty elastic and very broad.\u201dExtradition can take months in Canada.First a Canadian judge must be convinced of the case, and then the country\u2019s justice minister must approve. If either decision is appealed, the process can drag on for years, Mr. Currie said.But, in Ms. Meng\u2019s case, her lawyers could try to get the extradition order quashed preemptively based on political involvement, he said.\u201cAt the moment, both the president of the United States and the government of China seem to be interfering in our legal process,\u201d Mr. Currie said. The government\u2019s priority now, he said, is \u201cdefending Canada sovereignty and defending the Canadian legal process.\u201dWhat this may mean for the fate of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor is unclear at best. But it appears that China\u2019s security apparatus had been monitoring them for awhile.Mr. Kovrig, the former diplomat, was first secretary and vice consul at Canada\u2019s Beijing embassy from 2014 to 2016. More recently he had been working as a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization that moved its Beijing office to Hong Kong a few years ago amid tightened Chinese restrictions on such foreign organizations.He was regarded as a Sinophile, fluent in Mandarin, who had spent years investigating sensitive subjects such as the rights of Chinese ethnic minorities.Mr. Spavor saw himself as a sort of adventurer, writer, fixer, consultant and mediator between the West and reclusive North Korea.He helped to arrange a high-profile visit to North Korea in 2016 by Dennis Rodman, the basketball star, and boasted that he had even met Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s enigmatic leader, and had posed for a photograph with him, laughing and shaking hands, that he displayed on social media.Over the past year, Canada has been trying to start free trade talks with China in an effort to diversify an economy that is heavily reliant on the United States.But the new North American trade deal finally signed this past fall contained a contentious clause that many saw as a blatant push by the United States to block any free trade deal between China and Canada.The clause \u2014 which became widely known as the \u201cChina clause\u201d \u2014 laid out consequences for any member country for negotiating another trade deal with \u201cnonmarket economies.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of one of the Canadians detained by China.

{"Headline": "Pop in the Era of Distraction", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIt was a miniature tour de force, and enough to get Whack noticed by the Grammys (which, with typical befuddlement, nominated an earlier, more conventional track, \u201cMumbo Jumbo,\u201d for best music video). In its deceptively casual ambition and ruthless brevity, \u201cWhack World\u201d had a brilliant strategy for combat in the attention economy: keep things short and visual.Because, really, who has time for music?Listeners have work, or school, or both, and work in the internet era has grown infinitely expandable past 9 to 5. Because so much music now arrives via streaming, controlled on a screen, music also has to share attention with everything else on that screen: texts, social media, videos, alerts, news feeds, games, searches, maps, maybe one more check on that work email. Perhaps some single-minded listeners can set all those distractions aside, but they\u2019re a minority.Musicians face countless distractions of their own. The internet shattered the old album cycle of studio seclusion (for audio recording, and then for audio plus video) followed by promotion and touring. That prospect seemed freeing at first, since music could appear when inspiration struck, in any grouping or length.Along came the unintended consequences. Without the routine expectation of, say, a 12-song album every two or three years, the internet looms as a giant, insatiable maw, constantly demanding more content with less payback. YouTube and streaming have made each song a click rather than a purchase \u2014 and not even a click with autoplay, prefab playlists and algorithmic \u201cdiscovery\u201d (which actually pushes toward more of the same niche) guiding the way. In that endless stream, the idea that a song is a thought-out, carefully distilled utterance was bound to erode.Add another factor: social media. The initial promise was increased connectivity, a way to reach and respond to fans quickly and candidly: no gatekeepers, no filters. But for most pop aspirants, the result has been the end of creative seclusion. There\u2019s pressure to keep offering new material, musical and nonmusical, making the promotional cycle as endless as the internet workday. Maybe it\u2019s a song snippet or a glimpse of a video shoot. Or maybe it\u2019s a Twitter feud, a media-ready screed on Facebook or a fashion experiment on Instagram.For the 21st-century pop figure, songs are part of the mix, but so are romances and breakups, professional rivalries and reconciliations and countless rumors and memes that might be generated by the stars themselves, their fans or their trolls. Which in turn feed back into the next round of songs.Perhaps, in a culture that\u2019s constantly staring at a small screen, music was bound to be pushed aside. Songs that become massive streaming hits often sound unfinished, a looped riff and a vocal with a few tweaks. They fit into playlists that go by unobtrusively as background music; they are the ticktock of a soundtrack to everyday life. But songs can also have a higher profile. They can astound us with timbres never heard before and rhythms that kick and shake; they can tell us things we weren\u2019t sure we knew.And there is an audience for them. As the perceived value of recorded music has dropped nearly to zero, people have been willing to pay more and more each year for live concerts \u2014 where the music is the main thing in the room, where distractions are minimized. According to figures from the concert-promotion magazine Pollstar, for the top 100 tours of 2018 alone, gross revenues worldwide were $5.6 billion and average ticket prices rose from $84.63 in 2017 to $93.65 this year. In North America, the leap was even greater, from $78.91 to $92.50. Music can still be a central, overwhelming experience. We just have to put away the phones.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget the Carbon Tax for Now", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s politically toxic. There are other ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Gillis is a former New York Times environmental reporter and a contributing opinion writer.With a bit of calm upon us, now would be a good time for those of us concerned about climate change to engage in some introspection.These tax proposals all spring from basic economic theory. If people and companies are abusing a public good \u2014 in this case, by dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere \u2014 the answer, economists tell us, is to put a price on that activity that reflects the harm and encourages the development of more benign alternatives. Because most of the gases that cause climate change contain carbon in some form, the shorthand term for this policy is a \u201ccarbon price.\u201dYet the climate movement has, I fear, turned this potentially useful tool into a fetish. Discuss any aspect of the emissions problem these days and you will quickly hear somebody say, \u201cA price is the answer,\u201d or equivalent words. You hear that from the lips of politicians, from newspaper editorial boards, from utility executives and even from the heads of oil companies.Yet the put-a-price-on-it mantra is proving, in practice, to be a political failure. The Democrats could not get such a policy through Congress even when they had big majorities in the first two years of the Obama administration. Efforts to sell Republicans on the idea that this is the most market-friendly approach to the emissions problem have failed miserably, and will continue to fail.Proponents of carbon pricing like to point out that variants of the idea have spread all over the world, including to all the countries of the European Union and several American states and Canadian provinces. This is true, but when you look at how these systems have worked in practice, the picture grows murky. Invariably, huge political capital was spent to push through a carbon price too low to spur the rapid reductions in emissions that we need. Cases that are held up as demonstrating the purported success of carbon pricing, like a tax in British Columbia, mostly prove that if you slap on a modest carbon price, you will get a modest economic response. That people may get used to paying the low tax does not seem to make it much easier, in these jurisdictions, to raise the price to a level where it will really bite.The basic political problem is that the climate movement still does not have the strength of numbers to overcome entrenched opposition and put in the kind of stiff-and-rising taxes we would need to do the job. The oil companies may claim they want carbon pricing, but a subset of them spent more than $30 million in Washington State to kill the tax proposal there, twice as much money as the proponents were able to raise in support of their intelligent, carefully designed plan.Damn the oil companies if you will, but they persuaded 56 percent of the voters to take their side, carrying every county in the state but three. What that vote, and the French protests, tell us is that any proposal to raise energy prices is going to run into a buzz saw of opposition, including from working-class people who already feel like they are being mistreated.The political difficulties are not the only issue with carbon pricing, though. Even in theory, the idea is expected to work in some economic sectors but not in others, yet the fetishists hold it up as the magic answer to all problems.Here is more evidence that a carbon price is no magic bullet: One of the biggest climate problems is poorly constructed buildings that waste energy. A carbon price will not solve that problem, for the elementary reason that the people who put up the buildings, and have an economic motive to skimp on insulation and windows, are not the people who wind up paying the energy bills. The solution is building codes with strict energy requirements, vigorously enforced. Yet across huge swaths of the United States we still have weak building codes and lousy enforcement.To be clear, I am not arguing that a carbon price is unimportant. I would repeal none of the ones that have already passed, and I am in favor of passing new carbon prices everywhere that the politics seem aligned to make it possible. The activists in Washington State who pushed that proposal made a noble effort, and in a better world they would have won \u2014 not least because their plan was designed with the interests of the working class in mind.What I am saying is that we cannot argue for climate policy in a vacuum, ignoring the dangerous political moment we are in, when the anger of working people is being misappropriated by demagogues like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen in France. We would be wise not to ratchet up that anger, as President Emmanuel Macron of France belatedly acknowledged when he yanked the proposed hike in fuel taxes.Any carbon tax that is put on the table needs to be designed with that in mind. Maybe the opening promise should be that every penny of the money will go to relieve the burden on the working class, perhaps by cutting payroll taxes and putting more cash into its pockets the day the carbon tax goes into effect. Some countries might be able to push that through, even if the United States cannot.In the final analysis, the economic theory is right, of course: We do need a price on carbon. Some of our most important goals, such as cutting emissions from heavy industries like steel mills and cement plants, are likely to be impossible to achieve without it.Maybe we need to use those techniques to convince people that emissions really can be cut without wrecking the economy or further impoverishing the working class. Then, having proved that, we would pull the big tool out last.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of counties in Washington State that voted for a carbon tax referendum in November. It was three, not two.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei C.F.O. Is Arrested in Canada for Extradition to the U.S.", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A top executive and daughter of the founder of the Chinese tech giant Huawei was arrested on Saturday in Canada at the request of the United States, in a move likely to escalate tensions between the two countries at a delicate moment.Those talks now face an even steeper challenge. The aim will be for the United States to ease its tariffs; in exchange, China will be expected to lower trade barriers and further open its markets to American businesses.What\u2019s more, Ms. Meng\u2019s detention raises questions about the Trump administration\u2019s overall China strategy. Beijing is now likely to pressure Canada to release her and to press the United States to avoid a trial.\u201cThe arrest of a family member linked to Huawei\u2019s founder indicates how the tension between the two sides is rapidly escalating,\u201d said T.J. Pempel, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in East Asian politics and economy.Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican of Nebraska, linked the arrest to the American sanctions against Iran.Mr. Sasse said China had been \u201cworking to creatively undermine our national security interests, and the United States and our allies can\u2019t sit on the sidelines.\u201d He added that \u201cAmericans are grateful that our Canadian partners have arrested the chief financial officer of a giant Chinese telecom company for breaking U.S. sanctions against Iran.\u201dThis year, the Treasury and Commerce Department also asked the Justice Department to investigate Huawei for possibly violating economic sanctions against Iran, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation. Prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York took on the case, he said.In response, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Canada said in a statement that \u201cthe Chinese side firmly opposes and strongly protests over such kind of actions\u201d and urged the authorities \u201cto immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal freedom of Ms. Meng.\u201dHuawei said in a statement that Ms. Meng was arrested while changing planes in Canada and that she faced unspecified charges from the Eastern District of New York.\u201cThe company has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng,\u201d Huawei said, adding that it complies with all laws where it operates.Press representatives for the Justice Department and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in the Eastern District of New York declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond when asked if Mr. Trump was aware of the detention during his dinner with President Xi.Last month, the United States imposed sanctions aimed at reducing exports of Iranian oil to zero and crippling Iran\u2019s economy, though China is one of a handful of countries allowed to continue to buy oil for six months.The United States and China have also been locked in a struggle for high-tech supremacy, in a race that has increasingly taken on political undertones this year. While the United States has long claimed an advantage in the tech industry, China\u2019s internet companies, semiconductor makers and telecom equipment makers have all been growing rapidly, with many benefiting from government investment.Over the last decade, Huawei has grown into a powerhouse. Founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former People\u2019s Liberation Army engineer, it generated over $90 billion in revenue in 2017. Its equipment is the backbone of mobile networks around the world, and its smartphones are popular in Europe and China. That has made it a symbol of China\u2019s technological prowess and evolution from a country that makes cheap but unreliable gadgets to cutting-edge products that can rival the best of Silicon Valley and other Asian technology giants.Yet Huawei has long faced scrutiny as a security threat in the United States. Washington has expressed concern about using Huawei products, citing spying risk because of the company\u2019s close ties to the Chinese government.Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University, said the Huawei issue could be a cloud over coming talks. \u201cA fragile trade truce between China and the U.S. that was already foundering is now at greater risk of unraveling in relatively short order,\u201d Professor Prasad said.He added: \u201cIt is likely that China will have a measured response to this incident, although it will certainly add a sharper edge to the negotiations between the two sides.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco and Alan Rappeport from Washington.

Germany Is Broken.", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe erosion of the country\u2019s postwar order has created a populace open to messages and movements previously banished to the fringes.Mr. Nachtwey is the author of \u201cGermany\u2019s Hidden Crisis: Social Decline in the Heart of Europe.\u201d But Ms. Merkel, for all her power and influence, is just one politician. Germany\u2019s new political crisis runs much deeper. It stems from an economic system that has resulted in stagnant wages and insecure jobs. The erosion of Germany\u2019s postwar settlement \u2014 a strong welfare state, full-time employment, the opportunity to move up in the world \u2014 has created a populace open to messages and movements previously banished to the fringes.But the system has come at a cost. To maintain their competitive advantage in the global market, companies held down wages. Though for skilled workers in the export-oriented manufacturing sector pay remained stable, or even rose, less-skilled and low-wage workers suffered. This was made possible by decentralizing collective bargaining in the 1990s, which greatly weakened the power of unions.The other, more alarming reason underlying the country\u2019s political crisis \u2014 connected to, but distinct from, the economy \u2014 is the erosion of the German social model in recent decades. Though never as socially inclusive as the Scandinavian countries, postwar Germany had a comprehensive welfare state and robust labor unions, ensuring that citizens from the lower strata could achieve a decent living standard and a bit of wealth through full-time employment. In West Germany, where a secure job was the norm, full-time employment served as the foundation of social integration. The classic metaphor to describe this arrangement was coined by the sociologist Ulrich Beck in the 1980s: the \u201celevator effect.\u201d It implied that though social inequality still existed, everyone was rising in the same social \u201celevator,\u201d meaning that the gap between rich and poor wouldn\u2019t widen. Thirty years later, this society has vanished. Average real incomes declined for nearly 20 years beginning in 1993. Germany not only grew more unequal, but the standard of living for the lower strata stagnated or even fell. The lowest 40 percent of households have faced annual net income losses for around 25 years now, while the kinds of jobs that promised long-term stability dwindled.The number of precarious jobs like temp positions has exploded. At the height of postwar prosperity, almost 90 percent of jobs offered permanent employment with protections. By 2014, the figure had fallen to 68.3 percent. In other words, nearly one-third of all workers have insecure or short-term jobs. Moreover, a low-wage sector emerged employing millions of workers who can barely afford basic necessities and often need two jobs to get by.The German middle class is shrinking and no longer functions as a cohesive bloc. Though the upper-middle class still enjoys a high level of security, the lower middle contends with a very real risk of downward mobility. The relatively new phenomenon of a contracting \u2014 and internally divided \u2014 middle class has set off widespread anxiety.As Ms. Merkel\u2019s political career nears its end, and her possible replacements vie in Hamburg, it seems clear that the economic and social regime over which she presided is breaking down. Rising inequality has contributed to fragmentation in German society, fueling right-wing populism and fundamentally reordering the country\u2019s politics. What comes next is anyone\u2019s guess.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Sees in Brazil Continent-Size Profits and Problems", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExpansion south, into the nation where Amazon\u2019s namesake river ends, may prove a little harder.\u201cAmazon is still kind of irrelevant here,\u201d said Raul Prado, a vendor in the rural town of Guaipava, Brazil, who has relied on online retail sites to build up his business. Less than 1 percent of his sales are through Amazon.Brazil, home to more than 200 million people and the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, is in many ways an obvious target for Amazon\u2019s next major expansion. Google and Facebook have done well in Brazil, but their digital services \u2014 search, social media and advertising \u2014 do not have to overcome the hurdles of selling goods and making deliveries.As a retail behemoth wading into the market, Amazon has found itself playing catch-up with local rivals that know how to navigate Brazil\u2019s distinct challenges: a complicated tax structure, high import costs and the headache of moving goods across a continent-size country.\u201cBrazil is really kind of the natural next country in terms of sheer size,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who was the director of Amazon research at Gartner L2, a business intelligence and research company, but has since left. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity, and they are laying the groundwork for that today.\u201dNext year, he said, \u201cAmazon is going to be all about Brazil.\u201d His prediction came with a caveat: \u201cBut it\u2019s no small undertaking.\u201dAmazon has been present in Brazil\u2019s online retail market since 2012, but until recently it focused on selling books and its Kindle e-reader. A little over a year ago, Amazon made a splash when it expanded to let third-party brands sell electronics directly to consumers on its marketplace.Shares in local competitors tanked following the news, but they later rebounded when it became apparent that Amazon wasn\u2019t on the cusp of rolling out the services that have helped make it a market leader in the United States: first-party sales, by which brands supply Amazon with products and Amazon is the retailer; and its fulfillment service, which packages and ships products from the company\u2019s warehouses.\u201cAmazon arrived a little late to the game,\u201d said Marcel Motta, the Brazil director of the global research company Euromonitor International. Local, established companies, he said, \u201cknow how to get around the obstacles.\u201dMercadoLibre, for instance, the e-commerce leader that first began in Argentina and modeled itself after eBay, has been in Brazil for 19 years.\u201cWe helped build e-commerce in this region,\u201d said Cristina Farjallat, the head of MercadoLibre\u2019s third-party marketplace. \u201cWe have portfolios of sellers and portfolios of consumers that no one else has.\u201dShe said the company had lured more sellers to its site than any other online retailer by working with vendors to create the tools they need. MercadoLibre has a roster of 12 million vendors and its own fulfillment service, and is rolling out a payment service to bypass banks and credit cards.The company helped Mr. Prado, the vendor, turn a modest business venture \u2014 selling satellite antennas door-to-door in his remote village, where cellphone coverage was virtually nonexistent \u2014 into a national enterprise, with 20 employees.\u201cHonestly, I had no idea what I was doing when I started, but MercadoLibre is the first site people open when they go on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the brand name, their own payment plan, the logistics infrastructure and they even offer loans to sellers.\u201dMr. Prado, who created his company, Lojas Mineiras, in 2008, now offers his satellite and telephone products through nearly a dozen online retail sites. More than half of his sales are made through MercadoLibre.That doesn\u2019t mean it will stay that way.This year, Amazon broadened its catalog of products, offering sporting goods, fashion and home accessories, and signed up some major brands \u2014 but all remain independently sold and delivered.As of November, Amazon had just under 1 percent of the market share in Brazil, and was ranked 10th behind online retailers that offer both first- and third-party sales, according to Euromonitor\u2019s research. MercadoLibre had 19 percent of the market share.Experts say the window for Amazon to establish itself as a major player in Brazil is closing, which is why they expect the company to make a significant push in the next year. The question is whether it\u2019s too late.Mr. Smith said he had heard from industry sources, including investors, that Amazon had acquired a lease on a large warehouse outside S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s biggest city; advertised more than 100 jobs, many of them high level; and started negotiations to sell American brands on its Brazilian site. Amazon declined to comment.\u201cJeff Bezos has always harped on the idea that as Amazon saturates the U.S. market, he can go to emerging markets around the globe,\u201d Mr. Smith said, referring to the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s coming. Amazon wants to have boots on the ground in Brazil.\u201dAmazon appears to be moving cautiously in Brazil: It has not had a new platform up and working in the country in time for the Christmas shopping season.\u201cAmazon wants all the pieces of its ecosystem in place first,\u201d Mr. Smith said.One of the major pieces is transportation. Brazil is larger than the continental United States, but its roads are poorly maintained and often flood during rainy season, and the state postal service is widely seen as inefficient and unreliable.Magazine Luiza, one of Brazil\u2019s top e-commerce companies, which began as a mom-and-pop store selling televisions, has said it had overcome these problems by leveraging its pre-existing and growing presence: It has 900 stores across the country.Those stores, which now sell appliances, electronics and furniture to working-class Brazilians, are being converted into mini-distribution centers for Magazine Luiza, and help educate shoppers about the ease of online retail.\u201cPhysical stores are a fundamental part of our platform. We have succeeded in cutting delivery time and price,\u201d said Eduardo Galanternick, the executive director of e-commerce at Magazine Luiza. \u201cWhen you go deep into the interior of Brazil, Magazine Luiza is often the only department store around.\u201dFor example, thousands of rural families use the Magazine Luiza store in Graja\u00fa, a city in northern Brazil\u2019s soybean country, to order appliances and pick up online orders like diapers and brand-name cosmetics.In addition to difficult competitors and terrain, Amazon will face thickets of regulation. Brazil\u2019s convoluted tax structure can make delivering goods across state borders a costly affair, while high import tariffs have priced many foreign-made goods out of reach for all but the wealthiest Brazilians.Nonetheless, the potential for growth \u2014 Brazil represents just 1.1 percent of global sales in online retail \u2014 is expected to attract major investments from Amazon and other companies.Euromonitor forecasts that the Brazilian market will nearly double over the next five years to $35 billion, and some competitors will be squeezed out as obstacles to online retail are eliminated.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of Amazon conforming to our market,\u201d Mr. Prado said. \u201cRight now, they can\u2019t compete. But you never know. I\u2019ll keep offering my products on Amazon, just in case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "M.L.B. Prepares to Make Its Case to U.S. Government on Cuba Deal", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Major League Baseball announced on Wednesday that it had reached a historic agreement with the Cuban baseball federation to legalize the orderly signing of Cuban players, officials with the league knew the deal still required government approval.M.L.B. thought it had been operating on safe legal grounds when it made the agreement with Cuba, but it started receiving mixed signals from Washington toward the end of the process, especially in the 24 hours before the league\u2019s announcement.The United States government could still quash the deal, and some in the administration appear strongly opposed to it. But baseball officials remain optimistic, knowing they have a few arrows in their quiver, including a long list of American companies already doing business in Cuba.According to two baseball officials familiar with the issue, no one in the United States government has told the league to halt work on the deal, and M.L.B. and the players\u2019 union are operating as if it will pass government scrutiny. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly about the agreement.Under the plan, the Cuban baseball federation would release players to M.L.B. in return for a percentage of their contracts, an approach similar to the posting system used by Japanese and South Korean teams. The purpose of the agreement is to end the human trafficking of Cuban players to the United States and Canada.But the United States maintains a trade embargo with Cuba, and it has been strengthened in certain ways under the Trump administration. At least three branches of government oversee interactions with Cuba: the State Department, the Treasury Department and the National Security Council.The thrust of the new regulations is to prohibit entities from doing any business in Cuba that benefits its military and security services. Under Olympic rules, the Cuban baseball federation is required to be independent of the central government.M.L.B. plans to file a brief with the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control, asserting that the league was already granted legal approval to negotiate a deal to pay transfer fees to the Cuban federation for its players.M.L.B. obtained the license to do business with the Cuban baseball federation from the Office of Foreign Assets Control in September 2016, under the Obama administration. The league is relying on a national security presidential memorandum published on June 16, 2017, that outlined the Trump administration\u2019s new policy toward Cuba and new regulations governing American interests in the country. A fact sheet augmenting the memo said, \u201cThe forthcoming regulations will be prospective and thus will not affect existing contracts and licenses.\u201dOn Wednesday, a White House statement criticized baseball\u2019s agreement with Cuba, saying the administration would continue to restrict Cuba\u2019s ability to profit from American businesses.The Office of Foreign Assets Control could revoke M.L.B.\u2019s license to negotiate with the Cubans. If it does, it would signal a shift in policy that could affect many other companies doing business in Cuba.Companies including American Airlines, JetBlue, Delta and Western Union, plus several United States telecommunications companies and cruise ship lines, operate in Cuba, and the amount of money those entities pour into the Cuban economy dwarfs what M.L.B. would most likely pay in transfer fees to the baseball federation. Most of the players remaining in Cuba are not thought to be stars or top prospects who would garner huge salaries.But because M.L.B. has an especially high profile, its Cuban agreement may be subject to more government scrutiny.M.L.B. may continue to lobby members of the administration and Congress. The league has a legislative action committee that includes Yankees President Randy Levine, who has known President Trump for years and was recently said to be a candidate to replace John F. Kelly as the White House chief of staff. M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred could also seek to speak directly to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.If the agreement is scuttled, Cuban players who choose to defect probably would continue to be smuggled out. Several Cuban-born players in the major leagues have detailed harrowing tales of their escapes in dangerous sea voyages, and some say they continue to face extortion demands from smugglers even after arriving in the United States.\u201cTo this date, I am still harassed,\u201d first baseman Jose Abreu, who has played for the Chicago White Sox since 2014, said in a statement on Wednesday.While waiting for government approval, M.L.B. and the players\u2019 union still have work to do on the details of the pending agreement \u2014 including the specifics of how players would be posted and how scouts would be allowed to evaluate players.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Paris Accord Promised a Climate Solution. Here\u2019s Where We Are Now.", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld leaders struck an agreement three years ago in Paris to avert the worst effects of climate change, accepting not only that greenhouse gases were dangerously heating the planet, but also that every single country needed to do its part to curtail emissions.Now, emissions are rising in the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies. Other countries are backsliding on their commitments. The world as a whole is not meeting its targets under the Paris pact. As diplomats meet in Katowice, Poland, this week to bring the deal into effect, the world\u2019s 7.6 billion people face mounting risks from more severe and more frequent floods, droughts and wildfires. The Paris Agreement, it seems, is only as good as the willingness of national leaders to keep their word. \u201cWe have the ways,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said this week in Katowice. \u201cWhat we need is the political will to move forward.\u201d Champions of the accord point out that the diplomatic process is alive and well and that all of the world\u2019s 195 countries are still in the deal, including the United States, which can exit only at the end of 2020. The science is sharper than before on the dangers of unchecked emissions, and a great many countries, including the poorest, are pushing for more ambitious targets. \u201cTo waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change,\u201d Mr. Guterres said. \u201cIt would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.\u201d How did we get here? In August, an effort in Australia to transition away from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, resulted in the ouster of the prime minister. The man who succeeded him, Scott Morrison, endeared himself to the industry by bringing a lump of coal into Parliament.In November, Brazilians elected Jair Bolsonaro, who had pledged to promote agribusiness interests in the Amazon forest, the world\u2019s largest carbon sink. \u201cThe I.P.C.C. has sounded many alarms, and the world just keeps smashing the alarm and keeps on sleeping,\u201d said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the sidelines of the talks in Katowice. The world as a whole is not on track to meet the broad goal it set for itself in Paris: to keep the increase in global temperatures \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, over preindustrial levels. Under the agreement, each country put forward a voluntary pledge to curtail its own emissions. So far, those voluntary pledges have not been sufficient. New data made public in Poland this week by the group Climate Action Tracker estimated that current climate policies put the world on pace for somewhere around 3.3 degrees Celsius. \u201cIf we are serious about the Paris Agreement, we need to see different numbers,\u201d Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, told the delegates in Katowice this week. He noted that global emissions had risen in 2018.The negotiations in Katowice are aimed at setting out the rules by which countries will regularly update their emissions-reductions pledges and assess one another\u2019s progress. But even those technical discussions about the rule book have been bogged down by intense political differences.For its part, even though the United States has said it intends to withdraw from the Paris deal, the country has still sent a delegation to the negotiations. \u201cThese global energy and environmental policies will have an impact on U.S. interests, and we want to make sure we protect those so they\u2019re not hamstringing economic growth, innovation, entrepreneurship in the U.S.,\u201d said Wells Griffith, Mr. Trump\u2019s international energy and climate adviser.To be sure, the Paris pact, and the growing scientific clarity about global warming, has spurred countries and businesses to reorient themselves. From shipping to fast food to insurance, companies are setting their own targets to reduce carbon footprints. Solar and wind energy is expanding rapidly. Within the United States, a number of cities and states have dissented from the Trump administration\u2019s planned exit and created their own local plans to green their economies.Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief who led the Paris negotiations to their conclusion in December 2015, argued that the pact had set into motion a fundamental transformation of the global economy away from fossil fuels. It would be na\u00efve, she said, to not expect pushback.Brad Plumer contributed reporting from Katowice, Poland. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As OPEC Meets, Sizing Up Its Power and Its Politics", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 On Thursday, over 200 oil industry representatives, financial analysts and journalists are expected to crowd into a basement auditorium at the headquarters of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. It is a tricky time for OPEC at its twice-yearly gathering, and, more important, for the oil industry and consumers who depend on the world\u2019s most abundant energy source.Oil prices have been volatile in recent months. West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $76 a barrel in early October, the highest level since 2014, before plunging 35 percent to below $50 a barrel last Thursday, and then rising again Monday to about $53 a barrel.Adding to the uncertainty, any steps OPEC takes to curb production or raise prices may anger President Trump, who has tried to influence the oil markets in more obvious ways than any of his predecessors. Mr. Trump was ready with a tweet that landed midafternoon Wednesday in Vienna, putting the crowd on notice that he was watching.Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!As OPEC prepares to meet, here\u2019s a checklist to help understand its power and its political sway.The 15-member organization produces about 40 percent of the world\u2019s oil, and the group has a history of adjusting production to guide the market. OPEC is seen as a kind of oracle, especially when markets are jittery.It\u2019s a gathering where an official like Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, who speaks for around 12 percent of world oil output, can hold an informal news conference in a hotel lobby.\u201cAt the end of the day they are the closest thing to a regulator or central bank of the oil markets,\u201d said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank.OPEC is a different organization from what it was before a notorious meeting four years ago \u2014 Thanksgiving Day 2014 \u2014 when the Saudis declined to intervene in the markets and sent oil prices crashing. Since then, Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has coordinated with Russia, once a rival, and both have benefited.Other oil-producing countries are too small or hamstrung by political constraints to control the conversation. Over the last two years, the Saudis, the world\u2019s largest exporters, and Russia, which has been producing about 12 percent of world output, have called the shots.A high-five between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina last week was a sign of how closely their interests are aligned.\u201cWe call it OPEC, but it is a whole different system now,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm. \u201cThe managing committee is just two countries.\u201dLast summer, for instance, Saudi Arabia and Russia opened up the taps \u2014 in response to complaints about rising prices from the United States and other producers \u2014 leading to price declines and now-present worries about oversupply. The move brought complaints from other members, notably Iran, that the Saudis run OPEC for their own benefit.Most analysts say that the oil producers have little choice but to announce a substantial cut in production of at least one million barrels a day, or around 1 percent of world oil supplies. Otherwise, prices could slide into the $40-a-barrel range or lower, squeezing the oil-dependent economies of member countries.The purpose of cuts is to reduce supplies, to bolster prices and to change market psychology.\u201cThey need to cut because otherwise there will be a massive oversupply next year,\u201d said Ann-Louise Hittle, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a market research firm.Qatar, like Iran, appears to be fed up with Saudi Arabia\u2019s dominance of OPEC. The minister of state for energy affairs, Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, explained the decision on Monday by saying that the oil business was \u201ccontrolled by an organization managed by a country,\u201d apparently referring to the Saudis. Qatar will leave next year.Some analysts think that mutual interest in propping up prices may override discontent in the organization. \u201cMost of the countries want someone to do some cutting,\u201d said Bill Farren-Price, a director of RS Energy Group, a research firm. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want to do it themselves.\u201dIn the short term, yes. Mr. Falih has been traveling the world, lobbying for cuts. On Saturday he scored a big victory when Mr. Putin said at the G-20 meeting that Moscow was ready to again cooperate on market management. Predictably, oil prices jumped.Over the longer term, though, what happens in the markets depends on several questions \u2014 likely to be answered in the next few months. First of all, how much oil will the Russians, whose companies are enjoying their country\u2019s highest output ever, actually cut?Another uncertainty is how much Iranian oil the Trump administration\u2019s sanctions will take off the market. Sanctions went into effect in November but not as robustly as might have been expected. Washington\u2019s granting of waivers to some of Tehran\u2019s best customers, including China, Japan and India, led traders to suspect that the administration was not as committed to drying up Iranian crude sales as it earlier appeared.Iranian exports, though, now appear headed downward. Alex Booth, an analyst at Kpler, a firm in Paris that tracks tanker movements by satellite, said Tehran\u2019s exports fell to about one million barrels a day in November, compared with an average of 2.7 million a day from April to June.The surging global demand that had been helping to prop up prices is also beginning to look wobbly. Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy, has forecast that demand will grow by about 1.1 million barrels a day this year and next year. That\u2019s a 20 percent deceleration from 2017, linked to a slowing world economy.Analysts say there are doubts about how much room Saudi Arabia has to maneuver.Mr. Falih is believed to be guided by analyses of the oil markets and, perhaps more significant, by the demands of Prince Mohammed, who has been embroiled in a scandal over the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Turkey.Traders also worry that Saudi oil policy will be influenced by Washington. The Trump administration has pushed Riyadh, through presidential tweets and other channels, to keep production high to tamp down prices for American consumers and to buffer the new sanctions against Iran.\u201cThe Saudis are already finding that their ability to impact the markets through messaging and signals has diminished as a result of their challenging domestic politics,\u201d Mr. Farren-Price said.The most potent force in the oil markets may be the third global oil leader, a surprise player that won\u2019t be in the room on Thursday.Oil production from the United States has been stronger than even some of the best-informed people in the industry expected. For instance, Saudi Arabia and Russia together increased production by just over a combined million barrels a day from May to October. In that period the United States, benefiting from shale production, pumped up output by even more \u2014 1.2 million barrels a day \u2014 according to statistics from the International Energy Agency.By cutting output and raising prices, OPEC risks encouraging more investment by the shale oil producers in the United States and, in turn, losing market share.Adding to the intrigue before the meeting, the United States special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, met with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mr. Falih in Vienna on Wednesday, a State Department spokesman confirmed. There was no information on what was discussed.\u201cThe United States is the prime agent of transformation\u201d in the oil markets, analysts at IHS Markit wrote in October in a note to clients. \u201cIn turn, Russia and Saudi Arabia are the leaders of a global response team,\u201d reacting largely to shock waves set off by the United States.In other words, the United States is roiling the market \u2014 whether through booming domestic production or by curbing other countries\u2019 exports through sanctions or by leaning on the Saudis to influence their oil decisions.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

I know that you are a parent and hope that you can relate.In this complex world I do my best to shield my girls from the darkness, although I am honest with them about all issues to a degree appropriate for their age. We try to focus on the positive aspects of life, all the beauty, kindness and generosity.The mother of my girls is a sergeant in the Army and has just returned from a one-year deployment in Kuwait. She is an amazing woman, mother and soldier, so our daughters understand duty, sacrifice and patriotism.You are without question a success financially, as a businessman, as a celebrity and as a politician. So let us give credit where credit is due. Our economy seems to be in great shape, I have a good career, and I live a comfortable life relative to the majority of the world. I agree with some of your policies, disagree with some. I try to be a moderate and not an extremist in either political direction.As a proud citizen of this great country, I believe that I should be able to tell my daughters to look at the man who holds the highest office in our country as an example of a great American, but I am sorry to say I cannot!There are many ideas, values and systems that make our country great, and you are an example of the opportunities and the spoils that capitalism affords with hard work, and for this I credit you. It is in your actions and words in many other areas that I am averse to allowing my girls to look to you as a model citizen.The simple things I teach my children are honesty, kindness, love thy neighbor, the golden rule, freedom and justice for all, money does not buy happiness, help those less fortunate, do not manipulate others for selfish gains, do not bully or call others derogatory names, take credit for successes and own your mistakes and failures, and check your egos at the door.So it is with a heavy heart that I do not steer my daughters toward you as an example of these values, which ought to be the values of a great world leader, statesman or man of integrity.I do not hope for your failure as some do, because I want our country to thrive and be a beacon for others.

Summers, formerly President Barack Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, put the matter in a recent interview with Fox Business Network, \u201cThe ways in which the president spoke, I don\u2019t think any thoughtful economist would agree with.\u201d Then he made clear that he mostly agreed: \u201cI do think that there are more risks of overtightening than there are of undertightening right now.\u201dThe Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the fifth consecutive quarter. The unemployment rate sits at the lowest level in half a century, wages are rising and Fed officials say they are raising rates to make sure price inflation remains under control.The Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, and other officials have emphasized that further rate increases would depend on the strength of the economy. In September, most Fed officials predicted it would raise rates at least three times in 2019. But the Fed\u2019s plans are increasingly uncertain because the economic outlook is increasingly uncertain. The Fed will publish a new set of policy projections on Wednesday.Some critics say the Fed is raising rates unnecessarily. While wages are rising more strongly, they argue that there is no evidence wage growth is causing price inflation.Inflation is likely to fall short of the Fed\u2019s preferred 2 percent annual pace for the seventh straight year.Rising wages can lead to inflation, if companies find the money by increasing prices. But companies also can find money by curtailing profits, giving workers a larger share of the pie without increasing inflation.\u201cA central bank intending to lean against inflationary winds could inadvertently end up resisting secular forces toward income equality,\u201d wrote Mr. Faust, then an economist at Johns Hopkins University. The paper, written with Eric Leeper, was presented at the Fed\u2019s annual Jackson Hole symposium.There are various ways to measure the share of economic output claimed by workers, but all show the same basic pattern: A sharp decline during the first decade of the present century, followed by a period of stagnation, followed by a mild recovery that began around 2015. Over the last year, however, as the Fed has raised rates, the level of the \u201clabor share\u201d has stagnated.Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said she expected the Fed to take a break after raising rates Wednesday to wait for clearer evidence of inflation. \u201cI think that is their intention,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to pause on benign inflation and let things run strong.\u201dMr. Leeper, the co-author of the 2015 paper, said in an interview that it was impossible to determine from the available data if the Fed\u2019s rate increases were weighing on wage growth. But he added that he was confident that the Fed was mindful of the difference between rising prices and falling profits \u2014 not least because Mr. Faust now works at the Fed. \u201cI think you can be sure that they\u2019re carefully trying to decompose this in the way that we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Mr. Leeper said.(Mr. Faust, as a Fed staff member, is subject to a \u201cblackout period\u201d before policy meetings.)Mainstream economic models are built around the assumption that wages cannot rise faster than productivity growth without generating inflation. There is no allowance for changes in the division of economic output between workers and owners. The labor share is fixed.Many economists continue to regard that as a reasonable approximation.\u201cReal income growth is dependent on productivity,\u201d said David W. Berson, the chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company.The tax cuts orchestrated by the Trump administration significantly boosted corporate profits, and corporations shared some of that money with workers. But investors were the primary beneficiaries.\u201cThe tax cuts mean there could be a little bit there for businesses to give without having to raise prices,\u201d Mr. Berson said. \u201cBut I think if productivity growth remains weak, then wage gains will be translated into price gains fully and quickly.\u201dMr. Leeper said his own observation of public comments by Fed officials suggested that they did not take for granted a direct connection between wage increases and price increases.\u201cI think Fed people are very much accustomed to thinking outside the models, much more so than academics,\u201d he said.There is some evidence to support his view in past public comments by top Fed officials.Richard Clarida, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, wrote about the issue in his previous life as an economist at Pimco, an investment management firm. He published a research note in 2014 charting the increases in labor share during past economic recoveries. Mr. Clarida noted that the increases were not accompanied by increases in inflation.Mr. Clarida revisited the issue in April 2016, noting that labor share had begun to rebound without an increase in inflation. He described this as a normal pattern that should not raise concerns about inflation or corporate profits.\u201cEspecially in a low-productivity-growth world, gains in labor\u2019s share will come, at least to some extent, out of profit growth,\u201d Mr. Clarida said.Mr. Powell described the decline of labor share as \u201cvery troubling\u201d during an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee in July.He said most reasons for the decline were not under the Fed\u2019s control. But he added that the Fed had some power to help.\u201cThe thing that we can do is to take seriously your congressional order that we seek maximum employment so in tight labor markets workers are more likely going to be paid well and paid their share,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Economic Crisis Drags Down the Middle Class Almost Overnight", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Less than a year ago, he was running a thriving computer accessories business, driving a new car and renting a comfortable two-bedroom apartment in the center of Tehran. But last month, Kaveh Taymouri found himself riding a rusty motorcycle on his hourlong commute to his family\u2019s new lodgings, a 485-square-foot apartment in one of the city\u2019s worst neighborhoods, next to its sprawling cemetery.When he arrived home one recent night at 10:30 from his new job at an arcade, there was no food on the stove. The sandwich he had for lunch would have to do.Nevertheless, his wife and former business partner, Reihaneh, said she thought his mood was improving.\u201cAt least he has stopped screaming in his sleep,\u201d she said.Before their \u201cdownfall,\u201d as they call it, the Taymouris were the model middle-class Iranian family, prosperous college-educated business owners who made enough money to save for a down payment on their own home. Now, they are a model for a different sort: the millions of middle-class Iranians who almost overnight have seen their lives shrink, dragged down by economic forces beyond their control.Iran\u2019s economy is in a shambles, savaged by years of mismanagement and renewed economic sanctions.The government has expanded the money supply by more than 30 percent annually for more than a decade, using the extra cash to cover budget deficits and other expenses. In the United States, by comparison, a broad measure of the money supply has increased by an annual average of 6.4 percent over the last decade, according to the Federal Reserve.As a result of Iran\u2019s rapid expansion of the money supply, says Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a professor of economics at Virginia Tech University, inflation has exploded and by official figures is now running at an annual rate of 35 percent, compared with below 10 percent a year ago.President Trump\u2019s decision to leave the nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A., and to reimpose harsh economic sanctions prompted the other major economic disaster to befall Iran: a collapse in its currency, Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said. The rial lost about 70 percent against the dollar before strengthening recently, but its rates are still fluctuating heavily.\u201cThe withdrawal busted the expectations for an economic boom created by the J.C.P.O.A. and Iran\u2019s return to the global economy, which was expected to boost oil exports and foreign investment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reversal caused people to convert their rials into other assets, mainly dollars and gold.\u201dBy raising the cost of imports, the currency collapse has reinforced the inflationary surge and decimated small businesses that, like the Taymouris\u2019, rely on imported goods.Mr. Taymouri, saying it was best to let his money \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 do the talking, sat down and calculated the financial calamity that had befallen the family in the past year. Their monthly income fell from 50 million rials, or about $1,400, a year ago to 10 million rials, or $90, at the current heavily devalued rate.\u201cIf someone had ever told me I would one day live like this, I would\u2019ve laughed,\u201d Mr. Taymouri said bitterly, before falling silent. Finally, his wife spoke.\u201cI\u2019m not really that sad, because we are not alone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening to so many people.\u201dMr. Taymouri attributed the fall in the currency to speculators as well as the government \u201cfor just having stood by.\u201d Others blame Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s really because of Trump,\u201d said Nasim Marashi, the 29-year-old author of a best-selling book, \u201cAutumn Is the Last Season.\u201d The book, on the lives of three middle-class young women in Tehran, has had 35 print runs in four years. \u201cHe left the nuclear agreement, not Iran.\u201dIran, with a population of about 80 million, has long had a large and thriving middle class, covering roughly everyone from bus drivers to lawyers and doctors, and earning an average of $700 a month in local currency, according to government officials. That income was frequently padded by unreported side businesses in the country\u2019s large black market and government subsidies that lowered the cost of utilities, food and gasoline.Politically quite influential, Iran\u2019s middle class has consistently favored candidates like the current president, Hassan Rouhani, who support better relations with the West. But seldom have they been under as much economic pressure as they are today. Recently at least two people have been hanged after they were convicted in highly publicized trials for manipulating markets.In a sign that the government is taking the issue seriously, Mr. Rouhani introduced his administration\u2019s budget on Tuesday, and it included more support for state employees and more subsidies on basic goods.Not all have suffered as much as the Taymouris, whose business was so vulnerable to the currency collapse. But Abbas Torkan, a former adviser to Mr. Rouhani, said recently that the middle class had shrunk by 50 percent.Even for those in higher income ranges, the difficult times have meant a sudden lifestyle change.Royalties checks for Ms. Marashi\u2019s book dropped from 120 million rials a month to 20 million rials recently, she said. \u201cBooks aren\u2019t a necessity.\u201dOutwardly, Tehran looks every bit the bustling metropolis it has been. New restaurants are still opening. An Iranian theater version of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d sells out every night for 3,500 people who pay the equivalent of $16 a person. But cracks are appearing.In supermarkets, where the cost of Red Bull, for example, has quadrupled, people can be seen carefully studying the prices. Some imported products, like Purina pet food, have vanished entirely.Along Tehran\u2019s high-end shopping district on Jordan Street, stores selling Western brands are shutting down. Rent increases are pushing people out of their longtime neighborhoods, and plane tickets to Europe now often cost two months\u2019 salary.The pain many people are feeling may just be the start, said Faezeh Forouzan, an Iranian economist. \u201cFor the short term, those better off in the middle class will respond by changing their lifestyle, eliminating luxuries and excess,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the future, all will suffer as a result of a lack of investment in creating jobs.\u201dFor the Taymouris, the pain was seemingly instantaneous. They met five years ago at work, and between stealing kisses by the copy machine, they figured out they could make more money with their own business selling computer accessories.From their shop in the center of Tehran, the couple would buy keyboards, cables and other computer accessories from wholesalers. Ms. Taymouri would then resell them in the provinces, while her husband took care of the shop and short-term financing for the business.A son was born, and just weeks before everything came crashing down, they happily informed their parents that they were expecting a second child.But in January, the rial began to slide, and goods like the Taymouris\u2019 accessories that were priced in dollars and euros rapidly became unaffordable for most Iranians. Ms. Taymouri\u2019s phone stopped ringing, and sales orders dried up.A Western Digital hard disk still costs around the equivalent of $90 in Iran, but in the local currency it soared to 18 million rials from 3 million, Ms. Taymouri said. \u201cWhen your customers make only twice that a month,\u201d she added, \u201cyou can understand how our sales went down to zero.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Taymouri was getting plenty of calls \u2014 from the wholesalers he had bought accessories from on credit.\u201cThey were asking for their money, but clients in the provinces weren\u2019t paying us back and we were not selling anything,\u201d he said.One night, Ms. Taymouri said, \u201che just came home, dropped on the couch and said, \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019\u201dIn a country that still puts debtors in jail, the Taymouris had no choice but to make good on their debts. They sold the car, their furniture and the carpets they had been given as wedding presents.Mr. Taymouri sold the shop to the arcade man on the condition that he could work there. Then they moved to their current apartment, which has a communal shower in the hallway.\u201cWe don\u2019t like it here,\u201d he said, gesturing to the cemetery, one of the largest in the world. \u201cWe had been planning to move uptown, not next to the dead.\u201dMr. Taymouri brought out his infant daughter, Anita, from the tiny bedroom, and his wife started crying.\u201cI was just pregnant when everything suddenly turned upside down in our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cI admit that I thought of having an abortion. But despite all of this, I\u2019m so happy we have her now.\u201dEven Iranians in the upper strata of the middle class, like Ms. Marashi, are feeling the pinch. Malmal, her white Persian cat, played in the background as Ms. Marashi\u2019s husband, a filmmaker, rummaged in the refrigerator.\u201cWe are very lucky that we bought this house last year,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, we would never be able to afford it.\u201dIn her book, the three main characters face setbacks after the anti-government protests of 2009. One gets fired from her job as a reporter, the other becomes depressed about society and the third dreams of emigration but cannot get a visa.\u201cHad I written the book now, there would be no reference to visas, as going abroad has become too expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting fired as a journalist is still possible, but more so because paper has gotten too expensive and publications are closing.\u201dThe couple had been planning a European tour around an award she had won in Italy, but a ticket now costs more than she makes in two months, she said. \u201cSo we canceled.\u201dStill, Ms. Marashi said things could be worse, thinking of people who lived through the 1980s war with Iraq.\u201cWe have had much harder times,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a best-selling author in Iran. She is Nasim Marashi, not Narsin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal in San Francisco Ends Nationwide Marriott Strikes", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter almost two months of picket lines, nearly 8,000 workers at the hotel giant have agreed to a settlement that includes increased wages and improved working conditions. A new contract with Marriott International that will give housekeepers in San Francisco an eventual $4-an-hour increase and better protections against sexual harassment was approved Monday, ending a nine-week strike by 2,500 workers at seven hotels in that city.The settlement in San Francisco concludes a nationwide walkout against the world\u2019s largest hotel chain. At its peak, the protest involved 7,700 workers at 23 hotels.Workers at the Marriott Marquis, along with the Marriott Union Square, the Palace Hotel, the St. Regis, the W, and the Westin St. Francis, are set to return to their jobs on Wednesday. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming our associates back at work,\u201d said Connie Kim, a spokeswoman for Marriott. She declined to comment further.Marriott International is the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, with management or franchise agreements under 30 brands in 130 countries and territories. It had net profits last year of $1.37 billion.The dispute involved a range of Marriott brands in Boston; Detroit; four California cities \u2014San Jose, Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco; and Honolulu and Lahaina, in Hawaii. A worker in San Francisco who retires while the new contract is in place will receive a pension of $50 per month for each year of employment, said Anand Singh, the president of Unite Here Local 2, which represented the workers in San Francisco. Housekeepers, who are generally the lowest paid workers, will receive increases starting at $1.75 an hour and growing to more than $4 an hour over the life of the four-year contract. The current median wage for housekeepers is $23 an hour, Ms. Gumpert said. All employees who deal with guests one on one, such as housekeepers and workers who deliver room service or bags, will receive a silent GPS-enabled panic button to summon help if they feel unsafe, she said.Housekeepers will also receive a reduced workload that increases over the life of the contract, especially if they have a number of rooms that don\u2019t receive daily cleaning as part of Marriott\u2019s \u201cMake A Green Choice\u201c program. The initiative, billed as an environmental alternative, offers loyalty points to guests who forgo daily room cleaning. Housekeepers had complained that it disrupted the schedule for deep cleaning and that they were at risk of injury while trying to get through the heavy work in all their allotted rooms, no matter how many had previously been pulled from the daily cleaning pool, Ms. Gumpert said.While the financial terms varied by city, the sexual harassment agreement is included in all the contracts. There is also a nationwide plan to bring Marriott officials and union representatives together to discuss automation in the hotels, Ms. Gumpert said. Ms. Carumba, like many housekeepers, had been working a second job to make ends meet, cleaning a laundromat for three hours each day.\u201cI will be able to take care of my kids now because I don\u2019t need to go work another job,\u201c she said.The strike in San Francisco was particularly confrontational, and more than 100 union employees have been arrested since it began, on Oct. 4. Mr. Singh was arrested twice for civil disobedience.\u201cI think this campaign and the contract that we achieved certainly sets the standard in San Francisco, and it demonstrates that militant action in today\u2019s economy, even with large employers, can deal real successes,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cWe certainly hope it paves the way for settlements in our industry and in other industries.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, relying on information from a union representative, misstated which provisions were included in Marriott's contracts with its hotel workers. While a provision allowing people with low-level nonviolent drug convictions to obtain union jobs was proposed, it was not included in the final contract.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Report Card on the Populists", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis was the year populists made real efforts to challenge the economic consensus that has set the terms of the global economy for decades.How are they doing?It\u2019s a mixed bag. President Trump\u2019s trade war achieved some gains but has yet to deliver the type of change many populists have called for, like a rollback of China\u2019s interventionist industrial policies. Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union has not made it through the country\u2019s Parliament. But Italy\u2019s populist government this week reached a fiscal deal with the European Union that appears to be a slight win for the country. And some of the populists\u2019 economic ideas appear to be gaining ground.Populists have long contended that the global system of free trade hurt the livelihoods of many American workers. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war showed that it was not easy to force big changes in the arrangements that underpin the flow of trillions of dollars of trade.The Trump administration began by imposing tariffs on countries to force them to agree to his demands. But that confrontational strategy did not press China or the European Union to surrender. Instead, the Trump administration struck truces with China and the European Union and got mild concessions from other countries.The recent declines in the stock market, and the Republican loss of the House of Representatives most likely played a big role in persuading the administration to opt for d\u00e9tente.Several possible paths lie ahead. Britain could leave the European Union without a deal, an outcome some populists might favor. Perhaps more likely, Parliament, fearing an economic crash, would vote for Mrs. May\u2019s deal or a similar deal that ties Britain closer to the bloc. And the probability of a second referendum, in which voters may be asked if they still want to leave, continues to rise.Even if voters opted to remain in the European Union, the furor that might arise from holding a second vote could fuel populism in Britain for years to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Markets Were Early to the Trade War Meltdown. Now They\u2019re Not So Worried.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrade headlines have kept investors on tenterhooks in recent weeks and left stock markets on Wall Street and across much of the world down.Not in China though. The benchmark Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indexes hit their lows for the year on Oct. 18 after China\u2019s government reported that the country\u2019s economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly a decade during the third quarter. Since then, the two indexes are up 6 percent and 10 percent. By comparison, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 4 percent over that period.It\u2019s not that investors in China are sanguine about a trade war. It\u2019s that they just began selling much earlier.Chinese stocks tumbled more than 25 percent from mid-March through Oct. 18. That pushed valuations on Chinese stocks, by some measures, to their lowest levels in four years.The steep declines were partly because China\u2019s economy is more susceptible to a trade war than America\u2019s. China sells a lot more to the United States than it purchases. The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive approach to trade also came at a delicate time for China. The country was trying to tackle its considerable debt problem without slowing its economy further.A similar shift in sentiment was experienced across emerging-market stocks. Pressured by trade, rising interest rates in the United States and a stronger American dollar, the MSCI Emerging Market Index fell about 20 percent this year to its low in October. That left those stocks looking cheap too.Some of the pressures on emerging markets have eased since then. China and the United States agreed to a 90-day trade truce, the dollar has weakened and investors increasingly believe the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of rate increases. Over the last six weeks, emerging-market stocks have gained 5 percent.China is hardly past many of the concerns that have pulled down share prices this year. The country is still wrestling with how to ease its onerous debt burden without hurting economic growth, and trade negotiations could fall apart or end without any resolution.Could the recent performance of China\u2019s stock market indicate that the effect of the trade war on share prices is nearing a bottom? After all, sometimes the markets that get beat up the most, are also the first to show that the worst is nearing an end.We will have to wait to see if that is the case with trade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Labor Market Tightens, Women Are Moving Into Male-Dominated Jobs", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWidening opportunities do not automatically translate into better pay or a decline in gender discrimination.In comparing two 12-month periods \u2014 2016 and December 2017 to November 2018 \u2014 employment in five male-dominated sectors grew 3.4 percent, versus 2.5 percent in the mixed and female-dominated sectors. (The other two male-dominated sectors are agriculture and manufacturing.) The faster employment growth for women was concentrated in sectors that are at least two-thirds male. In these sectors, women\u2019s employment rose 5.0 percent, versus 3.0 percent for men. Women\u2019s employment grew more than 10 percent in construction, mining, and transportation and utilities. \u201cIn a tight labor market, firms give workers a chance they would not otherwise consider,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. \u201cBut the tight labor market could facilitate longer-term change if it demonstrates to firms that they should be more open to women in previously male-dominated areas.\u201d This growth in women\u2019s employment in male-dominated industries is not just about desk jobs. Within male-dominated industries, the fastest growth for women has been at the building site and on the factory floor, rather than in the accounting office.Women\u2019s employment in the male-dominated jobs within these male-dominated industries \u2014 mostly making and moving around physical goods \u2014 rose 6.9 percent, versus just 2.3 percent for men. In contrast, in mixed- and female-dominated jobs within these male-dominated industries \u2014 office, sales, service and management jobs \u2014 men\u2019s employment grew a bit faster (4.3 percent) than women\u2019s (3.8 percent). Nolee Anderson, 24, a carpenter in Nashville, said that while she\u2019s usually the only woman on a construction site, she has noticed a lot more interest in the field from young women. And the workwear company Wolverine has sponsored her to draw attention to diverse trade workers at a time when firms say they\u2019re having trouble finding enough of them. She said that when she entered carpentry, she didn\u2019t think her gender would stand out, but being female \u201chas given me a leg up,\u201d she said. \u201cEmployers are excited to hire diverse, qualified people.\u201d Yet even though women are increasingly getting traditionally male jobs, they are not necessarily the same jobs. Median earnings for women working full time in these jobs are 29 percent below men\u2019s earnings, and this pay gap isn\u2019t closing. Between 2016 and now, earnings rose 5.0 percent for men in these jobs, slightly ahead of 4.7 percent for women. The real test comes when unemployment starts rising again and employers have more candidates to choose from. Then we\u2019ll know whether the current rise of women in male-dominated jobs reflects a permanent shift in gender norms or a stopgap measure. One hint from recent history: Women\u2019s share of male-dominated jobs climbed in 2000, the last time unemployment dipped below 4 percent, then fell as unemployment picked up. Even if there is a permanent shift to hiring more women in male-dominated jobs, these jobs aren\u2019t the future. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment in male-dominated occupational sectors will grow 4.1 percent between 2016 and 2026, half the rate of mixed- and female-dominated sectors (8.3 percent). Two male-dominated roles, production and agricultural jobs, are expected to decline. The sectors projected to grow fastest, health care and personal services, are traditionally female. Male-dominated occupations are lifting women\u2019s employment today; future opportunities will come more from jobs traditionally held by women. Advertisement"}

Carrying placards that said, \u201cStand Up to Racism,\u201d Brexit supporters and opponents alike warned that Mr. Robinson was trying to co-opt the economic grievances of austerity-hit Britain.\u201cThey\u2019re using Brexit to get more support from people feeling left behind,\u201d said Lauren McCourt, 24, a member of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers\u2019 Union.Standing beside her, Claire Trevor, 30, of Leicester, said the march was about proving, especially to young people, that Mr. Robinson represented a small minority of Britons, no matter how much attention he got.\u201cA lot of young people are scared,\u201d Ms. Trevor said.The grievances that fueled the Brexit vote are simmering once more. Disappointment may well inject new energy into the far right, said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.\u201cThe prospect that Brexit would fix everything was enough for all but the most rabid xenophobe,\u201d Mr. Bale said. \u201cWhen people realize that it won\u2019t stop the economy sucking in people to do the jobs that Brits can\u2019t or won\u2019t do, that it won\u2019t stop people coming in via family reunification or asylum provisions, and that it won\u2019t do anything to send home the millions of people here already, then there will be trouble.\u201dHe added, though, that any embrace of violence or racism would consign the U.K. Independence Party, which played a major role in building support for leaving the bloc before the 2016 referendum, to \u201cmarginal irrelevance.\u201dAlready, the party has begun a drift toward the political edges, appointing Mr. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, as an official adviser.That has spurred resignations from the party and prompted fears that the far right, already emboldened by the referendum result, would capitalize on frustrations with Mrs. May\u2019s deal. Many of those taking part in the \u201cBrexit Betrayal\u201d march said that job loss was their central grievance.\u201cI\u2019m in construction, and in seven years on building sites I\u2019ve worked with four English builders,\u201d said Lee Windsor, 51. \u201cThe rest of them are from Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, wherever. The wage difference is: I pay tax, and they get paid in cash.\u201dDavid Rayner, 51, waved a sign saying, \u201cNo Prime Minister Is Better Than a Bad Prime Minister,\u201d echoing Mrs. May\u2019s adage, since abandoned, that no deal with the European Union was better than a bad one. He said the benefits of a \u201cno-deal exit\u201d would outweigh its negative effect on the economy.\u201cYou\u2019ve got people like Lord Adonis saying you\u2019re going to lose jobs\u201d if Britain makes an abrupt exit from the bloc, Mr. Rayner said, referring to Andrew Adonis, a Labour member of the House of Lords who is pro-Europe. \u201cWhere was he when our factories were shutting down and sending jobs to Slovakia and Turkey?\u201dAntonia Howard, 59, said she had supported the Tories since she was 18. \u201cNever again, we\u2019ll never vote blue again,\u201d she said. The party, she added, \u201chas really let people down. And good people. We\u2019re really not thugs.\u201dThe left-wing activists marching on Sunday were a heterodox group of pro- and anti-Europeans, many drawn by their ties to workers\u2019 unions, others by their activism against racism or for the rights of Palestinians.Padraic Finn, 64, a Londoner originally from Ireland, voted to leave the European Union and supports the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. He worries that a second referendum would resolve little while angering anti-Europe voters.But above all, he said, it was important not to let frustrations over the negotiations become fuel for the far right. \u201cUKIP sees Brexit as an opening,\u201d he said.Yasmina O\u2019Sullivan and her friend Chloe White, both 20, said they were trying to start a branch of the anti-racism campaign at the London School of Economics, where they are both students. Ms. White said it was easier for people angered by benefit cuts as part of the government\u2019s austerity program to lash out at immigrants rather than policies.Organizers of the anti-racism rally said that about 15,000 people had turned up to march, while U.K.I.P. put its crowd at \u201cquite a few thousand.\u201d The Metropolitan Police in London, which sent scores of officers clad in helmets to monitor the marches, said they did not estimate crowd sizes.Luciana Berger, a Labour member of Parliament from Liverpool, made the case to the crowd on Sunday that the two million Britons who had reached voting age in the two years since a referendum deserved a vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Alternative to Arms", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsWhen the Second World War ended in 1945 there were 51 member states in the United Nations. Today there are 193. Many of the new states emerged out of struggle and conflict as old empires crumbled.The world is dominated by nations\u2019 struggles to make their own laws and to decide their relationships with other nations. But for people to have control over the decisions that affect their lives, we must empower them through diplomacy, cooperation and dialogue. When governments put simple human decency and the rights of their people first as they negotiate the world\u2019s conflicts, democracy will follow.That, however, is easier said than done, especially when the individual people responsible for upholding the law often value their own power over the common good.When I was a teenager in Belfast I realized that my peers and I were not being treated fairly. Northern Ireland was created when the British government partitioned Ireland. People were divided on sectarian lines and Catholics were deemed to be disloyal. We were denied basic rights in what was effectively an apartheid statelet.The inequality we experienced was deeply embedded in our society, to the point of being policy. Still, I thought that fixing it was only a matter of bringing it to the attention of the people in charge. Once they realized the problem they would rectify matters.I soon learned that the people in charge relied on that inequality for their power. They were unlikely to eradicate it if that would cost them their leverage, and any solution would be tempered to a degree that would keep them in charge. People who have power, or even the illusion of power, are loath to give it up.Those on the other side of this equation \u2014 the disadvantaged \u2014 include many who believe they cannot change their situation. Some are reluctant even to consider that change is possible. Some are afraid of change. Some are used to society being organized in a certain way, even when that society discriminates against them. Some are too busy surviving or living their lives to consider that things could be different.There can be no progress without political struggle, but for it to succeed, people must be empowered. They need to have a stake in society and in their communities. They have to be cherished, and their humanity has to be respected and defended. They have rights and entitlements that must be upheld and promoted. Society needs to be citizen-centered, shaped around these rights.The reality, of course, is that progressive change in society rarely comes of its own accord. It has to be engineered, negotiated for. Violence often breeds when people believe that they have been left with no alternative. And this belief can become more entrenched as states use extrajudicial and violent means to defend their interests.Irish republicans and others succeeded in shifting from conflict to peace by building an alternative to armed struggle with the Good Friday Agreement. It provides for certain rights for Northern Ireland, including the right to a referendum on whether to remain a part of Britain or to end that relationship and establish a united Ireland. The agreement emerged slowly as a result of hard work, with parties and governments eventually being prepared to take risks, and with the support of the international community. It is still very much unfinished business.In the conflict between the Spanish state and the Basque independence campaigners a similar process, closely modeled on Ireland\u2019s, has succeeded in ending armed conflict, even though the Spanish government has not fully engaged so far. Sinn Fein leaders have often traveled to other conflict zones, including Afghanistan and Colombia, advocating the primacy of dialogue, negotiations and peace processes.I have traveled to the Middle East on several occasions, speaking to Palestinians, visiting the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and speaking to senior leaders in Israel and Palestine. Regrettably, the failure of governments to uphold international law and U.N. resolutions, and the Israeli government\u2019s refusal to defend democratic norms and find equitable and fair compromises, has left many Palestinians living in desperate conditions, with no hope of a different, better future. As a result, the Middle East exists in a permanent state of conflict.To change this demands a genuine effort to understand what motivates, inspires and drives people to make the choices they do. The dialogue that fosters that understanding is what ultimately empowers opposing sides of a conflict to come together.Whoever described politics as the art of the possible was reducing politics to a mediocre trade. People\u2019s expectations of their worth must be raised \u2014 not lowered. When we do that, we enable democracy to take hold in even the most dire situations.Gerry Adams has been a member of Ireland\u2019s Sinn Fein political party since the 1960s. He was an architect of the Good Friday Agreement, which helped to end the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and is currently a member of the Irish Parliament.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Nicaragua, Ortega Was on the Ropes. Now, He Has Protesters on the Run.", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAGUA, Nicaragua \u2014 A life on the run was not one any of these Nicaraguans ever intended.But many people in this desperately poor Central American nation now live in a bleak new reality. They have exchanged their routine lives as lawyers, engineering majors, radio broadcasters and merchants for one of ever-changing safe houses, encrypted messaging apps and pseudonyms.\u201cThey are hunting us like deer,\u201d said Roberto Carlos Membre\u00f1o Brice\u00f1o, 31,who fled Nicaragua this year after he said a photograph of him at a protest began circulating. He now lives in hiding on a ranch in Costa Rica with 50 strangers, including a ballet dancer who goes by code name \u201cThe Eagle.\u201dInstead, convinced that he was facing an attempted coup by well-financed political parties, Mr. Ortega responded with an increasingly brutal and repressive strategy to quell the opposition movement and has tightened his grip on his power.Now, nearly 40 years after the leftist Sandinista Front led by Mr. Ortega ousted the Somoza dynasty that had ruled Nicaragua for decades, he is accused of becoming the very dictator he helped depose all those years ago.The 73-year-old Mr. Ortega and his wife, 67, control virtually every aspect of government, including the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, the armed forces, the judiciary, the police and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The many Ortega adult children manage everything from gasoline distribution to television stations.Hundreds of civilians who never picked up a weapon or lit a match have been charged with terrorism-related crimes under a new law that broadened the definition of terrorism.In the past few days alone, the government shut down a popular television station, jailed its news director and expelled international human rights observers. Private gas stations that had participated in strikes were shuttered. The police raided the offices of the country\u2019s leading human rights organization and seized its computers.\u201cOur field work demonstrated that crimes against humanity are underway,\u201d said Paulo Abr\u00e3o, the executive secretary of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, who was among the international monitors expelled from the country on Thursday.While Mr. Ortega\u2019s crackdown has managed to silence the dissent for now, mounting international pressure and a plummeting economy \u2014 marked by the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs since the uprising began \u2014 could pose significant challenges to his power over the months ahead.Last week, President Trump signed the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act, or Nica Act, a law aimed at crippling Mr. Ortega\u2019s presidency economically by cutting off lending from international development banks.Those in the opposition fear that this tightening economic noose could result in increasingly desperate acts as Mr. Ortega fights for his political life.Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a journalist whose newsroom was raided and padlocked by the police this month, said he was \u201cabsolutely convinced that this movement is irreversible,\u201d referring to the push to oust the Ortega government. \u201cBut what worries me is: How many people is Ortega going to kill before the police say, \u2018We can\u2019t keep killing people?\u2019\u201dWhen the older people who would see their pensions reduced picketed in Managua, the capital, pro-government mobs attacked them. The college students who rushed to support the protesters were assaulted, and some were killed.\u201cThey didn\u2019t come to injure us,\u201d said a former college student who goes by the name \u201cLa China\u201d and now lives in hiding. \u201cThey came to kill us.\u201dThe surge of social unrest quickly spread to other cities as the social security measure became an unexpected detonator of a monthslong campaign to end Mr. Ortega\u2019s rule. He returned to the presidency in 2007, after heading the country from 1979 to 1990.University students took over college campuses, and masked residents armed with homemade mortars and other weapons set up road blocks around the country that paralyzed commerce. Some protesters set fire to government buildings and burned cars, while the police responded with deadly force against even unarmed groups of protesters, human rights observers say.Officially, the organization no longer exists: The National Assembly eliminated the legal status for her group and six others accused of financing or plotting a coup.\u201cWe are all terrorists, according to them,\u201d said Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 80.Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a former Sandinista who was held as a political prisoner in 1970s, said the repression Nicaraguans are experiencing today was far worse than anything the Somozas did. Her organization took reports from activists who said they had been sexually assaulted with bayonets. In the first days after the protests, men were stripped naked and tortured, and were then released barefoot with shaved heads.Rallies now require a permit, which no antigovernment group receives. People are afraid to carry the flag or sing the national anthem for fear of being viewed as a subversive.Experts estimate that 60,000 people have fled, with more than 23,000 of them seeking refugee protection in Costa Rica.On Thursday, before the O.A.S. observers released their investigative report, the government kicked them out, saying they were operating under the direction of the Trump administration.\u201cDespite much evidence of the violent nature of the supposed peaceful protests, the existence of police and citizens who were assassinated with high-caliber fire arms, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights characterized said protests as peaceful,\u201d said Denis Moncada Colindres, Nicaragua\u2019s foreign minister, reading from a statement.The Ortega administration channels all media requests through the office of the vice president, which did not respond to repeated requests for interviews. In past communiqu\u00e9s, Ms. Murillo described the protesters as petty criminals and gang members who were financed by right-wing political parties.The O.A.S. observers found that of the 109 killings that took place in the first six weeks of the uprising, only nine criminal cases were opened. Six of those were related to Sandinistas killed in the violence.Of the 109 dead, 95 were shot in the head, neck and thorax, which suggested extrajudicial executions. Mobs of men in civilian clothes clearly worked in concert with the police, the investigators said.At least 1,400 people were hurt, and the number is probably far higher because most people were too afraid to go to public hospitals, where doctors were fired for treating wounded protesters, investigators said.An analysis of videos posted on social media showed that the government went from using tear gas to rubber bullets, then real bullets and finally military firepower like assault rifles and grenade launchers.The country\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office seemed uninterested in investigating and unaware that prosecutors should be independent of the president\u2019s office, said Claudia Paz y Paz, a former Guatemalan attorney general who was among the experts. \u201cWhere were the prosecutors?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere were they?\u201dA group of former college students, now expelled and living in hiding, said that while they acknowledged that the government had succeeded in crushing the protests, the activists continue small activities like singing the national anthem in public, or setting a tire on fire and fleeing.One safe house visited in Managua was occupied by seven former college students, who passed the time playing Monopoly when they were not glued to their phones in search of updates about recent arrests of their fellow activists. Some have been there for months, without ever going outside.At a house of Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica, dozens of the activists slept on mats on the floor separated by curtains. The protesters vowed not to get too comfortable there: Their fight, they said, remains at home.\u201cWe are in a phase now where massive events cannot be done,\u201d said a student who goes by the name of \u201cJos\u00e9\u201d because he fears that his family will be targeted. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s over? It\u2019s not over. It\u2019s not going to end.\u201dHe pulled out his phone to read aloud some of the death threats against him on Facebook. Then he pulled a shirt over his face and recorded a video calling for a hunger strike.Alfonso Flores Berm\u00fadez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Homelessness Rises Slightly Despite Strong Economy, Federal Report Finds", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver all, the national rate of homelessness rose by a modest 0.3 percent to 552,830 people without stable living conditions, the report found. But that represented the second annual increase after seven straight years of declines \u2014 the result, in part, of rapidly increasing housing costs that have only recently shown signs of leveling off.\u201cI\u2019m not sure victory is the right word to use here,\u201d said Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development. He attributed some of the increase to about 4,000 people who have been temporarily displaced from their homes, including by natural disasters.The report relies on a locally conducted census of people in shelters and living outside, and those reporting chronic problems in finding shelter. Its conclusions have significant limitations.A handful of communities, including San Francisco, which has suffered a major increase in homelessness in recent years, did not participate in the 2018 national count. And some of the data presented on Monday is nearly a year old, relying on a \u201cpoint in time\u201d measurement culled from a head count taken on a single night each January.In all, 31 states and the District of Columbia reported decreases in homelessness while 19 states reported increases, according to the report.Historically, Los Angeles County has experienced major increases in homelessness. But this year, the homeless rate declined by 4.7 percent, thanks, in part, to stepped-up efforts by city officials.But several states have had major increases in homelessness over the last decade, a crisis driven by gentrification and the lack of affordable apartments for poor and working-class city dwellers.Since 2007, New York has experienced a nearly 47 percent increase in homelessness, despite efforts by state and local officials to reverse it.Mr. Carson, a former surgeon who ran for president in 2016 as a fiscal conservative, praised cooperation between federal and local officials \u2014 and particularly initiatives that prioritize housing placement for adults with mental health issues.But the Trump administration has not proposed significant funding increases for such programs, and Mr. Carson would not commit to requesting additional funding from Mr. Trump to tackle the problem.\u201cBudgeting obviously needs to take into account the fact that there are limited dollars,\u201d Mr. Carson said during a conference call with reporters on Monday. \u201cBut this is a significant problem.\u201dHours before the report was released, Pam Patenaude, the department\u2019s deputy secretary, announced that she was stepping down. Ms. Patenaude, an official in the George W. Bush administration, helped stabilize the department after Mr. Carson struggled to take control in 2017.\u201cThis is a tremendous loss for HUD,\u201d said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. \u201cShe moved some good things forward and stopped a lot of bad things from happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kosovo Parliament Votes to Create an Army, Defying Serbia and NATO", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRISTINA, Kosovo \u2014 Kosovo\u2019s Parliament overwhelmingly approved legislation on Friday to form an army, prompting criticism from NATO and European Union officials and angering neighboring Serbia, which said it was prepared to use its own army to protect ethnic Serbs in Kosovo.All 107 lawmakers present in Kosovo\u2019s 120-seat Parliament, which is dominated by ethnic Albanian parties, voted to back the government\u2019s plan to transform the 3,000-strong, lightly armed Kosovo Security Force into an army that would grow to 5,000 active troops and 3,000 reservists in the next decade.Kosovo Serb lawmakers did not attend the session.Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia\u2019s president, said in the town of Trstenik in central Serbia on the eve of the vote, \u201cNot a single act in the international law gives them the right to form an army.\u201dSerbia\u2019s foreign minister, Ivica Dacic, said that Belgrade would request an emergency United Nations Security Council session over what he said was \u201cthe grossest violation\u201d of the resolution governing such a formation.\u201cIt is the most direct threat to peace and stability in the region,\u201d Mr. Dacic said, according to Serbia\u2019s state-run Tanjug news agency.Serbia\u2019s prime minister, Ana Brnabic, said the formation of a Kosovo army ran counter to efforts at stability in the volatile Balkans, according to The Associated Press. She added that she hoped Belgrade would not have to use any of its 28,000 troops to protect the Serbian minority in Kosovo, although \u201cthis is currently one of the options on the table.\u201dOfficials in Kosovo had sought to defuse anger ahead of the vote. \u201cOur army comes in peace,\u201d Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said in an interview on Thursday. He accused officials in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, of spreading false allegations through the government-controlled news media that a Kosovo army would be a threat to Serbs and its neighbors.\u201cThe narrative that Kosovo would use its military forces against Kosovo Serbs and its neighbors is an unfounded narrative,\u201d Mr. Haradinaj said. \u201cIt\u2019s a modern, multiethnic army that has grown up together with NATO and KFOR, their soldiers and officers in our country.\u201dKFOR is the name of the NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. There are about 5,000 such troops in Kosovo, including some 600 American soldiers.According to Kosovo\u2019s Constitution, drafted after the Serbian Army and police forces were driven out in the summer of 1999, NATO is the only armed force allowed to operate in the country. Its troops have disarmed and disbanded the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force known as the Kosovo Liberation Army, which had fought the Serb Army in the 1989-99 war for independence.Belgrade does not recognize the independence of Kosovo, a former Serbian province that it lost two decades ago after an uprising by ethnic Albanians and a campaign of NATO airstrikes led by the United States.Jens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general, had warned the government in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, that the country would \u201cface serious consequences.\u201dThe vote to form an army is one of a series of tit-for-tat moves that have brought to a standstill European Union-sponsored dialogue on normalizing relations between Serbia and Kosovo. Serbia successfully lobbied to keep Kosovo out of Interpol and has waged a campaign to persuade countries around the world to revoke recognition of statehood for Kosovo.Kosovo\u2019s government has hit back, imposing a 100 percent tariff on Serbian goods, a move that could hurt its sluggish economy. Mr. Haradinaj has vowed that the tax will be lifted only in exchange for Belgrade\u2019s full recognition of statehood.\u201cKosovo will stand for its right to defend itself,\u201d Mr. Haradinaj said, adding that \u201cwe had no choice but to stand up for ourselves.\u201dThe tax and the move to form an army are popular in Kosovo, which has a population of 1.8 million people, predominantly ethnic Albanian. But commentators said they may not translate into increased support for Mr. Haradinaj and President Hashim Thaci, who has been talking to his Serbian counterpart about an unpopular land swap deal.\u201cIt\u2019s very popular to strike at Serbia,\u201d said Agron Bajrami, the editor of Koha Ditore, one of Kosovo\u2019s largest daily newspapers. \u201cBut people are not blind to political maneuvering in a very sensitive situation and the overpromising of the two politicians who remain the symbol of corrupt governance in Kosovo.\u201dMr. Bajrami said Serbia\u2019s belligerent words did not mean that another war was imminent. Serbia knows that any military movements would set off a dispute with NATO, he said. For its part, he said, Kosovo is well aware that its security forces would be no match for Serbia\u2019s military, which the Russians have recently armed with additional fighter planes.\u201cPassing the laws on Friday to transform our security force doesn\u2019t mean that on Saturday there will be an army ready to act,\u201d Mr. Bajrami said.\u201cThis is the first step, and a very symbolic one,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a step which is necessary to confirm Kosovo\u2019s statehood. Serbia does not accept Kosovo as a state, so they are opposing the creation of another of its institutions, which is the army, vigorously.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s China Truce Calms Markets, but He Chooses a Hard-Liner to Lead Talks", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet 48 hours after the deal was struck, several big areas of contention remained unresolved and Mr. Trump appointed a veteran trade negotiator with deep skepticism toward China to lead the talks for the United States.The administration has been intensely conflicted about how to approach China, with hard-liners like Mr. Lighthizer advising Mr. Trump to use punishing tariffs to force Beijing to change, and more moderate advisers, like Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, encouraging the president to avoid a trade war.\u201cThe greatest amount of expertise in the administration, on trade and China, is held by Bob Lighthizer,\u201d said Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who has been advising the Trump administration, adding that the Chinese have been avoiding Mr. Lighthizer out of fear. \u201cThe Chinese are wary because they know he\u2019s the real deal.\u201dOn Monday, the president trumpeted what he has called \u201can incredible deal\u201d for farmers and manufacturers, saying they would be first in line to reap the benefits of his agreement.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a specific agreement on that,\u201d he said.The confusion continued into Monday night, when the White House revised Mr. Kudlow\u2019s statement that the trade truce would begin on Jan. 1, rather than Dec. 1, giving the two sides an extra month to strike a deal. The White House released a corrected transcript of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s remarks, striking out January and replacing it with December to reflect that the 90-day clock had already begun.The lack of specific commitments from China and the conflicting statements from United States and Chinese officials struck many analysts as a sign that the president might ultimately get far less than he was publicly portraying.For instance, after leaving Buenos Aires on Saturday night, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Mr. Xi had agreed to approve a deal China had previously rejected between Qualcomm, a San Diego-based chip maker, and a Dutch firm, NXP, calling it \u201ca big thing.\u201d But Qualcomm had already abandoned its plan to buy NXP and said on Monday that it would not be resuscitating any agreement.\u201cThe afterglow of this convivial dinner could fade quickly unless the two sides can find a way to make substantive progress in closing the enormous gulf that still exists between their respective negotiating positions, which will not be easy to bridge,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University.And while stock markets rallied and regained some ground after a volatile few weeks, financial analysts cautioned that any celebration was premature.\u201cThe road for a U.S.-China trade deal is not one without potential pitfalls, and that such a \u2018truce\u2019 may well prove to be temporary, particularly when considering how the U.S. will try to enforce the implementation of such a deal,\u201d analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers are publicly trying to temper expectations and express cautious optimism given the longstanding differences between the two countries and the strong possibility that the trade war could resume next year.Mr. Mnuchin noted that China committed to purchase more than $1.2 trillion in unspecified American products, but he emphasized that promises of structural changes to its industrial policies were more important. Those will be the most difficult changes to secure.Other members of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team were even more reluctant to declare victory.Mr. Navarro, who has often accused Mr. Mnuchin of being too soft on China, said Mr. Xi spent 30 minutes on Saturday night outlining China\u2019s promises and offering responses to more than 140 of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade demands. None of that matters, he said, until Mr. Xi follows through.\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cWhat we are looking for is not more talk, but by the end of 90 days that we see verifiable and real structural changes that yield actual, verifiable and immediate results.\u201d\u201cWe have given nothing away here,\u201d he added. \u201cAll we have done is given the Chinese time to do the right thing.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Holiday Air Travel Forecast Calls for More People, but Better Screening", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cMy hope is this Christmas will be a better, less stressful, more hassle-free airport screening experience than last year,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco.Why? Better technology is one reason. The Transportation Security Administration has installed more effective equipment, like improved conveyor belts and 3-D scanning machines, which give screeners a better view of the contents of travelers\u2019 carry-on bags. The airlines and airports are testing biometric screening of passengers\u2019 passports or other photo IDs.The airlines are also adding more flights on some of their busiest routes or switching to bigger planes to meet demand during the period.And then, there are the dogs.The T.S.A. is using more dogs trained to detect explosives. The dogs speed the security process because passengers have already been vetted for explosives by the time they reach the scanners. \u201cThey\u2019re a very important layer of security,\u201d an agency spokeswoman, Lisa Farbstein, said.Of course, bad weather could throw a wrench into all the plans. But airlines also have an answer for that \u2014 apps that they say will allow travelers to reschedule their flights more quickly than standing in line at the ticket counter.The result should be smoother travel.\u201cThe industry is not ignoring the challenge of this,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m encouraged by is that steps are being taken, these new initiatives are being implemented and anything that can help move people through the screening faster is going to benefit everybody.\u201dMultiple factors are responsible for the surge in passenger traffic, a 5.2 percent rise over the comparable period last season, industry analysts say. A robust economy with low unemployment and rising wages has given Americans more money and more confidence about spending that money.\u201cWe\u2019re basically experiencing the impact of a strong economy,\u201d said Dan McKone, senior partner and head of the travel and transportation practice at L.E.K. Consulting. \u201cWhile there\u2019s a lot of mixed indicators impacting the markets, the overall economy remains strong and air passenger growth tends to be most highly correlated with G.D.P.,\u201d he said.While investors\u2019 concern about economic growth has led to volatility in the stock market in recent weeks, it has also contributed to the slide in global oil prices that has translated to lower gas prices for drivers and cheaper jet fuel.\u201cJet fuel has decreased, although it was up as much as 30 to 40 percent earlier this year,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said.This is helping to keep ticket prices low, which also drives demand, especially among leisure travelers. According to data from the travel booking platform Hopper, round-trip domestic ticket prices for holiday flights are averaging $304, a drop of nearly 10 percent from last year. (Prices for international flights ticked up a bit, rising $66 on average.)\u201cIf you actually look at the average price of tickets in real terms adjusted for inflation, air traffic continues to be more and more affordable,\u201d Mr. McKone said.With ticket prices lower, more Americans will be flying, and Hopper estimates that overall spending will be 6 percent higher this holiday season than last. \u201cHaving lower prices definitely does drive demand,\u201d Mr. McKone said.Airlines for America, the industry trade organization, estimates that domestic airlines will add, collectively, 143,000 seats daily to accommodate holiday travelers, and according to Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at Hopper, much of that capacity is being added by the major carriers at large hub airports.Southwest Airlines, for instance, announced new routes last month in Northern California and the Washington, D.C., area, as well as to popular warm-weather vacation destinations. United Airlines, which expects to transport roughly half a million passengers \u2014 a 4 percent increase over 2017 \u2014 on its peak holiday travel days, is increasing the frequency of flights to locations like the Caribbean and ski resort areas, and plans to add nearly 20 domestic wide-body aircraft to help manage full flights over the holidays, an airline spokesman, Charlie Hobart, said.The airline industry is looking to technology to help prevent bottlenecks and move travelers from check-in to gate to boarding more quickly \u2014 not just for this holiday season, but into 2019 and beyond.\u201cThey built the algorithm to compare those photos,\u201d said Caryl Spoden, JetBlue\u2019s head of customer experience. \u201cEverything happens in two to three seconds,\u201d she said, adding that the photo taken at the gate is not saved or stored.\u201cIt does remove the manual passport verification. That is a good time saver,\u201d she said. \u201cIt allows our crew members to interact with the customer in a more meaningful way.\u201dMs. Spoden said the inaugural machine will process around 500 passengers a day over the holidays. \u201cOur intent is to expand this to every gate at J.F.K. and beyond,\u201d she said.In the interim, though, there are the dog noses.The T.S.A. currently has roughly 1,000 dogs trained to detect explosives, and it trains about 350 new dogs a year. It also works with teams of K-9 handlers employed by state and local law enforcement agencies. Last month the agency announced an initiative to allow private companies that train and handle explosives-detecting dogs to provide security for cargo air traffic, freeing up more of the T.S.A.\u2019s dogs to screen travelers.Even though these early inroads into biometric and 3-D scanning technology will help speed the journeys of a relatively tiny subset of the nearly 46 million people expected to fly during the holidays, industry analysts say they will help airlines cope with the long-term growth in passenger traffic. \u201cYou\u2019re still seeing this trend where the price of flying is increasing at a lower rate than general income, so you have, every year, a huge number of people around the world who take their first plane trip,\u201d Mr. Surry, of Hopper, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should a Nonprofit Splurge on Management?", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistI work at a nonprofit that advocates for consumer rights and financial literacy, a mission I have been proud to serve. We recently suffered a financial crisis of our own. Due to changing federal policies, among other factors, we lost a chunk of our annual budget. Management decided to cut about a quarter of the staff to protect our long-term future. I was of course saddened by what happened, but I understood that there were no good options. Then a staff member who was laid off (and quickly found a new job) told me that senior managers\u2019 salaries made up nearly a quarter of the budget and that we were paying for a \u201ccompany car\u201d for our president. In addition, a former manager is paid an exorbitant hourly rate for consulting. Your organization is obliged to serve its mission as well as it can with the resources it can muster. To do so, it needs good staff and good management \u2014 which requires it to be mindful of what the market rate is for people with the skills it needs. (Nonprofits typically do comparative analyses of salaries in their sector when considering raises for top management.) At the same time, income is just one factor that draws employees; often staff members will work for less when they find the work genuinely rewarding.Especially given the particular mission of your nonprofit, the situation sounds worrisome, and it might indeed have been a good idea to appeal to those at the top to accept cuts in salary in order to reduce the number of frontline employees who were let go. It might also have been better to end a consulting contract than to fire a permanent employee. Both would be harder than layoffs at the bottom, because board members are likely to be personally closer to senior managers (and former managers) than to other employees. Still, it\u2019s their responsibility to weigh such options.None of these considerations, however, prove that the leadership made the wrong decision. When the budget shrinks, personnel decisions have to take account of the employment market. Suppose cutting your president\u2019s perks or pay would incline her to take a job elsewhere. (Though that car sounds like something most places wouldn\u2019t offer.) The cost to your organization of finding a new one, especially during a rocky period, might mean that it wasn\u2019t worth the risk. A fixed, across-the-board reduction in salary, defined in percentage terms, might simply produce an organization full of disgruntled people waiting for a better opportunity. It\u2019s conceivable, too, that the core competences of the organization lie in the best-paid people and that the less well paid would be easier to replace if and when funds return. You should feel free to talk to the media if you\u2019ve determined that a nonprofit devoted to financial literacy has made bad financial decisions. But to know that, you would have to be privy to the details. Are you? You say that senior managers \u201cseemingly\u201d didn\u2019t cut their own earnings \u2014 which makes it sound as if you might not be.The inequality in rewards between top and bottom is ultimately a structural problem that requires structural solutions. Several countries in Europe have chosen to deal with it by having higher taxes and more generous transfers to the less well off than we do, ensuring that their income inequality is much less than ours. Those lower-paid people laid off by your organization would have better unemployment insurance there, too. My point here is that the issues you raise aren\u2019t really local to your organization. If we want to do something about them, resigning in protest from your nonprofit probably isn\u2019t the answer.I was on a three-month study-abroad program for about a month before I changed my ticket to leave within a week.My partner\u2019s mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer a few weeks before I left for my trip.

{"Headline": "Why Trump Might Be Right About Interest Rates", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat if President Trump\u2019s gut turns out to have been right and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases are holding back the United States economy?There\u2019s little evidence that the Fed\u2019s rate increases are leading to slower economic growth. But there have been times in the past when higher borrowing costs damped the economy more than the Fed intended.As markets have tumbled in recent weeks, analysts and economists are trying to understand whether that has happened again. And some believe the Fed has already applied the brakes strongly and should back off for a time.\u201cThis is a good time to pause,\u201d said Barry B. Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel. \u201cWe are a lot tighter than people realize.\u201dHow can that be when interest rates are still well below historical levels? It all depends on your starting point.Mr. Bannister contended that the Fed\u2019s main policy rate, the federal funds rate, was in effect significantly lower in the years after the 2008 financial crisis than the actual rate. As a result, the rate has gone up more than might first be apparent.The economists, Jing Cynthia Wu and Fan Dora Xia, used the yields on government bonds to calculate a shadow fed funds rate. Their intent was to estimate what that rate would have been if it could have fallen below zero.In the years after the crisis, this shadow rate fell as low as minus 3 percent in May 2014.Why does this matter today? The Fed has taken the fed funds rate at from zero in 2015 to 2.25 percent today. But using the shadow rate, the Fed has effectively taken that rate from minus 3 percent in mid-2014 up to 2.25 percent today, a much greater increase, and one that might now be pressuring the economy. The shadow rate stopped being calculated once the Fed began raising rates from near zero in December 2015 because it was less useful.Recent big moves in stock and bond prices suggest investors are taking more seriously the possibility of a slowdown in the American economy. Among their fears: The stimulus from the tax cuts enacted at the end of last year may be losing some of its oomph; other countries\u2019 economies are not growing as fast as they were; the trade tensions may also have weighed on some economic activity.Still, there are reasons to be skeptical of the argument that monetary policy is more stringent than it looks. A large effective tightening does not appear to be reflected in the economy or the markets. Gross domestic product is expected to grow a healthy 2.65 percent in the fourth quarter, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Bank loans grew at around 4 percent in the third quarter. And some assets have been sold off, but markets aren\u2019t clamming up.\u201cBond yields have risen a bit but are still pretty low, the dollar has appreciated only modestly and equities are just about flat for the year,\u201d Eric Winograd, senior United States economist at Alliance Bernstein, said in an email, \u201call of which is consistent with only a modest tightening of financial conditions.\u201dIf the United States economy does keep growing at a solid pace, and markets shake off the funk of the past few weeks, it will be clear that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy was not too constricting. But the strong G.D.P. numbers this year may turn out to be short-lived and the economy may now be adjusting back to the lower growth of the post-crisis years. If that\u2019s the case, Mr. Trump, in his own way, may prove prescient.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S.-China Trade Truce Gives Both Sides Political Breathing Room", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe agreement reached by President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China to effectively pause their trade war and work toward a pact appears to be aimed at giving the two leaders some political breathing room after an escalating fight has begun inflicting economic damage on both sides of the Pacific.The temporary truce, forged over a working dinner on Saturday night in Buenos Aires, does little to resolve the deep differences between the two nations and is more a political agreement than a substantive one. Both sides immediately positioned the cease-fire as a domestic victory while staking out areas where they would not compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible deal. It goes down, certainly \u2014 if it happens, it goes down as one of the largest deals ever made,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters late Saturday night aboard Air Force One.But the tough road to a more comprehensive trade deal could be seen in the disparity between the official statements released by the United States and China, with the two documents essentially disagreeing over what was agreed to by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi.The United States emphasized the 90-day window it has set for trade talks, while China made no mention of it. And the White House, which has accused China of \u201cstealing\u201d technology from American companies, said that Mr. Xi had agreed to \u201cnegotiate immediately on forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers and cyber theft.\u201d The statement from China said only that the two countries would \u201cwork together to reach a consensus on trade issues\u201d but did not mention intellectual property.\u201cThe president has been clear that if there is a real deal he\u2019s willing to give some period of time to get this firmly negotiated \u2014 that\u2019s the direction he\u2019s given to the team,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a telephone interview on Sunday. \u201cOn the other hand, if there\u2019s not a real deal, he said he will proceed with the tariffs.\u201dMr. Mnuchin suggested that all the tariffs could be phased out as China meets its commitments to make changes over a period of time. It is possible that the initial tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports could be in place longer, until it is clear that China has kept its promises of wholesale structural changes.\u201cThe proposal that came back and was discussed between the presidents included both reducing the trade deficit and also included very specific structural issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt includes commitments on technology, to currency to cyber. There are a lot of important issues to be addressed here.\u201dWaiting for China to actually carry out its trade promises is a high bar to set for removing the tariffs. American and Chinese negotiators have been wrangling over many of the same questions of intellectual property protection, investment access and other issues since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.Until Saturday evening, China had been insisting on an immediate repeal of all tariffs as part of any deal. \u201cChina has emphasized many times that United States bullying and pressure aren\u2019t working with China,\u201d Gao Feng, the Commerce Ministry spokesman, said in a briefing on Oct. 11.But Saturday\u2019s deal left American tariffs in place while including a Chinese agreement to resume buying American agricultural and energy products. The dollar value of the Chinese resumption of purchases was not announced. But China\u2019s willingness to reach any deal for purchases while considerable tariffs remain in place suggested that Beijing officials, as well as Mr. Trump, were genuinely eager for a truce.It is likely to be a source of tension within the Trump administration over how gradually China is allowed to make policy changes or if the president will insist on a rapid transformation. While Mr. Mnuchin has been an advocate for talks, other advisers, like Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, have warned Mr. Trump about agreeing to what would ultimately amount to a hollow deal.In the interview, Mr. Mnuchin played down divisions within the economic team. He said that it was helpful to have Mr. Navarro, with whom he has occasionally clashed on trade policy, at the table to show the Chinese that the White House is a united front.\u201cWe put off tariffs for 90 days in exchange for the same things we\u2019ve been negotiating with the Chinese with for over a year,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cWhy would this 90 days make any difference?\u201dHe added: \u201cAre the Chinese going to change their development model in the next 90 days? No.\u201dThe most important long-term consequence of Saturday\u2019s deal may be felt in the Chinese auto industry, which has been preparing for a big push into the American market as car sales have slumped sharply this autumn in the slowing Chinese economy.Five Chinese automakers have disclosed plans to enter the American market in 2020. In mid-November, GAC, one of China\u2019s biggest automakers, showcased its vehicles, not to mention its global ambitions, at the annual auto show in Guangzhou, the southeastern Chinese city where the automaker is based.\u201cWe have accelerated internationalization plans and built a global network,\u201d said Yu Jun, GAC\u2019s president, before projecting overhead a giant map with scarlet arrows fanning out from southern China to Europe, the Middle East and the United States.Administration officials have said they hope to prevent a repeat of what happened from the 1970s to the 1990s, when an influx of Japanese and then South Korean cars resulted in heavy job losses in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin \u2014 states that Mr. Trump is counting on for his re-election campaign in 2020.By contrast, China\u2019s tariff on car imports from all over the world was 25 percent until last summer, when it cut the tariff to 15 percent. But China added a 25 percent tariff just on American cars over the summer, for a total of 40 percent, to retaliate against Mr. Trump\u2019s new tariffs.In a cryptic tweet late Sunday night, Mr. Trump suggested that China would reduce those retaliatory tariffs on the small number of American cars exported to China. But Chinese statements on the weekend agreement included no mention of changes in auto tariffs.But Michael Dunne, the chief executive of ZoZo Go, a San Diego automotive consultant, said that even at 25 percent, the tariffs would discourage Chinese automakers. \u201cIt gives them reason to pause and reset their strategy,\u201d he said.Mr. Dunne predicted that Chinese automakers would look for ways to assemble cars in the United States instead \u2014 just as Japanese automakers did in the 1980s and 1990s when they faced American trade barriers, initially shipping parts from Japan for assembly and later shifting supply chains to the United States.But building factories is time consuming. And the Trump administration included some auto parts in the 25 percent tariffs last summer and a lot of auto parts in the 10 percent tariffs this autumn, which could prove costly for Chinese companies.Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}

He was, at 30, the youngest black professor to be granted tenure at Harvard.Dr. Fryer told a Harvard investigator that any sexual banter in his office was related to his research and \u201cin the spirit of academic freedom.\u201d He wrote in his response to the complaint that \u201ccertainly no one ever brought to my attention that I ever said anything that made any employee uncomfortable.\u201dBut in interviews with The New York Times and for Harvard\u2019s investigation, former employees described Dr. Fryer as a bully and the lab as a place where sexual jokes and comments were routine, and where employees were expected to laugh along with the group or risk being isolated. Documents and interviews suggest that Dr. Fryer was told repeatedly over the course of 10 years \u2014 by employees and by at least one university official \u2014 that his conduct was out of line.A former assistant reported to a Harvard human resources office in late 2008 that Dr. Fryer was sending her unwelcome and sexually suggestive nighttime text messages. Dr. Fryer agreed to change his behavior, apparently on the advice of a university official. But he directed another employee to compile examples of poor performance by the accuser. He refused to write recommendations for economics graduate programs she was applying to, according to her complaint, and all rejected her.Separately, Harvard is investigating Dr. Fryer\u2019s spending and the lab\u2019s finances, according to several former employees who have been asked about the issue by university officials. In a statement for this article, Dr. Fryer said he \u201chired a first-rate finance team to insure both transparency and full compliance with Harvard policy.\u201dLast spring, Harvard imposed \u201cinterim measures\u201d while conducting its investigations, including barring Dr. Fryer from entering the Education Innovation Laboratory, the off-campus space known as EdLabs where he has presided over a group of employees and research assistants.This account draws on documents related to the allegations against Dr. Fryer and interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees of his laboratory, as well as other colleagues and associates, many of whom supplied copies of electronic communications with him. Nearly all insisted on confidentiality, fearing retaliation.Dr. Fryer, in a statement, portrayed the EdLabs workplace in a different light. \u201cThe lab has always been an extraordinarily collegial place,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people commented on each others\u2019 lives outside of work including their dating and other relationships. Jokes and comments by both female and male lab workers of a sexual nature were occasionally part of such discussions. Not one person has ever complained to me or to any other manager or employee that I am aware of suggesting they felt uncomfortable about any of these interactions. That said, if any comments made in the past were found to be offensive or made anyone uncomfortable, that was certainly never my intent and I am deeply sorry.\u201dDr. Fryer also said that \u201cI have never and would not retaliate against any employee.\u201dRachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman, said the university was \u201caware of and take seriously concerns raised about the treatment of staff\u201d but would not discuss or confirm any unresolved case.June Daniel, a lawyer who as executive director oversaw the lab\u2019s administration for more than five years, recalled that Dr. Fryer complained when Harvard administrators pushed the Economics Department to find qualified female candidates for professorships. \u201cRoland said that no such candidates exist,\u201d Ms. Daniel wrote in response to questions from The New York Times. She left the lab last year.Asked to comment, Dr. Fryer said, \u201cI have been a tremendous champion for women and other underrepresented groups in economics,\u201d and noted that he had started a departmental committee to \u201cincrease diversity and inclusion.\u201dFormer employees said Dr. Fryer often reminded junior researchers that his recommendations could vault them to top graduate programs \u2014 or ground their careers. Several women said Dr. Fryer had written negative recommendations after they angered him in some way, or refused to write a recommendation at all.Ms. Daniel said Dr. Fryer\u2019s reputation for vindictiveness made it hard for researchers to speak out against what she called his routine \u201cinappropriate comments about women or their body parts, men\u2019s body parts, homosexuals, minorities or other groups.\u201dSome current and former employees defended Dr. Fryer as a demanding but fair boss who frequently hired and promoted women into senior roles. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I was ever judged on anything other than the quality of my work,\u201d said Rucha Vankudre, the lab\u2019s current research director. \u201cHe takes me and my ideas seriously.\u201dDr. Fryer\u2019s rise in the field was swift and celebrated. In 2011, he won the MacArthur grant, and in 2015 he received the John Bates Clark Medal, which honors an American under 40 for \u201ca significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.\u201dSome of those who have worked in his lab say they hoped the job would lead to a career in economics, but a few say Dr. Fryer instead drove them out of the field.\u201cI write papers that I think will help the world,\u201d Dr. Fryer wrote to one research assistant in a chat message, after she complained about his treatment of employees. \u201cI\u2019m far less interested in people\u2019s feelings. They can quit if they don\u2019t like it.\u201dThe earliest incidents to figure in the formal complaints involve a woman who landed a job with Dr. Fryer as an assistant a decade ago, at 23, barely a year after graduating from college.Dr. Fryer began sending her text messages that \u201cquickly veered into flirtatious and sexual overtures,\u201d according to her complaint, which has been reviewed by The Times, along with text messages that the two exchanged. He invited her to see him socially, and she initially agreed, but became uncomfortable as he pushed her to spend more time with him away from the lab.In her first month, she made visits to his apartment at night to play video games, and he sometimes complained that she left too early or did not drink enough while there. He invited her to weekend activities that he said needed to stay a secret from others in the lab, to avoid rumors. And he sent after-hours BlackBerry messages, including one telling her: \u201cUr lucky ur not here. I would either tackle, bite u or both.\u201dThe woman told friends she was upset by the messages and his conduct, according to documents in her complaint, and she stopped visiting his apartment.After that, Dr. Fryer began to criticize her work. She informed human resources, but was told that the university could not transfer her to a different researcher.Dr. Fryer apologized to the woman and said she had misinterpreted his \u201cfriendly nature,\u201d according to notes taken at the time by two managers in the lab. The apology, along with a pledge never to contact the woman outside of work hours, appears to have been suggested by a university official, the notes show.The woman\u2019s formal complaint, filed this year, includes an email sent by Dr. Fryer to a deputy soon after her visit to human resources. \u201cI will be sending you every complaint I have about her performance on a regular basis,\u201d Dr. Fryer told the deputy, Richard Hagey, who has since died.Seven months later, after what she described in her complaint as \u201ctirades\u201d by Dr. Fryer about her job performance, the woman resigned. She pursued a career in a different academic field.Another case was brought by a woman who began working for Dr. Fryer in 2015. Over the course of two years, she told the investigator, Dr. Fryer repeatedly engaged her in conversations of a sexual nature. She cited 32 examples of such behavior; the investigator substantiated six. In others, the investigator found insufficient evidence to confirm that an incident occurred or that the conduct was unwelcome.Some of the woman\u2019s allegations were supported by text messages, chat logs or other documents. On one occasion, Dr. Fryer texted the woman while she was out with friends that she was \u201cgonna get a \u2026 roofy,\u201d a reference to a date-rape drug. Later he texted her, while she was still out, \u201cBe safe tonight. Wear gloves if ur gonna have hand action.\u201dDr. Fryer told the investigator that the comments were an \u201cill-attempted joke.\u201d The investigator found they were sexual in nature and \u201cobjectively unwelcome\u201d for the woman.In early 2017, Dr. Fryer suffered a heart attack and subsequently began to spend more time in the lab and less time traveling. After that, the tone of his comments changed and \u201cbecame more public and derogatory,\u201d the woman told the investigator.According to the investigator\u2019s report, Dr. Fryer began commenting on the woman\u2019s sex life and suggesting that the woman was in a sexual relationship with a former manager in the lab. In June, she texted her roommate complaining that Dr. Fryer had spent 20 minutes talking about how she and the former manager were probably having sex, using a vulgarity. \u201cLike in detail,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBody parts.\u201dA few days later, the woman went to a human resources official to complain about Dr. Fryer\u2019s behavior. Later that month, her doctor called human resources to say her patient was in \u201ca crisis situation,\u201d and the woman began a disability leave. She never returned to work at the lab.The accuser has also filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.Other employees told similar stories about Dr. Fryer, both in interviews with The Times and in discussions with Harvard\u2019s investigator.One incident was raised in the complaint filed by the Title IX office: an episode in which a woman in the lab told a story about bending down to help an older faculty member tie his shoe. According to several witnesses cited in the investigator\u2019s report, Dr. Fryer launched into an extended monologue implying that the woman had performed fellatio. By at least two accounts, Dr. Fryer put his foot on her desk so that his crotch was in front of her face, in view of several employees, including two other women who told the investigator they were upset by the behavior.The investigator concluded that Dr. Fryer\u2019s \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature was sufficiently severe\u201d that it interfered with the three women\u2019s ability to work.Dr. Fryer told the Harvard investigator that \u201cthat riff\u201d was simply a joke and that the employee it involved was \u201claughing hysterically.\u201d He questioned whether he was being singled out for scrutiny because of his race.\u201cWhy am I the only one who violated policy when many others participated?\u201d he asked, according to the investigator\u2019s report. \u201cIs it because I am the only professor or because of my skin color?\u201dThe report responds directly to that point. The investigator, it said, was troubled that Dr. Fryer \u201cappeared to discount the significance of his roles as a senior faculty member at the university and faculty director of EdLabs.\u201dJim Tankersley reported from Cambridge, Mass., and Ben Casselman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "News Flash: No Major Damage Done at G-20!", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump refrained from publicly vilifying American institutions, assailing political adversaries, insulting allies or committing major gaffes.Ms. Rice was the national security adviser during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.Rarely might one expect much drama at the annual gathering of the Group of 20 leaders, except perhaps during a major global crisis, such as the financial meltdown of 2008 and 2009. Still these are important meetings at which American leadership normally yields significant outcomes that benefit the country\u2019s economy and national security.However, with Donald Trump as president, one can be forgiven for worrying what chaos may ensue at yet another multilateral forum. I have learned to brace myself for blows to our national standing every time Mr. Trump travels abroad \u2014 the mental equivalent of a pre-emptive defensive crouch.Last week\u2019s meeting in Buenos Aires was no different. In fact, it appeared to be an even more inauspicious moment than usual for a high-stakes foreign trip. Ukraine and Russia remain on hair-trigger war footing, while President Trump resorted inexplicably to his classic \u201cboth sides-ism\u201d rather than clearly condemning Russian aggression.Against this backdrop, and grading on a curve (since every grade can\u2019t be an F lest it become meaningless), President Trump\u2019s trip to the G-20 could have been a lot worse. We can exhale, noting that no major damage was done.This time, Mr. Trump refrained from publicly vilifying core United States institutions like the courts, the F.B.I. and C.I.A. He neither assailed his political adversaries nor committed major gaffes. Without explanation, Mr. Trump downgraded to private pull-asides two previously planned full bilateral meetings with the Turkish and South Korean leaders, but, thankfully, he avoided insulting any treaty ally. He even flattered his usual nemesis, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.The president was not caught lavishing praise on dictatorial adversaries, having wisely (if likely for reasons other than those claimed) canceled a replay of the disastrous one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia in Helsinki. While we will never know what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin discussed informally at the G-20 dinner, their exchange was comparatively abbreviated and perhaps less risky. In addition, Mr. Trump avoided a full-on, public embrace of the pariah crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, leaving it to Mr. Putin and the prince to mime how fellow thugs salute each other when America has taken leave of its moral leadership.No progress appears to have been made on addressing key global security challenges such as renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Saudi-led war in Yemen, or the unabated North Korean nuclear threat. Rather than rally the Western world to impose additional sanctions on Russia or to punish the Saudis for murdering an American resident in cold blood and repeatedly lying about it, President Trump and his team again took a pass on exerting traditional American leadership. These were significant missed opportunities but not new sins of commission.Finally, President Trump chose to tap the brakes rather than drive the United States-China relationship over the cliff. By agreeing with President Xi Jinping of China to pause additional tariffs for 90 days to allow for continued trade negotiations in exchange for vague Chinese commitments to buy more American goods \u2014 plus a welcome commitment to restrict the availability of fentanyl \u2014 Mr. Trump has postponed escalation of his costly and risky trade war with Beijing. While perhaps only a temporary respite, this marks the most significant result of the G-20 gathering.With Mr. Trump back on American soil, we can safely conclude that, at least this time, we dodged another blow to our national honor, even as we have surrendered our global leadership and become mostly a global bystander. We can only hope that Mr. Trump and his top advisers will now discern that less is more when it comes to this president\u2019s travels abroad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Passion for Puerto Rico", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "The island has shaped the \u201cHamilton\u201d creator\u2019s identity. Now he\u2019s bringing the musical to San Juan, and things are getting complicated.Supported byVEGA ALTA, P.R. \u2014 The road to Vega Alta is lined with Lin-Manuel Miranda. Literally.Just next to the arched stone welcome sign is a billboard with a large photo of the \u201cHamilton\u201d creator, and a hashtag \u2014 #YoSoyVegaAlta \u2014 meaning \u201cI am Vega Alta.\u201dThis is the town where his father is from, where he and his sister spent summers as kids, where their aunt and uncle still live. It\u2019s also a community that has seen better days \u2014 challenged by joblessness and crime and a town center dotted with vacancies.A dozen amped-up adolescents, some wearing A. Ham hats, cornered him by the mural and, from memory (O.K., one or two of them were peeking at cellphone screens), performed an a cappella version of the musical\u2019s opening number, led by their high school English teacher, Edd Ramos, who has been using the show\u2019s coffee-table tome as a textbook.But even lighthouses get battered by waves.Lin-Manuel Miranda is a New Yorker, born and bred. He has spent most of his nearly 39 years living in Upper Manhattan; he attended New York public schools, and his career was established on New York\u2019s stages.But Puerto Rico offers a thread, a theme, a thesis for his life. It\u2019s the homeland where both of his parents grew up. It\u2019s the place he long idealized, where many now idealize him.As we talked about how Puerto Rico shaped his personal, political and artistic identity, he mused aloud about questions he has grappled with. What does it mean to feel nostalgia for a place you never lived, a place your parents loved but left? How does fame affect the way you see, and are seen, in that place?\u201cI believe I owe a great deal of who I am to this island,\u201d he said as we drove from a coffee plantation deep in the mountains to the theater in San Juan where he hoped \u201cHamilton\u201d would be staged.\u201cIt\u2019s a tactile thing. It\u2019s a tempo thing. It\u2019s the pace of life here,\u201d he said when I asked what about Puerto Rico he would want to pass along to his own children \u2014 two sons, both very young. \u201cIt\u2019s the way the world sounds at night. It\u2019s seeing the stars. It\u2019s this oneness with nature that is very natural and real. It is all the things you cannot get in New York City. And it is its culture, because the kindest people I know are here.\u201dHis identification with this United States commonwealth 1,600 miles south of New York has informed his biggest successes \u2014 \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d about a Caribbean-American community formed around a bodega in Northern Manhattan, and \u201cHamilton,\u201d whose title character is a Caribbean immigrant who becomes an American founding father.\u201cThis idea of who you are in one place, and how different or similar that is to who you are in another place, has been present from the first conversation I had with him,\u201d said Thomas Kail, one of Mr. Miranda\u2019s closest creative collaborators, a fellow Wesleyan University alumnus who directed both \u201cHeights\u201d and \u201cHamilton.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something Lin writes about in all of his shows \u2014 \u2018Who am I?\u2019, \u2018Where am I from?\u2019 and \u2018Have I done enough\u2019?\u201d Mr. Kail said. \u201cThose are the questions he\u2019s always thinking about.\u201dMr. Miranda first visited Vega Alta, which is about 20 miles west of San Juan, as an 8-week-old infant, and later he started spending a month in the town every summer, accompanied by his sister.Days were occupied with his grandmother, who ran a travel agency, and his grandfather, a manager at the credit union. There were hours exploring \u2014 trying to catch lizards; marveling at the moriviv\u00ed, a plant that shrinks from human touch; savoring quenepas, a tropical fruit (as well as Chef Boyardee and McDonald\u2019s French fries).\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing I have to literally a town where everybody knows your name,\u201d Mr. Miranda said.As he got a little older, he indulged a growing passion: filmmaking. His grandfather borrowed a security camera from the credit union, and Mr. Miranda used it to shoot battles between G.I. Joes, explosions of blood capsules, and, memorably, a scene in which he tossed a fake body, fashioned out of stuffed clothing, from his grandparents\u2019 roof, alarming the woman next door, who at first did not realize the body was a prop.That neighbor, Margot Rodr\u00edguez, was often featured in Mr. Miranda\u2019s films \u2014 she would pretend to faint, or to sing, or to play the guitar. \u201cHe was like my son,\u201d she said. \u201cMy beloved nene.\u201dHis aunt, Yamilla Miranda, described him as a \u201cfunny kid.\u201d\u201cYou expect a kid to run and to play and to be with the other kids,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he was reading, and he loved to play video games, and there was his film \u2014 all day, making films.\u201dIt was mucky atop the mountain.He was witty, worrying aloud about the safety of a bush when a slip-sliding journalist reached out to steady himself. He was revealing, rolling up his jeans to show off a new coffee-cup tattoo on his ankle. He was sweating in his gray Puerto Rican scholarship fund T-shirt, but he turned on the charm \u2014 embracing farmers, thanking donors, listening attentively to discussion of fungus infestation and seed regulation.And he was relentlessly on message: Puerto Rico needs help.\u201cA year ago, this island changed forever,\u201d he said at the small family-owned coffee farm in Jayuya. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have their backs.\u201dMr. Miranda\u2019s philanthropy, which he conducts in collaboration with his family, is still taking shape but is growing fast. Over the last two years, the Mirandas have given more than $4.6 million to nonprofits and have raised another $8 million, after expenses, through sweepstakes campaigns for a variety of causes, according to Sara Elisa Miller, the family\u2019s director of philanthropy.\u201cIt needs help, and it needs attention,\u201d Mr. Miranda said, \u201cand one of the weird side effects of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 is this megaphone that I didn\u2019t really know what to do with in the beginning.\u201dFor Mr. Miranda, figuring out how his heritage would influence his art, and his activism, started early, and took some time.He grew up \u2014 in the words of Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes, his co-author on \u201cIn the Heights\u201d \u2014 \u201ca Nuyorican hip-hop-raised whiz kid,\u201d and has often described \u201ccode-switching\u201d from an early age, as he shuttled between his predominantly Hispanic childhood neighborhood (Inwood) and the overwhelmingly white precincts surrounding his schools on the Upper East Side. (He attended Hunter elementary and high schools, public schools for gifted students.)Characters in the musicals he wrote in high school \u201cwould have Latino surnames, but there wasn\u2019t anything particularly Latino about them,\u201d he said. But at Wesleyan, he moved into La Casa de Albizu Campos, a house for Latino students named for a Puerto Rican nationalist, and honed his voice.\u201cIn that house, I really met other kids who were like me \u2014 who were first generation, very driven, but could speak to every side of pop culture \u2014 to Marc Anthony, Ricky Martin and J. Lo, along with the American culture we all grew up with,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a bat signal to your countrymen to say, \u2018I\u2019m up here, and you can be here too,\u2019\u201d he said.Not that he\u2019s complaining. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get any griping about being a celebrity from me,\u201d he said. \u201cTommy Kail would probably say, \u2018Lin was always this famous in his own mind, and the rest of the world caught up.\u2019 And that\u2019s not untrue.\u201dHe\u2019s also always writing. \u201cI still have ideas for musicals \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re film musicals or stage musicals, but I\u2019m just going to write them the way I wrote \u2018Hamilton\u2019 and see what they come out as,\u201d he said. He declined to share the topics, but said, \u201cI promise you history is nowhere near any of them. Every historian is throwing their books at me, and I\u2019m doing none of those.\u201dWhen I ask why he has so many projects, he dismisses the question with self-deprecation. \u201cI am the laziest Miranda,\u201d he said, \u201cand the laziest Miranda still gets a lot done.\u201dMr. Miranda wheeled around, turning his back on the two dozen publicists and filmmakers and sponsors and well-wishers jockeying for a moment, a word, a selfie.He was standing in the theater at the University of Puerto Rico\u2019s R\u00edo Piedras campus, where he expected to perform \u201cHamilton,\u201d and just for a moment, he tuned them all out. He looked out beyond the lip of the stage, surveyed the repaired roof and the new rigging, took a deep breath, and aimed his voice beyond the orchestra and up into the balcony.\u201cThe world turned upside down\u201d he bellowed across the cavernous, empty auditorium, testing an evocative \u201cHamilton\u201d lyric.Impressed by what he was seeing, he delivered a satisfied assessment. \u201cThis\u2019ll do.\u201dBut it wouldn\u2019t.San Juan is not on the regular circuit for touring Broadway shows. It\u2019s expensive and time-consuming to transport sets by boat, and the local economy is too weak to support long runs.But there was really never a question that \u201cHamilton\u201d would come to Puerto Rico.\u201cIt was the most satisfying creative experience of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt closed a circle I didn\u2019t know was open \u2014 I didn\u2019t realize how important it was to me that this island I love so much support my work.\u201dSo \u201cHamilton\u201d would come, too. The run in Puerto Rico would kick off the sixth production of \u201cHamilton.\u201d Mr. Miranda would play Alexander Hamilton only in San Juan; then when the rest of the cast heads to California for a long run in San Francisco, another actor would play the title character.Luis Miranda, a graduate of the University of Puerto Rico, was eager for \u201cHamilton\u201d to play at his alma mater, hoping to burnish its reputation and show that its theater could host touring Broadway shows.\u201cLin-Manuel, our lives are not your theater,\u201d read one of their handmade signs.\u201cThe only artists and people that benefit from \u2018Hamilton\u2019 are the elite, white North American settlers, the rich bourgeoise and those who actively participate and aspire to become oppressors,\u201d said Ruth Figueroa, a student of comparative literature and one of the protesters. She was critical of Mr. Miranda\u2019s stands on fiscal issues, worried that accommodating \u201cHamilton\u201d would drain resources needed elsewhere and unimpressed by the choice of Alexander Hamilton as the subject for a biomusical by a Latino artist.\u201cAs a Latin person, he should be more conscious of who Hamilton was \u2014 he\u2019s glorifying a person that represents oppression,\u201d she said. \u201cHe could have made a show about Harriet Tubman.\u201dMr. Miranda, who now advocates debt forgiveness for Puerto Rico, said he understands the concerns about Promesa and had no problem with the protesters. \u201cI believe the criticisms of everything that came after are valid, but I also, in that moment, didn\u2019t see other options,\u201d he said.I met with 14 theater and music students while visiting the university, and they expressed a swirl of conflicting emotions about \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 enthusiasm for the artistry, gratitude for Mr. Miranda, but also resentment that \u201cHamilton\u201d appeared to be showered with resources when their academic departments were being cut back, and disappointment that more of them were not given opportunities to work on the show.None of them expressed an intention to protest; all of them said they were hoping to see the show, and four were later offered unpaid internships with the production.The campus\u2019s acting chancellor, Luis A. Ferrao, thought the concern about protest was overblown. \u201cAnything that would have arisen could have been taken care of,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one dies because someone yells or carries a sign against whatever.\u201dThere is also a longstanding practice in Puerto Rico restricting police access to college campuses, which created a concern about how long it would take to get law enforcement assistance if needed. \u201cWe all felt 99.99 percent sure that all we were going to get were protests, and that\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s always that .01 percent possibility that a handful of people escalate something, and that\u2019s a risk we were not going to run,\u201d Luis Miranda said.Students are stunned and upset. \u201cI\u2019m certainly in shock and deeply disappointed,\u201d said Alondra Llompart. Then on Dec. 23, the presidents of student organizations at the university\u2019s many campuses released a statement asking the production to reconsider.Mr. Miranda is left making peace with the contradictions \u2014 melding his pride in this place, and its pride in him, with the messy realities of a politically charged island that is struggling to recover from hurts both recent and historic.\u201cI have no agenda for Puerto Rico other than I want it to be proud of me,\u201d he said. \u201cAll my efforts here are just to help the island in the best way I know how.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Trump\u2019s Strong-Arming of China Might Be Working", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration is using the current trade truce with China to flex its diplomatic muscles in a bid to get its own way. So far, it looks like the strategy may be succeeding.The president said on Tuesday he would consider intervening in the case of Meng Wanzhou, the C.F.O. of the Chinese tech giant Huawei who was arrested in Canada this month at the request of U.S. authorities, if it might increase the chances of a trade deal.

{"Headline": "Beyond the Wall at Mexico\u2019s Border: Six Photojournalists\u2019 Perspectives", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe idea of building a border wall remains a central flash point of the Trump era. But as Times photojournalists have seen for themselves, a wall already exists, and it takes many forms.During his campaign, President Trump captured the imagination of his supporters with the promise of a 1,000-mile-long wall on the border with Mexico. Though construction of an actual wall has not begun, and funding for it has yet to be provided by Congress, the symbolism and reality of what it means has grown. In many ways, a wall already exists and it takes many forms. Since March, when Mr. Trump visited San Diego to view prototypes of the wall, New York Times photojournalists have traveled to the border to document the struggle of migrants trying to reach the United States and the efforts of the authorities to stop them. We asked six of those photojournalists \u2014 Mauricio Lima, Todd Heisler, Meghan Dhaliwal, Tamir Kalifa, Lynsey Addario and Victor J. Blue \u2014 to write about their experiences at the border and what the notion of a border wall means to them.Among nearly 4,000 migrants living in precarious conditions in an athletic center-turned-shelter near the United States border, there was a surprising spirit of generosity and mutual respect. Despite their traumatic tales of violence and persecution at the hands of drug traffickers, and political instability in their home countries, many of the families I came across still dreamed of crossing the border and starting life anew.As demonstrators gathered outside a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Tex., to express their outrage against the policy of separating children from their parents at the border, a bus carrying detained children exited the gated facility. It was surrounded by the protesters, some of who waved or blew kisses at the children inside; others sat down in the street, trying to stop it.Many of the Border Patrol agents I have met come from the communities they serve and have family on either side of the border. Some are immigrants themselves.I remember the first time I saw people turning themselves in at the border. It was broad daylight and about 30 women and children from Central America crossed the Rio Grande and walked right up to Border Patrol agents. One woman had a child who was merely months old.Words are spoken, cried, screamed and sung along the length of the fence. Prayers rise up into the night sky from a group of Central American asylum seekers near one of the ports of entry. Tears stream quietly down the faces of those who know that a new, unknown journey is beginning when United States Customs and Border Protection officers finally accept them in to begin the asylum process.Miles away, on the beach, pressed up against the part of the wall in Mexico that juts into the Pacific Ocean, whispers intermingle with the sound of the waves. A group of teenagers examine the wall, stretching their hands through the bars to touch the chain-link fence reinforcing the other side, while talking about ocean tides. Their eyes measure how far the wall stretches into the sea.The wall is just a wall, but it is also a silent witness to all those who cross or wait in its shadow.As the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy occupied the nation\u2019s attention in June, Ismael Grimaldo stood quietly in the shadow of the United States-Mexico border fence that runs through Brownsville, Tex., sipping a soft drink from a foam cup. Mr. Grimaldo wanted to get a closer look at the Rio Grande while he waited to meet his uncle at a downtown park. He rested his foot on the rust-colored steel fence, constructed a decade ago to stem illegal immigration, as he passed the time.I visited these bridges in June while on assignment for The New York Times. As temperatures rose with the sun, individuals and families sought shelter from the heat beneath colorful umbrellas. Plastic tarps were tied to the razor-wire-topped fences to block the afternoon sun. People used water bottles for showers and dental hygiene.I asked one 30-year-old man, who left Honduras with his wife and four children, why he had chosen to wait. He told me he wanted to do the right thing and provide a positive example for his children.Conditions were grim but spirits were not. A steady flow of supplies and food donations from passers-by and local aid groups boosted morale. As temperatures fell, laughter punctured the tense atmosphere and children turned the bridge\u2019s narrow walkway into a playground. At one point they saw a Border Patrol boat passing below them and waved enthusiastically. The agents waved back.Eventually, an officer\u2019s voice would cut through the noise and in a moment, there would be a few less people on the bridge the only reminder of their passing, the piles of blankets left behind on the pavement. For these migrants, the hope of asylum was more effective at preventing illegal entry than a physical obstacle. Still, those desperate for a better future will continue to risk everything, including the possibility of deportation, for a chance at life in America.I used to imagine the wall as an infinite line of two-story-high concrete that traced the United States-Mexico border without a break. But when I finally went south, I realized that a wall can take many forms. There are places \u2014 roughly 700 miles of the almost 2,000-mile border \u2014 where the wall is indeed a hulking structure of concrete or steel, shooting up into the sky along invisible lines that divide towns, property and, sometimes, extended families. This wall appears as abruptly and jarringly as it disappears, simply giving way to the rigors of the terrain: a natural reserve, someone\u2019s backyard, private land, a berm.But along other parts of the border, the \u201cwall\u201d is a patch of dense, gnarled thorn brush. Or a blimp or a drone in the sky. Or a movement-triggered device tethered to a tree at common crossing point. Sometimes it seems as if the wall is the Rio Grande itself. I often also felt that the wall was human: At any given hour, thousands of Border Patrol agents drive along the periphery of the United States in trucks and A.T.V.s, or they ride atop horses led by dogs trained to sniff out migrants running for their lives.As I trailed agents to-and-fro at all hours of the day and night through the southern edge of the Rio Grande Valley, the vigilant hunt for people reminded me of the countless military patrols I accompanied while embedded in Afghanistan and Iraq. Information is passed from Border Patrol command centers through earpieces and radios. When the orders came and the chase began, we jumped fences, ran through opaque fog, crawled on our hands and knees through the woods guided by a headlamp or flashlight. Instinctively, I tried to avoid nonexistent land mines and improvised explosive devices by following precisely in the steps of the agents running ahead of me \u2014 a habit I haven\u2019t shaken from my years covering war, where I.E.D.s killed and maimed soldiers and journalists routinely.Sometimes we scrambled for hours, and sometimes the chase was quick. As we crisscrossed people\u2019s properties and searched abandoned sheds \u2014 often used as temporary safe houses for cover \u2014 local dogs betrayed migrants\u2019 positions with their frenetic barking. Once, we found an abandoned ladder on the American side of the wall, and several times we happened upon footprints across a grassy field, headed toward the unknown. They made it.A wall \u2014 in whatever form it takes \u2014 may be a deterrent to those trying to enter the United States illegally, but after covering refugees and migrants for almost two decades, in countries all over the world, I know there is a common thread that binds them all: No wall can stop a person fleeing violence or persecution or extreme poverty \u2014 or pursuing the dream of a better life.There has long been a wall in place between the United States and Mexico, and it\u2019s made of many things. Steel, concrete, gravel, sand. Scrubland, mountain, river.In some places the wall is made of excess, in others it\u2019s made of privation. It\u2019s been built up by the uncertainty of our future, and rises from the accretion of our history.Vice and virtue. Innocence and experience. Irony and paradox, mendacity and protection. The wall is the cartels and the coyotes and our darkest impulses. It\u2019s our appetites and addictions. It\u2019s made of promise and fantasy and hard, hard reality. The wall is protests and detention centers and car chases and sorties. It travels on horseback, on A.T.V.s, in white and green Suburbans; it is raised by the surveillance of drones and spotter planes and helicopters.Maybe more than anything, the wall is made of longing.When you drive west out of El Paso across the New Mexico line and follow State Road 9, then turn south a bit after Puerto Palomas, you will run into the border. Drive long enough on the dirt road and you will come to where the wall grows. From a distance it looks like a thin row of dark, rusting pines joined at the top. It replaces a long, low barrier stretching east. The panels of the new sections lie stacked on the other side of the road like a long freight train frozen in the dust. Harsh and beautiful treeless desert spills out on all sides, indistinguishable in flora or feature from one side of the border to the other. Depending on your perspective, the new wall gapes like a wound or binds like a bandage as it rises against the falling sun.If you spend any amount of time reporting on the border and the people living on either side of it, eventually you are struck by the realization that it\u2019s much wider than it is long. The actual wall \u2014 the sum of official and unofficial policy, of economic and family ties, of criminality and enforcement, of deprivation, and plenty \u2014 stretches much farther north to south. I\u2019ve seen it reach deep into misty mountain towns like Todos Santos in rural Guatemala, 1,000 miles from the Rio Grande, where Mam-speaking villagers have scrambled along it for decades to build new communities in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Oakland, Calif. Or wind its way north, across the Idaho plains to St. Anthony, 1,100 miles away, where it divides families living between there and Jalisco, Mexico.We have built this wall over decades. Whether this new phase of it rises or falls, the wall will continue to grow or diminish according to our fears and values. It remains an expression of our most public and darkly private ideas of what it means to be a citizen, an American, a foreigner, a family, a neighbor or a stranger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Transplanted Final, Even the Copa Libertadores Is Sanitized", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMADRID \u2014 Pity Mart\u00ednez, his legs like lead, took a deep breath. After 120 minutes of impossible tension, after a journey of 6,000 miles, after a game that had lasted a month, there was one more run to make.So he ran. Away from the last vestiges of resistance Boca Juniors could muster, away from all the turmoil and strife that had enveloped the final of the 2018 Copa Libertadores, and into the wide green expanse of Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, toward the unguarded goal, toward a place in eternity.Behind him, a sea of red and white bounced and broiled, urging him on, waiting for that moment of release, of certainty: for the third goal that would seal River Plate\u2019s 3-1 victory \u2014 and, just as important, Boca\u2019s defeat \u2014 and ensure that, for the fourth time in its history, River would be the South American champion. This one, though, will always mean the most. Nothing else will ever really compare.How could it? It was all too perfect: beating Boca, its counterweight in the Great Schism that defines Argentine soccer, its opposite pole in perhaps the fiercest rivalry in world sport; seizing the chance \u2014 in that moment that Mart\u00ednez rolled the ball into an empty net \u2014 not only to savor its own ecstasy but to taste Boca\u2019s pain, each sensation feeding on the other, swirling, metastasizing.And to do it here, in Madrid, in Europe, this most intimate of hatreds turned, for one night, global, so that becoming champion of South America felt like conquering Europe.Long after the final whistle had blown, long after all but River\u2019s most ardent fans had left the Bernab\u00e9u, the team\u2019s captain, Leonardo Ponzio, placed the Libertadores trophy at the stadium\u2019s center circle and gathered his teammates around it. They clasped hands, and they danced at the center of the soccer world. Their eyes did not leave the prize they had won. No, there will never be anything like this again.Perhaps that is for the best. As much as River will cherish it, treasure it, immortalize it in song, and as much as this felt like a significant moment for South American soccer \u2014 proof that it retains the appeal to gather 62,000 people in one of Europe\u2019s great stadiums at 10 days\u2019 notice \u2014 this was as much a warning as a celebration.Nor will it be, at least not while Boca Juniors have an appeal lodged with the Court of Arbitration for Sport that, if successful, would see River forced to forfeit the trophy, turning the most precious triumph in its history into the most bitter defeat.They did so, in part, because of Spain\u2019s large Argentine community, because of the frequent flights from Buenos Aires, and because they thought that only in Madrid \u2014 and perhaps Miami, though that option never extended beyond fantasy \u2014 could they stage the game safely while preserving so much of the flavor that makes Argentine soccer distinct.But just as the act of observing something distorts it, so too does moving it. Soccer \u2014 any sport \u2014 cannot be transported wholesale, airdropped somewhere else, and retain its true nature. It cannot be separated from its context and remain the same.Conmebol, the governing body for South American soccer, will regard this final, this opportunistic experiment, as a success. Fans had been flying into Madrid for days, not just from Argentina but from across Spain and the rest of Europe. On Friday night, thousands of River fans gathered at Plaza Mayor, in the heart of the city, as a show of strength, a little piece of Argentina in Europe\u2019s cobbled squares.On Saturday morning \u2014 just as they had in Buenos Aires the day the game was supposed to be played \u2014 fans in the red and white of River and the blue and yellow of Boca strolled in the winter sunshine at Plaza Mayor and at Puerta del Sol, mingling happily with the Christmas shoppers, with one another.Madrid\u2019s unofficial economy had stirred itself for the influx. Outside the Bernab\u00e9u, fans could buy half-and-half scarves, that great symbol of the gentrification of the game in Europe. Perhaps through novelty, or plain old-fashioned bafflement, they were selling well.Downtown, the stores that usually make their money selling trinkets to tourists had rolled out passable fakes of Boca and River jerseys; they had offers on commemorative T-shirts and sweatshirts and hats. The flags, the colors, of Boca and River ran together.Spain\u2019s security services had taken every possible precaution, under the circumstances. The main drag of the Paseo de la Castellana, the eight-lane highway that skims the Bernab\u00e9u, was closed all day. An area to its north had been reserved for River fans; Boca\u2019s had a spot to the south. Each had stages for live music, vendors offering food and drink. The idea was that, once inside, the fans would have no reason to leave, no chance to mix. When they eventually headed to the stadium, they had to pass through three security checks.Spain was not a passive force in this; there was a reason Real Madrid had made the Bernab\u00e9u available, free of charge, when Conmebol\u2019s president, Alejandro Dominguez, had suggested playing the game in Madrid. Argentina, with Uruguay and Paraguay, wants to host the 2030 World Cup. So, too, does Spain, alongside Portugal and possibly Morocco. Hosting the game Argentina could not manage offered a powerful parable.Only when Juan Quintero curled home, expertly, from the edge of the box did daylight appear. By that stage, one Boca player had been sent off, and another removed through injury. It had just nine players. It could not resist. And in the dying seconds, Mart\u00ednez raced clear, his place in immortality waiting.And yet, there was something missing. These were two Argentine teams, full of South American players, in front of a crowd of largely Argentine fans. It was not, though, a purely Argentine game so much as a sanitized, defanged version, some of its soul left behind somewhere over the Atlantic.That is not entirely a bad thing. No stadium in Argentina can match the Bernab\u00e9u for modernity, for comfort; it is not always a negative to treat fans like customers, with the respect that entails, though it does tend to come at too much of a cost. The security operation, too, felt more respectful, smoother, less high strung.But nor is it an altogether good thing, a European lesson for the South Americans to learn. Through one lens, this game was a warning for the future, the opening of a door to an era when UEFA, Conmebol\u2019s European counterpart, feels at liberty to move its Champions League final outside Europe, if showpiece games are made available to the highest bidder.But through another, it is the completion of the past, of the gentrification of soccer that has also swept through Europe over the last 20 years and that has served to take an organic, authentic passion and repackage it in a way that is more palatable, more readily consumable, more easily marketed.South America has not been immune to that, but it has managed to stave off its worst excesses. It has retained its passion and its color, what to European eyes looks like its authenticity \u2014 the good; and, as those River fans on the corner of Avenida Monroe proved two weeks ago, it has kept the bad, too.But, just as in Europe, all of that exists only in its context. It cannot be moved without being changed. In the Bernab\u00e9u, against the bright green of that perfect field, the colors seemed a little duller; in its steep stands, the noise was a little quieter. This was the Copa Libertadores, the Supercl\u00e1sico, but a doctored, Disney version: less exotic, more European; its tarnishes buffed, its edges smoothed.None of that will detract from River\u2019s victory. None of it will draw the elation from Mart\u00ednez\u2019s moment. Nor will it worry Conmebol, not particularly; this, after all, is just what it had wanted, a polished finale to a month of chaos. South America, the Copa Libertadores, at last, has a champion. For River, there will never be another game like this. For the rest of us, though, there will. There will be many, many more.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the city where the police were out in force. It was Buenos Aires, not Madrid.Advertisement"}

He notes that prosperity has raised people\u2019s expectations and access to information, even as it\u2019s helped the government forestall democratization: many citizens who might once have become dissidents have grown increasingly focused on their private lives and the opportunity to make money quickly, while party officials, who \u2018can often determine who succeeds and fails in the new capitalist economy,\u2019 wield \u2018tremendous leverage over the emerging class of private businessmen and entrepreneurs that might otherwise support political change.\u2019\u201dRead our review.Chinese Voices\u201cChina in Ten Words\u201d is a collection of essays in which Yu Hua \u201cdepicts a morally compromised nation, plagued by escalating unemployment, class polarization and endemic corruption and waste.

{"Headline": "The Case for a Mixed Economy", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe not everything should be privatized.Opinion ColumnistA mind is a terrible thing to lose, especially if the mind in question is president of the United States. But I feel like taking a break from that subject. So let\u2019s talk about something completely different, and probably irrelevant.I\u2019ve had several interviews lately in which I was asked whether capitalism had reached a dead end, and needed to be replaced with something else. I\u2019m never sure what the interviewers have in mind; neither, I suspect, do they. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re talking about central planning, which everyone considers discredited. And I haven\u2019t seen even an implausible proposal for a decentralized system that doesn\u2019t rely on price incentives and self-interest \u2013 i.e., a market economy with private property, which most people would consider capitalism.So maybe I\u2019m being dense or lacking in imagination, but it seems to be that the choice is still between markets and some kind of public ownership, maybe with some decentralization of control, but still more or less what we used to mean by socialism. And everyone either thinks of socialism as discredited, or pins the label on stuff \u2013 like social insurance programs \u2013 that isn\u2019t what we used to mean by the word.But I\u2019ve been wondering, exactly how discredited is socialism, really? True, nobody now imagines that what the world needs is the second coming of Gosplan. But have we really established that markets are the best way to do everything? Should everything be done by the private sector? I don\u2019t think so. In fact, there are some areas, like education, where the public sector clearly does better in most cases, and others, like health care, in which the case for private enterprise is very weak. Add such sectors up, and they\u2019re quite big.In other words, while Communism failed, there\u2019s still a pretty good case for a mixed economy \u2013 and public ownership/control could be a significant, although not majority, component of that mix. My back of the envelope says that given what we know about economic performance, you could imagine running a fairly efficient economy that is only 2/3 capitalist, 1/3 publicly owned \u2013 i.e., sort-of-kind-of socialist.Looking at private sector employment, we find that another 15 percent of the work force is employed in education, health, and social assistance. Now, a large part of that employment is paid for by public money \u2013 think Medicare dollars spent at private hospitals. Much of the rest is paid for by private insurers, which exist in their current role only thanks to large tax subsidies and regulation.And there\u2019s no reason to think the private sector does these things better than the public. Private insurers don\u2019t obviously provide a service that couldn\u2019t be provided, probably more cheaply, by national health insurance. Private hospitals aren\u2019t obviously either better or more efficient than public. For-profit education is actually a disaster area.So you could imagine an economy in which the bulk of education, health, and social assistance currently in the private sector became public, with most people at least as well off as they are now.Then there are other private activities that could plausibly be public. Utilities are heavily regulated, and in some cases are publicly owned already. Private health insurance directly employs hundreds of thousands of people, with doubtful social purpose. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing a few others.Put all of this together, and as I said, you could see an economy working well with something like 1/3 public ownership.Now, this wouldn\u2019t satisfy people who hate capitalism. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t even live up to the old slogan about government controlling the economy\u2019s \u201ccommanding heights.\u201d This would be more like government running the boiler in the basement.

{"Headline": "A Funeral for a President, and a Fleeting Unity for a Nation", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Presidential funerals provide a moment for Washington \u2014 and the nation \u2014 to pause and embrace the better side of our politics.But instead of dwelling on the inevitable presidential failures, the highly choreographed spectacle of a presidential funeral \u2014 a fitting bookend to the heavily scripted inaugural ritual \u2014 offers Americans a welcome chance to reflect on the nature and value of public service, to celebrate the achievements of the person and the office.In this way, presidents can be more unifying in death then they ever were in life.\u201cWe might not agree in historical hindsight on what they did or how they did it,\u201d said Matt Costello, a historian with the White House Historical Association. \u201cBut they were always trying to do what is best for the country.\u201d\u201cIn a strange way,\u201d he said, \u201cit is not about the past. It is looking forward to unity and cohesion and to remind people of what makes us Americans.\u201dThat was a sentiment shared by many of the thousands who visited the Capitol through the night to pay their respects to Mr. Bush, even though some might not remember the specifics of a presidency that was crucial to the reunification of Germany and the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait but that struggled with the economy at home.\u201cThere\u2019s not a perfect life or a perfect country,\u201d Pamela Timus, who works at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said as she was leaving Tuesday morning after paying her respects to Mr. Bush. \u201cThis president worked for American citizens and the good of the country.\u201d\u201cAll decisions he made may not have been favored by all Americans,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it was in the best interest of the country.\u201dThe historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said state funerals helped Americans pay tribute not just to a lost leader, but to their shared heritage and the possibilities ahead.\u201cI think it is a time when we remember the presidency itself, the whole institution of the presidency as something that binds us,\u201d she said. \u201cThese moments allow you to feel the history of the country and the belonging. We belong to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and the forefathers, that is part of who we are. This president is part of that family line.\u201dLike Reagan and Ford, the presidents before them and those still to come, Mr. Bush took steps as president that infuriated some Americans, ended badly and cost lives and money. But he also served with dignity and distinction in the military and various public posts, tried to stir Americans to greater civic involvement and enacted economic policies that paid off while posing a distinct threat to his own political fortunes.\u201cWhether people agree with every policy that President Bush undertook, you always knew that he did what he thought was in the country\u2019s interest even when it was politically disadvantageous to him, such as the budget agreement with the Democrats,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, referring to the 1990 agreement that broke his \u201cno new taxes\u201d pledge. \u201cRight or wrong on the policy, that was a very brave action to take, and it probably cost him the election.\u201d\u201cMy hope is that as we take this pause to honor this great man, that we think about how he governed, the respect and dignity that he showed to adversaries and to friends alike,\u201d said Ms. Collins, who paid a final visit to Mr. Bush at his home in Kennebunkport, Me., in September. \u201cGeorge Bush represented an era where you could disagree with someone but still respect and even like the person, where a search for a common ground was applauded, not denigrated.\u201dShe is hardly alone in hoping that the focus on Mr. Bush\u2019s humanity and willingness to compromise spurs some introspection in Washington in a time of intense and volatile political warfare. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who as the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee is involved with coordinating memorial events, said the funeral could be Mr. Bush\u2019s \u201cfinal gift\u201d to government as a remembrance of the virtues of compromise when Congress is trying to resolve multiple year-end legislative conflicts after a contentious midterm election.\u201cHe makes everyone step back and remember why we are really here,\u201d said Ms. Klobuchar, who added that events such as the funeral enable \u201cus to step back as a country and remember those who have done extraordinary things like George H.W. Bush. If we don\u2019t do things like this, we have lost our sense of democracy.\u201dBut recent experience does not give much occasion for optimism that any sense of unity and common ground will be long lasting.The August funeral of Senator John McCain, which had all the trappings of a state funeral, also marked a moment of bipartisanship, but it dissipated quickly as the Senate plunged into a brutal Supreme Court confirmation fight and President Trump struck a combative tone for the midterm elections. Mr. Trump played no role in the McCain observances \u2014 he was purposely excluded by the family \u2014 but he plans to attend to Mr. Bush\u2019s funeral, though he is not speaking at it.Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who served in the first Bush administration and visited the ailing president this summer at the family home in Maine, said the potential for bipartisanship remained, despite today\u2019s extreme conflict. And, he said, the intense political environment now is all the more reason to appreciate the character of Mr. Bush.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a guy who didn\u2019t have strong views,\u201d Mr. Portman said. \u201cHe did, and he campaigned hard. But when it came time for governing, he said, \u2018Let\u2019s figure out how to make it work.\u2019 I think we will get back to the center at some point. We have to figure out how to get along here.\u201dThat is a sentiment Mr. Bush would no doubt would welcome as his legacy.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zanele Muholi: Paying Homage to the History of Black Women", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRace storiesThrough self-portraits, Zanele Muholi reimagines black identity and challenges the oppressive standards of beauty that often ignore people of color. Zanele Muholi\u2019s face is luminous \u2014 and framed by a headdress of inflated latex gloves. The image is typical of the Johannesburg-based photographer\u2019s theatrical self-portraits, where hairstyles, headgear and objects as diverse as a majestic necklace of cowrie shells or a wooden stool worn as a hat or crown suggest multiple personas and layers of historic, cultural and political meaning.As Muholi has said, you might look at the latex gloves, \u201cand think of balloons and play, rather than the constraints of work and domesticity or the need to breathe, to feel deflated.\u201d Characteristic of Muholi\u2019s work, that photograph is about all of these things, and much more.The image is one of more than 90 self-portraits in \u201cZanele Muholi: Somnyama Ngonyama, Hail the Dark Lioness\u201d (Aperture), a monograph accompanying a traveling exhibition organized by Ren\u00e9e Mussai for Autograph ABP in London and now at the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art in Atlanta through Dec. 8. In addition to photographs, the book contains essays, criticism and poems by more than 20 curators, art historians and writers.The self-portraits function on various levels and pay homage to the history of black women in Africa and beyond, the dark lionesses of the book\u2019s title. They reimagine black identity in ways that are largely personal but inevitably political. And they challenge the stereotypes and oppressive standards of beauty that often ignore people of color. \u201cAll this stereotyping inspires a deep-seated hatred of the black body, from head to toe: eyes, lips, everything, your features,\u201d said Muholi in a recent interview with Ms. Mussai\u201cI wanted to use my face so that people will always remember just how important our black faces are, when confronted by them,\u201d said Muholi, who prefers to be called a \u201cvisual activist\u201d rather than an artist. \u201cFor this black face to be recognized as belonging to a sensible, thinking being in their own right.\u201dMuholi\u2019s portraits inspire by example, self-discovery and resistance. They build on earlier series devoted to visual activism, such as \u201cFaces and Phases,\u201d \u201cInnovative Women\u201d and \u201cTransfigures,\u201d which documented black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex South Africans, in response to the persecution, violence and invisibility they endured.\u201cToo often I find we are being mimicked, and distorted, by the privileged other,\u201d said Muholi. \u201cWe are here; we have our own voices; we have our own lives.\u201d In this regard, the photographer wants to \u201cteach people about our history, to rethink what history is all about, to reclaim it for ourselves, to encourage people to use artistic tools such as cameras as weapons to fight back.\u201d Those words echo Gordon Parks, who more than a half-century ago called the camera his \u201cweapon of choice\u201d against racism, poverty and injustice.Using richly symbolic poses, props and situations, Muholi\u2019s self-portraits represent African identity as nuanced and incongruous \u2014 from a stoic figure engulfed by a snakelike vacuum-cleaner hose to a series of pictures dedicated to Muholi\u2019s late sister, Basizeni, images that serve both as elegies and as \u201cconversations with the legion of \u2018ancestral selves,\u2019\u201d as Ms. Mussai wrote.Among the most poignant images in \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama\u201d are those honoring the photographer\u2019s late mother, Bester Muholi. In several pictures, Muholi wears headdresses composed of scouring pads or clothespins that allude to Bester\u2019s work as a domestic. These images push the envelope of traditional portraiture, serving as respectful homage, pointed satire and thoughtful commentary on a difficult life made worse by apartheid.\u201cBester\u2019s headdress appears like a costume that undermines the pretensions of portraiture,\u201d the art historian Tamar Garb wrote in the book. \u201cBut it also asserts the defining role that she played in an economy of subservience and spectacle. The figure is framed by her labor, haunted by pictorial precedents, captured by the gaze of her desiring daughter, for whom the love of mother was always shared, never enough, gone too soon.\u201dWhen posting images online, Muholi often uses the hashtag #blackbeauty, an affirmation of how the artist is taking control of an attribute too often defined and represented by outsiders. Muholi implores viewers, like the liberated lioness of \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama,\u201d to question and free themselves from oppressive aesthetics.Muholi hopes that \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama\u201d will motivate black people facing racism, sexism and homophobia in Africa and beyond to resist and transcend the cultural limitations imposed on them.\u201cThe series touches on beauty, relates to historical incidents, giving affirmation to those who are doubting \u2014 whenever they speak to themselves, when they look in the mirror \u2014 to say, \u2018You are worthy, you count, nobody has the right to undermine you: because of your being, because of your race, because of your gender expression, because of your sexuality, because of all that you are.\u2019\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cut One Year Later: What Happened?", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany corporations made good on promises to raise wages and pay bonuses. But others announced layoffs, even as the $1.5 trillion tax cut added billions to their bottom lines.The fawning faded quickly. Analysts noted that the handouts to workers amounted to a relatively small share of the roughly $200 billion in federal income taxes that corporations avoided thanks to the cuts. Wages across the economy ticked up, but not by nearly as much as some Republicans had promised when they voted for the law. Capital investment surged at the start of the year, but the rate of growth fell sharply in the third quarter. Some workers did reap rewards from the law, as many companies followed through on \u2014 and even exceeded \u2014 their promises to raise wages and pay bonuses. Yet other firms have announced layoffs, despite reporting higher profits and billions of dollars in tax savings. While the long-term effects remain to be seen, the evidence so far does not suggest the sustained investment and productivity growth boosts that Republicans and supply-side economists predicted. Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, are cutting their growth forecasts for 2019, in part because of the waning effect of the tax cuts. Here\u2019s a look at what companies promised and what has come to pass as we head into Year Two of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Corporate earnings over the last several quarters show why companies were such enthusiastic cheerleaders of the tax cuts. By cutting the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent, the law has reduced the effective tax rate that many companies pay.\u201cThis tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs,\u201d Randall Stephenson, the chairman and chief executive of AT&T, said last year, as the company announced plans to award worker bonuses and increase capital spending. Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told workers in a memo last year that the new law would reduce the bank\u2019s tax rate, and that \u201cin the spirit of shared success, we intend to pass some of those benefits along immediately\u201d to workers.Job creation accelerated across the economy this year, compared to 2017, including at several large companies that celebrated the tax cuts by expanding hiring plans. But strong growth has not spared the jobs of thousands of American workers at large companies where executives have cited automation, outsourcing and product-line restructuring to explain why they reduced employment in a year when tax cuts raised their profit margins. Walmart increased its starting wage to $11 an hour, gave bonuses of up to $1,000 each for associates and expanded some worker benefits like parental leave. The wage increase amounted to $300 million more than the company had planned before the cuts. Its employment levels have not changed over the year.AT&T handed out $200 million in worker bonuses and contributed $800 million to its employee and retiree medical trust fund. It increased its dividend for the 35th straight year. It also appears to be shedding employees. Officials at the Communications Workers of America, the union that represents AT&T workers, say the company has cut more than 10,000 union jobs this year, accelerating its pace of cuts from last year. Verizon has paid down corporate debt by $4.2 billion this year, as it said it would after the tax law passed, and granted employees 50 shares of Verizon stock, a move worth more than $400 million.White House officials predict that investment growth will bounce back next year, driving further productivity gains and lifting wages for workers, based in part on the high levels of planned investment that many business surveys continue to forecast. \u201cWhat we expect to see from the second part of the tax bill, which is the lower cost to capital and the higher investment, is just higher wage growth that\u2019s sustained,\u201d Kevin A. Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, recently told reporters.That favor has receded. In December, SurveyMonkey found, 47 percent of Americans approved of the law, while 46 percent disapproved. Republicans still praise the law and its benefits to businesses in floor speeches and news releases, but they did not make it a dominant campaign issue in November\u2019s midterm elections. Support for the law, odd as it may seem, has fallen slightly from the peak among Republicans \u2014 and risen slightly among Democrats. Overall economic confidence was higher in the 2018 surveys than in 2017, but \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we can attribute that to the tax reform passage,\u201d said Laura Wronksi, one of the SurveyMonkey pollsters. She noted that Republicans have grown more economically optimistic even as their support for the law has fallen.Mr. Hassett said \u2014 as most economists have long predicted \u2014 that he did not expect to see this year\u2019s wave of bonus announcements repeated next year. Few companies have followed Bank of America in announcing another batch of them.But companies are still talking about the law \u2014 at least to shareholders. An analysis of earnings calls by Hamilton Place Strategies found that in the third quarter of this year, large companies discussed tax reform more than any policy topic, including the tariffs that have dominated headlines and market anxiety for the past several months.

{"Headline": "A China Hawk Gains Prominence as Trump Confronts Xi on Trade", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Michael Pillsbury had just finished a rib-eye salad at the Cosmos Club on Tuesday when he received a text message from the White House: \u201cThe president is trying to reach you. Call back.\u201dA day later, Mr. Pillsbury huddled in the Oval Office with President Trump and senior members of the White House economic team ahead of a pivotal weekend meeting in Argentina between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.For more than an hour, Mr. Trump, Mr. Pillsbury and advisers including Steven Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross, Larry Kudlow, Jared Kushner and Peter Navarro, who joined remotely from California, strategized about negotiations with China that could determine the direction of a trade war that has gripped the world\u2019s two largest economies, spooked global markets and shaken diplomatic relations between Beijing and Washington.Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi are expected to dine on Saturday evening at the G-20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires, where they will talk about the possibility of a trade truce. The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, and the rate of some of the levies is set to increase to 25 percent in January, from 10 percent. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 an additional $267 billion \u2014 if a compromise cannot be reached.Mr. Trump has received conflicting advice from his trade team about how to approach China but it is Mr. Pillsbury\u2019s counsel that the president is most likely to keep in mind.He has emerged as a key sounding board for Mr. Trump, who has publicly referred to Mr. Pillsbury as \u201cthe leading authority on China\u201d on multiple occasions. (Three times, by Mr. Pillsbury\u2019s count, who said sales of his 2015 manifesto on China have soared as a result.)\u201cWe could not have shifted the entire apparatus to this confrontational mode with China if it wasn\u2019t for the intellectual architecture of \u2018A Hundred-Year Marathon,\u2019\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist who recruited Mr. Pillsbury as an adviser during the transition and used to hand out copies of his book around the White House.The book, which was published while Mr. Pillsbury was advising the Obama administration as a Pentagon consultant, presents an apocalyptic view of China as a clever enemy with a stealthy plan to overtake the United States as the dominant world power by 2049 \u2014 a century after the People\u2019s Republic was founded.At the time of its release, Mr. Pillsbury\u2019s book was widely mocked as fringe and it drew criticism as subpar scholarship.Mr. Pillsbury disputes this critique and considers it fraudulent.In his book, he describes China\u2019s approach as one of deception, in which its leaders use America\u2019s belief that it can democratize China to \u201cmislead and manipulate American policymakers to obtain intelligence and military, technological and economic assistance.\u201dMr. Pillsbury plays into this argument with Mr. Trump, arguing that the clash between the United States and China has evolved precisely because Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda to restore America\u2019s \u201cgreatness\u201d is so directly at odds with Mr. Xi\u2019s own political doctrine for modernizing China, known officially as \u201cXi Jinping Thought.\u201d\u201cThey take \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 very seriously,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury, referring to the Chinese, said in an interview this week. \u201cTo them, it\u2019s a violation of the new model of great power relations, it\u2019s a violation of the new era and it\u2019s a violation of \u2018Xi Jinping Thought,\u2019 if you will.\u201dTall, bald and broad-shouldered, Mr. Pillsbury has served the United States government in varying levels of prominence as a Chinese and national security expert in administrations dating to Richard Nixon\u2019s. Fluent in Mandarin with a doctorate in political science from Columbia University, Mr. Pillsbury, 73, gained notoriety among China specialists for his ability to gain access to Chinese intelligence and military officials and his knack for finding and translating archived documents that shed light on China\u2019s thinking.And, like some of those in the Trump administration, Mr. Pillsbury also once considered himself a \u201cpanda hugger\u201d \u2014 someone who thought that China could become an economic and political ally whose growth should be supported.But Mr. Pillsbury began to take a darker view of China \u2014 and its ambitions \u2014 later in his career, after interviews and discussions with top military and intelligence officials in Beijing. And he has found a soul mate in Mr. Trump \u2014 whose relentless desire to upend America\u2019s trade relationship with China and protect domestic power has produced a trade war that has no natural path to resolution.Mr. Pillsbury was brought into Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit during the transition period in 2016, after the president-elect spoke by telephone with Taiwan\u2019s president, breaking protocol and angering China.He has worked closely with Matthew Pottinger, the senior director of Asian affairs on the National Security Council, and the White House considered offering him a formal role, according to a former official, but there were concerns about his ability to get a security clearance. Mr. Pillsbury said that it remained a possibility and that he would like to be the ambassador to China someday.As Mr. Trump increasingly blurs economic security and national security \u2014 viewing China\u2019s economic rise as a national security threat to America \u2014 Mr. Pillsbury\u2019s knowledge of China has become even more in demand.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team is deeply divided on how to approach China, with nationalists like Mr. Navarro and Robert E. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, often clashing with Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Mr. Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, who have offered more conciliatory approaches.Mr. Pillsbury, whose fairly dark view of China has found resonance, tries to explain to White House officials that China\u2019s leadership has its own internal divisions and advises Mr. Trump on how to leverage those splits to gain an advantage, he said.When Mr. Navarro, with whom he plays tennis and who featured him in his movie \u201cCrouching Tiger,\u201d asked him how to rankle the Chinese earlier this year, Mr. Pillsbury begrudgingly told him that using the term \u201ceconomic aggression\u201d would grab their attention because the word \u201caggression\u201d has a more sinister meaning in Mandarin.\u201cTo try to get them to sign a piece of paper saying they\u2019ve done all these bad things is futile,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury said. \u201cIt gets back to the goal of the president. If the goal is to humiliate the Chinese and tell the base we\u2019re stopping this raping of our country, this approach won\u2019t work.\u201dSome have suggested that Mr. Pillsbury\u2019s more doveish tone is part of an effort to stay in the good graces of the Chinese. He has traveled to China four times in the last 18 months and is planning to go again in December, when he will share insights about the United States with Chinese think tanks.These days, Mr. Pillsbury likes to boast \u2014 with a smile \u2014 that he has become a \u201chumble, modest fellow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Going Nowhere Fast on Climate, Year After Year ", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree decades after a top climate scientist warned Congress of the dangers of global warming, greenhouse gas emissions keep rising and so do global temperatures.Mr. Bledsoe lectures on environmental policy at American University.By that, he meant that humans were responsible.His testimony made headlines around the United States and the world. But in the time since, greenhouse gas emissions, the global temperature average and cost of climate-related heat, wildfires, droughts, flooding and hurricanes have continued to rise.To avoid this, greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall by nearly half from 2010 levels in the next 12 years and reach a net of zero by 2050. But in the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, President Trump continues to question the science of climate change, and his administration is rolling back emissions limits on power plants and fuel economy standards on cars and light trucks, while pushing to accelerate the use of fossil fuels. Other major nations around the world aren\u2019t cutting emissions quickly enough, either.So what has happened over the last 30 years? Progress has been made in fits and starts, but not nearly enough has been done to confront the planet-altering magnitude of what we have unleashed. Here\u2019s a look at some of what has occurred:With its rapid industrialization, China surpasses the United States as the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. Congress raises auto fuel efficiency standards for the first time since 1976.In his acceptance speech to become the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney mocks President Obama\u2019s climate efforts: \u201cPresident Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.\u201dA United Nations study finds that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the level required to keep temperature rise below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 2 degrees Celsius, the cost of climate change adaptation in developing countries is likely to reach two to three times previous estimates of $70 billion to $100 billion per year by 2050The Republican-controlled Congress votes to phase out tax credits for wind and solar energy by 2020; various tax incentives for fossil fuel production remain.

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Moves to Restrict Food Stamp Access the Farm Bill Protected", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would seek to put in place more stringent work requirements for adults who rely on food stamps, even as the president signed a sweeping farm bill in which lawmakers had rejected stricter rules.The administration, which along with conservatives had fought to include stricter work requirements in the farm bill, continued to argue that food stamps were never meant to be a way of life and that able-bodied adults should be able to find jobs in a healthy economy.\u201cLong-term reliance on government assistance has never been part of the American dream,\u201d Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said in a statement. \u201cMoving people to work is common-sense policy, particularly at a time when the unemployment rate is at a generational low.\u201dThe proposed rule drew ire from Democrats, who accused the Trump administration of steamrollering a rare bipartisan compromise and ignoring Congress\u2019s mandate to leave the program and its 40 million recipients untouched.\u201cAfter a very rough back and forth on that particular issue, basically we left the program alone without restricting people from being able to get it,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, one of the negotiators on the bill\u2019s bicameral committee. \u201cNow you have Secretary Perdue doing essentially what was, in a bipartisan way, agreed not to do. He needs to know what the intent of Congress is and follow it.\u201dSenator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, accused Mr. Perdue in a bluntly worded statement of \u201cblatantly\u201d ignoring the bipartisan farm bill and disregarding \u201cover 20 years of history giving states flexibility to request waivers based on local job conditions.\u201d\u201cThe administration may portray its proposal as a reasonable \u2018work requirement,\u2019\u201d Mr. Greenstein said. \u201cBut as noted, most states don\u2019t offer these people any job, training opportunity or slot in a work program, and people who are \u2018playing by the rules\u2019 and looking hard for a job are cut off nonetheless.\u201dBy contrast, House Republicans, who had included tougher work requirements in their version of the farm bill, cheered the decision, and argued that the final, bipartisan version left the door open for Mr. Perdue to intervene.Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, the Republicans\u2019 chief deputy whip, denied that the move amounted to a partisan circumvention of Congress.\u201cI think a fresh view from the Department of Agriculture at that process and at that data is a healthy and good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWas it a partisan move when the Obama administration expanded the waivers?\u201dRepresentative K.

A decade of political self-indulgence at home risks leaving us without a credible voice in Asia.At a time when China, our major trading partner, is ascendant and our traditional allies in the North Atlantic are in retreat, Australia should be stepping up as a champion of openness. But our politicians are turning inward, and now the beleaguered conservative government of Scott Morrison is threatening to reduce immigration, our main engine of growth.But our tawdry domestic politics undermines these natural advantages by corroding our global standing. Australia has changed prime ministers five times since 2010, four times in party back-room coups and only once at a general election.We are reminded of our ambiguous place in the Asia-Pacific each time we change leaders. Each new prime minister seems to blunder into a diplomatic spat with our nearest neighbor, Indonesia, the new rising economic star of Asia and the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority country. Each unnecessary argument raises the risk of a more serious rupture between Canberra and Jakarta, as the politics of both countries are coarsened by their respective nationalist fringes.In previous disputes, Indonesians did not have the clout to harm Australia\u2019s interests. This time, however, the Indonesians are flexing their economic leverage \u2014 and Asia is watching.Mr. Joko has his own election to fight next year and cannot afford the perception at home that he has compromised the Palestinian cause. And so the history of these two Asian neighbors repeats in stalemate as short-term politics in both democracies prevents an easy resolution to the dispute.Australia has a direct stake in Indonesia\u2019s success. Our overriding interest is for Indonesia to remain an ally in the fight against regional terrorism, and to become an active partner in helping check the unilateral impulses of China.The key to this engagement is openness and mutual respect.Mr. Morrison displayed neither quality in his handling of the embassy dispute. At home, it might have been excused as a rookie error. But in the region, it reaffirmed a pattern of Australian insensitivity and unreliability.Five years earlier, it became public that Australia\u2019s intelligence agency had tapped the phone of the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and his wife, Ani Yudhoyono. The prime minister at the time, Tony Abbott, refused to apologize.It took the better part of two years, and the replacement of the abrasive Mr. Abbott with the cosmopolitan Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister, to restore a full working relationship between the countries. That work was undone by Mr. Morrison.Australia\u2019s political class remains haunted by the sins of its founding fathers. When the nation was formed in 1901, the first significant piece of legislation was the White Australia Policy, which banned immigration from Asia. High tariffs were added to its cocktail of national self-harm, and it took decades to undo the economic and reputational damage. The last vestiges of racial selection in immigration were removed in 1973, and the tariff wall dismantled over the course of the 1990s.The present generation of members of Parliament has known only the open economic and social model. Only a handful have any experience of the last recession, which ended in 1991. Many believe that slashing immigration is an antidote to problems of congestion in the big cities. In New South Wales, for example, the conservative government is calling for a halving of immigration to the state.But any gratuitous cut in immigration threatens to cause a recession at home, and would be a reminder of that older Australia that thought it could have it both ways: as an exporter to the region who didn\u2019t want its people in return.George Megalogenis is an author and a commentator.

It also is a crucial indicator of the impact that poverty and the resulting inequities can have on personal and environmental health, she added.In a conversation on \u201cFixing the Food Supply Chain,\u201d led by Sam Sifton, food editor of The New York Times, Ms. Suh and Walter Robb, a former chief executive of Whole Foods Markets, made the argument that it makes moral, social and economic sense to ensure equitable access to fresh food in communities throughout the United States.\u201cPeople are voting with their forks, and that is changing the way we think and the opportunities we have for innovation,\u201d said Ms. Suh, who works as an advocate for environmental and public health. \u201cYou can make conscious choices every single day, and that has collectively changed the world.\u201dMany people do not have the access and economic viability to select healthful food, making it essential for advocates to work toward a more equitable market, she said.In New Orleans, there is one grocery store for every 14,000 residents, and half of the city\u2019s population has no grocery store within three miles of where they live, Mr. Sifton noted. (A 2012 Tulane University study found that New Orleans lagged behind the national ratio, which was one supermarket for every 8,500 residents.)That lack of access is made worse by a lack of reliable public transportation, Mr. Robb said, adding that both of those factors are prevalent in cities throughout the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s a disparity that is troubling because of its impact on health,\u201d he said.It makes economic sense for retailers, investors and entrepreneurs to have a vested interest in this issue, said Mr. Robb of Stonewall Robb Advisors, an investment and advising firm for food businesses.\u201cFood is the most robust sector in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have to eat.\u201dAs an example of a successful retail move, he cited Whole Foods\u2019 move into Midtown Detroit in 2013, adding that \u201cWall Street laughed\u201d at the time.Retailers cannot just drop into communities, he said. Instead, they should work with local food policy groups to develop relationships so that they can better understand a market\u2019s needs.\u201cReal work happens through partnerships,\u201d he said.Something that extends the life of produce can change a retailer\u2019s mind about carrying it, he said. \u201cThe reason they don\u2019t want to do it is because it goes bad and they have to throw it out, and that costs money.\u201dFood waste, access and safety are affected by a wide variety of public policies from the regulation of pesticides and standardization of food labeling to recognition of the role that immigration laws play, Ms. Suh said.For example, she said, regulating pesticides and promoting more natural and sustainable farming practices supports the health of the farmworker, the communities that surround the farms and the retail customers themselves.\u201cSystemwide approaches are needed to meet the demands and needs of the whole world,\u201d said Ms. Suh, who, before joining the N.R.D.C. in 2016, was assistant secretary for policy, management and budget at the Interior Department.Ann Maloney is a reporter for NOLA.com | The Times Picayune.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Four Questions for the Year Ahead", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewUncertainty abounds, especially about a few big policy questions. Here are four questions we may learn the answers to in the months to come.When will the Fed stop?Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has been raising its target for the federal funds rate, slowly and steadily. Its goal is to return interest rates to more normal levels, after a long period of roughly zero percent rates following the financial crisis and recession of 2008-9.At some point, Fed policymakers will say they\u2019ve done enough. But when? The data is offering conflicting signals.How will Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, balance these risks? Stay tuned.How will the trade shenanigans end?I can imagine three possible endgames in Mr. Trump\u2019s trade skirmishes.The best outcome is for the president to get some serious concessions from bad actors. For example, fearing worse outcomes like punitive tariffs, China might agree to start respecting American intellectual property.A second, more likely outcome is that our trading partners accept some minor concessions, and Mr. Trump promotes the new agreements as magnificent deals and giant steps forward. This is what happened with the slightly updated Nafta, now rebranded as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.The third and most worrisome possible outcome is an escalation of global tensions and a retreat from the principles of open trade that have promoted growth in the United States and abroad over the past half-century.In other words, the open question about trade policy is whether Mr. Trump is crazy like a fox or just plain crazy.Will someone pay attention to festering problems?Some economic problems are like learning your house is infested with termites. You can delay dealing with the issue for a little while. But if you put it off indefinitely, the problem will only grow larger and more costly to solve.Two such problems are global climate change from human carbon emissions and the looming fiscal imbalance as more baby boomers retire and start collecting Social Security and Medicare. These problems are hardly a secret, but few in Washington want to talk about them.One approach is easy to envision. A tax on carbon emissions would encourage the movement toward cleaner energies and raise revenue for the public purse, helping address both problems.For elected officials, the easiest approach is to let the next homeowner deal with the termites. But next year, the 2020 presidential campaign will start heating up. Maybe some candidate will try to stand out from the crowd by taking the politically risky strategy of acting like a responsible adult.Which economic advisers will have the president\u2019s ear?I am no fan of President Trump. But I must admit that he has some solid economic advisers. That is reassuring news if, as some fear, the economy hits the skids over the next couple of years.But it is unclear how much the president listens to them. The problem is due in part to Mr. Trump\u2019s excessive confidence in his own judgments. Making matters worse is the role of Peter Navarro, a relatively unknown economist who became a presidential adviser because his idiosyncratic views on trade are consistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s isolationist leanings.If there is one thing that characterizes this White House, however, it is fluidity in staffing and influence. I am rooting for the coming ascendancy of Mr. Hassett and Mr. Kudlow. This is more a hope than a forecast. But I try to start every year on an optimistic note.N. Gregory Mankiw is the Robert M.

{"Headline": "How to Make the Trade War Even Worse", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy undermining the World Trade Organization\u2019s judges, the United States could destroy one of its best tools to hold China accountable.Ms. Hillman is a professor at Georgetown Law Center.Mr. Lighthizer, who is America\u2019s main negotiator in its current round of trade talks with China, is a longtime lawyer for the steel industry, which for years has complained that the W.T.O. makes it too difficult for the United States to impose trade remedies for unfair practices. The seven-member appellate body hears appeals in disputes between W.T.O. members. But rather than fix the problems, Mr. Lighthizer appears to prefer blowing up the entire system.At a meeting of the W.T.O.\u2019s General Council in mid-December, the European Union and 11 nations, including China, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, proposed changes to the body\u2019s dispute settlement system in response to American complaints. They hoped the amendments would convince the United States to allow vacancies on the appellate panel to be filled.That creates the risk of turning every W.T.O. dispute into a mini-trade war. Rather than waiting for the impasse over the judges to be resolved, countries will take trade disputes into their own hands, engaging in retaliation and counter-retaliation that could escalate indefinitely. It also signals a desire by the Trump administration to return to an unsustainable might-makes-right system.This threat to the dispute settlement system comes just when the United States needs it most. Without it, America will have no mechanism to hold China accountable for its persistent theft of intellectual property, its rampant use of subsidies or its cybersecurity breaches. And the United States will have no forum in which to defend the interests of American businesses when China insists on transfers of critical technology as the price for approvals for joint venture licenses or other permits to do business in China.The United States is on the verge of major victories at the W.T.O. for American farmers in challenges to Chinese agriculture subsidies and to discriminatory restraints on American exports of wheat, corn and rice. All China needs to do to prevent those rulings from becoming binding obligations is to appeal them to the soon-to-be nonexistent appellate panel, potentially setting off another trade war.This belligerence toward the W.T.O. comes even though the United States has won more W.T.O. cases than any other country. America relies on the W.T.O. to protect the ability of American farmers, workers and intellectual property owners to export their goods and services without fear of being discriminated against simply because they are American.The intransigence of Mr. Lighthizer and other trade hard-liners in the Trump administration must be challenged. Members of Congress and their constituents \u2014 farmers, workers and corporations \u2014 need to fight for a system of trading rules and a mechanism to enforce them that benefits everyone. Leaders here and abroad should press the United States and China to bring their trade war into the W.T.O. And if all else fails, the members of the W.T.O. should band together to appoint appellate judges over the United States\u2019 unilateral objection.Trade and trade disputes should take place under predictable and clear rules that can be fairly enforced. The world has such a system with the W.T.O., and we should not allow it to be destroyed. History shows that the alternative is resolution of trade wars through much more destructive means.Jennifer Hillman is a professor at Georgetown Law Center, a former member of the World Trade Organization\u2019s appellate body and a former ambassador and general counsel in the Office of the United States Trade Representative.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot so long ago, corporate leaders understood they had a stake in the country\u2019s prosperity.At the time, almost nobody took postwar prosperity for granted. The world had just endured 15 years of depression and war. Many Americans were worried that the end of wartime production, combined with the return of job-seeking soldiers, would plunge the economy into a new slump.\u201cToday victory is our purpose,\u201d Benton wrote. \u201cTomorrow our goal will be jobs, peacetime production, high living standards and opportunity.\u201d That goal, he wrote, depended on American businesses accepting \u201cnecessary and appropriate government regulation,\u201d as well as labor unions. It depended on companies not earning their profits \u201cat the expense of the welfare of the community.\u201d It depended on rising wages.These leftist-sounding ideas weren\u2019t based on altruism. The Great Depression and the rise of European fascism had scared American executives. Many had come to believe that unrestrained capitalism was dangerous \u2014 to everyone. The headline on Benton\u2019s article was, \u201cThe Economics of a Free Society.\u201dAnd the economy \u2014 and American business \u2014 boomed during this period, just as Benton and his fellow chieftains had predicted.Warren wants an economy in which companies again invest in their workers and communities.

{"Headline": "Turkey Threatens Incursion Into Syria, Raising U.S. Concerns", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 The Turkish president is threatening to mount a new incursion into northern Syria, accusing the United States of failing to tackle the security threats Turkey faces in the region.Turkish commando units were deploying Friday to the border with northeastern Syria, the Turkish news media reported, raising the possibility of an inadvertent confrontation with American troops operating in the same area.Turkey and the United States, NATO allies, both oppose the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. But they back rival local forces in Syria: Turkey supports the Free Syrian Army, a mainly Arab rebel force, while the United States is allied with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.In a phone call with President Trump, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey expressed concerns on Friday over the actions and presence of the Kurdish militia in northeastern Syria, the Turkish presidency said. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly demanded that American forces stop supporting the Syrian Kurdish fighters.\u201cIf there is a threat against us there, which there is, the response to this threat will be immediate,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said Friday in a speech to representatives of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul. \u201cEither they will demolish those terror groups or we will,\u201d he added in a reference to the United States and its Kurdish allies.The White House issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan had agreed to \u201ccontinue coordinating to achieve our respective security objectives in Syria.\u201dA Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Sean Robertson, has warned that any unilateral military action in Syria\u2019s northeast would be unacceptable and a source of grave concern, \u201cparticularly as U.S. personnel may be present or in the vicinity.\u201dIn addition to some 2,000 military personnel, a team of up to 20 American civilians helps run stabilization programs in northeastern Syria, working to restart utilities and clear rubble in areas captured from the Islamic State.Turkey, which has been fighting the separatist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., in Turkey for three decades, has accused the United States of bolstering the group by arming and training its Syrian affiliate, the Y.P.G., which forms the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The United States considers the P.K.K. a terrorist group, but says the Y.P.G. is the force in Syria most capable of fighting the Islamic State.American Special Operations forces are working with the Syrian Democratic Forces to combat remnants of the Islamic State in eastern Syria. Even as Turkey was threatening military action, the Syrian Democratic Forces announced that its fighters had taken control of Hajin, the last town in Syria held by the Islamic State.Mostapha Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, said that the group would resist any Turkish intervention, which he said would force it to halt the fight in Hajin.\u201cWe will retaliate if attacked,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe won\u2019t give up to the Turkish. We hope the Turks will stop their threats, but if they decide to commit foolishness and continue their offensive, the battle in Hajin will definitely stop.\u201dThat would give ISIS \u201cmore freedom to redeploy and expand,\u201d he said.During Syria\u2019s nearly eight-year conflict, Kurds have carved out an autonomous territory in the country\u2019s north along the Turkish border. Mr. Erdogan, who considers this Kurdish-controlled territory hostile to Turkey, has repeatedly threatened military action against the mainly Kurdish units in northeastern Syria.Mr. Erdogan first announced the operation on Wednesday. \u201cWe will start our incursion to save east of the Euphrates from the separatist terror group within days,\u201d he said.But he assured the United States that its troops would never be a target. And in their phone call on Friday, the Turkish and American leaders agreed on the need for more effective cooperation on Syria, the Turkish president\u2019s office said.A Turkish commando unit with 50 trucks was heading to the southeastern Turkish town of Sanliurfa on Friday, Turkish news agencies reported. Troops arrived in Akcakale, a Turkish town on the Syrian border, residents reached by telephone said.Turkey began the operation with airstrikes Thursday against P.K.K. bases in northern Iraq, Mr. Erdogan said. He complained that the United States was delaying negotiations to resolve Turkey\u2019s concerns about Kurdish forces controlling affairs in the Syrian town of Manbij for more than two years.United States forces control the airspace and, with the Syrian Democratic Forces, most of the northeastern corner of Syria that lies east of the Euphrates River.\u201cTurkey has lost enough time in intervening in the terror swamp east of the Euphrates,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cAfter that, we do not have tolerance even for a daylong delay.\u201dThe Pentagon announced this week that it was establishing three observation posts along the Syrian-Turkish border to guard against any activity hostile to Turkey there. But that has not satisfied Turkey.American officials said Turkey appeared to be aiming at moving on the border towns of Tal Abayd and Ras al-Ayn, mainly Arab-populated towns where there is no United States presence, and advancing no more than nine miles into Syrian territory.One likely possibility would be that Syrian rebels of the Free Syrian Army, recently renamed the National Liberation Front, would advance on the ground backed by Turkish air power, one American official said.American officials said Turkey was not likely to target Manbij, which United States and Turkish troops have been jointly patrolling in recent weeks, and the Syrian-Kurdish town of Kobane on the Turkish border, where there is a large presence of American troops.An American official involved in Syria said the United States was preparing for the worst-case scenario and would move the civilians out if Turkey begins an incursion.Western officials in the region said Mr. Erdogan\u2019s saber-rattling could well be a tactic to stir up nationalist support ahead of municipal elections in March. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party risks losing some municipalities as the Turkish economy has faltered; heightening nationalist commentary has served him well in previous elections.But Mr. Erdogan may also be set on seizing more territory in northern Syria, which would give space for the Free Syrian Army to deploy and for some of the three million Syrian refugees in Turkey to return to their country.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, Ben Hubbard from Doha, Qatar, and Saad al-Nassife from Gaziantep, Turkey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the U.S. Stop China From Controlling the Next Internet Age?", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech executives worry China will turn to tit-for-tat arrests of Americans in response to the detention of Meng Wanzhou. And the worries don\u2019t stop there. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Imagine, if you will (and you should), a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing.\u201cIt\u2019s worrisome, because it\u2019s an escalation we did not need,\u201d one executive said, referring to the already tense trade talks between the two countries. \u201cWhat China will do, given all the existing tensions, is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201dNo one I spoke to would talk on the record, out of fear of antagonizing either side and also because no one knows exactly what is happening. But many expressed worry about the possibility of tit-for-tat arrests. While everyone focuses on the drama of the arrest \u2014 Ms. Meng was grabbed while changing planes at the airport \u2014 and its effect on the trade talks and stock prices, to my mind there is a much more important fight brewing, and it is about tech hegemony. Specifically, who will control the next internet age, and by whose rules will it be run?Until recently, that answer was clearly the United States, from which the Internet sprang, wiring the world together and, in the process, resulting in the greatest creation of power and wealth in history. While China has always had a strong technology sector, in recent years it has significantly escalated its investment, expertise and innovation, with major support from the government.That hand-in-glove relationship creates obvious issues, and the Trump administration is right to stop pretending that China does not present a threat both from security and innovation perspectives.But the high-profile arrest of Ms. Meng underscored a new and disturbing spiraling in the already complex relationship the tech industry has with China and the Trump administration.The Justice Department had been investigating Huawei on suspicion of having violated sanctions against exporting American technologies to Iran, and the arrest of Ms. Meng appears to be part of that effort. Since Huawei has become a global powerhouse in smartphones and equipment for the mobile networks, it\u2019s no surprise that scrutiny about whose interests it is serving would increase. The company\u2019s founder, and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which had long set off warning bells among American intelligence officials about Huawei\u2019s ties with the Chinese government. All this makes the move against Ms. Meng look like a particularly bold one and a message to China that the United States has come to play. The government has a lot to be concerned about. As critical 5G \u2014 fifth generation \u2014 wireless networks roll out over the world, many are being deployed by Huawei. These are the networks that will usher in the next age of innovation, and the idea of China \u2014 which pretty much exemplifies the surveillance economy \u2014 dominating that age is troubling.But I am perplexed about why the Trump administration has been such an embarrassment when it comes to the kind of actual leadership and vision needed to keep the United States at the forefront of the tech race. Our government\u2019s commitment to investment in what\u2019s coming next is the best counterpart to vigilance against competitors like China. Instead, we are seeing a loud but decidedly empty effort to promote the idea that tech manufacturing should return to the United States (it won\u2019t) and a very weak commitment to bringing qualified tech and science minds into the centers of power (a good pick for the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy has yet to be confirmed after being nominated this year).From where I sit, the sentiment in Silicon Valley seems to be: Good for the government for being tough on Chinese companies when they break the rules \u2014 that rule-breaking having been a longtime complaint of companies like Cisco and Apple. Vigilance is key, of course, but everyone would feel a lot more confident if the government was also focused on investing more in American innovation and if the crackdown looked less chaotic.Which is why you can imagine a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing. And our government should, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Willy Wonka and the Medical Software Factory", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe engineers at Epic Systems work on a campus full of childish whimsy but also sit in on open-heart surgery. Is this the indulgence of an oddball founder, or a better way to run an I.T. company?Epic Systems is a health care services provider with $2.7 billion in annual revenue. Its mathematician chief executive, Judy Faulkner, is a billionaire recluse who hosts P.T. Barnum-esque gatherings for clients. Those clients \u2014 big hospitals and health systems around the United States and more than a dozen overseas markets \u2014 are served by customer-service representatives known as BFFs. Every month, employees are compelled to gather in a subterranean chamber for two-and-a-half-hour staff meetings that have been likened to a megachurch experience. Workers are discouraged from ordering business materials on Amazon or living more than 45 minutes away from the office, in order to shorten commutes and keep Epic\u2019s wealth in the local economy.Epic\u2019s software is ubiquitous in doctors\u2019 offices and operating rooms, and companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet regularly hoover up its young engineers. Yet most people outside of the Madison environs, I\u2019d be confident to say, have never heard of the company.I certainly hadn\u2019t. I cover Wall Street, not health care or technology, and when I came across the privately held Epic this year I was consumed with questions. Who was this publicity-shy yet spectacle-loving C.E.O., and how did her theme-park sensibility coexist with the mundanity of health care billing protocols? Was Epic\u2019s odd culture a magnet for talent and clients, or was it an indulgence that kept the company from growing even bigger? In August, I traveled to Wisconsin to see what this 1,100-acre Midwestern behemoth might be hiding.When I arrived in Epic\u2019s hometown, Verona, two beaming receptionists at the Fairfield Inn tried to offer me something called the \u201cEpic discount.\u201d When I said I couldn\u2019t accept anything of value from the company, they clarified that the special rate was a gesture of gratefulness from the hotel, on account of the huge proportion of guests who come to do business with Epic. It is by far the dominant player in Verona, where the population of 10,600 is comparable to the company\u2019s head count of 9,800.Epic\u2019s headquarters were a short drive away, down a meandering road through countryside dotted with Queen Anne\u2019s lace and farm equipment. I drove past a giant Tin Man, the first indication of the campus\u2019s fairy-tale aesthetic, and into guest parking, in one of the campus\u2019s few aboveground lots.The design theme was childish even by the standards of technology start-ups, where ball pits and scooters are common. I paused at the Cavey Den, a hollowed-out treehouse with stumps for seats and children\u2019s books, then rocked on a rocking horse and ate a cookie from a jar, wondering what time was set aside for naps. There was a long series of clay slabs with handprint impressions from longtime employees, and walls and walls of art sourced from Wisconsin-area artists: a dragon perched in an iron bird cage; expanses of blue and purple stained glass; a clock featuring manicured poodles and Cupid; an old-timey circus ad painted on canvas.The diversions went beyond art. At the Black Dragon cafe, which was next to an informal band-practice area, a sandwich board advertised oatmeal for 75 cents and bacon for $1. Along the Indiana Jones tunnel, decorated with vines and a golden idol, the sound of dripping water and roaring animals played in a constant loop. A conference room named after a Star Wars planet was reached via a rickety swinging bridge. All around me, young workers in shorts and band T-shirts hurried past. (The company\u2019s dress code is that when visitors are on campus, wear clothes.)The next morning, I woke up feeling off: a throat infection I\u2019d been treating with antibiotics seemed to be getting worse. Verona, while long on breweries, day cares, artisanal pizza and jumbo mortgages, lacks an urgent-care clinic, so I drove into nearby west Madison for some attention.The clinic I found was, naturally, running on an Epic system that logged me in, took my information and tracked my health statistics. The nurse\u2019s assistant who saw me had visited Epic during her training, as do many medical professionals who work with its technology as part of their jobs.Once you know what Epic does in health care, you see it everywhere. When I left the urgent-care center, diagnosed with a gnarly case of strep, the summary printout I was given was branded on one corner with Epic\u2019s insignia.The next day, back at company headquarters, I sat in one of the less Montessori-style conference rooms with Steve Dickmann, 72, the chief administrative officer. He became animated when explaining some of the more functional, less fantastical features of the space. \u201cThe whole campus is designed to promote productivity, creativity, comfort,\u201d he said.There was a philosophy behind everything. All employees have offices, because studies show that workers in open floor plans get interrupted frequently. Stairs promote socialization, but buildings can\u2019t be more than three stories, because workers are reluctant to climb more than a flight or two. Every conference room must have windows so that visitors don\u2019t feel hemmed in during days and days of training.The overriding mission, Mr. Dickmann said, was to ensure the safety of patients at facilities that use Epic software. If health care programmers make mistakes, he said, \u201cbad things can happen.\u201dEpic\u2019s coders often leave campus to embed in operating and recovery rooms, where they watch nurses ripping the tops off blood bags and surgeons opening up people\u2019s chest cavities. It\u2019s an experience that young engineers are unlikely to get at, say, Facebook or Snap, working on algorithms that tailor ads to demographic groups or insert rainbow vomit into photographs.Programmers regularly faint at the sight of beating hearts, scalpels and bodily fluids. \u201cThere were people that would pass out in the hallway\u201d of hospitals, said Aaron Webb, who worked at Epic for 10 years as a software developer. He watched \u201chundreds\u201d of surgeries, often with his team in tow, before moving to Seattle, where he now works for a business that matches companies with storage space. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t understand what your users are going through, you\u2019re not going to design a good system.\u201dEpic works its more than 5,000 programmers hard. Middle-of-the-night technical crises, stress-related illness and employees weeping from exhaustion in airport lounges are not uncommon, say former employees. Long hours are expected. One piece of company lore has it that during a construction project, Ms. Faulkner questioned a plan to install motion-activated light switches, noting that employees might be sitting still at their desks for such long stretches that they\u2019d frequently find themselves in the dark. (The sensors were installed, and she was proved correct.)This combination of chaotic, stressful client visits and isolating, mundane office work might explain the company\u2019s Disney dimension. Epic is a place where wedding music plays on a campuswide public-announcement system when new clients are signed. Dry-cleaning services are found at the \u201cNew York Sock Exchange.\u201d Employees can hurtle down an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d slide into a room with miniature furniture. They are encouraged to visit a conference room encased by waterfalls and a shark pond when in need of inspiration. (The shark is fake.) Internal awards for outstanding work are named after Jack Bauer and MacGyver.A few hours after my sit-down with Mr. Dickmann, I was granted an audience with Ms. Faulkner herself. We met in her personal conference room, a place of warm earth tones, steaming hot tea and personal memorabilia, including a copy of the prayer \u201cDesiderata\u201d with faux-burned margins mounted on a wall. \u201cI think we save many, many, many lives a year,\u201d she told me.Born in 1943, Ms. Faulkner said she taught herself to code in a week, using a Fortran textbook, during her undergraduate years at Dickinson College. As a graduate student in computer science at the University of Wisconsin, she conceived a prototype for Epic while sitting in her living room one day in the mid-1970s.\u201cThe sun was shining, I was disattentive, I was just sitting there and suddenly it all came to me: Here\u2019s how you build it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I remember running into the kitchen, grabbing a pad of paper and just writing code, code, code, code,\u201d she said. While she went on to teach computer science for a period, she kept coming back to the idea, and in 1979, in a Madison basement, she founded what would become Epic: a start-up called Human Services Computing. Today, some of Epic\u2019s foundational programming still bears Ms. Faulkner\u2019s initials.Ms. Faulkner is now 75, and over the last four years, the company she built has grown an average of 14 percent a year, according to revenue figures it shared with The Times. She has instructed her heirs (she has three children) and stock-holding employees, who together constitute a majority of the company\u2019s equity holders, that they must always vote their shares in favor of keeping Epic private. They must also ensure that Epic is run by an executive who already works for the company, and that that person is a software developer.That decision-making may not occur for a while. It\u2019s \u201cmore likely that I\u2019d die than that I\u2019d retire,\u201d she said.\u201cI look at our financial information maybe for a minute a month,\u201d she said.One criticism that has dogged Epic is that its software sometimes won\u2019t connect with that of competitors, meaning that patient information can\u2019t move around as seamlessly as it should. The company has chipped away at the problem in recent years, but much remains to be done.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the lack of effort, it\u2019s the lack of standards,\u201d said Jim Turnbull, the chief information officer for the University of Utah system and a longtime Epic client. \u201cUntil the federal government and all the vendors recognize that we have too many standards, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be possible to completely interoperate,\u201d he said, using the industry term for connectivity.The day after meeting with Ms. Faulkner, I took a final tour of Epic with its head of media relations, Meghan Roh, who was hired in 2017 as the first person ever to occupy that position. We went down a slide connecting the ground floor of a building called Heaven, with a white interior, to a lower level with an elevator whose floors were marked Devil, Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub and Mephistopheles. (When you press a button, you hear audio of an imaginary demon saying, \u201cPlease come in. It\u2019s nice and toasty in here.\u201d)Underground is also where you\u2019ll find Epic\u2019s auditorium. Built partly to preserve the sightlines on campus and minimize water and waste runoff, the gathering place hosts the Verona high school\u2019s annual graduation ceremony as well as Epic\u2019s monthly staff meetings, at which attendance is required. On the way in, employees are served popcorn and coffee, an homage to an earlier point when the company used movie theaters for large meetings, and shown a reel of pictures of recent staff weddings, newborn babies and beloved pets. Then they hear presentations on new products and priorities, matters of company philosophy, and new \u201carmies\u201d being formed for employees to brainstorm software-based solutions to epidemics like the opioid crisis and maternal morbidity.Workers who fully commit to Epic \u2014 who survive the long hours and grisly sights \u2014 are treated to a remarkable perk. After five years, they get a sabbatical, including round-trip airfare for two to travel somewhere they\u2019ve never been for a month, plus a per diem for meals and lodging. (They get another sabbatical after 10 years, 15, and so on.)Epic is constantly scanning the undergraduate ranks for new hires. Rather than sticking to engineer incubator schools like M.I.T. or Stanford, it scouts institutions like Carleton College in Minnesota and Clemson University in South Carolina. Candidates take online tests to gauge their problem-solving skills and, if they pass muster, are whisked to Madison for an on-campus interview and tour of the area.Once on board, employees take a multiweek training course that includes basic business etiquette as well as Epic-specific skill building. Officials preach a flat structure in which it\u2019s never O.K. to turn down colleagues for help. They also teach a tactic called \u201cbadgering\u201d \u2014 remember, it\u2019s Wisconsin \u2014 or the art of being persistent but not maddening.Epic\u2019s broad recruiting strategy and perks help draw people in, but over time, it\u2019s the cultures of both Wisconsin and Epic that help keep people there.\u201cThe only reason I left Epic was so that my family could move out West,\u201d said Mr. Webb, the former Epic programmer. \u201cEvery day was different. And it was fun. And just being able to go see the impact you were having, that was really, really cool.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how patients' medical records are handled. They are accessed by software that runs on Epic servers; they are not stored on Epic servers.Advertisement"}

On Wednesday, the company was acquired by Procter & Gamble for an undisclosed sum.The deal represents a successful exit for Mr. Walker and his investors. It also signals an effort by Procter & Gamble, the maker of Gillette, to reach new markets with its shaving products. But while many start-up founders make a hasty exit after getting acquired, Mr. Walker is planning to stay on and grow Bevel, his men\u2019s shaving brand, and Form, his women\u2019s hair care brand. \u201cWe\u2019re a team of 15 with very grandiose ambitions,\u201d he said of Walker & Company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., but will move to Atlanta as part of the deal. \u201cWe want this company and its purpose to still be around 150 years from now.\u201dMr. Walker grew up poor in Queens. His mother focused on his education, and he was accepted into an elite boarding school. From there he went to Stony Brook University, on Long Island, and then the Graduate School of Business at Stanford. After working at Foursquare, he became an entrepreneur in residence with the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and from there he started Walker & Company. Mr. Walker also co-founded Code2040, an organization working to improve diversity in the technology industry. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted earlier this year in San Francisco. What\u2019s that book you\u2019ve got there? Would you say you\u2019re more of a Greek or a Roman?Roman. In 53 years, these guys came from nothingness and became a global power. It\u2019s just fascinating how you can do that so quickly, with such discipline. For them to reach their apex and decline so quickly, I think there\u2019s something really interesting to learn in that. When I think about my own business, and think about how history really does repeat itself, the Rome story is one that really rings true. This idea of arrogance matched with discipline is a kind of interesting dichotomy to explore a little bit more deeply.Did you read the classics in school? No, no. I was an economics major. I was a great student \u2014 4.0 G.P.A., valedictorian, all that stuff. I learned to study and play to the test, play to the grade, get to the next step. Now I\u2019m in a position where I can actually devour the content I always wanted to. I remember reading Ben Franklin\u2019s autobiography and being so delighted by it. It gave me this real delight to pursue a path of more knowledge.Where\u2019d you grow up?I grew up in the projects in Queens. Fortunately, I had a mother who worked three jobs, did everything she could to ensure that I was set up for success and had the education that I needed. I got a full-ride scholarship to the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn. And from there, I got to see how the other half lived. It completely changed my life. I got to see what success could look like. I got to see what wealth was. And it completely changed my worldview.How so? I would walk down the halls and see last names like Ford, go to some classes and realize they\u2019re Rockefellers. These are names that were in my imagination. It taught me the importance of name and what that can mean, not only for you but your progeny. When I started at Hotchkiss, I didn\u2019t know what a verb was. So I spent all of my time in the library studying. I spent all of my time thinking about what I wanted to be when I grew up.What motivated you during this time? Wealth creation. I mean, I know what the opposite looks like. And I don\u2019t wish that on anybody. I think everyone deserves the opportunity to succeed, and when I saw how the other half lived, it motivated me. When I was younger I realized there are three ways to get rich. The first was to be an actor or an athlete, which didn\u2019t work out for me too well. The second way was to work on Wall Street. And the third way is entrepreneurship, which is what I\u2019m pursuing now.What was your first job after college? I worked for Lehman Brothers each summer during college. Then I graduated, went to work on Wall Street, and realized I hated it. I was a trader. Your goal as a trader is to make money with other people\u2019s money to, at the end of the year, make money for yourself. And there was really nothing validating there for me. I felt that the world was bigger, and that there were other things that needed solving. I have a lot of friends who continued to pursue that path. Thank goodness I left after two years, because they start paying you enough money to keep you there. And then your opportunity cost gets so high that you don\u2019t want to leave, and you get miserable. I saw this happen over and over and over again. I didn\u2019t want to be the victim of that.What did you make of Silicon Valley when you arrived? I was 24 when I came to Stanford. The other 24-year-olds here were not only making millions of dollars but fundamentally changing the world. Why did I not have any idea this place existed? There was this world, this innovation economy, that by design I was unable to participate in because I didn\u2019t know about it.That\u2019s a pretty rosy view of things, about changing the world. Has it changed at all? This diversity problem in Silicon Valley continues to not improve. It is a fundamental problem. The majority of the world is people of color. The majority of this country in 20, 30 years will be. It\u2019s the most culturally influential demographic group on the planet. Why are we not participating in this? When you think about the percentage of black, Latino folks getting funding, it has not gotten better.I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much difference. Instead of selling bits, I\u2019m selling physical products. The need here was really the fact that I could not shave. Why are there no products that really understood the fact that I have curly hair? The shaving products that exist cut the hair beneath my skin, and that hair grows into my skin, leading to some irritation issues. That\u2019s just a really simple insight.I\u2019ve also been frustrated for years about having to walk down what\u2019s called an \u201cethnic beauty aisle,\u201d which is always next to the beauty aisle. There\u2019s not a great assortment of products. The products are usually dirty. There\u2019s a photo on it of some 65-year-old bald black dude in a towel drinking a Cognac, petting a tiger, and it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.People of color spend more money on this stuff than anyone else. So I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to respect those things before anybody else does, and really create a long-term view around celebrating this beautiful community and culture.\u201dThere are other shaving start-ups out there, like Harry\u2019s and Dollar Shave Club. What\u2019s different about Bevel?I can\u2019t use their products. I mean, the fundamental problem is that things like multi-blade razors help exacerbate the condition for folks with curly hair. A hundred years ago, both men and women used to shave with a single-blade razor. This idea of multi-blade did not exist. Multi-blade razors cut the hair beneath your skin, whereas single-blade cuts level with the skin, so there\u2019s nothing to grow into. There\u2019s no patent on single-blades anymore. Let\u2019s think about what that means as a business person, if you lose your patent. What do you do? You try to generate more innovations that get you more intellectual property. So now we have two- all the way up to six-blade razors, which really don\u2019t do anything much different. And companies are neglecting a growing audience of folks that can\u2019t use those things.I recently met with the C.E.O. of a large consumer packaged goods company, and I asked him, \u201cWhen was the last time you saw a black man shaving in an ad?\u201d Now, this guy has sold tens of millions, maybe billions, of blades. And he said, \u201cHm. Never.\u201d And I remember feeling not only sad, but really upset.This is your first time leading a company. How are you growing into your shoes as a leader? What are your priorities as you keep building the company? I\u2019m dedicating my life to the demographic shift happening in this country. Not only for Silicon Valley. Not only for business. But for this country\u2019s competitiveness. It\u2019s changing. And folks need to respect that and they need to celebrate it. And if there\u2019s any frustration I continue to have, it\u2019s when folks are lacking in their celebration of it. The more quickly everyone comes to grips with the importance of focusing on this, the better off we\u2019ll all be. The more fair we\u2019ll all be. The more equitable we\u2019ll all be. And the more competitive we\u2019ll all be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Central Bank Ends One of the Biggest Money-Printing Programs Ever", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrankfurt \u2014 One of the biggest money-printing programs of all time, a geyser of cash that may have prevented the collapse of the eurozone, will officially end in a few weeks in a slow-motion wrap-up that reflects lingering risks to the region.The European Central Bank said on Thursday that at the end of December it would stop adding to its stock of government and corporate bonds, the so-called quantitative easing program it has used to hold down interest rates and encourage lending.After a decade marked by recessions, financial crises and political turmoil that nearly tore the eurozone apart, the wind-down of the bond-buying program showed that the central bank was confident enough in the eurozone\u2019s health to begin taking the region off life support. It was also a vindication of sorts.Although not a surprise, the end to the stimulus program \u2014 or more precisely, the end of its expansion \u2014 was a milestone for the euro a few weeks before the currency marks its 20th birthday.The decision by the central bank\u2019s Governing Council in early 2015 to begin buying hundreds of billions of euros of government bonds was momentous at the time and also controversial. It generated legal challenges and friction within the council, which includes representatives from all 19 countries in the eurozone.The program survived and ultimately changed forever the way that the European Central Bank fights crises, while bolstering its credibility.Quantitative easing \u201cis part now of the toolbox; it\u2019s permanent,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said Thursday. Previously, the European Central Bank was seen as lacking the firepower of the Federal Reserve Board. But now, Mr. Draghi said, the bank is \u201clike other central banks in terms of the array of tools it can use.\u201dThe move to end the nearly four-year effort was expected. The bank signaled in June that the bond-buying program, which pumped 2.5 trillion newly created euros, or $2.8 trillion, into the eurozone economy, would probably end in December. The central bank\u2019s governing council affirmed the decision at a meeting on Thursday.The central bank nonetheless appeared to have some doubts about the eurozone\u2019s vitality. The sentiment is shared by many economists, and the central bank reassured investors on Thursday that the reduction to its bond holdings would be a calculated affair.The bank said in a statement that, even though it would not increase its total holdings of government bonds after December, it would reinvest the money it gets when the bonds mature. It also pledged to keep reinvesting the principal even after it starts to raise interest rates from their current record lows.That means an enormous stockpile of government bonds will remain in the central bank\u2019s possession for years. The central bank emphasized on Thursday that it was in no hurry to reduce its holdings, and reiterated that it would not begin to raise interest rates before the end of next summer.\u201cThe latest data and survey results have been weaker than expected,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference. \u201cThis may suggest some slower growth momentum ahead.\u201dThe eurozone is undoubtedly in better shape than it was when the central bank began the quantitative-easing program early in 2015 as some pundits were predicting the euro\u2019s demise.But in recent months, growth has slowed and risks have grown, including a rise in global trade tensions, tumult in Italy\u2019s politics and the continuing chaos surrounding Britain\u2019s plans to decouple from the European Union.In one particularly ominous sign, Germany\u2019s economy, which tends to set the pace for the eurozone, actually shrank slightly from July through September. Mr. Draghi highlighted some other risks Thursday, including jumpy financial markets and weakness in some emerging markets.By reinvesting money from maturing bonds, the central bank will still be keeping a lid on market interest rates, or yields, said Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y.\u201cYields will not go up because the E.C.B. has stopped buying new bonds, although downward pressure on interest rates will remain steady rather than increase every month,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said in an email. \u201cThe excess liquidity remains in the banking system as long as the E.C.B. keeps its bond holdings steady.\u201dBefore the program began, some experts had said that quantitative easing couldn\u2019t be done in the eurozone. The eurozone is not a government and does not issue bonds. There was no form of pan-regional debt comparable to the U.S. Treasury bonds that the Federal Reserve bought as part of its emergency stimulus program.The European Central Bank solved that problem by buying bonds issued by its 19 member countries roughly in proportion to the size of their economies. It also bought bonds issued by eurozone corporations.The program generated bitter criticism from some citizens and economists, particularly in Germany, who saw it as a de facto bailout of countries like Italy and Spain that, they said, should have been forced to solve their own problems. Critics also argued that the central bank was effectively providing financing to governments in violation of European Union law.But the program withstood legal challenges, making it easier for the central bank to use quantitative easing in the future.Mr. Draghi declined to specify what it would take for the European Central Bank to ramp up bond purchases again.A debate percolates among economists whether the bond-buying program did any good.Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German bank, said he believed the main effect was psychological.\u201cI think it was more the announcement of the program \u2014 that the E.C.B. was doing something \u2014 than the program itself,\u201d Mr. Schmieding said in Frankfurt this week. \u201cIt fueled a certain optimism.\u201dMr. Draghi said Thursday that the program had indeed achieved its goal of pushing down market interest rates, and also made the eurozone banking system safer by increasing the value of bonds that banks had in their portfolios. At times during the eurozone crisis, \u201cQ.E. has been the only driver of this recovery,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.But he acknowledged that its benefits were not spread evenly.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that not everybody participated in the benefits of the common currency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should find the reasons why.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s going to be cold and dark for the foreseeable future. Anyone reasonable knows in his or her bones that the proper course of action over any given afternoon for the next several months is to take a nap. And so late stage capitalism has, naturally, found a way to pose the question: What would you pay for one?At the Dreamery, an outfit opened by the mattress company Casper in Manhattan, naps are for sale. To be more precise, a 45-minute session in a darkened nook with peace and quiet is for sale for $25.To be clear, this institution is no pod hotel. It\u2019s no Japanese slab in a train station for professionals with too many meetings and no real desire to return home. If you need a room for a transaction of a temporary and illicit nature, it is definitely not your place. This is a nap joint; it sells the idea of the nap as much as the nap itself. From the street, you pass through a blue tunnel, flecked with starry lights, to a room that looks like the bedroom of a wealthy child whose parents met at a Decemberists concert. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. But really, you need experts to tell you that? Look around the world around 2:30 in the afternoon.

Sign up for Sunday Best.]I\u2019ve been a freelancer for more than 10 years now, working from home; the quality and quantity of work I can do emerges directly from my ability to concentrate. I do not understand how people have creative careers without napping. Every day at about 1 p.m., everyone faces the same choice: sleep until 2 p.m. and then work until 5, or daydream and drift around social media and take pointless meetings until 7 p.m. The friends I have who still work in offices inform me that their bosses insist they take the second option, that napping is equated with laziness. I genuinely find it bizarre. One piece of nap research demonstrated that if you nap properly, it\u2019s like waking up from a full night\u2019s sleep. You can double your day\u2019s worth of concentration. The only problem with the $25 nap is the pressure the money puts on you. The clock is running, and naps are best when the clocks stop running, when the weight of slumber falls on you of its own accord. Still, the rest was delicious. What I purchased was the ability to concentrate for the afternoon. Under hypercapitalism, the most beautiful things are the surest signs of impending crisis. The nap seems like a luxury, or even a sign of weakness, a regression into infantlike torpor. Nothing could be further from the truth. In a gig economy, the ability to take a nap is a huge advantage. The availability of a proper nap for a reasonable fee is yet another example of how inequality works. People with enough money will be able to afford the naps that allow them to have enough intellectual energy to make the money to afford the naps. Eventually the luckiest among us will all be perfectly efficient mobile brains recharging in glamorous pods alongside our phones. It\u2019s exhausting to contemplate.

{"Headline": "On the Front Line of the Saudi War in Yemen: Child Soldiers From Darfur", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKHARTOUM, Sudan \u2014 The civil war in Darfur robbed Hager Shomo Ahmed of almost any hope. Raiders had stolen his family\u2019s cattle, and a dozen years of bloodshed had left his parents destitute.Then, around the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia offered a lifeline: The kingdom would pay as much as $10,000 if Hager joined its forces fighting 1,200 miles away in Yemen.Hager, 14 at the time, could not find Yemen on a map, and his mother was appalled. He had survived one horrific civil war \u2014 how could his parents toss him into another? But the family overruled her.\u201cFamilies know that the only way their lives will change is if their sons join the war and bring them back money,\u201d Hager said in an interview last week in the capital, Khartoum, a few days after his 16th birthday.Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis say they are battling to rescue Yemen from a hostile faction backed by Iran. But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children.At any time for nearly four years as many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen have been fighting in Yemen in tandem with the local militia aligned with the Saudis, according to several Sudanese fighters who have returned and Sudanese lawmakers who are attempting to track it. Hundreds, at least, have died there.Almost all the Sudanese fighters appear to come from the battle-scarred and impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced during a dozen years of conflict over diminishing arable land and other scarce resources.Most belong to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a tribal militia previously known as the Janjaweed. They were blamed for the systematic rape of women and girls, indiscriminate killing and other war crimes during Darfur\u2019s conflict, and veterans involved in those horrors are now leading their deployment to Yemen \u2014 albeit in a more formal and structured campaign.Some families are so eager for the money that they bribe militia officers to let their sons go fight. Many are ages 14 to 17. In interviews, five fighters who have returned from Yemen and another about to depart said that children made up at least 20 percent of their units. Two said children were more than 40 percent.To keep a safe distance from the battle lines, their Saudi or Emirati overseers commanded the Sudanese fighters almost exclusively by remote control, directing them to attack or retreat through radio headsets and GPS systems provided to the Sudanese officers in charge of each unit, the fighters all said.\u201cThe Saudis told us what to do through the telephones and devices,\u201d said Mohamed Suleiman al-Fadil, a 28-year-old member of the Bani Hussein tribe who returned from Yemen at the end of last year. \u201cThey never fought with us.\u201d\u201cThe Saudis would give us a phone call and then pull back,\u201d agreed Ahmed, 25, a member of the Awlad Zeid tribe who fought near Hudaydah this year and who did not want his full name published for fear of government retaliation. \u201cThey treat the Sudanese like their firewood.\u201dA few thousand Emiratis are based around the port of Aden. But the rest of the coalition the Saudis and Emiratis have assembled is united mainly by dependence on their financial aid.But in Sudan, which has played a far larger role, the Saudi money appears to flow directly to the fighters \u2014 or mercenaries, as critics call them. It benefits the economy only indirectly.\u201cPeople are desperate. They are fighting in Yemen because they know that in Sudan they don\u2019t have a future,\u201d said Hafiz Ismail Mohamed, a former banker, economic consultant and critic of the government. \u201cWe are exporting soldiers to fight like they are a commodity we are exchanging for foreign currency.\u201dA spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement that it was fighting to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen and that coalition forces upheld all international humanitarian and human rights laws, including \u201cabstaining from child recruitment.\u201d\u201cThe allegations that there are children among the ranks of the Sudanese forces are fictitious and unfounded,\u201d the spokesman, Turki al-Malki, said in the statement. Saudi officials said their soldiers have also died in Yemen, but declined to disclose how many.The Sudanese ground troops unquestionably have made it easier for the Saudis and Emiratis to extend the war. The Sudanese have insulated the Saudis and Emiratis from the casualties that might test the patience of families at home.The Sudanese are sometimes deployed to defend the flanks of the Yemeni militiamen who spearhead attacks. But the Sudanese fighters insist they are also the main barrier against the Saudis\u2019 Yemeni foes, the Houthis.\u201cWithout us, the Houthis would take all of Saudi Arabia, including Mecca,\u201d Mr. Fadil said.Ambassador Babikir Elsiddig Elamin, a spokesman for Sudan\u2019s Foreign Ministry, declined to comment on troop levels, casualties or paychecks in Yemen. He said that Sudan was fighting \u201cin the interest of regional peace and stability.\u201d\u201cOther than that,\u201d he added, \u201cwe don\u2019t have any national interest in Yemen.\u201dSudan\u2019s defense minister threatened last May to withdraw from the conflict, pointedly announcing that Khartoum was \u201creassessing\u201d participation in light of Sudan\u2019s \u201cstability and interests.\u201d Diplomats called the statement a veiled demand that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provide more financial assistance.They did not, and the Sudanese economy teetered.Khartoum backed down. The flow of fighters continued.But President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has gained valuable allies, easing his international isolation after years as a virtual pariah.Until recently, the Saudis and Emirates kept their distance, suspicious of Mr. Bashir\u2019s roots in political Islam and relations with Iran and Qatar, both Saudi rivals.The war in Yemen, however, has enabled Mr. Bashir to win at least diplomatic support from its Gulf leaders, and he has thanked the Saudis and Emiratis for pressing Washington to upgrade relations.Darfur has furnished mercenaries to other conflicts as well.But far more have fought in Yemen.The five fighters who had returned from Yemen and two brothers of fighters who died there all gave similar accounts. Sudanese jets departed Khartoum or Nyala, Darfur, carrying 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers at a time to Saudi Arabia.They were delivered to camps inside the kingdom, where some said they saw as many as 8,000 Sudanese gathered.The Saudis issued them uniforms and weapons, which the Sudanese fighters believed were American made. Then Saudi officers provided two to four weeks of training, mainly in assembling and cleaning their guns.Finally, they were divided into units of 500 to 750 fighters, they said. Then they traveled over land to Yemen, to battles in the Midi Desert, the Khalid ibn Walid camp in Taiz, or around Aden and Hudaydah.All said they fought only for money. They were paid in Saudi riyals, the equivalent of about $480 a month for a 14-year-old novice to about $530 a month for an experienced Janjaweed officer. They received an additional $185 to $285 for any month they saw combat \u2014 every month for some.Their payments were deposited directly into the Faisal Islamic Bank of Sudan, partly owned by Saudis. At the end of a six-month rotation, each fighter also received a one-time payment of at least 700,000 Sudanese pounds \u2014 roughly $10,000 at the current official exchange rate.By comparison, a Sudanese doctor working overtime at multiple jobs might earn the equivalent of $500 a month, said Mr. Mohamed, the economic consultant.Abdul Raheem, a 32-year-old member of the Rezeigat tribe whose full name was withheld to prevent reprisals, said that last year his family paid a local militia leader a bribe worth $1,360 so an older brother could go to Yemen as an officer.The brother, Abdul Rahman, died in combat in February 2018. \u201cLife is like that,\u201d Abdul Raheem said, stone-faced.Abdul Rahman\u2019s wife and three children received the equivalent of $35,000 in Sudanese pounds, although banking restrictions have hindered access to it.Some Sudanese officers had told the soldiers explicitly, \u201cDon\u2019t fight harder than the money is worth, don\u2019t fight more than you are paid for,\u201d recalled Ahmed, of the Awlad Zeid tribe.All the fighters complained of Houthi rockets and mines, and they recounted casualty levels ranging from 135 in Mr. Fadil\u2019s unit to about 200 in Ahmed\u2019s. When they returned they bought livestock, a Korean-made pickup truck or a small grocery store.Hager, who went to Yemen at 14 and returned in November 2017, wore a matching khaki shirt and pants to an interview in Khartoum. His cheeks were clean. His mustache was just beginning.His unit lost 20 men during their overland journey to a camp near Aden, where they lost 22 more in a first battle and 35 in a second \u2014 180 after six months.He had been terrified every day, he said, hunching forward in his seat when he talked about combat. But his Sudanese officers let him call his parents from time to time, and now they are happy. Besides a house, he bought the family 10 cattle.Declan Walsh and Saeed al-Batati contributed reporting from Yemen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Bounce Back From Edge of Bear Market", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThroughout Wall Street\u2019s December meltdown, analysts have been saying that markets were plunging despite plenty of evidence that the United States economy remains strong and corporate profit growth is healthy.A substantial rise in crude oil prices added to the lighter mood, as did efforts from the White House to ease up on criticism of the Federal Reserve.The rally continued in Asia, led by Japan, where stocks on Thursday opened 3.7 percent higher.The rebound in the United States offered investors a much-needed reprieve from a decline that had picked up speed in December. Stocks had fallen for four consecutive days through Monday, and the drop had pushed the S&P 500 to within just a few points of a bear market \u2014 defined as a 20 percent retreat from its high.Still, the S&P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis a decade ago and is only back to where it stood on Dec. 20. Plus, the move in prices Wednesday was most likely heightened by lighter-than-average trading volume during a holiday week.But to some traders, the move upward finally made sense.\u201cFundamentally you\u2019ve got good growth here in the States, you have reasonable growth overseas, you\u2019re going to have record earnings in 2019 and possibly in 2020 as well, you\u2019ve got low inflation,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Before Wednesday\u2019s steep rise, the market had fallen too far, Mr. Wren said, and it was ready to climb thanks to the underlying strength of the American economy.The rally was broad-based. Only one stock in the S&P 500, Newmont Mining, fell.Oil prices, too, were on the move after Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, told a Russian newspaper that the country would benefit from continuing to cooperate with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on regulating production. American crude, the benchmark for oil prices, rose almost 9 percent to over $46 a barrel, and shares of large energy producers also climbed.After leading Wall Street\u2019s recent slide, technology stocks rebounded as well. Tech investors have had plenty of causes for concern. A slowing global economy could hurt sales, tensions are rising with China on manufacturing of devices, and privacy concerns are bringing the potential for regulation. Apple shares rose 7 percent, while stock in the semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices gained 7.5 percent and Facebook added more than 8 percent.Bank stocks, which have taken the brunt of recent selling as worries grew that the United States economy was weakening, rose significantly.The rally doesn\u2019t mean that this year\u2019s precipitous decline in stock prices is over. Signs of economic health that encouraged the buying are doing little to address one of stock investors\u2019 primary concerns. They\u2019re worried that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to continue raising interest rates, even if at a slightly slower pace, will hurt the economy and corporate profits. Higher interest rates on bonds or even savings accounts make stock investments less appealing as an alternative.The Fed announced an interest-rate increase last week and said it would continue to withdraw the support it had offered the economy in the wake of the financial crisis.\u201cThe Fed is making a monumental mistake,\u201d said Barry Bannister, the head of institutional equity strategy at the broker Stifel. \u201cThey do not realize how long and by how much they\u2019ve tightened already, and until they back off the market\u2019s going to have a very weak floor under it.\u201dAdding to volatility has been the possibility that President Trump would consider firing the central bank\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, because he disagreed with Fed policy. Mr. Trump, who previously sought to hitch his political success to a rising stock market, has blamed interest-rate increases for the downturn on Wall Street.White House officials insisted again that the president had no plans to fire Mr. Powell, news that reassured investors.Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Wednesday morning that Mr. Powell\u2019s job was \u201c100 percent\u201d safe. He echoed remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, both of whom spent the weekend trying to persuade investors that the president did not plan to fire Mr. Powell. Those efforts had mostly backfired, in part because Mr. Trump continued to criticize his handpicked Fed chairman.It also helped matters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump refrained from offering new criticism of the Fed, a marked difference from the days leading up to the Christmas holiday, when he railed against the central bank on Twitter and vowed to keep the government shut down for an extended period. In fact, for the first trading session in many days, Mr. Trump posted just one tweet: It was about his trip to Iraq.Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Far-Right Vox Party Erodes Socialists\u2019 Control in Spain\u2019s Largest Region", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s governing Socialist party suffered an unexpected election setback on Sunday as right-wing parties won enough votes to oust the Socialists from power in the nation\u2019s largest region for the first time since the country returned to democracy.The Socialists won just 33 of the 109 seats in the regional parliament, according to provisional results released late Sunday, with 94 percent of the votes counted. It was the party\u2019s worst result in Andalusia since 1982, when the region held its first election after Spain adopted a new Constitution.The biggest change for Spain\u2019s political landscape on Sunday was the emergence of Vox, a far-right party that had never previously made any significant election inroads. The party won 12 seats, according to the provisional results.That could make Vox a kingmaker in the formation of a right-wing coalition government in the region. The bloc would comprise the Popular Party, which secured 26 seats, and the Ciudadanos party, which won 21.The Socialist leader in Andalusia, Susana D\u00edaz, on Sunday night urged the right-leaning parties not to allow Spain to become the latest European country in which a far-right party takes a front-line role in politics.\u201cThere\u2019s a clear regress of the left in Andalusia, but the most worrying change is the entrance of a far-right party,\u201d she said.One of the first to congratulate Vox on its result in Andalusia was Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far right, who took to Twitter to praise \u201ca very significant result for a young and dynamic movement.\u201dPolls had predicted that Ms. D\u00edaz and her Socialist party would win enough seats to remain in office, even if she was expected to fall short of a majority.Ahead of the expected coalition negotiations in Andalusia, neither the Popular Party nor Ciudadanos on Sunday ruled out joining forces with Vox to oust the Socialists.\u201cIt\u2019s a historic day that allows us all to abandon 40 years of Socialist government in Andalusia,\u201d said Juan Mar\u00edn, the regional leader of Ciudadanos.Though the Spanish economy has done better since a banking bailout in 2012, Andalusia remains a bleak spot in terms of economic performance, and has high unemployment. With about 900,000 people out of work, the region has a joblessness rate of almost 23 percent, compared with a national rate of 14.8 percent.The Socialists have also been plagued by major corruption scandals, including over the payment by Andalusia\u2019s previous governing Socialist politicians, in concert with union officials, of millions in fictitious early retirement benefits to affiliates and relatives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hard-Money Men, Suddenly Going Soft", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrumpism trumps everything, even Ayn Rand.Opinion ColumnistI have a confession to make: I have been insufficiently cynical about modern conservative economics.But while I yield to nobody in my appreciation of the right\u2019s fiscal fraudulence, I took its monetary hawkishness seriously. I thought that all those dire warnings about the inflationary consequences of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to fight high unemployment, the constant harping on the evils of printing money, were grounded in genuine \u2014 stupid, but genuine \u2014 concern.Silly me.It\u2019s no surprise that Individual-1, who lambasted the Fed for keeping interest rates low while Barack Obama was president, is demanding that it keep rates low now that he\u2019s in the White House. After all, nobody has ever accused Donald Trump of having consistent, principled views about monetary policy (or anything else).Now, you might say that the explanation for the right\u2019s about-face on monetary policy is the same as the explanation of its about-face on deficits. That is, Republicans want pain and suffering when there\u2019s a Democratic president, but a nonstop party when one of their own sits in the White House. And that is indeed how it looks now. But I used to think there was something more to the story.You see, as a pundit who, well, gets a lot of hate mail, I\u2019ve learned that the issue of whether it sometimes makes sense to print money stirs more visceral emotions on the right than anything else. Declare that Trump is a corrupt Russian puppet, and you get a fair bit of blowback, but nothing like what you get if you say that returning to the gold standard would be a bad idea, or that monetary easing isn\u2019t necessarily inflationary. A lot of people on the right just go crazy at any suggestion that money is something to be managed, not treated as a sacred trust with which mortals must not meddle.The only thing I know that brings comparable blowback is criticism of Bitcoin, a topic that combines some of the same libertarian derp with a hefty infusion of technobabble.Furthermore, the view that printing money is always a terrible thing seemed extremely durable, despite an uninterrupted track record of predictive failure. People who warned about looming inflation in 2009 continued to warn about it year after year, even as it kept not happening.There is, by the way, a reasonable case (which I accept) that the Fed should, indeed, pause its campaign of raising rates, and even that this week\u2019s hike was a mistake. But this case should be made on the basis of fundamental economic principles, not in pursuit of short-term political advantage, and least of all because it\u2019s what Donald Trump wants.Yet that\u2019s how it\u2019s going. These days the G.O.P. is all about power; there are no principles it will adhere to if they involve any political cost. And it\u2019s a party that belongs to Trump: What he says is the party line, on any and every issue.Trumpism, it turns out, trumps everything else \u2014 even Ayn Rand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Raises Interest Rates, Showing Confidence in Health of Economy", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and signaled that it expects additional rate increases next year in a display of measured confidence in the economy that came despite financial market worries and political pressure to suspend rate increases.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, emphasized the continued strength of economic growth at a news conference after the announcement. He acknowledged new strains in recent months, including weaker growth in Europe and China and a downturn in stock prices, and he said the Fed expects slightly slower domestic growth and fewer rate increases next year.But he strongly defended the Fed\u2019s decision to increase rates.\u201cWe think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell\u2019s remarks were described by one analyst as a dose of \u201ctough love\u201d for financial markets.Mr. Powell insisted on the wisdom of the Fed\u2019s plans to raise borrowing costs while investors dumped their holdings. Stock prices fell when the Fed released its policy statement at 2 p.m., and dropped again as Mr. Powell spoke. The S&P 500 was down 1.5 percent on the day and is now down 6 percent on the year.Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s advice, Mr. Powell said it \u201cplayed no role\u201d in the Fed\u2019s decision.\u201cNothing will deter us from doing exactly what we think is the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\u201cPolicy at this point does not need to be accommodative,\u201d Mr. Powell said of that milestone.The Fed\u2019s announcement offered a few crumbs for critics. In previous statements, the Fed had said it planned \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d in its benchmark rate, conveying to investors that additional increases were expected. Wednesday\u2019s statement sought to recalibrate those expectations by adding the word \u201csome\u201d to the beginning of the phrase, suggesting that rates may not rise much higher.A majority of Fed officials predicted on Wednesday that the central bank would raise rates no more than twice next year. In September, most Fed officials had predicted at least three rate increases.Mr. Powell tried to emphasize that the Fed would continue to keep a close eye on economic conditions and said that the ultimate pace of rate increases was \u201cnot predetermined.\u201d He has said the Fed\u2019s goal is to strike a balance between extending the expansion and maintaining control of inflation.But the overall tone of the statement suggested the Fed continues to regard the strength of economic growth as more impressive than any storm clouds on the horizon, including a trade war with China and geopolitical strains overseas. Companies continue to add jobs, the unemployment rate sits at 3.7 percent and wages are rising more quickly.\u201cOver the past year, the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows and inflation has been low and stable,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cAll of those things remain true today.\u201dStill, Mr. Powell noted that the robust expansion of 2018 would most likely moderate next year, and critics continued to raise questions about the Fed\u2019s steady march toward higher rates. It now appears likely that inflation will fall short of the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target for the seventh consecutive year. And Fed officials predicted on Wednesday that the central bank will miss the 2 percent target next year, too.Low inflation is a sign of economic weakness and can be a problem in its own right, for instance by restricting the Fed\u2019s ability to reduce borrowing costs should the economy begin to falter.\u201cI think they will look back on this as a mistake,\u201d Josh Bivens, the director of research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said of the rate increase. \u201cThis threatens to snuff out the very beginning of wage gains that we\u2019ve started to see recently in the data. The Fed should allow the expansion\u2019s gains to reach more broadly into the work force and get off the steady escalator of ever-higher interest rates.\u201dInvestors and some economists are increasingly concerned about the economic outlook, particularly as the sugar high from Mr. Trump\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases wears off and as the president continues to press trade fights with most of the nation\u2019s major trading partners.FedEx, a bellwether for the global economy, on Wednesday sharply reduced its profit outlook for 2019 and announced plans to cut jobs, citing a deterioration in demand for its shipping services.Fred Smith, the company\u2019s chief executive, blamed the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies.\u201cMost of the issues that we\u2019re dealing with today are induced by bad political choices,\u201d Mr. Smith said, specifically citing Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions to impose tariffs on a wide range of foreign goods.There are also signs that the Fed\u2019s march toward higher rates is weighing on sales of homes and autos.\u201cThe era of low auto loan rates is clearly behind us,\u201d said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, which gathers data on the auto industry. Mr. Smoke said the average monthly payment on a new car in November was $567, a 5 percent increase over November 2017. \u201cIf rates are indeed even higher in 2019, the buyer pool for new vehicles could further decline,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s a mood of concern, a mood of angst about growth going forward,\u201d Mr. Powell said.But he said the impact on the economy so far appeared to be small.\u201cIn our view, these developments have not fundamentally altered the outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said.He added that the United States economy \u201chas continued to perform well\u201d and that \u2014 while overall financial conditions have tightened \u2014 the Fed has only \u201cmodestly\u201d lowered its projections as a result.The bottom line, he said, is that the Fed intends to let circumstances dictate its decisions.If the economy weakens, the Fed will raise rates more slowly, or stand still. If the economy continues to chug along, the Fed is likely to raise rates at least a few more times.The Fed\u2019s forecasts are guesses, not promises. \u201cThere\u2019s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the ultimate destination of any further increases,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Navy Interrupts Oil Exploration Off Guyana", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn oil-exploration ship contracted by Exxon Mobil suspended operations off the coast of Guyana over the weekend after it was approached by a Venezuelan navy vessel in a renewal of a century-old border dispute.The Venezuelan navy did not board the ship, a Norwegian vessel that was conducting seismic testing in Guyanese waters 90 miles from the internationally recognized border Saturday morning. The ship sailed away to safer waters.After Exxon Mobil announced its early discoveries, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela issued a decree establishing maritime defense zones in Guyanese waters. He later backtracked on the decree, although the claim over Guyana gives Mr. Maduro a nationalistic issue while his government\u2019s popularity and the nation\u2019s economy are in free fall.Guyana has a population of only 750,000 and is one of South America\u2019s poorest countries. Oil production, which is scheduled to begin in 2020, is expected to transform the country\u2019s economy.The episode this weekend could slow exploration along the western Atlantic coast, but should not stop drilling altogether.

Venezuela is running short of fuel and food, and its military has its hands full keeping the regime in power.One of Exxon Mobil\u2019s partners in Guyana is the Chinese oil company Cnooc.

{"Headline": "\u2018Destroying Our Children for Sport\u2019: Thailand May Limit Underage Boxing", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHAT PHANOM, Thailand \u2014 Sprawled on a bamboo mat, Supattra Inthirat closed her eyes as her father massaged her hard arms with oil and menthol. In preparation for her 15th muay Thai bout, her father whispered a prayer into her ear.When Supattra, a 12-year-old fighter known as Pancake, faced her rival and 400 fans under halogen lights, she would be fighting for a purpose: $60, almost a half of a month\u2019s salary for Thai families in this region.\u201cShe will be a champion,\u201d he said. \u201cShe must train early to build up her boxing bones.\u201dAcross Thailand, muay Thai is a hallowed style of kickboxing propelled by both rich and poor. For the poor, it can be a form of social mobility, a means for muscled young boxers to fight their families\u2019 way into the burgeoning middle class. For the rich, it\u2019s a brutal gambling form in which tens of thousands of dollars can be won and lost each night.Last month those worlds collided just south of Bangkok when Anucha Tasako, 13, died of a brain hemorrhage after being knocked out in a muay Thai fight. Video of the knockout showed five fierce blows to the head, then Anucha limply buckling to the ground as the referee tried to stop the action. Two days later, Anucha died in a hospital. He had fought an astonishing 174 bouts since the age of 8.Now Thailand has been left to reconsider the brutality of a sport involving underage fighters and the shadowy gambling economy built around it.\u201cIt\u2019s child labor and child abuse,\u201d said Dr. Jiraporn Laothamatas, a neuroradiologist leading the charge to ban boxing by children. Last month she released a seven-year study on the effect of muay Thai on children\u2019s brains, showing a steady drop in IQ and brain function for those who fight. \u201cThese kids earn. They feed their families and their promoters with their winning. We are destroying our children for sport.\u201dAnucha\u2019s death stirred a wave of shock and anger across the nation, leading Thai lawmakers to propose a measure that could put stringent limits on fights and bar children younger than 12 from competitive boxing.\u201cThis will destroy muay Thai,\u201d said Dr. Sudhichai Chokekijchai, a doctor for professional boxers in Bangkok and a fight enthusiast. \u201cWe should be focused on prevention instead of pushing kids away. They are fighting for their lives.\u201dThe national rules state that boxers over 15 are required to register to fight officially. For competitors under that age, the rules are vague, requiring only parental permission and offering little guidance on gambling and safety.Most fights happen off the books, though. A Thai investigative journalism center reported that only 10,373 child fighters had registered between 2010 to 2017, while according to boxing officials nearly 200,000 children under 15 regularly compete.\u201cIt\u2019s in our blood to fight,\u201d Dr. Sudhichai said. \u201cThese laws will only push people away from doing it safely. These kids are healthy, they stay away from drugs and crimes. How will the government support them if they take fighting away?\u201dMuay Thai is known as the art of eight limbs, mixing kicking, punching, kneeing and elbowing to defeat an opponent. Fights are typically five rounds of three minutes of fighting with no headgear and competitors wearing 10 ounce gloves. Over the past 400 years, it has grown from a local sport form into a worldwide phenomenon popularized by films, video games and fitness enthusiasts.In Thailand, muay Thai competitions have managed to stay outside the child protection and labor laws, which designate that only salaried children are considered workers. Money won in muay Thai fights is considered an award and is legal.In the poorer and more rural regions of Thailand, where child boxing has its strongest following, that money can become an important buoy. Compared with families that may earn an average of $200 a month working farms and rice paddies, a budding child fighter can bring in $60 to $600 for a victory \u2014 or even more for a knockout.\u201cDo you want them to play golf?\u201d said Sukit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who defends fighter rights. \u201cEvery famous professional boxer starts at 7 years old.\u201dFor fighters, a life of discipline and dedication begins early. In small, makeshift training camps in rural parts of Thailand, children punch with rotting gloves and donated bags, working their way up the ranks as they grow.The best of them are recruited by Bangkok fight gyms. These act as makeshift boarding schools, where the elite young fighters live piled together on tiny mattress away from their families and follow a rigorous training routine. At 4:30 a.m., a six-mile run in the dark. Boxing from 5:30 to 7. School until the afternoon, then another training session until the sun goes down.The dream is to go pro. At the famous Rajadamnern Stadium in Bangkok, muay Thai bouts are held four times a week. Middle-aged Thai men and foreign tourists pack into dim wings of the stadium, drinking beer and shoving their hands into the air in an elaborate array of motions signaling their bets. Whether it\u2019s per round or per fight, wagers can easily jump from $50 to $500 in an instant.Pancake\u2019s career has had a promising start. Girls are relatively new to muay Thai, but comprise a growing sector, and Pancake has won 12 of her last 14 competitions. Coming from a middle-class family, she is one of the luckier boxers, able to train with her father, a former fighter himself, in their makeshift home gym.On the night of her fight, she climbed into the ring to face another 12-year-old girl. Before the bell, the two wore stony faces and performed a swirling, traditional warm-up dance. Over a loudspeaker, an announcer called out the nicknames of others on the lineup: Super Small, Mint, Diamond Lighting, Diamond Cactus and Sidewalk Flower.After five rounds of flailing arms and legs, the two girls walked off, faces sweaty and battered. The judges\u2019 unanimous decision: Pancake had lost. Her father gathered her things.\u201cShe\u2019ll need to train harder,\u201d he said.Navaon Siradapuvadol contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Rise After U.S. and China Agree to Halt Escalation of Trade War", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks rose on Wall Street Monday after President Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary truce in the trade war between the United States and China.The S&P 500-stock index climbed 1.1 percent, notching its fifth gain in the last six trading sessions. Major Asian and European equity markets also posted solid increases.Exporting giants like Boeing, Caterpillar and Deere pulled the export-reliant S&P 500 industrial sector higher. Semiconductor makers, which have been hurt by the trade war\u2019s potential to disrupt their widespread production networks in Asia, also rose, as did tech giants such as Apple, which climbed more than 3 percent.Still, market gains were tempered by doubts that the fragile cease-fire \u2014 essentially a 90-day postponement of additional American tariffs on Chinese imports \u2014 would put the dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies to rest permanently.\u201cJust because they have a truce for three months doesn\u2019t mean this thing is going away,\u201d said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at the asset manager Fidelity Investments in Boston.The d\u00e9tente, forged by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi over a dinner, merely postpones a larger reckoning over trade. Under the deal, the United States will postpone an increase in tariffs that was set to be imposed Jan. 1, and it sets a March 1 deadline for the countries to reach a more extensive pact.The deal leaves in place American tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods and the retaliatory measures enacted by Beijing. It is unclear whether the countries can resolve such thorny questions as the Chinese government\u2019s support for sensitive industries and protections for American-created intellectual property.Still, the relatively good outcome of the meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump adds to the sense of relief for investors. A range of worries \u2014 about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to continue raising interest rates, the impact of the midterm elections in the United States, the trade war and signs of slowing global growth \u2014 weighed on stocks in October and November. After it peaked on Sept. 20, the stock market\u2019s gains for the year melted away as the S&P 500 slumped more than 10 percent through Nov. 23.In recent weeks, several developments had also helped allay those concerns. Last week, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, sparked a market rally when he said interest rates were \u201cjust below\u201d a range of estimates for the neutral level, meaning the Fed was nearing the point where it would not be tapping on the brakes or pressing on the gas on the economy. His statements raised investor hopes that the Fed might not lift interest rates as high as previously thought.Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season has shown corporate profits remained strong.The midterm elections on Nov. 6 went largely as expected, with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retaining control of the Senate.\u201cWhat were the worry points? Earnings and sales, the election, China, interest rates,\u201d said Richard Nackenson, a portfolio manager at the asset management firm Neuberger Berman. \u201cWow, guess what? It\u2019s all been mitigated.\u201dMr. Nackenson stressed, however, that the market\u2019s worries had not been resolved. Investors remain aware that the conflict between China and the United States is far from resolved, and stock market enthusiasm may be fleeting.\u201cWe see it obviously as a positive that there is a pause in the trade war talk,\u201d said Richard Weiss, chief investment officer for multi-asset strategies at American Century Investments. \u201cBut it could reignite at any moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump May Choose Critic of Fannie and Freddie to Lead Agency Overseeing Them", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is expected to nominate Mark Calabria, the chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, to run the government agency overseeing the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to two White House officials.Mr. Calabria, who is being eyed to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is a longtime critic of the government-backed housing finance companies, which have been under government control since the 2008 financial crisis. If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Calabria would replace Mel Watt, a holdover from the Obama administration whose term as director of the agency expires in January.The appointment would come at a sensitive moment for the United States housing market. Home prices have increased and sales have strengthened since the housing bust. But sales of new and existing homes have slumped this year, a phenomenon that analysts attribute to several factors, including prices that have climbed faster than incomes and the Federal Reserve\u2019s march toward higher interest rates, which raises borrowing costs.Fannie and Freddie are the primary sources of funding for mortgage loans in the United States. The companies do not make loans. Instead, they purchase loans from private mortgage lenders, providing those companies with cash to make more loans. The two companies financed 44 percent of new mortgage loans during the first six months of 2018, according to the Urban Institute.Mr. Calabria has criticized the current housing finance system, in which Fannie and Freddie purchase most mortgage loans and then repackage the loans for sale as securities. He argues that the combination of federal support and the securitization process has encouraged investors to take on larger risks, threatening the stability of the financial system.As director of the housing finance agency, Mr. Calabria would have some authority to reduce the role that Fannie and Freddie play. He could, for example, require the companies to raise the fees they charge on loans, or limit the maximum size of the loans that the companies can purchase.But David Berson, who worked as Fannie Mae\u2019s chief economist from 1987 to 2007 and is now the chief economist at Nationwide, said he did not expect big changes no matter whom the administration named to lead the agency.\u201cThings are working too well, and it would be too politically divisive,\u201d he said.The Trump administration released a report in June proposing to privatize Fannie and Freddie while continuing to subsidize mortgage loans for less affluent home buyers through an existing program operated by the Federal Housing Administration. Such a plan, however, would require congressional approval, an unlikely prospect given that the House will soon be controlled by Democrats who have long been more supportive of government involvement in the housing finance market.Mr. Calabria, along with many conservative economists, has long blamed government-sponsored enterprises including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for contributing to the 2008 crisis by offering low-interest loans to borrowers who could not afford them. He has also criticized the 30-year mortgage, saying the stability it provides to homeowners in the form of a fixed monthly payment comes at the expense of taxpayers, who are at risk of having to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if the housing market craters, as it did in 2008. Mr. Calabria has argued that there is no reason to subsidize such products instead of loans with shorter terms.Fannie and Freddie were created by the federal government to increase mortgage lending, and thus homeownership. Until the 2008 crisis, the companies operated with the implicit backing of the federal government while earning huge profits that were pocketed by their shareholders. In September 2008, the faltering companies were placed under federal conservatorship: Their operations are now backed explicitly by the government, and the government pockets the profits.Under Mr. Watt, the companies have expanded their loan purchases. Mr. Calabria, by contrast, has long argued that the government should stop backing Fannie and Freddie.In a 2016 speech, Mr. Calabria described the current system as unnecessarily risky, and said it had not produced significant gains in homeownership or affordability.Mr. Calabria rose to prominence in conservative circles during the housing crisis, arguing for market-based conservative solutions to the mass foreclosure crisis at a time when most Democrats, and some Republicans, were advocating a more hands-on federal approach.Federal lending entities, such as the Federal Housing Administration and government-sponsored enterprises, Mr. Calabria said, \u201cshould engage in aggressive recourse against delinquent borrowers who have the ability to pay, but simply choose not too.\u201d\u201cAll federal modification programs should also include strong recourse provisions,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe should make every effort to turn away from becoming a society where legally incurred debts are no longer obligations to be honored but simply options to be exercised.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Trump, \u2018a War Every Day,\u2019 Waged Increasingly Alone", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "At the midpoint of his term, the president has grown more sure of his own judgment and more isolated from anyone else\u2019s than at any point since he took office.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump grows frustrated with advisers during meetings, which is not an uncommon occurrence, he sits back in his chair, crosses his arms and scowls. Often he erupts. \u201cFreaking idiots!\u201d he calls his aides. Except he uses a more pungent word than \u201cfreaking.\u201dFor two years, Mr. Trump has waged war against his own government, convinced that people around him are fools. Angry that they resist his wishes, uninterested in the details of their briefings, he becomes especially agitated when they tell him he does not have the power to do what he wants, which makes him suspicious that they are secretly undermining him.At the midpoint of his term, Mr. Trump has grown more sure of his own judgment and more cut off from anyone else\u2019s than at any point since taking office. He spends ever more time in front of a television, often retreating to his residence out of concern that he is being watched too closely. As he sheds advisers at a head-spinning rate, he reaches out to old associates, complaining that few of the people around him were there at the beginning.\u201cCan you believe this?\u201d he has said as he scanned the torrent of headlines. \u201cI\u2019m doing great, but it\u2019s a war every day.\u201d\u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d he has asked aides, with no acknowledgment that he might have played a role. The aides, many of whom believe he has been treated unfairly by the news media, have replied that journalists are angry that he won and proved them wrong. He nods in agreement at such explanations.As the president vents, he constantly rattles off what he sees as underappreciated accomplishments. \u201cLook what I did for Mexico and Canada,\u201d he has told allies. \u201cLook what\u2019s happened with terrorism.\u201dThe portrait that emerges from interviews with about 30 current and former administration officials, personal friends, political allies, lawmakers and congressional aides suggests a president who revels in sharp swings in direction, feels free to disregard historic allies and presides over near constant turmoil within his own team as he follows his own instincts.White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. But as the president struggles to find a way forward, the path is about to become much more hazardous. As tumultuous as events have been so far, Mr. Trump\u2019s first two years may ultimately look calm compared to what lies ahead.In less than two weeks, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California will take the speaker\u2019s gavel held until now by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and subpoena-wielding House Democrats will be empowered to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s family, business, campaign and administration. At some point after that, he will face the results of whatever Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds about campaign ties to Russia and obstruction of justice.\u201cNothing he\u2019s going to face in the next two years is going to be like the challenges of the previous two years,\u201d said Michael Steel, a longtime adviser to Republicans like Mr. Ryan and former Speaker John A. Boehner. \u201cGiven the staff turnover and the increasing feeling that the president is encircled or cornered by legal and political enemies, it\u2019s entirely possible it gets worse, not better.\u201dAs a result, a partisan war may be just what he wants. He has privately told associates that he is glad Democrats won the House in last month\u2019s midterm elections, saying he thinks that guarantees his re-election because they will serve as a useful antagonist. That may be bravado, but history provides some support. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, his Democratic predecessors, both endured even bigger midterm setbacks and went on to win re-election.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fair to say that it\u2019s better to have Nancy Pelosi as a foil than Paul Ryan as a foil,\u201d said Marc Short, the president\u2019s former legislative affairs director. \u201cIt\u2019s better for the party and it\u2019s better for unity.\u201d He added, \u201cThe reality is the Democrats could overplay their hand.\u201dBoth sides gamely talk about possible cooperation on issues like rebuilding the nation\u2019s tattered network of roads, bridges and other infrastructure. \u201cThe opportunity in the era of divided government is to work with both sides to get something done for the country,\u201d said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat from New Jersey and co-chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.House conservatives, meanwhile, revolted against Mr. Trump when he seemed to retreat on his demand for border wall funding to avert a government shutdown. At the same time, Senate Republicans, who had voted unanimously to keep the government open without the wall money Mr. Trump had demanded, were angry when he reversed course and refused to sign such a measure.Such conflict comes with a cost. Mr. Trump has a way of stepping on his own successes. The border wall fight overshadowed his signing of the criminal justice overhaul. The abrupt way he decided to withdraw from Syria overshadowed the military victories against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump\u2019s focus during the midterm campaign on a caravan of migrants overshadowed the positive economic story he had to tell before the latest stock market gyrations.\u201cWhen he\u2019s talking about the economy, he\u2019s gotten a much more positive reaction,\u201d said David Winston, a Republican pollster. \u201cObviously on other topics he hasn\u2019t been able to get it to the point where he\u2019s able to create an overall job approval. The question is, do you address weaknesses or do you play to your strengths?\u201dSome left in a cloud of corruption allegations, including his health and human services secretary, his Environmental Protection Agency chief and, most recently, his interior secretary. Others left after clashing with Mr. Trump. Mr. Mattis was the last of the so-called axis of adults seen by some as tempering a volatile president, following the ouster of Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state, H. R. McMaster as national security adviser and John F. Kelly as chief of staff.\u201cRex Tillerson and Jim Mattis are two of the finest people ever to serve in government,\u201d said Steve Goldstein, who was under secretary of state until he was fired along with Mr. Tillerson. \u201cThey were very close and worked hard at trying to do what was best for the country, and sometimes that meant being brutally honest with folks at the White House.\u201dBut Fred Fleitz, who worked for nearly six months this year as chief of staff for John R. Bolton, the current national security adviser, said the new team is more cohesive and better suited to Mr. Trump than one constantly undermining him.\u201cHe came in as the ultimate outsider and he brought in some unorthodox policies that worked and he tried some things that didn\u2019t work, and one of the things that didn\u2019t work was bringing in some staffers who didn\u2019t work, like McMaster and Tillerson,\u201d Mr. Fleitz said.In recent days, Mr. Trump has asked aides whether he can fire Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman he appointed, telling advisers that Mr. Powell will \u201cturn me into Hoover,\u201d a reference to the Great Depression-era president. During a meeting with German car executives this month, Mr. Trump threatened to impose higher fuel efficiency standards on their imported cars than required on American vehicles even though aides told him he could not do that.Mr. Trump has spent far less time lately with older friends. The sense of isolation was on display at this month\u2019s holiday parties when he appeared for a few minutes, took a few perfunctory photographs with preselected guests and then disappeared back upstairs rather than mingle. He spent part of this preholiday shutdown weekend alone until Melania could return from Florida.For election night in November, he insisted on throwing a lavish party in the East Room and originally wanted aides to be on display for his guests, a simulation of officials gathering election return information like aides did at Trump Tower in 2016. When White House officials warned that a party would look discordant given the likelihood of losing the House, he insisted on going forward anyway.By all accounts, Mr. Trump\u2019s consumption of cable television has actually increased in recent months as his first scheduled meetings of the day have slid back from the 9 or 9:30 a.m. set by Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff, to roughly 11 many mornings. During \u201cexecutive time,\u201d Mr. Trump watches television in the residence for hours, reacting to what he sees on Fox News. While in the West Wing, he leaves it on during most meetings in the dining room off the Oval Office, one ear attuned to what is being said.Still, for all the reports of a fuming president alarmed at possible impeachment, Mr. Trump rarely expresses such specific anxiety out loud, associates said. Instead he expresses frustration, anger, mania \u2014 all of which aides read like tea leaves to discern what lies beneath.\u201cIt will be a challenge not to be consumed by it,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cIt would only be human when it\u2019s the coverage leading the news every day to be distracted, but it will be important to have the internal discipline not to be.\u201dNo one outside of Mr. Mueller\u2019s office, of course, knows for sure what he will report, but so far he and other prosecutors have drawn a devastating picture of a president surrounded by people who have lied to the authorities, cheated on their taxes, skirted campaign finance laws and secretly worked for foreign interests. The question is what Mr. Mueller will say about Mr. Trump.\u201cMueller will decide whether there\u2019s collusion with the Russians on the election,\u201d said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former White House chief of staff to Mr. Obama. \u201cBut we can now say there\u2019s collusion with the Russians on foreign policy, and it\u2019s not to America\u2019s benefit.\u201dMore recently, Mr. Trump has taken to spending time reminiscing about the happier days of his candidacy and his 2016 victory. He spent the fall showing different groups of visitors what he calls his love letters from North Korea\u2019s iron-fisted dictator, Kim Jong-un, expressing admiration for Mr. Trump. And he still takes joy in aspects of the job, primarily those that demonstrate power. \u201cThe roads closed for me!\u201d he declared to friends this year after a motorcade ride.But those highs have been hard to recapture. The days are filled with conflict, much of it of his own making. More advisers are heading for the door. The divisions are widening, not closing. If it is a \u201cwar every day,\u201d there are no signs of peace.\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to figure out is where does it end,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. \u201cThe language gets coarser on all sides. The respect for the office of the presidency seems less to me than it was. How do we move people back? Or are we in the new reality?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michelle Bachelet: Ignore Climate Change at Your Peril", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsThe attitude that nature is a static element at the service of humanity has long prevailed. The more enlightened among us, however, have realized that this outlook will lead to our ruin. The environment is no longer a secondary concern; it is, in fact, nothing less than the imperative that should guide all future questions about long-term development.The good news is that the urgency of our current environmental plight has accelerated our awareness. The bad news is that we\u2019re already late. We are the last generation of decision makers that can act in time to avoid a planetary catastrophe. The decisions we make today could lead us toward a more climate-resilient future, or they could undermine food, water and energy security for decades to come.Grasping the significance of environmental issues in any discussion on development inevitably leads to questions about its costs. Mitigation and, above all, adaptation and the transitional process away from outdated productive models require a considerable allocation of resources. Once we accept the notion that short-term economic growth cannot be our only guiding principle, the next questions are: How much do we want to invest in this? How much are we willing to sacrifice?There is no simple answer. But the key here is understanding that any economic reading must acknowledge the comparatively low cost of going down this path, especially when taking into account the effects of rising CO2 levels.Every day, new studies provide evidence of the price of inaction: droughts, forest fires, severe storms or extreme rainfall, with a strong impact on crops, livestock or infrastructure. The price of inaction is also visible in the forced displacement of millions of people, and in public health systems suddenly under pressure to respond to new epidemiological scenarios.According to the World Bank, the impact of extreme natural disasters is the equivalent of a $520 billion loss in annual consumption. In fact, climate change could force 100 million people back into extreme poverty by 2030. As experts have pointed out before, if we do not manage climate change, we are simply undoing development.We have demonstrated that productive models can evolve. As people have discovered in Iceland and Costa Rica, we have found that reducing emissions is good business. And we have shown that all countries, small and big, can spearhead relevant solutions to environmental challenges.But if we really want global transformation, we cannot expect each country to do the same thing, and do it on its own. We must commit our collective energies to defending the common good, and finding a balance between economic growth, job creation and environmental demands. We fail if we continue to do things as usual. Such continuity has become a fatal path amid the explosive growth of populations, the growing demand for energy and our dangerous consumption habits. International cooperation, such as efforts like the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, provide a framework to coordinate efforts, support laggard nations and suggest alternatives.But we also need to move forward with a strategy \u2014 much as the United States did with the Marshall Plan, offering economic aid to Europe after World War II \u2014 that speeds up our actions, allows viable investments to make the difference and, among other things, absorbs the risks of the productive turn our economies require.A world of untapped possibilities emerges, for example, when we consider energy transformation. Project Drawdown, a nonprofit environmental coalition, estimates that an increase to 21.6 percent in the global production of onshore wind electricity by 2050 would reduce CO2 emissions by 84.6 gigatons and save $7.4 trillion.The time has come to put a price on the type of development that can be expected to generate lasting cohesion and peace. Because that\u2019s what this is all about: humanity\u2019s survival, done right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jerome Powell Tries a Nuanced Fed Policy. Markets Don\u2019t Like It.", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalking a narrow line between signaling interest rate intentions and vowing to be nimble in response to changing conditions, he helps prompt a stock sell-off.The news conference Jerome Powell gave on Wednesday, his fourth as chairman of the Federal Reserve, was his most consequential to date, coming amid market turbulence and signs of an economic slowdown in the year ahead.But his message \u2014 or at least the part of it that matters most for the direction of the economy and markets \u2014 wasn\u2019t a simple one. It boils down to this:That being the case, there was no reason not to follow through with the interest rate increase that had already been telegraphed.But the choppy global economy and sell-off in stock and certain corporate debt markets has gotten Fed officials\u2019 attention, and they\u2019re open to the possibility that their optimism is misplaced. The officials are now thinking they should raise rates only twice next year, not three times as envisioned in September, and they\u2019re prepared to throttle back further if events justify it.Oh, but the effort to reduce the Fed\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar portfolio of bonds, acquired during its post-crisis era of monetary interventionism, will continue on autopilot, no matter how much President Trump tweets his complaints about it (as he did Tuesday).It\u2019s a bit of a messy combination, which helps explain why stocks sold off as the news conference progressed.Mr. Powell has emphasized that, with the economy relatively healthy, the Fed needs to make its policy moves responsive to incoming information, an approach of \u201cdata dependence.\u201d This contrasts with his immediate predecessors, who stressed \u201cforward guidance\u201d \u2014 using explicit signals about future plans as a tool of policy.\u201cThere\u2019s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the destination of any further increases,\u201d Mr. Powell said in the news conference.But the actual content of Wednesday\u2019s announcement shows how hard it will be to abandon forward guidance in practice.After all, Mr. Powell used a form of forward guidance \u2014 the signal about two 2019 rate increases instead of three \u2014 to indicate that the Fed is taking geopolitical concerns and strains in financial markets seriously. Had he not, the sell-off on Wall Street would have been even worse.And the Fed\u2019s strategy on unwinding its bond holdings in a steady, consistent manner is a form of forward guidance too \u2014 and one that Mr. Powell affirmed.He faced an admittedly tricky task in this meeting. If he had held off on raising interest rates, it would have fueled the idea that there is a \u201cPowell Put\u201d\u2014 that the Fed under his leadership will act like an option contract to prevent stocks from falling too much. It would also have looked as if President Trump\u2019s attacks on the Fed were changing its behavior.At the same time, Mr. Powell and the Fed are plenty attuned to the possibility that market swings, especially in the price of bonds, can reveal important information about what the economic future holds.So the use of this forward guidance was, in effect, a way for Mr. Powell to have it both ways: to keep on the path of tighter money while signaling that the Fed will back off if market turbulence starts to really pinch the economy.Indeed, the market drops over the last couple of months have, to some degree at least, aligned with the Fed\u2019s goals. Some of the markets for corporate debt that had looked a little bubbly two months ago appear less so now.Mr. Powell presumably didn\u2019t want to undo those positive effects, and in discussing economic risks spoke more extensively about international economic challenges than about the strains in interest-sensitive sectors of American industry.It may not have been enough for Wall Street on Wednesday, but there actually was some good news in the materials the Fed published for those who think the rate increase campaign should come to an end sooner rather than later.The consensus view of Fed officials on where their interest rate target ought to end up in the longer term was lowered, to 2.8 percent from 3 percent. That implies that officials have increased comfort with finishing their rate-raising campaign before much longer.But in figuring out whether, and when, to suspend rate increases, Mr. Powell and his colleagues face an inherent contradiction.It\u2019s well and good to make your policy by responding to incoming events, rather than following a preset course. But often a central bank\u2019s most powerful tool for guiding the economy isn\u2019t \u201copen market operations,\u201d the term for buying and selling securities to influence interest rates. It\u2019s \u201copen mouth operations,\u201d or telling the markets what you intend to do.It\u2019s mighty hard to have it both ways, as Mr. Powell found on Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time for G.O.P. to Threaten to Fire Trump", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican leaders need to mount an intervention.Opinion ColumnistUp to now I have not favored removing President Trump from office. I felt strongly that it would be best for the country that he leave the way he came in, through the ballot box. But last week was a watershed moment for me, and I think for many Americans, including some Republicans.It was the moment when you had to ask whether we really can survive two more years of Trump as president, whether this man and his demented behavior \u2014 which will get only worse as the Mueller investigation concludes \u2014 are going to destabilize our country, our markets, our key institutions and, by extension, the world. And therefore his removal from office now has to be on the table.I believe that the only responsible choice for the Republican Party today is an intervention with the president that makes clear that if there is not a radical change in how he conducts himself \u2014 and I think that is unlikely \u2014 the party\u2019s leadership will have no choice but to press for his resignation or join calls for his impeachment.It has to start with Republicans, given both the numbers needed in the Senate and political reality. Removing this president has to be an act of national unity as much as possible \u2014 otherwise it will tear the country apart even more. I know that such an action is very difficult for today\u2019s G.O.P., but the time is long past for it to rise to confront this crisis of American leadership.Trump\u2019s behavior has become so erratic, his lying so persistent, his willingness to fulfill the basic functions of the presidency \u2014 like reading briefing books, consulting government experts before making major changes and appointing a competent staff \u2014 so absent, his readiness to accommodate Russia and spurn allies so disturbing and his obsession with himself and his ego over all other considerations so consistent, two more years of him in office could pose a real threat to our nation. Vice President Mike Pence could not possibly be worse.The damage an out-of-control Trump can do goes well beyond our borders. America is the keystone of global stability. Our world is the way it is today \u2014 a place that, despite all its problems, still enjoys more peace and prosperity than at any time in history \u2014 because America is the way it is (or at least was). And that is a nation that at its best has always stood up for the universal values of freedom and human rights, has always paid extra to stabilize the global system from which we were the biggest beneficiary and has always nurtured and protected alliances with like-minded nations.Donald Trump has proved time and again that he knows nothing of the history or importance of this America. That was made starkly clear in Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\u2019s resignation letter.Trump is in the grip of a mad notion that the entire web of global institutions and alliances built after World War II \u2014 which, with all their imperfections, have provided the connective tissues that have created this unprecedented era of peace and prosperity \u2014 threatens American sovereignty and prosperity and that we are better off without them.So Trump gloats at the troubles facing the European Union, urges Britain to exit and leaks that he\u2019d consider quitting NATO. These are institutions that all need to be improved, but not scrapped. If America becomes a predator on all the treaties, multilateral institutions and alliances holding the world together; if America goes from being the world\u2019s anchor of stability to an engine of instability; if America goes from a democracy built on the twin pillars of truth and trust to a country where it is acceptable for the president to attack truth and trust on a daily basis, watch out: Your kids won\u2019t just grow up in a different America. They will grow up in a different world.The last time America disengaged from the world remotely in this manner was in the 1930s, and you remember what followed: World War II.You have no idea how quickly institutions like NATO and the E.U. and the World Trade Organization and just basic global norms \u2014 like thou shalt not kill and dismember a journalist in your own consulate \u2014 can unravel when America goes AWOL or haywire under a shameless isolated president.But this is not just about the world, it\u2019s about the minimum decorum and stability we expect from our president. If the C.E.O. of any public company in America behaved like Trump has over the past two years \u2014 constantly lying, tossing out aides like they were Kleenex, tweeting endlessly like a teenager, ignoring the advice of experts \u2014 he or she would have been fired by the board of directors long ago. Should we expect less for our president?That\u2019s what the financial markets are now asking. For the first two years of the Trump presidency the markets treated his dishonesty and craziness as background noise to all the soaring corporate profits and stocks. But that is no longer the case. Trump has markets worried.The instability Trump is generating \u2014 including his attacks on the chairman of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is causing investors to wonder where the economic and geopolitical management will come from as the economy slows down. What if we\u2019re plunged into an economic crisis and we have a president whose first instinct is always to blame others and who\u2019s already purged from his side the most sober adults willing to tell him that his vaunted \u201cgut instincts\u201d have no grounding in economics or in law or in common sense. Mattis was the last one.We are now left with the B team \u2014 all the people who were ready to take the jobs that Trump\u2019s first team either resigned from \u2014 because they could not countenance his lying, chaos and ignorance \u2014 or were fired from for the same reasons.But too often Trump has given us disruption without any plan for what comes next. He has worked to destroy Obamacare with no plan for the morning after. He announced a pullout from Syria and Afghanistan without even consulting the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the State Department\u2019s top expert, let alone our allies.And while, yes, we need disruption in some areas, we also desperately need innovation in others. How do we manage these giant social networks? How do we integrate artificial intelligence into every aspect of our society, as China is doing? How do we make lifelong learning available to every American? At a time when we need to be building bridges to the 21st century, all Trump can talk about is building a wall with Mexico \u2014 a political stunt to energize his base rather than the comprehensive immigration reform that we really need.Indeed, Trump\u2019s biggest disruption has been to undermine the norms and values we associate with a U.S. president and U.S. leadership. And now that Trump has freed himself of all restraints from within his White House staff, his cabinet and his party \u2014 so that \u201cTrump can be Trump,\u201d we are told \u2014 he is freer than ever to remake America in his image.We cannot afford to find out.An earlier version of this article misstated the frequency of false or misleading claims told by President Trump. It was an average of almost 11 a day during his first 700 days in office, not five a day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unrest in France Hinders Macron\u2019s Push to Revive Economy", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The need to accelerate growth has long been visible in almost every corner of the French economy, from dreary unemployment offices packed with job seekers to businesses whose financially stretched customers struggle to make do.President Emmanuel Macron came into office pledging to change all that by improving the country\u2019s long-term prospects. But his halting response to a month of violent demonstrations by the so-called Yellow Vest movement over social inequality has clouded his efforts for a revival.The same day, the country\u2019s central bank trimmed its growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent, well off the sluggish pace expected for the year. Businesses have sustained more than 10 billion euros, about $11.4 billion, in damage and lost sales, a figure that will probably grow.\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for business,\u201d Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said Sunday as he toured Paris businesses smashed up by rioters. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for our economy,\u201d he added, a point he pressed again on Tuesday in a briefing with a small group of reporters.He pledged tax cuts and financial support for those having trouble getting by, urged businesses to give employees year-end bonuses and said the government would help minimum-wage earners with a \u20ac100 monthly supplement starting next year.Mr. Macron\u2019s speech, a recorded message just 13 minutes long, was also notable for what he left out.\u201cWe know how important it is for us to be as attractive as possible for foreign investors,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe key point is to make clear that we will remain strong on structural reforms.\u201dWhile foreign investment in France has risen since Mr. Macron came to office, \u201cthere will be a mark left by this episode,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a given that this will succeed in calming the dissatisfaction of a part of the population.\u201dMany of those protesting understand that improving the economy is a long-term project, but their concerns are focused on their monthly efforts to make ends meet. On social networks, some protesters said Mr. Macron\u2019s offer fell short.Mr. Macron has lectured leaders of other eurozone countries \u2014 especially Italy \u2014 about the need to balance their books. Now he must follow his own advice. French ministries have been ordered to find cuts in their budgets, and the government could delay some tax cuts for companies that had been scheduled to kick in next year, Mr. Le Maire said.Mr. Macron also refuses to end a tax break for wealthy citizens that he granted upon taking office. He says the measure was intended to lure money into France, where it can be invested in French companies. The move has drained more than \u20ac3 billion from France\u2019s coffers this year, but Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday that there was no data yet to show whether it was having the promised stimulus effect.Mr. Le Maire has suggested another way to make up the shortfall: pursuing the taxes that he said Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google had avoided paying in France for years. The European Union is considering a plan to impose such taxes. If the union does not reach an accord on doing so by March, Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday, France will move to collect $500 million in back taxes from the tech giants.Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis Bank, which is based in Paris, said that even if the tax cuts and spending increases Mr. Macron had proposed increased France\u2019s budget deficit, \u201cmarkets will accept that\u201d as a price for restoring social stability.Still, the slowdown in growth caused by a month of disruption will make it harder for Mr. Macron to address several major problems.Retailers, including supermarkets and sellers of luxury goods, have collectively lost more than \u20ac1 billion, while small and medium-size companies have lost at least \u20ac10 billion, according to France\u2019s main retail and business associations.The agriculture sector is facing over \u20ac13 billion in losses, said ANIA, the main industry group, citing four weekends of protests that blocked roads, causing delivery delays and often preventing groceries from reaching stores.Tourism has also been affected, with hotels recording cancellation rates as high as 25 percent since the protests started last month. American and Japanese tour operators have been advising customers not to travel to France, according to the National Federation of Tourist Offices.Some companies have paused hiring plans. Auchan, a large supermarket chain, said it might not hire 4,000 temporary workers it had planned to employ across France for the holiday season.Stores that need to make up for lost revenue will be allowed to open on Sundays, something that has been prohibited in most of France by decades-old laws requiring that Sunday be a day of rest.In the end, the main issue for France is not the short-term cost from the demonstrations, said Mr. Artus, the economist.\u201cIt\u2019s whether Macron will keep the reforms going,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to maintain the attractiveness of France.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the bank where Patrick Artus is the chief economist. It is Natixis Bank, not Natexis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Robots Have Descended on Trump Country", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey are leaving many \u2018casualties of history\u2019 in their wake.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The growing use of work robots and the deployment of artificial intelligence have been most disruptive in just those areas of the country that provided President Trump with crucial margins of support in 2016.These job losses are concentratedin blue collar occupations such as machinists, assemblers, material handlers and welders. Workers in these occupations engage in tasks that are being automated by industrial robots, so it is natural for them to experience the bulk of the displacement effect created by this technology.The adverse effects of automation fall disproportionately on the voters who cast most of their ballots for Trump in 2016: White men, much more than women, and whites without college degrees.The Trump tax bill permits \u201cU.S. corporations to expense their capital investment, through 2022. So, if a U.S. corporation buys a robot for $100 thousand, it can deduct the $100 thousand immediately to calculate its U.S. taxable income, rather than recover the $100 thousand over the life of the robot, as under prior law,\u201d Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a specialist in tax policy, wrote me by email.In an email, David Autor, who is also an economist at M.I.T., explained the situation:We find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor\u2019s share of value-added in the industries in which it originates. In the case of employment, these own-industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand.Overall, according to Autor,employment is growing steadily, and its growth in terms of number of jobs has not been discernibly dented by technological progress. But the sum of wage payments to workers is growing more slowly than economic value-added, so labor\u2019s share of the pie of net earnings is falling. This doesn\u2019t mean that wages are falling. It means that they are not growing in lock step with value-added.Automation and productivity improvements, Autor wrote, tend to grow the economic pie in aggregate while simultaneously considerably diminishing some slices and yet expanding others\u2019 dramatically. Most new workplace technologies displace some worker tasks and entire jobs, devalue certain skills, and disrupt livelihoods. This is individually and socially costly and politically disruptive.The experience of immiseration came upon them in a hundred different forms; for the field laborer, the loss of his common rights and the vestiges of village democracy; for the artisan, the loss of his craftsman\u2019s status; for the weaver, the loss of livelihood and of independence; for the child, the loss of work and play in the home; for many groups of workers whose real earnings improved, the loss of security, leisure and the deterioration of the urban environment.While there are parallels between conditions of workers during industrialization in England and during the deindustrialization of regions of this country now, one big difference stands out from a political vantage point: In England, workers turned sharply to the left while here they have moved sharply to the right.Autor identified a contemporary source of discontent. He noted that even if automation creates \u201can opportunity for every citizen to gain in theory,\u201d thatwill almost never happen without forceful social policy and tax policy that spreads the gains and buffers the individual losses. Absent those policies (which the U.S. has little of in general, and even less so today than in earlier decades), losses will tend to be highly concentrated among displaced workers and in communities in which legacy employers are located.The major concern for the labor market in the United States, Autor wrote, is not the number of jobs per se, but the decline in labor\u2019s share of value-added and, even more urgently, the steep falls in earnings among less-educated workers, which certainly have a technological origin.Last but not least, the development and adoption of productivity-enhancing AI technologies cannot be taken for granted. If we do not find a way of creating shared prosperity from the productivity gains generated by AI, there is a danger that the political reaction to these new technologies may slow down or even completely stop their adoption and development. This underscores the importance of studying the distributional implications of AI, the political economy reactions to it, and the design of new and improved institutions for creating more broadly shared gains from these new technologies.Acemoglu and Restrepo agree with Autor thatgreater use of robots in a commuting zone is likely to generate benefits for the rest of the U.S. economy by reducing the prices of tradable goods now produced using robots and by creating shared capital gains.But Acemoglu and Restrepo contend that even after calculating \u201cthese positive spillovers across commuting zones,\u201d there are still \u201cuniformly negative aggregate effects.\u201dTheir calculations suggest that one more robot per thousand workers reduces aggregate employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percentage points or, equivalently, one new robot reduces employment by about 3.3 workers and wages by about 0.37 percent (as opposed to 0.37 percentage points and 0.71 percent, respectively, without trade).I asked Acemoglu whether these findings challenge the economic argument that technological advance is almost always beneficial. He replied:It does challenge the conventional wisdom to some degree. But this conventional wisdom is really up for challenge. The view that technological change always and everywhere benefits most groups is completely devoid of historical context. This isn\u2019t what has happened in history, this isn\u2019t what has happened in the early 20th century.He cited key developments in the late 1890s and early 1990s:During mechanization of agriculture, we have also experienced rapid creation of new jobs and tasks in industry, both for production workers and for clerical workers. If it weren\u2019t for these other changes, many of them technological and social in nature, mechanization of agriculture would have created much more hardship (and today we tend to forget how much hardship it did create in the first place).Acemoglu, Restrepo and Autor are not alone in exploring the economic and political consequences of robotics and artificial intelligence.Until now, automation (robotics, machines more generally, smart systems) has mostly replaced activities that require brawn (agriculture, mining, lifting, warehousing) repetitive physical activity (assembly line, cutting/sowing), basic data management (ledgers, various logistics), while being complementary with complex management, human judgment, highly contextual activities.The demographic group most hindered by the rise of automation, Sachs wrote, \u201chas been the proverbial white male with less than a college degree and living in rural and semirural areas.\u201dSachs believes thatthe next wave of job losses will be in basic business services (wholesale and retail trade, warehousing and transport) which will mean another hit for workers with relatively lower educational attainment.In terms of incomes, according to Sachs, \u201cautomation (including AI) will raise overall output but lower the earnings of some or even all workers, while raising the returns to many forms of capital.\u201dWithout the adoption of redistributive tax and spending policies, he argued,the old, the skilled, and the rich (who will make intergenerational transfers within families to their own children) will benefit at the expense of the young, the less skilled, and the poor. All of this seems to be underway.Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, writing with Robert Seamans, a professor of management at N.Y.U., has a broader view of the positive and negative effects of automation and artificial intelligence.Both the upside and the downside of artificial intelligence, Furman and Seamans point out, have \u201cthe potential to dramatically change the economy,\u201d adding thatOn the one hand, the potential for increased productivity growth is welcome given the decades-long slowing in productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies. On the other hand, the potential for AI-induced labor disruptions could potentially exacerbate existing problems in the labor force, including the decades-long decline in male labor force participation rate.Andrew K. Shotwell, a local attorney, told the County Board that opioid use is increasing and that \u201cOntonagon in the top 10 for that in the state of Michigan.\u201d The Gazette reported that prescriptions \u201crose from 65.6 per 100 people in the county in 2009 to 113 in 2016, more than the number of people.\u201dE.P. Thompson, looking at 19th century England, put the plight of similarly technologically displaced people best:Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience.Ontonagon County is at an extreme, but at the extreme, it illuminates the bleak dislocation much of Trump country has suffered.Per capita retail sales, a measure of economic vitality, were $7,550 last year in the county, according to the census, compared with $13,443 nationally.These are men and women, to quote E.P. Thompson again, who \u201clived through these times of acute social disturbance.\u201d If, Thompson continued, \u201cthey were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.\u201dis clearly bad. The median American household earns less than it did fifteen years ago, labor\u2019s share of national income peaked in the early 1980s and has been falling pretty steadily since then, long-term unemployment has emerged as a vexing problem, and start-ups are creating many fewer jobs than they used to.high-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder, taking on jobs traditionally performed by low-skilled workers, pushing low-skilled workers even further down the occupational ladder and, to some extent, even out of the labor force.I would argue that we have been warned \u2014 the situation that obtains in the country today has to be grasped with the head as much as with the gut.Advertisement"}

The median age is 43, seven years older than city dwellers. Its productivity, defined as output per worker, is lower than urban America\u2019s. Its families have lower incomes. And its share of the population is shrinking: the United States has grown by 75 million people since 1990, but this has mostly occurred in cities and suburbs. Rural areas have lost some 3 million people. Since the 1990s, problems such as crime and opioid abuse, once associated with urban areas, are increasingly rural phenomena.These days, economic growth bypasses rural economies. In the first four years of the recovery after the 2008 recession, counties with fewer than 100,000 people lost 17,500 businesses, according to the Economic Innovation Group. By contrast, counties with more than 1 million residents added, altogether, 99,000 firms. By 2017, the largest metropolitan areas had almost 10 percent more jobs than they did at the start of the financial crisis. Rural areas still had fewer.I\u2019ve lived most of my life in big cities. I don\u2019t pretend to understand what it\u2019s like to live in a small town or on a family farm, or how it feels when all the jobs in a community seem to be fading away. I do spend a lot of time thinking about how the economic changes of the last several decades have undercut many American workers. One thing seems clear to me: nobody \u2014 not experts or policymakers or people in these communities \u2014 seems to know quite how to pick rural America up.There are 1,888 counties in America in which more than half the population is rural, according to the Census Bureau, and they stretch from coast to coast.New York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square milePopulation density by countySan Francisco County, Calif.Urban countiesRural counties18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataPopulation density by countyUrban countiesRural countiesNew York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square mileSan Francisco County, Calif.18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataPopulation density by countyUrban countiesRural countiesNew York County, N.Y.73,475 people per square mileSan Francisco County, Calif.18,871 people per square mileLexington City, Va.2,843 people per square mileSource: Brookings analysis of Census Bureau dataIn Comanche County, a land of cattle, farming, oil and gas on the plains of southwestern Kansas, 1,790 people live in a sparsely settled area of nearly 800 square miles. In Perry County \u2014 home to some 26,500 people in the Appalachian Mountains of Eastern Kentucky \u2014 so far no other industry has replaced once-mighty coal. Essex County in New York\u2019s Adirondacks is three-quarters rural, by the census definition. So is Calaveras County in California.After World War II, small town prosperity relied on its contribution to the industrial economy. The census considers Price County, Wis., to be 100 percent rural. Still, over a third of the jobs there are in manufacturing, from building industrial machines to assembling trucks. Auto parts manufacturers in West Point, Ga., draw workers from all over Troup County. Overall, manufacturing employs about one in eight workers in the country\u2019s 704 entirely rural counties. That\u2019s more than agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining combined and second only to education, health care and social assistance, which includes teachers, doctors, nurses and social service counselors. Most of those jobs are government funded.But factory jobs can no longer keep small-town America afloat. Even after a robust eight-year growth spell, there are fewer than 13 million workers in manufacturing across the entire economy. Robots and workers in China put together most of the manufactured goods that Americans buy, and the high-tech industries powering the economy today don\u2019t have much need for the cheap labor that rural communities contributed to America\u2019s industrial past. They mostly need highly educated workers. They find those most easily in big cities, not in small towns.Consider Lake County, in Tennessee. Some 7,500 people live there, about 500 fewer than in 2000. Lake County is betting on a new industrial park on Cates Landing on the Mississippi River. But it will be tough to reverse years of declining employment. Between 2013 and 2017, the county averaged fewer than 250 manufacturing jobs, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. That\u2019s half as many as it had in 2000.Wisely, they suggest that any federal government effort must choose its targets carefully. Better to focus on middle-sized places that are near big tech hubs and have some critical infrastructure, rather than scatter assistance all over the landscape.Share of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaKing County, Wash.15%Fairfax County, Va.27%Osceola County, Mich.10%Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataShare of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaOsceola County, Mich.10%Fairfax County, Va.27%King County, Wash.15%Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataShare of digital and technology jobs by countyUrban countiesRural counties1 million+ people<50K people not adjacent to metro areaFairfax County, King County, Source: Brookings analysis of Emsi dataSound as these ideas may be, however, even the authors concede that they may not be up to the task. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these ideas are going to work,\u201d Mr. Galston acknowledged when I pressed him on the issue. \u201cBut it is worth making the effort.\u201dThis is the inescapable reality of agglomeration, one of the most powerful forces shaping the American economy over the last three decades. Innovative companies choose to locate where other successful, innovative companies are. That\u2019s where they can find lots of highly skilled workers. The more densely packed these pools of talent are, the more workers can learn from each other and the more productive they become. This dynamic feeds on itself, drawing more high-tech firms and highly skilled workers to where they already are.\u201cWe have a spatial reorganization of the economy,\u201d said Mr. Muro. \u201cWe have an archipelago of superstars in an ocean of low-productivity sectors.\u201dAfter examining a range of potential policy interventions, they conclude that a targeted employment subsidy, such as the earned-income tax credit, is probably the most powerful tool available to revive employment. But they, too, are not sure it will work. \u201cOur call for a wage subsidy is us saying, \u2018We can\u2019t figure this out, and we hope the private sector will,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mr. Glaeser told me.There are, to be sure, some rural communities with productivity as high as some big cities. But they rely on heavily mechanized and automated industries that support few jobs: oil extraction or large-scale agriculture, in which tractors talk to satellites and no drivers are involved. The livestock business on the vast pastures of Sioux County, Neb., for example, supports an economy worth $306,000 per worker, according to data from Mr. Muro and Jacob Whiton of Brookings. But only 1,200 people live there.In the Southeast Fairbanks area of Alaska, it is all about oil and gas. Output per worker is $203,000. But its population doesn\u2019t quite reach 7,000.Excluding these places, the United States is still left with 50 to 55 million people living in rural communities that no longer have much to offer them economically.What if nothing really works? Is there really no option but to do nothing and, as some have suggested, return depopulated parts of rural America to the bison?Instead of so-called place-based policies to revitalize small towns, why not help their residents take advantage of opportunities where the opportunities are? Geographic mobility hit a historical low in 2017, when only 11 percent of Americans picked up shop and moved \u2014 half the rate of 1951. One of the key reasons is that housing in the prosperous cities that offer the most opportunities has become too expensive.The most helpful policy for people in small towns could be to relax zoning rules in dense cities like New York and San Francisco, so that more affordable housing could be built to receive newcomers from rural Wisconsin or Kentucky, and they wouldn\u2019t need the income of an investment banker or a computer scientist to afford to live there.Still, there are compelling reasons to try to help rural economies rebound. Even if moving people might prove more efficient on paper than restoring places, many people \u2014 especially older people and the family members who care for them \u2014 may choose to remain in rural areas. What\u2019s more, the costs of rural poverty are looming over American society. Think of the opioid addiction taking over rural America, of the spike in crime, of the wasted human resources in places where only a third of adults hold a job.And if today\u2019s polarized politics are noxious, what might they look like in a country perpetually divided between diverse, prosperous liberal cities and a largely white rural America in decline? As Mr. Galston warned: \u201cThink through the political consequences of saying to a substantial portion of Americans, which is even more substantial in political terms, \u2018We think you\u2019re toast.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe distress of 50 million Americans should concern everyone. Powerful economic forces are arrayed against rural America and, so far, efforts to turn it around have failed. Not every small town can be a tech hub, nor should it be. But that can\u2019t be the only answer.An earlier version of a map showing population density by county omitted New York County, which covers Manhattan.Advertisement"}

The move would give the city an economic lift at a time when General Motors and Ford are cutting jobs.Fiat Chrysler\u2019s idle Mack Avenue plant, which previously made V6 engines, will be extensively retooled over the next 12 to 24 months to begin producing the new Jeep, according to those briefed on the plans.The plant is likely to employ at least 1,800, they said. Auto assembly plants typically have 2,000 to 4,000 workers.\u201cJeep is growing, and to keep that going they have to feed it product,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive editor at Autotrader. \u201cAnd man, that\u2019s good news for Detroit.\u201dThe new vehicle will be bigger than any current Jeep model, reflecting a shift in consumer tastes that has roiled the industry. Prompted by low gasoline prices, Americans are flocking to sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks and shunning compacts and sedans. They have also been drawn by improvements in fuel economy and comfort that manufacturers have made in the last five years.Heavy bets on large vehicles reflect the automakers\u2019 conclusion that gasoline prices will remain low to moderate for several more years.Fiat Chrysler said in June that it intended to add at least three new Jeep models by 2022, including a Gladiator pickup that will go into production next year, and several battery-powered variants. The company makes most Jeeps at two plants in Toledo and its Jefferson North plant in Detroit. All three are operating at nearly full capacity.The Jeep brand, one of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s top moneymakers, is among the few auto brands still growing in the United States. In the first 11 months of this year, Fiat Chrysler has sold 892,000 Jeeps, a rise of 18 percent from the previous year. The company\u2019s total United States sales were up 8 percent, while the overall domestic vehicle market was flat.Fiat Chrysler is on track to sell about two million Jeeps worldwide this year, up from 730,000 in 2013.

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Allies Fear That Traditional Ties No Longer Matter Under Trump", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a former French defense official, it was a landmark moment of an American president under fire, in open opposition to his intelligence and military structures, acting with utter disregard for traditional American allies in his sudden decisions to pull troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.\u201cUntil now, you could talk about hedging, and all allies were doing it fairly prudently,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said. \u201cBut now everyone will have to work on the assumption that the alliance system is no longer there. The organizations are there, the treaties are there, the troops and equipment are still there, but the high priest of that church is gone.\u201dThese alliances cost the American taxpayer real money, of course, but the payments were not altruistic \u2014 they prevented the United States from having to engage in yet another global conflict, another world war. And they created increasingly wealthy markets for American products, both industrial and agricultural.In Beijing, China\u2019s military leaders are certain to be pleased. To demonstrate American support for Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its territory, Mr. Mattis dispatched warships to the Taiwan Strait three times this year. He also pushed back hard against Beijing in the South China Sea, sending warships close to disputed islands that China claims.A new American defense secretary whose thinking would be more in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s could be an opportunity for China, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University.\u201cCertainly Trump wants a more compliant secretary of defense,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cWith China, Trump focuses on the economy, not security or geopolitics. But the military has been pushing vigorously on Taiwan and the South China Sea. Let\u2019s see if this will change.\u201dFor France and Britain, it was a time to question their involvement under American leadership in both Syria and Afghanistan. The French defense minister, Florence Parly, said Friday morning that French forces were in the Middle East and engaged over Syria \u201cin the framework of a coalition, which is led by the Americans,\u201d trying to eliminate the remaining Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria \u201cat the side of the Americans.\u201dBut now, \u201cit is evident\u201d that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria \u201cprofoundly changes the situation,\u201d Ms. Parly told RTL radio. The Islamic State is not dead, as Mr. Trump asserted, she said.\u201cThe risk is that by not finishing off these pockets, they can grow again, regain territory and hit Europe again,\u201d she added. \u201cThe job must be finished.\u201dBritain, with troops alongside American forces in Afghanistan, must also recalibrate, said Ivor Roberts, a former ambassador.\u201cAll around for America\u2019s allies, it\u2019s a matter of great dismay,\u201d he said. In Syria, \u201cTrump has given comfort to people I wouldn\u2019t think the United States would want to give comfort to: the Russians, Iranians and ISIS.\u201dThe United States has been so indispensable for so long at the geopolitical table. But many analysts say Mr. Trump\u2019s volatility and disregard for allies could fundamentally diminish America\u2019s global clout if the country is no longer seen as a dependable ally.\u201cPresident Trump seems to think he can have it both ways,\u201d said Karin von Hippel, director of the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies, a military research institute in London. \u201cWithdraw U.S. troops from every deployment, reduce financial support for international institutions such as NATO or the U.N., cede U.S. leadership on peace processes in places such as Syria, Yemen, Libya \u2014 and still keep the prominent seat at the table.\u201cI\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe are already seeing like-minded countries moving on without the United States as well as countries such as China, Russia and Iran filling the void that has been created. U.S. withdrawal can only lead to more global insecurity, which will negatively impact the United States as much as Europe.\u201dMore immediately, the abruptness of Mr. Trump\u2019s latest moves, coupled with the Mattis resignation, left many allies feeling left out.Japan\u2019s secretary of defense, Takeshi Iwaya, said he was surprised by the resignation. \u201cNot only did he work for close cooperation between Japan and the U.S., he also showed very strong leadership,\u201d Mr. Iwaya said of Mr. Mattis. \u201cI am hoping that the policy of close cooperation as allies will continue.\u201dAnother Japanese official, however, expressed confidence that the military alliance with the United States would remain strong given Mr. Trump\u2019s close personal relationship with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.The unexpected troop withdrawals in Syria and Afghanistan did not just startle allies, some analysts predicted the moves could diminish American leverage, rather than enhance it.\u201cTrump has pulled the rug out from under our negotiators in both Syria and Afghanistan,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a former American diplomat who has been critical of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhy will the Russians and Iranians make concessions to us in Syria now that they know we are leaving? Why will the Taliban deal seriously with us now that they know half our troops will be withdrawn so suddenly?\u201d he asked, referring to possible peace talks in Afghanistan.To many analysts, the whole flurry of changes is dizzying, but also the new reality.\u201cEuropeans can no longer pretend that there is not a fundamental shift in the way the United States perceives of her military role in the world,\u201d said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.6 percent, pushing it 19.5 percent below its late-August peak. A decline of 20 percent marks the start of a bear market.On its own, the broader S&P 500 is down more than 15 percent from its peak, close to entering a bear market and ending the long bull rally that began in early 2009.\u201cThere\u2019s just a constant selling pressure,\u201d said Paul Hickey, a founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, a financial market research firm in Harrison, N.Y. \u201cIt\u2019s just any excuse is an excuse to sell.\u201dOn Thursday, investors had their pick of excuses.Tensions between the United States and China flared as the Justice Department unveiled new indictments of Chinese nationals accused of hacking government and corporate targets on behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies.Shares of technology companies, increasingly the epicenter of the confrontation between China and the United States over trade, security and technology, fell sharply. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft were all down more than 2 percent.Elsewhere, President Trump again raised the specter of a federal government shutdown if he didn\u2019t receive funding for his promised border wall.And crude oil extended its slump, sending energy stocks sharply lower. The S&P energy sector led the declines in the S&P 500, with the energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron dropping 3.1 percent and 2.7 percent.American benchmark crude oil prices tumbled 4 percent more, pushing the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude to nearly $46 a barrel.Initially, the sharp slump in crude oil prices \u2014 they\u2019re down more than 23 percent this year \u2014 was seen as a result of a global supply glut that was expected to be transitory. But as the sell-off has persisted, the decline has raised questions among investors about the strength of global demand and economic health.\u201cWhen prices move in a sustained way it\u2019s telling you something about demand,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, an economic consulting firm.Asian markets followed Wall Street lower in Friday morning trading, with Japan\u2019s 1.8 percent drop leading the way. Futures markets, however, suggested Wall Street could open higher on Friday.The global economy does appear to be slowing. Official figures in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, show it is growing at its slowest pace in a decade. The world\u2019s No. 3 and 4 economies, Japan and Germany, both contracted during the third quarter.At the same time, the world\u2019s largest economy, the United States, had one of its strongest years of economic growth since 2005. That was due in part to a jolt of fiscal stimulus in the form of a deep cut to corporate tax rates.But for financial markets, the books are already closed on 2018. And asset prices are painting a much more dour picture of the economic outlook.The S&P 500 is now down nearly 16 percent from its Sept. 20 peak, as investors have grown increasingly uncertain about the outlook for the economy and corporate profits.Many had hoped that the right mutterings from the Federal Reserve as part of Wednesday\u2019s decision on interest rates could offer a lifeline to a market rally that began in the economic wreckage of the financial crisis in March 2009.By some measures, that bull market is the longest on record, having pulled the stock market up more than 250 percent.\u201cEverything points to the Fed needing to stop,\u201d said Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at the brokerage and investment banking firm Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. \u201cAnd until they do, it\u2019s kind of hard to put a floor under stocks.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Does the E.U. Think This Is Going to End?", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the standoff over Italy\u2019s debt, Brussels is playing a very dangerous game.Mr. Tooze is an economic historian and the author of \u201cCrashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World.\u201dThe European Union and Italy have been in a standoff over the Italian government\u2019s debt for weeks. Brussels \u2014 supported by the rest of the governments of Europe \u2014 seems to believe that Rome will soon back down, delivering another victory for European Union discipline. But that\u2019s far from certain. Moreover, even if the Italian government does fall into line, the political consequences may prove disastrous for Europe. However the drama ends, Europe is playing a dangerous game.Italy\u2019s real financial problem, however, is not the annual budget shortfall but the country\u2019s mountain of outstanding debt, running to a total of 2.6 trillion euros, most of which was piled up decades ago by political parties that no longer exist. Today the debt burden hovers around 133 percent of gross domestic product.Debts at this level can easily become unsustainable, growing faster than the income necessary to repay them. The debt is widely held by banks inside and outside Italy. A scenario in which Italy had difficulty meeting its financing needs would deal a shattering blow to Europe\u2019s fragile financial system. Given this delicate balance, there is little room for error. Every opportunity must be taken to lower the ratio of debt to G.D.P.With the eurozone\u2019s having experienced a modest recovery since 2013, and even Italy\u2019s economy growing again, the European Commission argues that Italy should tighten its belt. Rome demurs.Of course, no government wants to embrace cuts. But there is a more basic point here: For the commission to declare Italy fit to make budget cuts just because the country has seen some growth is in glaring contradiction to actual economic and political conditions.The two parties that make up the current Italian government, the League and the Five Star Movement, were elected in March to address this crisis. The League is xenophobic; Five Star is erratic and zany. But the economic programs on which they campaigned are hardly outlandish. The League wants tax cuts for its core constituency of small businesses. Five Star wants a minimum income guarantee for its voters in Italy\u2019s poorer southern regions. Both want to coddle Italy\u2019s pensioners. These proposals will increase the deficit. But at the same time, Rome argues, they will deliver a much-needed stimulus.How much stimulus is the key question.The Italian government\u2019s budget forecasts are optimistic. But others, including the Bank of Italy and the Peterson Institute of International Economics, warn that Italy is caught in a trap: Anxieties about debt sustainability mean that any stimulus has the perverse effect of driving up interest rates, squeezing bank lending and reducing growth.Currently, market confidence is still supported by European Central Bank bond purchases. In 2019 the E.C.B.\u2019s outgoing president, Mario Draghi, a longtime advocate of Italian discipline, is stopping the bank\u2019s bond buying. Tension is set to rise.The European Commission is, of course, bound to defend its rules. But how does the European Union expect the confrontation to play out?It will therefore have to be the markets that deliver the discipline. But that is a terrifying prospect: Not only is Italy\u2019s debt huge, but Italy\u2019s banks are not minnows, either. Italy is both too big to fail and too big to bail.So what is the game plan? If the commission is gambling that the budget crisis will force Italy\u2019s government to fold, what direction does it imagine the government folding in?The last time Italy\u2019s public debt was in the eurozone\u2019s spotlight was in the fall of 2011. Then, the resolution was political: Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was toppled in favor of the unelected technocrat Mario Monti. Mr. Monti was the darling of the markets. But back home, public outrage against the suspension of normal democratic procedures helped to trigger the upsurge of the Five Star Movement, which culminated with its taking 32 percent of the vote in March.The European Commission can hardly wish to repeat that cycle.On the back of its election victory, Five Star was the senior partner in the coalition formed in May. But the balance of power has shifted. While Five Star\u2019s popularity has slid, support for the League has doubled to 34 percent. The League is a party of northern Italian small business. It is far from keen on Five Star\u2019s plans to increase welfare for the south. A League-dominated reshuffle that dropped Five Star\u2019s expensive minimum-income guarantee would go a long way to meeting the financial demands of the European Commission. The new government might even find common ground with Brussels on issues of \u201csupply-side reform.\u201d That would no doubt reassure investors, but it would be a disastrous outcome for the European Union, handing a political victory to Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, who makes no secret of his desire to remake Europe as an arena of neo-nationalist, nativist politics.If strengthening the League is not the commission\u2019s intention, perhaps Brussels is hoping for a tactical withdrawal by Rome. A face-saving compromise may yet be arranged over the expensive pension proposals. If the government crumbles, perhaps a new election might yield a more compliant majority.But this is, to say the least, a high-risk and negative strategy. Above all it fails to address the deep sense of crisis in Italy. If the European Union is determined to hold the line on debt and deficits, it should offer something positive in exchange, such as a common European investment and growth strategy or a more cooperative approach to the refugee question, which has driven the upsurge in the League. If all Brussels has to offer is discipline, it is inviting the remaking of Italian politics along lines that are more nationalist and more hostile to Europe.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump has been right to press all the issues, though his methods so far have yielded more disruption than progress.But Mr. Trump has also taken trade hostage, and we\u2019re all prisoners alongside it. He reasons that because Americans buy more stuff from our trading partners than those countries buy from us, he has the stronger hand.

{"Headline": "Trump Renews Attack on Fed as Mnuchin Tries to Calm Markets", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 48-hour effort by the Trump administration to soothe jittery financial markets did little to reverse the free fall in stocks on Monday, as the president\u2019s renewed attack on the Federal Reserve and the specter of a prolonged government shutdown further rattled investors already worried about a global economic slowdown.With a single tweet on Monday, President Trump undercut his top economic advisers\u2019 efforts to reassure the markets that he did not intend to fire Jerome H. Powell as Fed chairman. But Mr. Trump, who blames the Fed\u2019s recent interest rate increases for the market gyrations, said \u201cthe only problem our economy has is the Fed,\u201d an assertion that exacerbated the worst sell-off on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis.Stocks continued marching toward their largest December declines since the 1930s, with the S&P 500 closing down 2.7 percent on Monday after a shortened trading session ahead of the Christmas holiday.The markets are trying to digest the confusing signals from Washington. On Saturday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, posted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump acknowledging that, while he did not agree with the Fed\u2019s recent interest rate increases, he did not have any plans to fire Mr. Powell. And Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Mr. Trump now realized he lacked authority to fire Mr. Powell, his handpicked chairman.For the markets, the Fed is a complicated player at the moment. Investors have been disappointed by rising interest rates, concerned that they could sap growth. But the speculation about firing Mr. Powell, a move that could turn the independent central bank into a political tool, has undermined confidence in a pivotal institution essential to economic policy.Markets have already been on edge in recent weeks because of uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations between the United States and China, signs of slowing global growth, and the prospect of a prolonged government shutdown in the United States. Mr. Mnuchin added to the economic jitters by announcing on Sunday that he had called bank executives to ensure the markets were functioning properly, the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis.\u201cIt signaled a sense of panic and anxiety that didn\u2019t need to be there,\u201d said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \u201cMy first reaction when I heard it was, what has happened over the last couple of days that the market does not understand or realize? Is there something that Treasury knows that the rest of us don\u2019t?\u201dAnd while Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney tried to reassure markets on the Fed\u2019s leadership, there is still an effort within the White House to discern whether any legal rationale exists for removing Mr. Powell from the chairman spot, according to two people familiar with the discussions.Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, has been openly critical of the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates and blamed the central bank for the market volatility. Mr. Mnuchin, meanwhile, has said the recent stock swings are the result of high-speed electronic trading and post-crisis financial rules that he says make it harder for banks to play their traditional market-stabilization role.Mr. Trump on Monday made clear he is still not happy with Mr. Powell, likening the Fed to a \u201cpowerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch - he can\u2019t putt!\u201dThose attacks have drawn criticism from former Fed officials as well as lawmakers from both parties, who say that any attempt to turn the Fed into a political organ would undermine its credibility. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.On Monday, Senator Jeff Flake, the retiring Arizona Republican, posted a photograph on Twitter of a 5-billion-dollar bank note from Zimbabwe and urged the president to back off.\u201cI\u2019ve lived in countries where the Head of State has used the central bank for political purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease respect the Fed\u2019s independence, Mr. President.\u201dAnd Wall Street is bracing for more intervention from a president who views the stock market as a report card of his presidency. Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at the investment advisory firm Veda Partners, spent her weekend studying the 1935 Banking Act to determine whether Mr. Trump could unseat Mr. Powell as chairman but keep him on the Fed board without violating the law. She has yet to determine whether that could pass legal muster.Treasury officials tried to brush away criticism of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s public statement and his calls to bank executives, saying he was trying to ensure that banks had ample liquidity for lending. But the conversations were described by several on the receiving end as more routine than the striking statement suggested.The Treasury secretary asked for updates on how markets were functioning and inquired about any stresses in the system, according to one bank chief executive. Another bank C.E.O. was so unconcerned about the recent fall in stocks that he used his time with Mr. Mnuchin to discuss new capital requirements and how they could affect the bank\u2019s balance sheet in the long term as the Fed continues selling government securities it amassed during the financial crisis, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion.Policymakers who participated in the President\u2019s Working Group call on Monday also described it as a routine meeting, with no market problems reported and nothing to warrant an official statement after the discussion. The call was described by a person familiar with the conversation as a \u201ccheck-in\u201d scheduled at the Treasury\u2019s request for officials so they could plan for a prolonged government shutdown.Negotiations to end the partial government shutdown have remained at an impasse since midnight Friday when funding lapsed for a number of federal agencies and nine departments, including the Treasury. Neither chamber is expected to reconvene until Thursday, with House lawmakers looking to the Senate Democrats and Mr. Trump to reach a compromise over border security funding.The decision to convene the working group, which became known as the Plunge Protection Team during the 2008 financial crisis, struck some former officials as curious given that its duties have mostly been taken over by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. That body, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, held a public meeting last week when it also published its annual report, which had little mention of market concerns.\u201cNow that the administration has chosen this extremely rare policy approach of verbal intervention in the stock market its credibility is at risk should markets settle lower,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.Former Treasury officials said Mr. Mnuchin had probably amplified concerns about the markets by publicizing his efforts to calm them.\u201cI never heard anyone in any venue in the last two months voice any concerns about liquidity,\u201d said Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, noting that Mr. Mnuchin had injected more uncertainty into the calculations of investors.Mr. O\u2019Neill also suggested that Mr. Mnuchin was in a difficult position in trying to assuage a mercurial boss and could be overcompensating to please him.\u201cThe president apparently is blaming Mnuchin for the markets going south, which is a fairly strange thing,\u201d he said.Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy secretary of the Treasury under President Barack Obama and a former Fed governor, said Mr. Mnuchin would be better served keeping conversations about financial stability private.\u201cWhen you do something like that you\u2019ve got to be really careful and quiet about it,\u201d Ms. Raskin said. \u201cYou run the risk of planting the seeds of doubt in people\u2019s minds.\u201dBut, Ms. Raskin suggested, Mr. Mnuchin could have been trying to show the president, who canceled his own Florida vacation, that he was working hard despite traveling with his children to a resort in Mexico.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just worried because he\u2019s in Cabo, the markets are going down and the Treasury secretary is in another country and they don\u2019t like the optics of that,\u201d she said.Emily Flitter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Expect a Much Less Aggressive Fed in 2019", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhether the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate Wednesday or not may be less important to investors than what it says about the path of rates next year.In the futures market that investors use to bet on the Fed\u2019s decisions, traders are indicating the central bank will raise rates by a quarter point to between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent when the Fed wraps up its two-day meeting on Wednesday.But after that, investors expect to wait awhile for the next increase \u2014 and that\u2019s a view that has changed fast.The odds that there will be just one rate increase in the next year now stand at nearly 60 percent, up from 9 percent just over a month ago. And the chances that it raises rates twice or less by the end of 2019 have risen to 89 percent, up from 41 percent in early November.And odds of three or more rises next year? Those have fallen to just over 2 percent.The data highlights the shifting outlook for interest rates in the markets over the past months and stands in contrast to the forecasts of most Fed officials at the central bank\u2019s September meeting. Projections from that meeting showed a majority of Fed officials expected the central bank to raise rates three or more times in 2019.But much has changed since that meeting. Stocks across Wall Street have tumbled more than 10 percent; oil prices have sunk more than 30 percent; inflation has become more muted; and some of the world\u2019s largest economies, including China, Germany and Japan, have shown signs of weakness.Fed officials also have appeared to soften their tone on the future of rate rises.The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, helped set off the early October sell-off when he said the Fed\u2019s main policy rate was \u201ca long way\u201d from neutral, or the rate at which the Fed would no longer be tapping the brakes or pressing the gas. The comment worried investors, who took it to mean that the Fed still had longer to go on its tightening path than expected.Traders do not just expect fewer rate rises next year. They also forecast the pace the Fed takes rates higher will slow. A month ago, odds that the central bank would raise rates twice by the end of its June meeting were nearly 60 percent. Currently, they are 31 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Electric Vehicles Are Gathering Speed in Latin America", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo fight global warming and air pollution, cities across the region are taking advantage of innovations in urban transportation. Ms. Viscidi and Mr. Edwards are specialist in energy and climate change.But several factors are impeding the progress of EVs in Latin America, including upfront costs that are hefty for developing countries, subsidized fossil fuels, a lack of vehicle fuel efficiency standards, insufficient charging infrastructure, and bidding processes to procure new buses, which prioritize least cost options disqualifying cleaner technologies with higher upfront costs. To overcome these barriers, governments need to strengthen financial incentives and standards favoring clean technologies, expand programs for electrifying high-use vehicles, develop electric mobility strategies and goals, and create public-private partnerships.Governments have attempted to counter high price tags with both financial and nonfinancial incentives. In 2017, the Colombian government eliminated import tariffs for up to 1,500 E.V.s per year through 2019. By 2023, the annual quota will increase to 3,000. In July, Colombia\u2019s stock of E.V.s surpassed 1000 units \u2014 in 2012, just 33 were sold.Local and national governments should also incorporate electric mobility into long-term energy and transportation planning. Electric mobility strategies can provide clarity to markets and direction for public policy. Building on the region\u2019s first law to incentivize E.V.s in Costa Rica, which entered into force in January, President Carlos Alvarado has announced that by 2021 his administration will launch a plan to establish a fossil fuel-free transportation system.Finally, partnerships involving city governments and private utilities, automakers, bus companies and local businesses have also accelerated the adoption of E.V.s across Latin America and should serve as models. Last year, Mexico had some 1,500 publicly accessible chargers, most of which were installed by Tesla through deals with shopping centers and hotels. Low-interest loans from multilateral development banks are also enabling cities to make the large upfront payments for electric buses.E.V.s alone are not a silver bullet. Addressing urban transportation challenges requires a multifaceted approach that should include improvements to public transportation, stricter fuel efficiency and fuel quality standards for all vehicles, and the expansion of nonmotorized transport including walking and biking. But as the only zero-emissions vehicles, E.V.s will play a vital role in meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.After decades in which the world\u2019s transportation system has scarcely changed, urban mobility appears on the cusp of rapid transformation. As the world embraces this transition, Latin America is also getting on board.Lisa Viscidi is director of the Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries Program at the Inter-American Dialogue.

The tax cuts have failed to increase gross domestic product beyond the \u201csugar high\u201d stimulus they gave to an economy already heading toward record low unemployment. The economy seems to be slowing, making a mockery of the promise of strong growth that was used to peddle the tax cuts. To pay for the millionaire tax cuts, sacrifices had to be made. So Congress limited deductions for state and local taxes to $10,000 annually. While that generally applies to well-to-do people who can itemize their tax returns, it was also a clear shot against blue states such as California and New York that have relatively high state and local taxes. But reducing these deductions, along with higher interest rates, punished the housing market, which is stagnant nationally and in a free fall in the Northeast.Our ability to keep the $1 trillion deficit created by the Trump tax cuts from deepening depends in part on collecting taxes to which the government is legally entitled.

{"Headline": "When Does Political Art Cross the Line?", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsAs far back as one can trace, political art has been problematic but ultimately necessary, as it forces art outside of its comfort zones and connects artists with the world.As an artist living in exile, I have often found myself crossing the art world\u2019s thin red line, not deliberately but because political reality is what has defined my life. But it isn\u2019t only artists in exile who must deal with this borderline \u2014 it exists wherever there is an intersection between art and profit, whenever artists are pulled in opposite directions, balancing high aesthetics and politically charged and relevant subjects.To share a personal experience, in the aftermath of the Egyptian revolution, I set up a temporary studio at a local arts organization near Tahrir Square in Cairo. I shot a series of portraits of grieving elderly Egyptian men and women as they described tragedies, such as the loss of their children, that they experienced during the revolution. I had hoped to capture the human cost behind such euphoric revolutions, which often hit impoverished communities the hardest.Soon after this photographic series, \u201cOur House Is on Fire,\u201d was exhibited at the Rauschenberg Foundation\u2019s gallery space in New York, a nonprofit organization who had originally commissioned the project, a critic published a piece accusing me of framing Egyptians\u2019 sorrows for commercial galleries in Chelsea to invoke pity and ultimately profit, clearly oblivious to the fact that proceeds from online sales went to charity organizations of my choosing in Egypt.After reading the criticism of \u201cOur House is on Fire,\u201d I was taken aback, wondering whether the critic\u2019s interpretation and accusations may have been correct. Was I guilty of manipulating people\u2019s emotions to make art? Or was he wrong by grossly misrepresenting the truth and bending a narrative that fit his own anti-art world and political agenda?But then again, whenever there has been human loss, conflict or tragedy, there has also been art. There are also vastly different value systems that judge the validity and appropriateness of such art, which often at its purest intent is meant to make sense out of shambles, to distill essence out of chaos.By scrutinizing another artist\u2019s intent in engaging in a humanitarian project though, I realized I wasn\u2019t that different from the critic who had questioned my own integrity as an artist. I realized that there is a paradox for artists in exile, as their emotional response to ongoing horrors is often reflective of their own personal experiences, while at odds with maintaining an artistic career that has placed them in a position of privilege.Perhaps the problem resides in our hegemonic system, in which Western free-market consumerism and its cultural production machinery run rampant throughout the practice of art. And what is different and in opposition to this system is either marginalized or co-opted so as to appear open and inclusive. It is therefore through the filter of this lens that the work of artists such of Ai (characterized as the brave exiled artist who escaped the tyranny of his homeland) and myself (the oppressed exiled Iranian Muslim woman artist) can be legitimized and viewed.Politically conscious, humanitarian art is as necessary as the air we breathe today if we are to survive these trying times and not be condemned to repeat our endless cycle of terror and human tragedies, even if the hegemonic forces of the art world influence our every move. It is ultimately up to the artists to determine the future of this thin red line, and how easily it can be crossed \u2014 not the critics nor the market.Shirin Neshat is an Iranian American visual artist and filmmaker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Center Being Born", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe market and the welfare state go together.Opinion ColumnistThe first cracks were over the issue of global warming. Libertarianism is a philosophy that emphasizes limited government, free markets and individual rights. There is nothing in that creed that should bias a person one way or another over whether global warming is a serious problem or not. That\u2019s a scientific question, not a philosophical one.Yet Taylor found that many libertarians, fired by ideological zeal, had slid into the position of minimizing climate change because they didn\u2019t like some of the big government remedies that were being proposed to address it. Once he saw this tendency on climate change, he saw it everywhere and on all sides: People with single all-explaining ideologies have a tendency to let their philosophic blinders distort how they view empirical reality.Taylor didn\u2019t abandon his faith in markets and individual rights, but he decided to abandon the belief that a single ideology can be applied to all problems. There are a lot of different goods in society: liberty, social justice, equity, community, virtue, prosperity. It\u2019s crazy, Taylor argued, to prioritize one of those goods in nearly every single policy context. And yet that\u2019s what ideologues do.Since at least 1964, American politics has pitted conservatives who believe in a small government and a free market against liberals who believe in a bigger government.But Niskanen thinkers like Ed Dolan, Samuel Hammond and Will Wilkinson made a simple and empirically verifiable observation. The nations that have the freest markets also generally have the most generous welfare states. The two are not in opposition. In the real world they go together.The key distinction you have to make, Will Wilkinson writes, is between the redistributive state and the regulatory state. Nations like Denmark, Sweden and Canada built elaborate redistributive states to give their citizens a foundation of economic security. Then they realized they were going to have to liberalize their economies if they were going to be able to afford their welfare states.Today, those nations have many fewer regulations governing zoning and economic activity. They score very high on the rankings of economic freedom that are put together by conservative outfits like the Heritage Foundation and the Fraser Institute.They want government to protect citizens against the disruptions of global capitalism: \u201cWithout strong income supports that put a floor beneath displaced workers and systems that smooth the transition to new employment, political actors and the public tend to turn against the process of creative destruction itself.\u201dAt the same time, they want an open, dynamic society. They want to reduce restrictive zoning and land use regulations that favor the rich and entrenched. They see immigration as crucial to America\u2019s long-term prosperity. They want charter schools and wider choice, but within strong government structures to ensure quality. (It turns out that bad charter schools continue to attract students; the education market doesn\u2019t work totally unregulated.)The Niskanen authors are making a compelling case for moderation; for understanding that politics is striking a rough but workable balance between competing goods; for understanding that the world is complex and our knowledge is limited, and so it\u2019s best to proceed constantly, but skeptically.As I was reading the Niskanen report I experienced two strange sensations: I felt liberated to see the world in fresh new ways, and not only in the ways I\u2019ve always seen them or the way people with my label are supposed to see them. I began to feel at home.Advertisement"}

But lenders are starting to push the loans on borrowers, who are using them to get into homes that may be bigger and more expensive than what they could otherwise afford.One popular loan is the interest-only adjustable rate mortgage, with which a borrower pays only the interest for a period before the rate resets and principal becomes part of the payment. Another is the income verification or \u201cability to repay\u201d loan, tailored to a borrower who does not have regular wages but is paid in large chunks of money \u2014 for example, from an investment partnership.These types of loans may be a good strategy for a wealthy home buyer, but some say they still carry the taint of overeager and unscrupulous brokers who pushed them on borrowers unable to repay them, creating a bubble in the housing market that burst in 2008.\u201cAll of these types of loans make anyone who is in this business cringe,\u201d said Tom Millon, chief executive of Capital Markets Cooperative, a network of 550 small mortgage lenders and servicers.Still, lending standards are higher, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the no-asset, no-income, no-verification loans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about someone with a nontraditional income source that\u2019s verified six ways to Sunday.\u201dYet the slowdown in mortgage underwriting has pushed lenders to look at alternative loans, Mr. Millon said. \u201cWe all have time on our hands because business is so slow,\u201d he said.Banks and mortgage providers are careful to say they are marketing these products only to qualified borrowers. But the offerings can be hard to understand.Tonaus John, chief operating officer of DBC Real Estate Management, recently moved to Pittsburgh for work. He and his wife bought a 4,000-square-foot home in Franklin Park, a suburb where they felt they could put down roots for their twin first-grade daughters.\u201cI fell in love with the house,\u201d Mr. John said. \u201cWe saw it, put in an offer and closed in less than 30 days.\u201dHe used an interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage to buy the house, which cost about $1 million. He looked at traditional fixed-rate loans as well, but the interest-only loan was half a percentage point lower, with the rate locked in for 10 years.\u201cI calculated that I was going to save $25,000 on the adjustable-rate mortgage,\u201d he said. The possible increase in interest at the end of 10 years was capped at 5.25 percentage points. \u201cThe worst it could be was 8.75 percent, and saving $25,000, I could put that money somewhere else.\u201dThe family\u2019s plan, Mr. John said, is to make principal payments in addition to the interest, with the goal of reducing his mortgage faster than he would with a 30-year fixed-rate loan.\u201cWe don\u2019t like paying interest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur aim is to pay it off in 15 to 20 years.\u201dIn many ways, this is the ideal strategy for someone taking out an interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage. But even a conscientious borrower faces risks with these types of loans, said Susan M. Wachter, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.One is an unexpected downturn in pockets of the housing market. She said this was happening at the high end of the condominium market in New York, where demand for luxury residences is not keeping up with the supply.\u201cThe supply-demand imbalance leads not to small price changes but to large price changes, even if a market as a whole isn\u2019t showing stress,\u201d Dr. Wachter said. \u201cIf you do need to sell to move or get a better job, or your own financial circumstances change, having a mortgage that exceeds the value of the home will put you in a spot.\u201dOf course, this could happen with a traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but the monthly payments help pay down the principal, which increases the homeowner\u2019s equity.Another concern, Dr. Wachter said, is in hot markets like San Francisco, where home values are growing so quickly that an interest-only loan may be the only feasible way to buy a house. If, for example, a big chunk of the borrower\u2019s income comes from company stock or annual bonuses, then keeping the monthly payment low for the time being seems logical.But when the local economy slows or the housing market stalls, interest-only buyers could be hit harder if they weren\u2019t diligent in paying down the principal.\u201cIn markets like San Francisco, the correction is going to be more severe,\u201d Dr. Wachter said. \u201cThese are the properties that are going to be the most volatile and have the most price risk. The price falls will be higher because of the expectation that prices always go up.\u201dAnd not paying principal during the initial interest-only period just makes the amortization period of the loan shorter, said Richard K. Green, a professor of real estate at the University of Southern California.In other words, instead of paying off a mortgage over 30 years, the borrower is paying it down over 20 or 25 years, increasing the amount of the payments after the interest-only period ends.Both professors noted that interest-only loans could be smart choices depending on how the buyer thought about the house.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about independently wealthy households and they\u2019re thinking about cash management and they really do want more debt, this is a way to manage it with a view toward the entire portfolio,\u201d Dr. Wachter said.Peter Boomer, a mortgage executive at PNC Bank, which underwrote Mr. John\u2019s loan, said the interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage made sense for the right client and had benefits over a traditional mortgage.He offered three categories of borrowers for whom these loans work well: those who do not plan to stay in their homes for the full 30 years, those whose compensation includes a bonus that makes up the bulk of their earnings and those who look at the mortgage as another form of debt in their portfolio.Borrowers are evaluated to see if they can repay a 30-year fixed-rate loan for the same home, he said, and they are often asked to put down 25 percent or 30 percent of the purchase price if they chose one of the non-qualified mortgages.He added that PNC did a personal assessment of each borrower. \u201cIt\u2019s not to just get someone into a house,\u201d he said.The risk of a change in a person\u2019s financial circumstances could affect the ability to repay interest-only loans. But Dr. Green said a bigger problem was subprime borrowers, like the middle-class buyers who used them in the lead-up to the housing crash.\u201cIn the past, the one most likely to blow up was the loan to the couple making $40,000 a year who bought a house in Bakersfield for $500,000,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the payment shock that blew them up. These people were on the edge and couldn\u2019t buy a house with a standard loan. They were the first to lose their jobs.\u201dToday, though, even qualified borrowers need to be aware of the loans\u2019 risks. After the initial interest-only period resets, the payment can go up as high as 50 percent, and some people cannot afford that, Dr. Green said.Borrowers can refinance at a lower rate, but with interest rates rising, they need to be aware that may not be a possibility.\u201cI feel that you should have to be a qualified investor to get into the product, like you have to be for private equity,\u201d Dr. Green said. \u201cFor the first-time home buyer, I say stay away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The chief justice, who considers the president a populist demagogue, fears further attacks on judicial independence. The president accuses his former vice president of treason, and the chief justice presides over the trial himself, upholding a subpoena that requires the president to turn over relevant evidence. And after the vice president is acquitted, the chief justice leads a court that represents the last bastion of resistance to mob rule, defending the sanctity of contracts against attacks from populist presidents and the states, upholding the power of Congress to regulate the national economy and forcing the president and state courts to acknowledge the supremacy of the Constitution.Could the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts, who has embraced Marshall as his model, play a similar unifying role in defending the Constitution against populist threats to judicial independence today? That depends on his fellow justices. And although Brookhiser\u2019s biography reminds us that American politics has always been polarized, today the polarization threatens to transform the deliberations of the court. The life of Marshall reminds us of the urgent importance of Roberts\u2019s efforts to persuade his colleagues to unite around a shared commitment to defending the legitimacy of the court by rising above partisan politics.Jeffrey Rosen is the president and C.E.O. of the National Constitution Center and a law professor at George Washington University.

Washington Responded.", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYe Jianming courted the Biden family and networked with former United States security officials. Today, his empire is crashing down in court.He struck billions of dollars\u2019 worth of deals in Russia, Eastern Europe and Africa. He sought business with war-torn places like Chad and with international pariahs like North Korea.Ye Jianming, a fast-rising Chinese oil tycoon, ventured to places only the most politically connected Chinese companies dared to go. But what he wanted was access to the corridors of power in Washington \u2014 and he set out to get it.China\u2019s rise in political power and wealth has created a new generation of business tycoons whose clout and cash can open doors. Former Washington officials, many with access to the White House and to American military and intelligence institutions, have proven to be eager to help.But the fall of Ye Jianming shows that China\u2019s lack of openness can make it difficult to know who, exactly, is sitting on the Chinese side of the table. On the American side, some don\u2019t ask enough questions \u2014 or never asked any at all. It\u2019s a relationship that is all the more fraught given the trade tensions between the two countries, which were recently heightened by the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive on the request of American prosecutors.Many who met Mr. Ye believed he was the grandson of a famous Chinese military leader; people in his hometown say he comes from a family of boatmen. Many believed he had access to untold wealth; now, it appears his empire was built on a mountain of debt. Many believed his company must have deep connections and business savvy to be so successful; the Chinese state news media have accused him of bribery.\u201cIn China, if you can provide proof of association with a high-level official, you are assumed to be powerful,\u201d said Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China.Mr. Ye grew up in a city called Jian\u2019ou, a poor but lush region of bamboo groves and rice plantations in the southern province of Fujian. A three-tiered, newly refurbished shrine to the Ye family stands among plain concrete buildings and more dilapidated wooden houses. His father and grandfather ferried people and goods along the region\u2019s inland waterways, locals said. Mr. Ye worked a series of odd jobs before buying a small piston factory that supplied the military, his introduction to the People\u2019s Liberation Army.As the company prospered, Mr. Ye moved its headquarters to Shanghai, where he built a corporate campus modeled on Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party\u2019s leadership compound in Beijing. Adorned with Chinese art, calligraphy and stately furniture, the company\u2019s campus was dotted with villas for executives and a building to host officials and foreign dignitaries.\u201cHe had this aura of being a rich investor, and he built up his social network,\u201d said Martin Hala, an academic based in Prague who tracked the company\u2019s networking efforts in the Czech Republic. \u201cIt\u2019s been clear for some time that this is not just a Chinese commercial company, that they had some intelligence ties,\u201d Mr. Hala added. \u201cPeople from the U.S. intelligence agencies should have known something was going on.\u201dYe Jianming\u2019s early efforts to break into the Washington power broker scene didn\u2019t always pan out.Later, Mr. Inman said, CEFC officials called him and said they were considering acquiring oil fields in Syria. Could he help them persuade the American military not to bomb them? Again, he said no.\u201cThey were looking to do business deals in the energy space and they were looking for connections to help them do that,\u201d said Mr. Inman, who said he kept American officials apprised of his communications with CEFC. To build influence, Mr. Ye turned to Vuk Jeremic, a Serbian diplomat and former president of the United Nations General Assembly whom CEFC hired as a consultant, and Mr. Ho, a former Hong Kong official. CEFC also donated at least $350,000 to the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, a politically connected think tank, according to court testimony. The think tank counts Robert C. McFarlane, the Reagan-era national security adviser, as its president and Mr. Woolsey, a Clinton-era C.I.A. director, as its co-chairman. In an emailed statement, Mr. McFarlane said his encounters with CEFC were related to research on American dependence on foreign oil. \u201cI have never had any organic or contractual relationship with CEFC,\u201d he said. Mr. Woolsey didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs said in a statement that it \u201chas had no contact with CEFC or any of its officials for more than a year, nor have we accepted further contributions.\u201dCEFC also organized forums in Hong Kong and Washington that brought together retired American and Chinese military officers, among other events. All the while it continued to network.\u201cThey kept coming back and saying, \u2018Can we organize contacts?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pyntikov said.It is unclear whether Hunter Biden struck any business deals with CEFC or Mr. Ye. Through his attorney, Hunter Biden declined to comment.CEFC also tried to bring prominent Republicans into its orbit in anticipation that they might take control of the White House after the 2016 election. In a 2014 memo after the November midterm elections that year, CEFC outlined a plan for reaching out to top Republicans and politically connected people. The company should begin making that outreach \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d it said, in order to form a \u201crelationship and friend base.\u201dJames Biden, a financier and brother of the former vice president, was in a hotel lobby in November 2017 when he got a surprise call on his cellphone. The call was from Patrick Ho, Mr. Ye\u2019s lieutenant. Mr. Ho, 69, was in trouble.Mr. Ye has not been charged with wrongdoing in the United States, but the legal actions there began a series of events that led to his downfall. They have also changed the narrative of Mr. Ye and CEFC, as court documents and other new information portray a bumbling company with much less political heft than it appeared.During Mr. Ho\u2019s trial, federal prosecutors said that he bribed officials in Chad and Uganda and tried to make CEFC a middleman with Iran to avoid oil sanctions. They also said CEFC was involved in the unseemly business of attempting to deal arms in conflict zones. Prosecutors said some of the meetings to further the bribery schemes took place in a $5 million apartment CEFC had bought on the 78th floor of the Trump World Tower at United Nations Plaza.David Zornow, one of CEFC\u2019s lawyers at Skadden Arps in New York, declined to comment. Edward Kim, a lawyer for Mr. Ho, declined to comment.Mr. Ye\u2019s problems could get still worse. In October, China Central Television, the official government broadcaster, accused Mr. Ye of bribing a provincial party boss to help CEFC secure the money to make bigger and more high-profile deals.In Washington, many of Mr. Ye\u2019s new acquaintances ultimately came to naught.In a brief interview, James Biden said he had been surprised by Mr. Ho\u2019s call. He said he believed it had been meant for Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son. James Biden said he had passed on his nephew\u2019s contact information. \u201cThere is nothing else I have to say,\u201d James Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be dragged into this anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Rise as Wall St.\u2019s Roller Coaster Stages Late-Day Rally", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street\u2019s roller-coaster ride extended into Thursday with stocks staging a late-day recovery as investors turned their attention to fresh data about the United States economy.Investors have struggled to find their bearings this month as the S&P 500 hurtled toward bear-market territory, defined as a 20 percent drop from a recent high point. They are trying to assess the prospects for economic growth and corporate profits as interest rates rise and a trade war with China persists, while \u2014 most recently \u2014 also factoring in internal White House turmoil and President Trump\u2019s antipathy toward Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman. A government shutdown that could deprive investors of economic data from the Commerce Department is only adding to the uncertainty.It\u2019s all coming together in a volatile mix, with financial markets lurching this way and that. After a drop of as much as 2.8 percent, the S&P 500 rallied in the final minutes of trading to end up 0.9 percent. The gains added to a surge Wednesday that was the benchmark\u2019s best day since 2009.The swings are an indication that the recent declines have gone too far, even if there are reasons to be concerned, said David Donabedian, the chief investment officer for CIBC Private Wealth Management in Atlanta.\u201cIn the absence of more bad news, a snapback was necessary,\u201d he said.The exuberance was not shared in Asia, where monthly production data from Japan offered investors a reminder that the region\u2019s growth is slowing. Stocks in Japan opened 0.8 percent lower, while shares in China and Hong Kong opened only modestly higher.In the United States, investors had only a few new clues about the economy\u2019s health to consider on Thursday, and the signals were mixed. Weekly jobless claims were lower, a positive sign. Expectations for job growth, as measured by the monthly consumer confidence index, hit a five-month low, however. In China, officials said industrial profits had declined in November for the first time in three years, a reminder that the growth of the world\u2019s second-largest economy continues to slow.Because of the partial shutdown of the federal government, a report on new home sales in the United States was delayed.Trading volume during holiday weeks is usually lower than the rest of the year, and that means each trade can have an outsize effect on stock prices. But huge swings were taking place well before the holiday slowdown.Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices who tracks and catalogs market performance, said stocks\u2019 swings had been larger and more frequent this year than at any other time since 2011. On 15 days in 2018, the value of the S&P 500 changed more than 3 percent. Such a large change did not occur on a single day in 2017, and happened on only five days in 2016. In 2011, when ratings agencies downgraded United States government debt, roiling the stock market, the days on which the S&P lost or gained 3 percent numbered 24.\u201cIt\u2019s higher today than it has been for the last several years, and you can feel it,\u201d Mr. Silverblatt said of the market\u2019s volatility.Adding to the recent jitters are concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s response to the drop in stock prices. Last week, Mr. Trump used Twitter to vent his frustration over the Fed\u2019s decision to keep raising interest rates and sought guidance from aides about whether he could fire Mr. Powell. Despite the president\u2019s frustrations, a number of White House officials have tried to reassure investors that Mr. Powell\u2019s job is safe.This suggested to investors that the Fed might not be willing to change its plans to further raise rates and drain money from the financial system, even if market turmoil persisted. Other Fed officials quickly moved to assuage those worries after the Dec. 19 announcement, but Mr. Donabedian said he expected anxiety about the Fed\u2019s flexibility to persist until at least the end of the next meeting of the Fed board on Jan. 30.Ultimately, he said, deep worries about the future, rather than more superficial factors like low trading volume, were behind the market tumult lately.\u201cThere are a lot of people searching for something else, some technical factor,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think this is driven by rising uncertainty about the fundamentals: earnings, the economy and interest rates.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson and Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

His Debut, \u2018X 100PRE,\u2019 Demolishes More.", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s Pick\u201cLa Romana,\u201d one of the standout songs from Bad Bunny\u2019s invigorating debut album, \u201cX 100PRE,\u201d begins with bachata guitar \u2014 nimble, quick, leaning toward the traditional. Before long, it\u2019s bolstered by a booming, viscous Latin trap beat, and the 24-year-old Puerto Rican rapper begins his trademark exultations.For a couple of minutes, he continues this way, a blend of excitable and boastful. Then comes the switch: a quick sigh, followed by a dembow beat almost twice as fast. El Alfa, the Dominican star of dembow \u2014 the close cousin to reggaeton \u2014 arrives for some tongue-twisting rapping, and Bad Bunny returns with palpable urgency and attitude.This union of two of Latin music\u2019s best-known stars is a wild romp. And it underscores what has made Bad Bunny so valuable over the last couple of years. He is a chameleonic figure, adaptable to almost any style, with a broad, blurry-edged voice that melts at the margins.It\u2019s almost surprising that after that year, Bad Bunny would release something as mundane as an album. He has demonstrated how in the modern pop economy, depositing a little of yourself on other people\u2019s songs can be just as effective a takeover strategy as asserting your place at the center \u2014 maybe even more so. (\u201cX 100PRE\u201d arrived as a surprise release at the top of Christmas Eve on streaming services.)But Bad Bunny, album artist, stakes out even more territory on \u201cX 100PRE\u201d; despite his seeming ubiquity, there remain areas that he\u2019s yet to explore. If this diverse album is any indication, he\u2019s eager to get to them.His experiments start with pop-punk, on \u201cTenemos Que Hablar,\u201d with its sneering guitar, which parallels the flirtations with the genre from SoundCloud rap stars like Juice WRLD. And they continue on \u201cOtra Noche en Miami,\u201d which combines 1980s synth-pop melancholy with Drake-style melancholy for an utterly modern downer about how a glamorous life is no replacement for love.And then there are the sounds Bad Bunny has made his name with: the sad reggaeton of \u201cSolo de M\u00ed,\u201d or the ominous hip-hop on \u201cCaro,\u201d or \u201cSi Estuvi\u00e9semos Juntos,\u201d which begins as an ambient mood piece and ends up a tragic reggaeton ballad.Better than any album in recent memory, \u201cX 100PRE\u201d speaks to the fluidity of contemporary Latin music: how several genres are in regular, high-level dialogue, and how the optimal performers for this moment \u2014 think Ozuna, or J Balvin \u2014 find common threads, vocal approaches that span rhythms.\u201cX 100PRE\u201d is produced largely by Tainy, a versatile veteran of the 2000s reggaeton explosion, and La Paciencia (Roberto Rosado). (One of the few exceptions is \u201c200 MPH,\u201d a buoyant club number produced by Diplo.) The music is rich with low end, serving as ballast for ethereal, sometimes claustrophobic synths. There\u2019s little breathing room on these songs \u2014 both Bad Bunny and his music seep into all the available space.Often, the mood is cloudy. But Bad Bunny withholds the biggest of the previously released songs here for the end of the album, when the euphoric \u201cEstamos Bien\u201d arrives like a healing sunrise after an agonizing night. And \u201cMia,\u201d his sweet-voiced Drake collaboration, is tacked on at the end, almost an afterthought. Those songs demonstrate how Bad Bunny is capable of reaching for the universal, a deployment of firm pop star instincts. But on this album, he has many moods, portending many more still to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Trade Tensions Boil Over at Staid W.T.O. Forum", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The Americans accused the Chinese of being modern-day mercantilists who steal intellectual property. The Europeans accused the Americans of provoking a crisis in the world trading system, threatening the global economy.And the Chinese invoked Spider-Man. Unlike Spidey, the Chinese emissary said, America is not using its superpowers with great responsibility.The reviews, held every two years, usually attract only lower-ranking diplomats. They are intended to allow W.T.O. members to explain their trade policies and for other members to comment and ask questions. But in an age of severe trade tensions, countries sent full-fledged ambassadors and the sessions, which were held on Monday and Wednesday, became a venue for allies and adversaries alike to vent their anger at American policies they said were illegal and destructive.The debate provided another example of the way the Trump administration\u2019s confrontational approach to international diplomacy has altered the rules of engagement at international institutions like the W.T.O. The niceties of protocol are eroding and the language has become more blunt.The United States, by contrast, tried to turn the discussions into a platform to attack China and what the American emissary, Dennis Shea, said was exploitation of W.T.O. rules in a quest for economic hegemony.The European Union and other allies generally agree with the White House\u2019s criticisms of China. But they disagree with the President Trump\u2019s strong-arm tactics, such as tariffs to pressure China. They have expressed fear that the Trump administration is fomenting a new Cold War with China that will force them to take sides. Many countries in Europe, Asia and Africa depend on trade with both the United States and China.The tensions between the two countries show no signs of easing. Top advisers to Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, briefed Congress on Tuesday afternoon about the state of the trade talks with China and left staff with the sense that the negotiations were in disarray.Congressional aides said after the briefing that they were not optimistic about the prospects of reaching a significant deal by March 2, the new date for proposed increases in United States tariffs on China. One aide said that the trade officials, Stephen P. Vaughn, the general counsel of the trade representative\u2019s office, and Jeffrey D. Gerrish, Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s deputy, suggested that the tariffs that the United States had imposed on China would not be rolled back even if an agreement was struck by the deadline. The officials were also unsure about how they would even enforce the concessions that they were pressing China to make.\u201cThe Trump-induced whiplash on China has left more questions than answers,\u201d said Rep.

The talks were closed to the public, but the United States and other countries made texts of their speeches available.Under Mr. Shea, who also serves as the American permanent representative to the W.T.O., the United States has expressed its views in unvarnished language that has shocked other diplomats at times but is very much in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s view that America is getting a raw deal on global markets.Critics accuse the United States of trying to undermine rules of trade it largely wrote, creating a free-for-all that would undercut global growth.American leadership in matters of trade \u201chas driven much of the phenomenal growth of prosperity across the world over the last decades,\u201d said Mr. Vanheukelen, the European Union ambassador. \u201cIn deciding to use tariffs as a central plank of its new trade policy, and in suggesting that trade wars can have winners, the U.S. is putting these achievements at risk.\u201dThe United States view is that the W.T.O. has lost its way, though it is unclear what changes the administration wants. \u201cWe must recognize that the W.T.O. that we helped create, and the W.T.O. we seek, is in key respects not the W.T.O. we have today,\u201d Mr. Shea said.If nothing else, the Trump administration has focused media attention on an organization that has long been crucial to the functioning of world trade but rarely generated headlines.But numerous speakers in Geneva argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies threaten to undermine global trade and isolate the United States.The United States was once the leading advocate of a trading system that operates according to rules, Mr. Deepak said. Now, he said, its behavior \u201ccould sound the death knell of the W.T.O. as we know it today.\u201dChina is already trying to exploit the United States\u2019 isolation on trade issues, portraying itself as the voice of reason.Mr. Zhang then turned his homage to Mr. Lee into an attack on the United States.\u201cWhat impressed me most is not Spider-Man\u2019s superhuman abilities,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, \u201cbut rather this line from the movie: \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019\u201dIn the last year, Mr. Zhang said, the world is witnessing \u201ca different America with severe mismatched power and responsibility.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tense Victory for Theresa May, With a Humbling Concession", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 On Wednesday, finally, Theresa May raised her voice.The British prime minister\u2019s voice was hoarse and her face was pale, and who could blame her? Her two years of negotiations on exiting the European Union were a hair\u2019s breadth from ending in a meltdown. Rebel Tories had called a no-confidence vote, forcing her to plead with her own lawmakers to give her more time. The promise she made in order to win the vote Wednesday night was a humiliating one: that she would step down as prime minister before the next election.At the weekly Question Time in Parliament, she found someone she could take it out on. She leaned over the table toward the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and spat out her disdain for him. She was seething.\u201cAll he wants to do is create chaos in our economy, division in our society and damage to our economy,\u201d she said, raising her voice to be heard over the cheers from her backbenchers. And Mr. Corbyn raged back, accusing Mrs. May of leading her fractured country into a deepening, increasingly risky political crisis.\u201cMany people in this country find planning ahead impossible,\u201d he yelled, \u201cbecause all they see is chaos at the heart of this government!\u201dFor many months, Mrs. May had maintained a robotic calm about the unraveling of her Brexit negotiation, pretending not to see that it was speeding toward a brick wall.The pretense that all was well came to an end this week, when she abruptly canceled a parliamentary vote on her European Union withdrawal agreement rather than suffer a humiliating defeat. Now, not only was she facing a no-confidence vote, but enemies in her own party were so confident that they had set up a headquarters they called \u201cThe Kill Zone.\u201dTo save her job, Mrs. May had two arguments to put forward. First, she argued, changing leaders so close to the March 29 deadline for withdrawal from the European Union could open the door to something worse \u2014 a Labour government or a reversal of Brexit.\u201cThe British people want us to get on with it,\u201d she said, not for the first time. \u201cThe Conservatives must not be a single-issue party. We are a party of the whole nation. Moderate, pragmatic, mainstream.\u201dThe more important case was made at 5 p.m., behind the closed doors of a wood-paneled committee room, where Mrs. May promised Conservative lawmakers that she would step down before the next general election, currently scheduled for 2022.Lawmakers who were present said she had invoked her long history as a party worker, going back to her teenage years, and confessed that \u201cin my heart\u201d she had truly hoped to run again. Tim Shipman, political editor of The Sunday Times, described \u201cministers crying in the room,\u201d and George Freeman, a member of Parliament, described a \u201cpowerful and moving moment.\u201dMatt Hancock, cabinet secretary for health and social care, also described this promise as a turning point.\u201cThere was a real warmth in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were some questions, but a real warmth toward her.\u201dBut not everyone was moved. Lee Rowley, another lawmaker, told Mrs. May that \u201cstamina is not a strategy,\u201d according to journalists present.Then they voted. Mrs. May won, but not comfortably. Two hundred lawmakers backed her, and 117 voted against.At the announcement, the Tories jumped up and erupted into applause, but it was hardly a real success. Margaret Thatcher, who won 204 votes in a similar contest, was so weakened that she stepped down the following year.Anand Menon, a professor of foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London, said Mrs. May\u2019s poor showing will complicate her efforts to find backing for her withdrawal agreement, which early this week appeared likely to be defeated by a crushing margin.\u201cThe fact of the matter is that Theresa May is very unpopular,\u201d Mr. Menon said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt now of the strength of the feeling against her. That being said, she carries on. But she\u2019s back where she left off with the Brexit deal.\u201dThis was her approach on Wednesday, to plow on. Those looking for signs of fragility could spot only one, minor tell: Her husband, Philip, was in sitting in the gallery for Question Time, such an unusual occurrence that The Daily Mail covered it as a separate story, under the headline, \u201cHusband Goals.\u201dThe awkward timing of the leadership challenge, with a countdown ticking to the March 29 Brexit deadline, may have worked in her favor, some observers said. Its failure provides Mrs. May with a degree of protection, since according to Tory rules, rebel members can call a no-confidence vote only once a year.\u201cI think maybe there is a degree of emotional release that the moment has finally come,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cI think she was aware that this was a possibility for two or three weeks, and now that it\u2019s happened at least things are out in the open and the battle can be joined.\u201dBut upon taking power, she seemed perhaps a bit too old-fashioned for her country. The Conservative Party had barreled past her, embracing an anti-Europe agenda that had been dismissed for 20 years as too radical. Mrs. May was reflexively secretive about the progress of negotiations. She tried hard to win over Conservative hard-liners, but made little effort to win allies among Remainers and centrists. On Wednesday, facing her possible removal, Mrs. May did not even try to invoke loyalty, instead casting herself as the least-bad option.\u201cA change of leadership in the Conservative Party now will put our country\u2019s future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it,\u201d she said, warning that a new Conservative leader would not be in place in time to exit the European Union on March 29. \u201cAnd a leadership election,\u201d she added, \u201cwould not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the parliamentary arithmetic.\u201dDavid Shimer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Haiti Awakening to Change?", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, an anti-corruption movement has been growing, aided by social media and peaceful street protests. But tensions are rising as the government turns to repression. Mr. Johnston is writing a book about Haiti and international policy toward it since the 2010 earthquake.On Oct. 17, huge crowds of Haitians from all sectors of society peacefully demonstrated with banners and shirts demanding an answer to Mr. Mirambeau\u2019s tweeted question, which is still trending.The result has been a remarkable challenge to the legacy of corruption and misgovernment that Haitians share and have felt powerless to effectively counter for many decades. The big question for this tiny, impoverished country has become whether the current movement will push the political scene toward functional democracy or drive the government into a new cycle of repression.On Nov. 18, a day commemorating Haiti\u2019s victory over Napoleon\u2019s troops 215 years ago, citizens again hit the pavement, signaling that this movement will not go away.But ensuring that this momentum leads to significant change will require all interested parties \u2014 Haiti\u2019s government and business, its elite and the impoverished masses, along with the international community \u2014 to unite in the fight against corruption, the transactional status quo that extends beyond the nation\u2019s borders.After the 2010 earthquake here, foreign donors pledged more than $10 billion in aid. But less than 1 percent of the emergency aid spent in their names went directly to Haitians. The legitimate government, the private sector and civil society were cast aside in favor of for-profit aid companies in the United States and other foreign experts. It is a policy that evokes the dynastic Duvalier dictatorship in the mid-20th century, when \u201cPapa Doc\u201d and \u201cBaby Doc\u201d became international symbols of kleptocracy. Today it is a policy that has only served to weaken the state and perpetuate the corruption, this time on an international scale. And now, after the $2 billion scandal languished for a year in the hands of politicians, and with Haiti\u2019s judiciary too weak to act, Haitians on their island and living abroad took it into their own hands.Unfortunately, tensions are rising as change begins to appear possible. Last July, three days of riots followed a gasoline price hike, revealing how close the nation is to a social explosion. Then came Mr. Mirambeau\u2019s #PetroCaribeChallenge, shifting the paradigm to a nonviolent campaign. Still, armed gangs close to the ruling party, together with corrupt police officers, massacred at least 60 people just days before the Nov. 18 protest. In Haiti, stability has often been cited as a reason not to challenge misgovernment, but the events of last summer and fall revealed that continuing the status quo will only generate more instability. Nonviolent protest that puts pressure on officials to promote accountability would seem to be an obvious path out of that conundrum, but recent history does not point to much hope for significant change. For example, the government has urged patience and promised an investigation. But Haitians have heard empty promises before. After the Duvalier dictatorship fell, not one official was convicted of a financial crime. In February 2017, when Jovenel Mo\u00efse became president, he pledged a crackdown on corruption. But his political mentor and presidential predecessor, Michel Martelly, had presided over most of the Petrocaribe spending. Now Mr. Mo\u00efse too has been directly implicated, and his government\u2019s repression has picked up. With the repression only making the opposition more determined, prominent political and business figures clearly sense a moment of opportunity. Whether it is to pursue justice or to protect their own interests is an open question. Either way, an investigation will be hard put to avoid being sucked into the political swordplay in Haiti\u2019s capital.One problem is that the U.N.\u2019s recent history in Haiti includes years of refusal to accept responsibility for a peacekeeping mission\u2019s introduction of a deadly cholera epidemic. A new U.N. mission arrived in 2016, but it appears feckless in the fight against impunity. After it welcomed the assignment of an investigative judge to the Petrocaribe case this year, Haiti\u2019s government protested, and the U.N. quietly replaced the mission\u2019s director.Another barrier is that any deep international role in a reformation would be difficult to accept in a nation with a long history of foreign intervention. Still, the universal principles \u2014 investigative independence, expertise and legal empowerment \u2014 that have guided the Guatemala commission may provide a useful road map for Haiti\u2019s anticorruption movement. It would be hard to argue against the need for experienced forensic auditors, courageous prosecutors and legally empowered professionals with a mandate to follow money wherever it may lead.For the international community, whose interventions and misplaced priorities have long helped consolidate the unsustainable status quo, standing up for transparency this time could re-establish some trust with the Haitian people and keep open a path to systemic change.It is up to all of Haiti\u2019s interested parties to follow that path. \u201cI was not expecting all this,\u201d Mr. Mirambeau, whose tweet started it all, told me. Nobody was. But for now, it is this possibility of change that has brought a modicum of hope to Haitians across the world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Tech Expansion, Austin Is Still Weird. It\u2019s Just More Wired Now, Too.", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Walking distance from the pink dome of the Texas Capitol building, there were whiskey samples, tamales and Nerf guns.The Virtual Reality crowd talked Augmented Reality. The millennials in YETI shirts and the gray-haired post-hippies in psychedelic vests racked up points in a 3-D shootout on Space Pirate Trainer. And then there was Tim Porter, the guy with the hologram-creating Merge Cube. Using an app he developed, Mr. Porter pulled out his phone and put his 4-year-old daughter\u2019s stuffed penguin into the cube, virtually speaking.Austinites have a name for all this: a Tuesday night.It was just another event at the Capital Factory, Austin\u2019s techie community center and start-up hub \u2014 this time, a virtual reality holiday party. Located in an office and hotel complex downtown, the Capital Factory has helped a number of Austinites quit their day jobs to become tech entrepreneurs. The shared work space features a Star Wars-themed floor with Luke and Leia restrooms, local craft beer on tap and a conference room hidden, Hardy Boys-style, behind a bookcase that swings open when you press the right book (\u201cThe Plains of Passage\u201d).\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you want to do, there are five Meetups at night that will support it,\u201d said Mr. Porter, 34, the founder and chief technology officer at Underminer Studios. \u201cIt\u2019s a maker community.\u201dFor decades, Austin was defined by the bureaucracy of state government, the academia of the University of Texas and the funkiness of its hippie-cowboy, Willie Nelson-inspired music and arts scene. Today, the tech culture and economy have transformed Texas\u2019 capital city and surrounding suburbs, creating jobs, worsening traffic, raising prices and changing the region\u2019s politics, tempo and brand.None of this is entirely new \u2014 people have been calling the Austin area\u2019s tech scene \u201cSilicon Hills\u201d since the late 1980s and early 1990s. But the slogan and the hype have now dramatically caught up.Apple\u2019s planned expansion has raised a host of unanswered questions about traffic, gentrification, affordability and competition for jobs.Austin consistently ranks high on the lists of cities with the worst traffic in America. And a recent housing market analysis found a shortage of 48,000 rental units affordable to households earning less than $25,000 per year. Supplies for middle-income families are also increasingly strained.\u201dI think in the last 10 years, it\u2019s been a real struggle for Austin to keep its identity and keep its soul, as downtown is being razed and converted into condos and high-rises, and you have people like Google and Facebook and Apple taking over the town with these buildings,\u201d said Omar Gallaga, who covered the city\u2019s tech culture for The Austin American-Statesman for more than 20 years. \u201cIf you have all the artists and the creative people that make it interesting move away because they can\u2019t afford to live there, then it becomes a different place.\u201dFew dispute that tech has turned Austin into one of the most vibrant and distinctive capital cities in America. Its other varied cultures \u2014 music, military, higher-ed, food, politics, journalism, real estate \u2014 are inseparable from its tech culture.Joseph Kopser, an Austinite who founded and sold a start-up called RideScout, made an unsuccessful but attention-grabbing run this year for a seat in Congress. A longtime venture capitalist, John Thornton, was the founder of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, Austin-based digital news organization that has helped transform Texas journalism. The nonprofit Austin Tech Alliance has launched get-out-the-vote efforts and helped city government shift to paperless permitting. One of the city\u2019s biggest annual cultural attractions, the South By Southwest festival, is now as much a celebration of tech as it is music and film.On any given day, some of the state\u2019s far-right lawmakers may be rubbing elbows downtown with 20-something entrepreneurs headed to work on motorized scooters \u2014 or perhaps, not long ago, passing by Professor Dumpster, otherwise known as Jeff Wilson, the co-founder of the start-up Kasita, who lived in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year as part of an experiment in minimalist living.Austin is still weird. It\u2019s just more wired now, too.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to become Silicon Valley \u2014 we want to be Austin,\u201d said Joshua Baer, the founder and chief executive of the Capital Factory, launched in 2009 to mentor, finance and support start-ups and entrepreneurs. \u201cWhat makes Austin really different, to me, is the culture clash. But it\u2019s not a clash. It\u2019s the culture collaboration.\u201dThere are now more than 138,000 tech-related jobs in the Austin metropolitan region, about 14 percent of the total jobs in the area. Ray Perryman, an economist in Waco, estimated that the tech sector pumps about $31 billion into the area\u2019s overall economy, about 35 percent of the total. It is far from the biggest tech community in the country. In a ranking of the top tech-talent markets by CBRE, a commercial real estate company, Austin came up sixth, behind San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, Toronto and New York. But Austin\u2019s brand as a tech hub rivals that of some of its rivals, including other cities that have a larger tech presence.\u201cWe punch way above our weight class,\u201d said Barbary Brunner, the former chief executive of the Austin Technology Council, which was founded in the early 1990s and functions as the tech community\u2019s chamber of commerce. \u201cIf you\u2019re from outside Austin, you think the tech industry here is huge, super sophisticated, super mature. We don\u2019t have the innovation leaders here. We have executors here.\u201dThe buzz lately does not revolve solely around Apple. A different older global behemoth rarely embraced by hipster tech has become a major player \u2014 the United States Army. Months before Apple\u2019s announcement, the Army opened a new center in downtown Austin to help modernize its weapons and equipment and to identify, acquire and develop innovative technology.The Army Futures Command is the only so-called four-star command that is based not on a military installation but in a civilian building, in this case in the heart of the city in a satellite of the University of Texas. The soldiers mostly shun camouflage for button-down shirts and khakis. They have embedded in Austin\u2019s tech culture, military officials say, to help make the Army smarter and more cutting-edge. The leader of the Army Futures Command, Gen. John M. Murray, a four-star general who also wears casual business attire to work, has been meeting tech entrepreneurs, hanging out at the Capital Factory and recently attended his first Austin hackathon.\u201cOne of the things that we are working on \u2014 and we have not solidified yet, this is just still a concept \u2014 is can the Army work with venture capitalists?\u201d General Murray said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve probably had, in the last couple months, a dozen or a dozen and a half conversations with VCs. For me, it\u2019s more about understanding, because this is all new to me. So, understanding the world they live in, what their requirements are, how they can help us and how we can help them.\u201dOne of the first outcomes of the Army\u2019s new venture was a mixed success. General Murray wanted the Army to work with an Austin-based start-up, Senseye, to help reduce the amount of time a pilot spends in training. It did not work out as planned, but the Army found another application for the company\u2019s technology.The Futures Command will be fully operational in the summer of 2019, and a staff of about 500 will take over two floors of the UT System building. Until then, a subset of the Futures Command called the Army Applications Lab has a team that works out of the Capital Factory.The day after the VR holiday party, Mr. Baer and the rest of Capital Factory hosted a visit from one of the Army\u2019s top officials, Ryan D. McCarthy, the Army under secretary. Mr. McCarthy told reporters that he felt \u201cpretty good\u201d about Apple\u2019s planned expansion, and the Army\u2019s expanding role in Austin. \u201cI think it just shows the wealth of talent and opportunity that exists here in this city and this state.\u201dDavid Montgomery contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Oil Industry\u2019s Covert Campaign to Rewrite American Car Emissions Rules", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it turns out that there was a hidden beneficiary of the plan that was pushing for the changes all along: the nation\u2019s oil industry.The campaign\u2019s main argument for significantly easing fuel efficiency standards \u2014 that the United States is so awash in oil it no longer needs to worry about energy conservation \u2014 clashed with decades of federal energy and environmental policy.The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world\u2019s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales.Gary R. Heminger, Marathon\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the company supported \u201csound fuel economy standards\u201d and wanted to \u201chelp ensure they are achievable and based on existing technology.\u201d He added, \u201cWe appreciate the administration\u2019s willingness to conduct a thorough review in order to ensure future standards are achievable and will actually benefit American consumers.\u201dA spokesman for Koch Industries, the energy conglomerate led by Mr. Koch, said the company had \u201ca long, consistent track record of opposing all forms of corporate welfare, including all subsidies, mandates and other handouts that rig the system.\u201dThe standards that the Trump administration seeks to weaken required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of new cars, SUVs and pickup trucks by 2025. Instead, the Trump plan would freeze the standards at 2020 levels. Carmakers, for their part, had sought more flexibility in meeting the original 2025 standards, not a categorical rollback.The energy industry\u2019s efforts also help explain the Trump administration\u2019s confrontational stance toward California, which, under federal law, has a unique authority to write its own clean-air rules and to mandate more zero-emissions vehicles.California has pledged to stick to the stricter standards, together with 13 other states that follow its lead. But President Trump\u2019s plan challenges California\u2019s rule-writing power, setting up a legal battle that threatens to split the American auto market in two. \u201cHowever, you have another side who doesn\u2019t want to pivot away\u201d from the stricter rules, Mr. Heminger said. \u201cSo we have a lot of work to do to keep this momentum going.\u201d\u201cOur CEO, Gary Heminger, would be very glad for an opportunity to visit with the Administrator,\u201d a Marathon lobbyist wrote in an email to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team on May 8, 2017. \u201cI believe this would be a constructive dialogue.\u201d The E.P.A. helps oversee fuel economy rules along with the Transportation Department.A Marathon spokesman, Chuck Rice, said Mr. Heminger did not discuss auto-efficiency rollbacks with Mr. Pruitt. An E.P.A. official did not respond to a question about whether the auto rules were discussed.Mr. Rice of Marathon said the company did not write the letter, and the company declined to say who did. It did not offer an explanation for Mr. Birsic\u2019s digital fingerprint on the document file.Representatives from the three state delegations either declined to comment or did not respond to requests. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, criticized the industry\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt appears as though oil interests are cynically trying to gin up support in Congress for the weakest possible standards to ensure that cars and SUVs have to rely on even more oil,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this attempt is successful, the outcome will be a blow to the auto industry, consumers, and our environment.\u201dMore than 3,300 of the 12,000 public comments that D.O.T. has made public contain language identical to that petition, an analysis of the files showed.Derrick Morgan, a senior vice president at AFPM, said the group \u201cregularly works with policymakers, coalition groups and individuals to promote shared goals,\u201d and also will \u201clead and join groups like Energy4US.\u201dThe Department of Transportation said it was \u201cgenerally aware\u201d that there were groups urging the public to make comments through online campaigns, but said it does not regulate them.In Dearborn, Mich., at a September meeting on the Trump fuel-efficiency rollbacks, Annie Patnaude of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-funded group, spoke in favor. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction to protect consumers and workers against government mandates that would limit choice,\u201d she said. But Americans for Prosperity said fights like these get to the heart of its free-market philosophy. \u201cWe believe in a level playing field so all Americans have the equal opportunity to succeed,\u201d said Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the group, in a statement. The organization will keep fighting \u201cmandates that unfairly pick winners and losers in any industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a relic,\u201d the memo said, particularly at a time when the United States was \u201cpoised to become the largest oil producer in the world.\u201d Emails obtained by the Times show that Marathon has been working with members of the legislative exchange council to build support for the Trump fuel-efficiency rollback in state legislatures and to denounce California\u2019s power to write its own rules for cars. The emails were made public under Wisconsin\u2019s open records law to Documented, a watchdog group that tracks corporate influence in public policy. California\u2019s special authority could effectively split the American auto market in two, since 13 other states \u2014 representing roughly 35 percent of nationwide car sales \u2014 have agreed to follow California\u2019s stricter rules. That means automakers might find themselves making cars to two competing standards.\u201cWho should decide what cars and trucks consumers should buy, consumers themselves or unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento, California or Washington, D.C.?\u201d the memo sent by Marathon said.In a statement, Bill Meierling of the legislative exchange council said that mandating fuel economy was a rule that \u201cmany state legislators believe doesn\u2019t make sense for working Americans.\u201d Just days after the emails between Marathon and the Wisconsin lawmaker, some 1,500 state legislators and other officials from across the country gathered in New Orleans to cheer on Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation, at the legislative exchange council\u2019s annual convention. Marathon sponsored the event.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump\u2019s Retreat on the Environment Is Affecting Communities Across America", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "In California, where over a third of the nation\u2019s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown, farm workers are being sickened by a pesticide that the Obama administration tried to ban.In the heart of West Virginia\u2019s coal country, the state\u2019s largest inland waterway is still being contaminated with hundreds of pounds of selenium, a pollutant that can wipe out aquatic life, as well as smaller amounts of arsenic and mercury.A coal-burning power plant in the suburban sprawl of Houston, one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing metropolises, is getting a free pass to continue spewing harmful levels of sulfur dioxide into the air.Far to the north, on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, booming energy production has brought greater prosperity, but pollutants from the burning and venting of methane are threatening health problems.Beyond the glare of Washington, President Trump\u2019s retreat on the environment is unfolding in consequential ways for the health and safety of Americans.In just two years, Trump has unleashed a regulatory rollback with little parallel in the past half-century.In just two years, President Trump has unleashed a regulatory rollback, lobbied for and cheered on by industry, with little parallel in the past half-century. Mr. Trump enthusiastically promotes the changes as creating jobs, freeing business from the shackles of government and helping the economy grow.The trade-offs, while often out of public view, are real \u2014 frighteningly so, for some people \u2014 imperiling progress in cleaning up the air we breathe and the water we drink, and in some cases upending the very relationship with the environment around us.With this running start, Mr. Trump is already on track to leave an indelible mark on the American landscape, even with a decline in some major pollutants from the ever-shrinking coal industry. While Washington has been consumed by scandals surrounding the president\u2019s top officials on environmental policy \u2014 both the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior secretary have been driven from his cabinet \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s vision is taking root in places as diverse as rural California, urban Texas, West Virginian coal country and North Dakota\u2019s energy corridor.While the Obama administration sought to tackle pollution problems in all four states and nationally, Mr. Trump\u2019s regulatory ambitions extend beyond Republican distaste for what they considered unilateral overreach by his Democratic predecessor; pursuing them in full force, Mr. Trump would shift the debate about the environment sharply in the direction of industry interests, further unraveling what had been, before the Obama administration, a loose bipartisan consensus dating in part to the Nixon administration.In the words of Walter DeVille, who lives on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, \u201cThis is our reality now.\u201dGabriella Demczuk is a photographer and regular contributor to The Times, covering Washington politics and national policy.BAKERSFIELD, Calif. \u2014 The spring air was cool. There was the slightest breeze. The smell floated into the cabbage field about six weeks after the newly installed Trump administration brushed aside scientifically established health concerns and overturned a planned ban of one of the world\u2019s most potent pesticides.Some workers scurried to nearby cars to avoid the toxic air. Others kept picking and packing, squinting and covering their faces and trying not to breathe. They were afraid of the repercussions of walking away. They needed the money. Women coughed. Some vomited.Bricmary Lopez fainted. A 37-year-old mother of three, she remembers the smell, the dizziness, the overwhelming feeling of nausea. Other workers thought she was faking it, trying to be funny, when she hit the ground and started convulsing.\u201cWe were teasing each other, saying, \u2018Ha, you don\u2019t want to work,\u2019\u201d said Lucia Martinez Polido, 57.Reality bit. Soon, nearly everyone felt the burning sensation and queasiness. Some fainted. Those not immediately incapacitated helped the others. They put a pillow under Ms. Lopez\u2019s head and stood over her, waving their arms over her face, trying to offer fresh air.Fire trucks and ambulances came. They stayed out on Copus Road, a couple of hundred yards beyond the cabbage field and adjacent almond groves, because the rescuers did not want to get exposed.Ms. Lopez remembers being ushered behind curtains, a makeshift room assembled for roadside decontamination. She remembers being naked in a temporary shower, and the ambulance ride to a Bakersfield hospital, about 20 miles away.She said she was given medicine and released. No longer working the fields and riddled with health problems, Ms. Lopez has been searching for answers.\u201cAll I want to know,\u201d she said at her home recently, \u201cis am I going to be O.K.?\u201dHad Donald J. Trump not won the presidency in 2016, millions of pounds of chlorpyrifos most likely would not have been applied to American crops over the past 21 months. It would not have sickened substantial numbers of farm workers, or risked what the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s own studies suggest could be continued long-term health problems for others exposed to the chemical at low levels.Chlorpyrifos use(pounds per county inthousands for 2016)11050150SacramentoSOLANOCOUNTYSanFranciscoCALIFORNIADelanoBakersfieldKERNCOUNTYLos AngelesBy The New York Times | Source: California Department of Pesticide RegulationSince taking office, Mr. Trump has consistently sided with powerful economic constituencies in setting policy toward the air we breathe, the water we drink and the presence of chemicals in our communities.The effects of such large-scale decision making are felt locally. And in the case of chlorpyrifos, there may be no place where the tension between science and the administration\u2019s policy inclinations plays out more than in California\u2019s Kern County, the vast crosshatched expanse roughly the size of New Jersey that surrounds Bakersfield.It also leads the state in the use of chlorpyrifos. And its toll may extend well beyond farm workers. Neighborhoods and schools are carved out of old orchards and groves. They may be separated from crops by mere feet, maybe a road. Even in the middle of the small towns, nobody is far from the fields or the nearly 29 million pounds of pesticides \u2014 including 200,000 pounds of chlorpyrifos \u2014 spread on them in 2016, just within Kern County.There is also broad concern over the impact of low-level exposure, including in drinking water and on the fruits and vegetables we eat. Chlorpyrifos is deemed particularly dangerous to young women in farming communities, as studies have found it in the blood of pregnant women and their babies. It has been linked to neurodevelopmental problems such as reduced birth sizes and weights, lower I.Q.s, attention deficit problems and disorders on the autism spectrum \u2014 symptoms found with higher frequency in farming communities, studies suggest.Those in the agriculture and chemical industries who say there is still doubt about the degree of the health risk often point, paradoxically, to the problem that the chemical is too toxic to be tested on humans, leaving scientists to rely on epidemiological studies of people who might have been exposed to it in their normal environment over long periods.An increasing number of the studies show correlations to neurological problems in children, among other issues. But are their problems the result of chlorpyrifos?Dow says no, and other people associated with the agriculture industry, in an echo of the argument against aggressive action to confront a warming planet, say not enough is known yet to come to a firm conclusion.\u201cOur attitude is not that chlorpyrifos is good or bad,\u201d said Gabriele Ludwig, the director for sustainability and environmental affairs for the California Almond Board. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We feel it hasn\u2019t gone through the proper process.\u201dHundreds in California have been acutely sickened by chlorpyrifos in the last 15 years, mostly farm workers and mostly by drift. The incidences have slowed since 2015, when state regulators added restrictions to chlorpyrifos use, requiring licensing and training.But as chlorpyrifos use has continued, so have the accidents \u2014 at least a half-dozen reported episodes of drift in California, including the one in May 2017 that sent Ms. Lopez to the hospital and sickened 36 other cabbage pickers.The vast majority of incidents, involving chlorpyrifos or any other pesticide, go unreported. Most farm workers in California are undocumented immigrants. They worry about everything from missing much-needed work to reprisal from bosses and deportation from the authorities.\u201cThere is no incentive to report these things,\u201d said Eriberto Fernandez, the research and policy coordinator for the United Farm Workers Foundation in Bakersfield, whose parents have worked the fields for decades.Most farm workers, like most other people in Kern County, do not distinguish chlorpyrifos among hundreds of pesticides used in agriculture. They may smell different, or cause different reactions, but few, if any, can name them. That was certainly true during the drift incident in May 2017. No one knew it was chlorpyrifos that was sickening the workers, because most had never heard of it until the Trump administration halted the proposed ban.\u201cA pesticide is a pesticide,\u201d said Lucia Martinez Polido, one of the women picking cabbage that day.If pesticides are not floating in the air, they are smeared on their fingers and skin from nearly everything they touch. Shiny citrus leaves are dulled by a white film. Pruning grape vines at the end of the season, for example, can free a chemical odor. Kicking up dust releases it from the soil.It is why many farm workers cover their skin from head to toe, wrapping bandannas around their noses and mouths, even in the teeth of triple-digit summer days. They bring snacks to the fields that they do not have to touch with their hands. They carry their own bottles of eye wash.But concern over chlorpyrifos extends well beyond farm workers and acute poisonings.Each spring, the dozens of schools and licensed child-care centers in Kern County within a quarter mile of an active crop receive a list of the restricted-use pesticides that the growers plan to use, sometime between July 1 and June 30. Some of the lists contain more than 50 different chemicals. Chlorpyrifos is often one of them.If the pesticides are known to drift, like those spread by crop dusters, they cannot be used within a quarter mile of schools, this year\u2019s notifications state. If they are less susceptible to drift, \u201csuch as most applications using a tractor,\u201d the buffers shrinks to 25 feet. Monday through Friday, they cannot be sprayed from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.Among those notified is Sunset Child Development Center, a day care south of Bakersfield. It is part of the Arvin Migrant Center, commonly called a \u201clabor camp,\u201d with rows of housing for itinerant farm workers.The day care is next to grape vineyards. The children there range from 6 months to 5 years old. Because most of the parents are farm workers themselves, they drop off their children as early as 4:30 a.m. \u2014 within the allowable time slot for spraying pesticides like chlorpyrifos.One parent of a 3-year-old girl is Byanka Santoyo, 28, a single mother from Arvin. She is a daughter of farm workers, and spent time in the fields herself.Ms. Santoyo works as a community organizer for the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. It was the area\u2019s notoriously polluted air, sometimes the worst in the nation, that led her to activism. It was the drift episodes experienced by her parents over the years, and now the concern over her daughter\u2019s health, that pulled her toward fighting unsafe use of pesticides.\u201cWe all live surrounded by ag,\u201d Ms. Santoyo said. \u201cWe just want it to be safe.\u201dThe day care center is required to allow the children outside for parts of the day. There are sun shades to protect from the heat, but nothing to protect from whatever pesticides might be drifting in the air. Playground equipment is scrubbed several times a week because it often becomes covered in a sticky film that sometimes works its way indoors. Ms. Santoyo says her daughter\u2019s clothes get tacky, and the residue is visible when she wears something like black leggings.Chlorpyrifos is not the most-used pesticide, but it is the most contentious. In California in 2016, according to the state\u2019s Department of Pesticide Regulation, 902,575 pounds of chlorpyrifos was used in more than 12,000 applications across 640,000 acres on more than 60 different crops.The fight to ban chlorpyrifos in California has several fronts, fought by organizations that include the United Farm Workers, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Californians for Pesticide Reform. They are ramping up pressure on state regulators and politicians as uncertainty over the federal ban persists.The ruling has been appealed, and in the meantime California is weighing tighter regulations of its own. While lawyers and lobbyists fight, the pesticide, sold under a variety of brand names like Lorsban and Vulcan and employed by farmers nationwide, remains in use.Dennis Johnston is a fourth-generation farmer in Exeter, east of Bakersfield. He remembers using chlorpyrifos on the citrus groves since he left college in 1980.\u201cWe use it for katydid, which takes a bite out of the fruit when it\u2019s in the flower form,\u201d Mr. Johnston said, referring to a pest that looks like a grasshopper. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bite when they do it, but it grows and becomes a big chunk when it\u2019s ripe and makes it unmarketable.\u201dChlorpyrifos, to Mr. Johnston and countless other farmers, is a go-to pesticide when others do not work. But Mr. Johnston, who said he has never had a drift incident, is using it less and less. He simply would like to have it available.The cloudy future of chlorpyrifos has left farmers like Mr. Johnston unsure how to proceed. Will the appeals court force the E.P.A. to ban it? Will California step in? And what if any of that happens while this season\u2019s crop is growing?\u201cWe\u2019re cautious about it, as most farmers are,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cWill it kill us if we can\u2019t use it? Probably not, not in my business. Can we make something else work? Yes, but it\u2019s what happens when you lose it. You have to use something in a different manner, or more of it. It\u2019s kind of a daisy chain sometimes.\u201dThat concern echoes across the agricultural landscape, in Kern County and beyond.\u201cThat is a real dance that goes on out in the grove,\u201d said Jim Cranney, the president of the California Citrus Quality Council. \u201cYou can have, at some point, the need to use a pesticide, but in other cases, you can allow the insects already in a grove to get rid of the harmful insects. When we use a pesticide that is harmful to the beneficial insects it can cause harmful insects to go haywire.\u201dThat was little relief to people like those in the Coalition Advocating for Pesticide Safety.In November, in Lindsay, 60 miles north of Bakersfield, the group opened a storefront office. Staffed by volunteers, it is seen as a safe place for farm workers and concerned residents \u2014 most of them Latino, many of them undocumented \u2014 to ask questions without worry over repercussions from labor contractors or government officials.On the night of its opening, about 50 people stood in the dark parking lot. There were balloons and a ribbon to be cut. Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate who entered politics partly because of concerns over pesticides, gave a short speech, pausing as each line was translated to Spanish.She spoke the language of organophosphates, with a deep knowledge of chlorpyrifos \u2014 its regulatory history and the risks increasingly attached to it. (She is an author of a 2000 report for Physicians for Social Responsibility called \u201cIn Harm\u2019s Way: Toxic Threats to Child Development.\u201d)\u201cIf it\u2019s too dangerous to be used in the home, why isn\u2019t it too dangerous for farm workers?\u201d Ms. Stein said later, as people mingled inside and ate bowls of pozole.Lucia Montero came to the United States from Mexico at age 15 and immediately began working the fields. Now 33, she was a foreman in that cabbage patch on May 5, 2017, overseeing one of the three crews, when the invisible but toxic cloud of chlorpyrifos arrived.At first, she thought she smelled grease or burned oil. Believing it was the tractor, she turned off the engine.Then came the burning, the itching, the nausea. Ms. Montero called the supervisor on her phone, who told her to get her crew out of the field. By then, several were vomiting. Two or three fainted, she said.An investigation by the Kern County agricultural commissioner\u2019s office was complicated by the fact that four separate pesticide applications took place that morning within 1.5 miles of the cabbage field.Another company nearby had sprayed grapes with a sulfur compound found to have drifted into the cabbage patch, too. That company was fined $20,000.The investigation said that 37 workers reported illness. Almost all declined medical treatment. In interviews, several said they were afraid of the repercussions, like missed paychecks or being blacklisted by contractors.Ms. Montero has not been back since that day. She said she cannot fully shake recurring headaches, dizziness and nausea. Still living in Bakersfield, she has taken courses to become a barber.This month, Ms. Montero learned she was pregnant. She no longer worries just for herself.\u201cI am scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope I have a healthy baby.\u201dBricmary Lopez, the only one of the workers in the field that day to be taken to a hospital, has not returned to the fields either.She fainted many times after she was sickened by the drift incident, three or four times a week at first, she said. Her asthma has spiked, her skin gets blotchy, and her red-blood cell count has dipped.She filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the packing company she was working for, but action has been slow. Most farm workers, advocates said, never take it this far.But Ms. Lopez, who arrived from Colombia in 2015 and has filed for asylum, does not fear the repercussions.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be worried about calling attention to this,\u201d Ms. Lopez said in her living room. Her daughters, ages 15, 18 and 21, stood at her shoulder, her fianc\u00e9 sat at her side. \u201cIt was not my fault it happened.\u201dDescribing the previous administration as hostile to coal-burning plants, the E.P.A. lifted a rule that would have improved the region\u2019s air quality.THOMPSONS, Tex. \u2014 It is a once-common sight that is now less frequent: A mile-long freight train rolls up to a power plant in Texas \u2014 in this case, the W. A. Parish complex near Houston \u2014 and then slows to a crawl as its cars, each carrying 100 tons of coal, are tipped one at a time like child\u2019s toys to deliver their load.Long reliant on coal as a major source of fuel for its electricity-generating plants, Texas is increasingly shifting to natural gas, wind and solar energy, prodded by the improving economics of these alternative sources and by tighter environmental regulation.The change has brought a degree of progress in cleaning up the air. Two Texas coal-burning plants, targets of an Obama administration policy intended to curb harmful sulfur dioxide emissions, have closed this year. A third, which has supplied power to San Antonio since the 1970s, will be mothballed at the end of this month.But now, after years of policies that President Trump and others have derisively described as a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d the Trump administration has called a timeout on a costly mandate that would have ensured continued improvement in the region\u2019s air quality.The administration\u2019s target has been an Obama-era rule that would have forced a group of coal-burning plants to install expensive scrubbers to cut sulfur dioxide discharges. For the owner of the W. A. Parish plant, NRG Energy, this would have meant either spending hundreds of millions of dollars to put in two of the huge devices, or shutting down the coal-burning operations there.Instead, the agency is working out an industry-backed alternative that will require no immediate reductions in air pollution by the Texas plants still in operation.The result, according to some of the United States\u2019 top air pollution experts, is measurable human and environmental costs.Even with the recent shutdowns of coal-burning plants, Texas remains one of the top sources of sulfur dioxide emissions.Average amount of particle pollution from nine power plants(PM2.5 for August 2018 in micrograms per cubic meter)0.10.40.71Caney CreekWilderness AreaOKLAHOMAARKANSASShermanTexarkanaJ.

A. Parish, the regulatory reversal is deeply personal. The plant pumped 37,649 tons of sulfur dioxide into the air last year, one of the highest levels among power plants in the United States.\u201cIt is the kind of thing you don\u2019t think about at all \u2014 until you notice that ugly smell every once in a while,\u201d Ms. Cantu said. \u201cAnd then you remember, \u2018There is that plant down there and I wonder: Should my daughters be playing outside?\u2019\u201dNo environmental issue has animated Mr. Trump more than coal. The president has often portrayed coal as the heart of a lost industrial glory he is determined to restore. And for political as well as economic reasons, he has sided regularly with the industry and users of coal, dismissing much existing environmental regulation as an unjustifiably expensive, job-killing intrusion on the American economy.The administration said emissions of many pollutants declined in Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office and that it expects the declines to continue. \u201cDespite a misleading narrative, our air is getting cleaner,\u201d said James Hewitt, a spokesman for the E.P.A.After decades of political, scientific and economic clashes over the issue, the trade-offs highlighted by Mr. Trump\u2019s policy shift in Texas raise a fundamental question: When it comes to the pace of environmental progress in the United States, when is enough enough?Supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory philosophy believe that much of his predecessor\u2019s approach placed unjustifiable costs on companies and the economy. In Texas, the Obama administration relied on a rule governing haze in national parks to push through what critics said was an excessively expensive and unnecessary set of requirements to limit emissions from burning coal.They dispute that the sulfur dioxide discharged from the W. A. Parish plant is a health threat, or a major cause of haze in national parks and wildlife areas, despite the conclusions of the Obama-era E.P.A. and certain environmentalists.And more important, they say, the fact that power plants across Texas are cutting the overall amount of sulfur dioxide in the air at an even faster rate than the Obama E.P.A. had mandated \u2014 without being forced to make expensive upgrades \u2014 is proof that market forces are a better mechanism than the government for balancing the costs and benefits.\u201cAll of this basically is a question of how quickly do you get the desired results,\u201c said David Knox, a spokesman at NRG, as he gave a walking tour of the sprawling plant.In this case, downwind included the Caney Creek Wilderness Area near Glenwood, Ark., 400 miles north of Houston.At the OK Cafe in Glenwood on a recent Sunday, the hot topics included the slow start of the deer hunting season and an upcoming runoff election for local sheriff.No one there had heard of the W. A. Parish plant. The Regional Haze rule was just as unfamiliar.John Sorrells, a disabled saw mill operator, has seen traces of the haze in question while hunting in the area near Caney Creek. The haze moves in from the south and takes over the hillsides, hitting up against the mountains, which run east to west here.\u201cIf the wind is blowing out of the south for five days or so, you will see it, especially in the summertime\u201d Mr. Sorrells said. \u201cIt just covers the hills. It has got to be coming from somewhere.\u201dCaney Creek, a pristine, 14,290-acre federally protected wilderness area on the southern edge of Arkansas\u2019 Ouachita National Forest, had its own visibility problems until that trend slowly started to turn around in the last decade. The improvement most likely accelerated this year, with the closing of several major coal-burning power plants in Texas. But the air clarity is still a long way from so-called natural conditions, when views can extend as far as 80 miles.NRG called the E.P.A. calculations \u201cfundamentally flawed,\u201d disputing that W. A. Parish affects visibility at Caney Creek. But the agency\u2019s findings gave the Obama administration legal justification to step in and propose mandating the installation of scrubbers on a power plant more than 400 miles away.Hundreds of buttons, dials and gauges blink, buzz and slide in one of the control rooms at the W. A. Parish plant, the central nervous system of a 4,900-acre site that allows the crews to watch as coal is ignited by an enormous fireball inside the boiler.The goal is to hit just the right temperature, about 3,000 degrees, as the steam generator turns turbines with so much power that the entire complex vibrates amid a deafening roar.One of Parish\u2019s four coal-burning boilers already has a scrubber, which douses the emerging exhaust with a mixture of water and limestone, extracting most of the sulfur dioxide. But the other three coal-burning units have no scrubber.Parish\u2019s control room monitors demonstrate in real time the difference a scrubber can make: The unit that has one was discharging 272 pounds of sulfur dioxide per hour from the 500-foot smokestacks. A separate unit with no scrubber was pumping out 3,250 pounds per hour.Stephen Hedge, the Parish plant\u2019s manager, said it had already invested a tremendous amount into cleaning up its air discharges.\u201cWe have got a lot of environmental controls on these plants,\u201d he said, detailing past efforts at Parish to significantly cut pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and mercury.In the debate over how much more money should be spent to protect the environment, Texas residents have much at stake, said Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston, and George D. Thurston, a professor of environmental medicine at New York University.Lowering emissions at nine Texas power plants targeted by the Obama-era E.P.A., including Parish, would mean 1,300 fewer cases a year of acute bronchitis, as well as about 100,000 fewer lost workdays from related illnesses and 125 fewer admissions a year to area hospitals for heart conditions, he concluded.Hoping to drive home the point to Mr. Pruitt, the former E.P.A. head, who is from Oklahoma, Dr. Thurston prepared a summary showing how the Obama policies would also benefit Oklahoma residents, given that air pollution from Texas often blows in that direction.The bottom line: Hundreds fewer Oklahomans would die prematurely each year, according to a chart that Dr. Thurston passed to Mr. Pruitt during a June 2017 meeting, where Dr. Thurston and other public health experts urged Mr. Pruitt not to reverse the Obama administration\u2019s proposed order demanding plant upgrades under the Regional Haze rule.\u201cPeople in your own state won\u2019t get these health benefits from cleaner air if you don\u2019t follow through on this,\u201d Dr. Thurston said he told Mr. Pruitt.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s response, Dr. Thurston said, was blunt.\u201cThis is a visibility rule,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said. \u201cTherefore the health impacts are irrelevant.\u201dEnvironmental groups sued late last year to try to block the rollback. But even while this lawsuit has been pending, coal-burning power plants in the state have been shutting down for reasons beyond the potential costs of complying with the Obama policy.\u201cThis is what our customers want,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a lot of this is taking place already.\u201dBut the progress that has been made, while considerable, is still far short of what the Obama-era E.P.A. sought.And even after subtracting the emissions from the Texas coal-burning plants that closed this year, the state remains the top source of sulfur dioxide releases in the country. The 26 states with the lowest sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants \u2014 a list that includes California and New York \u2014 collectively produced 157,000 tons in 2016. That is less than Texas is still generating on its own, E.P.A. data suggests.Installing the scrubbers on the six remaining Texas power plants targeted by the Obama administration, including Parish, would mean 11,400 fewer cases a year of asthma attacks spread across 14 states, according to Dr. Thurston\u2019s calculations. It would also mean 600 fewer cases of acute bronchitis, about 40 fewer nonfatal heart attacks and about 310 fewer premature deaths every year.What these numbers suggest, Mr. Cohan said, is that now is not the time to stop.\u201cJust because the water is getting cleaner does not mean we should not stop the industry from dumping huge amounts of hazardous waste in our rivers and lakes,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because cars are getting cleaner does not mean we should not regulate the dirtiest cars and trucks on the road. It is the same thing with coal-burning plants like Parish. Sure, they are cleaner than they used to be. But they are still not clean enough.\u201dThe Kanawha River has been an environmental wreck for decades. Now some industries are sidestepping bipartisan cleanup and protection efforts.CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 The Kanawha River has never been clean, at least not since Colleen Anderson moved here nearly 50 years ago.The river is lined with so many chemical facilities that the area where the Kanawha cuts through the Charleston region is known as Chemical Valley. One town, Nitro, even gets its name from a chemical \u2014 the nitrocellulose produced there for explosives.In the 1980s, Ms. Anderson recalls, swimmers competing during an annual waterfront festival would enter the river with bright white swim caps, only to see them stained a murky brown.\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful river,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to fall in.\u201dIn fits and starts, the Kanawha has gotten the attention of environmentalists and federal officials concerned about water quality. Beginning in the 1960s, both Republican and Democratic administrations in Washington made strides to restore polluted rivers across the country, including the Kanawha, the largest inland waterway in West Virginia.But the environmental crackdown hit the chemical and coal industries hard, and they resisted much of it. Since the election of President Trump, the most rigorous Obama-era restrictions have been blocked, delayed or killed, allowing many industries along the Kanawha and its tributaries to sidestep some cleanup and protection efforts.The operator of the state\u2019s largest power plant, which towers over the Kanawha about 20 miles downstream from here, has stopped design work on a water treatment system that would have removed most of the remaining pollutants \u2014 like arsenic, mercury and selenium \u2014 from discharges into coal ash ponds and the river.Rebecca McPhail, president of the West Virginia Manufacturers Association, said the rollbacks under the Trump administration had \u201cprovided a boost to confidence for manufacturing investment\u201d in the state. Even without the federal rules, she said, businesses were \u201cworking to improve our ability to make the water we are putting out cleaner than when we brought it in.\u201dMany here cheer the counterattack on the mounting demands from Washington, which had been seen as a direct threat to jobs. Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said the Obama administration proposed \u201cimpossible standards\u201d that were unfair to coal mining. \u201cThings are now getting back to balance, creating some certainty,\u201d he said.Registered industrial facilities that useextremely hazardous substancesOHIOKanawhaRiverWESTVIRGINIABancroftCoalRiverNitroSt. AlbansCharlestonElkRiverNBelle10 MILESBy The New York Times | Source: Environmental Protection Agency data as of April 30, 2018, via The Right-to-Know Network.But others saw the Obama-era offensive as long overdue and mourn the faltering of decades of bipartisan consensus around clean-water protections. The likely consequences for ordinary people of the Trump administration\u2019s interventions can be measured in many ways, including the hundreds of pounds of chemicals that continue to make their way into the river and the reduced protections for fish and sources of drinking water.\u201cI\u2019m angry, but not surprised,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, 68, a writer, graphic designer and singer who spoke up publicly about protecting the environment after a chemical spill in 2014 contaminated the city\u2019s water supply.Of the big polluters benefiting from the rollbacks, none looms as large as the John E. Amos Power Plant. The coal-powered utility sits downstream, just after the Kanawha begins a U-shape turn from Charleston.Giant plumes of steam and exhaust spew around the clock from its cooling towers, but its discharges into waterways pose one of the greatest harms.The discharges have been highlighted repeatedly over the past two decades in studies by the Environmental Protection Agency. The waste has included arsenic, mercury and other toxic heavy metals, as well as selenium and other substances that kill fish or damage their reproductive systems.The owner of the plant, the Ohio-based power company A.E.P., has taken steps to address some of the worst problems. Nonetheless, E.P.A. records show, the plant continued to release significant levels of contaminants last year, including more than 400 total pounds of arsenic, mercury and selenium in the Kanawha and an adjacent stream.A.E.P. prides itself on complying with environmental standards. But Melissa McHenry, an A.E.P. spokeswoman, said the company believed \u201cit is not economically practical\u201d to upgrade the wastewater treatment facility, given that its existing system can already remove about 90 percent of selenium, a major pollutant that kills aquatic life.Without a federal order to update the system, she said, the company might have a problem recovering the cost \u2014 estimated to total tens of millions of dollars \u2014 from ratepayers in West Virginia, as it needs permission from state regulators to make capital improvements.Much of the coal fueling the Amos plant comes from mines in West Virginia and elsewhere in Appalachia that have produced tens of billions of tons in coal and provided jobs for generations.At first glance, a stream near the mine appears picturesque, but aquatic life is missing and the water is tinged in white. The stream flows into the Leatherwood Creek, which eventually meets the Elk River and ultimately the Kanawha River.Representatives from Southeastern Land, which owns the mine, did not respond to requests for comment. In court papers, lawyers for the mine\u2019s previous owner acknowledged that there were discharges, but said steps were being taken to minimize the impact on nearby waters.Joe Lovette, a lawyer and the founder of Appalachian Mountain Advocates, a group that handles litigation for residents hurt by mining pollution, considered the move a setback. \u201cOld mines are the biggest concern,\u201d Mr. Lovette said, adding, \u201cThere is this pollution that will discharge into perpetuity.\u201dMany West Virginians have long accepted the environmental consequences of having polluting industries in the state, especially since they drive the local economy. Mr. Lovette would be the first to acknowledge that his objections do not reflect mainstream public opinion.But the chemical spill that contaminated Charleston\u2019s drinking water in 2014 served as a catalyst for change.By the next morning, 300,000 people across the Charleston region were told not to use their water for drinking, cooking or bathing. The crisis lasted for 10 days, bringing the region to a standstill and prompting people to seek medical care for nausea and vomiting. Restaurants closed, and bottled water was scarce. The chemicals in the air smelled of black licorice.\u201cI was afraid and shocked,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, who moved to the state in 1970 as a volunteer for the national VISTA service program and has lived for the past 37 years about a mile from the State Capitol and just a few blocks from the Kanawha.State lawmakers, usually reluctant to challenge industry, quickly passed a sweeping law that required, among other things, annual inspections of aboveground storage tanks. The law was subsequently weakened by exemptions \u2014 the number of tanks regulated was reduced to 5,300 from about 48,000 \u2014 but it remains one of the country\u2019s tougher regulations on industrial tanks.The spill also focused the attention of federal regulators. After the contamination, a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council and other environmental groups led to a consent decree requiring the E.P.A. to complete spill prevention rules by 2019. The E.P.A., under President Obama, considered a regulation that would have expanded its oversight of tanks, letting industry bear the compliance costs.\u201cE.P.A. believes that additional regulatory requirements for hazardous substances discharges would be duplicative and unnecessary,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said in a news release.The burning and leaking of natural gas is fouling Fort Berthold\u2019s air, demonstrating a trade-off between economic gains and risks to the environment and residents\u2019 health.FORT BERTHOLD, N.D. \u2014 In late June, a specially equipped truck from the Environmental Protection Agency drove through the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation to examine air hazards. What it found was sobering.One flare that was supposed to be burning gas was not lighted, allowing raw methane to spew into the air. In other spots, waves of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, were leaking at high levels from a storage tank.Those hazards and others were not shared with Fort Berthold\u2019s residents at a time when energy production in the region is booming. But the findings underscored the risks involved in the Trump administration\u2019s decision to reverse a rule curbing leaks and flaring, both of which pose dangers and are increasingly common on federal and Indian lands across the West.Like other communities around the country, Fort Berthold is confronting a tension at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s unrelenting push to roll back regulations governing a range of industries: Cutting the costs associated with environmental protection can generate substantial short-term economic gains while producing longer-term and potentially profound health and environmental effects.A 75 percent surge in oil production in the past two years has left Fort Berthold lighted by towering shafts of flame. Hundreds of controlled flares burn so bright in the cold night air that the sky turns a weird orange yellow, even as snow falls onto the frozen ground.An estimated three billion cubic feet of gas is burned or released each month here \u2014 a volume that could heat about 600,000 homes. Energy companies have figured out a way to capture the oil, but their pipelines are not big enough to handle all the less valuable gas that comes out of the ground. Much of the excess is torched.Less than 22 to 1010 to 3030 to 60More than 60October 201815 billion cubic feet totalOctober 20167 billion cubic feet totalMinotMinotWillistonWillistonFort BertholdIndian ReservationFort BertholdIndian ReservationLakeSakakaweaLakeSakakaweaNORTH DAKOTANORTH DAKOTADickinsonDickinsonBismarckBismarck25 MILESLess than 22 to 1010 to 3030 to 6060+October 20167 billion cubic feet totalOctober 201815 billion cubic feet totalMinotMinotWillistonWillistonFort BertholdIndianReservationFort BertholdIndianReservationNORTH DAKOTANORTH DAKOTADickinsonDickinsonBismarckBismarck25 MILESLess than 22 to 1010 to 3030 to 60More than 60October 20167 billion cubic feet totalOctober 201815 billion cubic feet totalMinotMinotWillistonWillistonFort BertholdIndianReservationFort BertholdIndianReservationNORTH DAKOTANORTH DAKOTADickinsonDickinsonBismarckBismarck50 MILESLess than 22 to 1010 to 3030 to 60More than 60October 20167 billion cubic feet totalOctober 201815 billion cubic feet totalWillistonWillistonFort BertholdIndian ReservationFort BertholdIndian ReservationDickinsonDickinsonNORTHDAKOTANORTHDAKOTA50 MILESLess than 22 to 1010 to 3030 to 6060+October 20167 billion cubic feet totalOctober 201815 billion cubic feet totalFort BertholdIndian ReservationFort BertholdIndian ReservationNORTHDAKOTANORTHDAKOTA50 MILESBy Sarah Almukhtar | Source: North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Note: Gas production, and therefore flaring, fluctuates with economic demand.\u201cMy children and grandchildren breathe in this air,\u201d said Lisa DeVille, whose family has lived on the reservation for generations. \u201cHow is this going to affect our health?\u201dThe move was in keeping with Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to cut regulatory costs for industry and promote domestic energy production. And it will help protect a remarkable economic boom on this once-impoverished reservation, where the tribal government\u2019s budget \u2014 90 percent of which comes from energy-related sources \u2014 has surged over the past 15 years to $330 million from $20 million.Tribal leaders and state officials here say they are committed to using their regulatory powers to try to confront the flaring and leaks. But in an interview last month, the top tribal oil and gas regulator, Carson Hood Jr., acknowledged that he had no plans to cut production until pipelines could be built to handle all the excess gas. That means the intense flaring will probably continue for at least several years, or until the boom in oil drilling subsides.And the state, which has its own flaring rules, recently moved to reconsider them, as it does not want to chase away any new investment by oil and gas companies, which fuel the state\u2019s economy.The leaks and flaring are an increasing source of tension at Fort Berthold. Many are focused on the cash from the energy industry that is pouring into community and tribal government coffers. The tribes and some families are paid royalties for each barrel of oil pulled from the ground, revenue that has changed many lives for the better.\u201cSovereignty by the barrel,\u201d is the slogan used by the M.H.A. Nation\u2019s Energy Division, which both regulates and promotes oil and gas drilling here.Yet others are backing a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s rollback of the federal rule, while also pressing tribal leaders to move aggressively on their own to confront the consequences of the burning and leaking of gas.\u201cThis is not just an empty worry \u2014 this is very real worry,\u201d said Joletta Bird Bear, whose family collects oil production royalties but is pushing for greater regulations on reservation. \u201cAll you have to do is look around and you can see for yourself, the flares burning. They are huge. This is going to impact human life.\u201dThe DeVilles set out for a drive through the Mandaree neighborhood of Fort Berthold to show off both the benefits and the costs that fracking has brought this tiny town.Even the car the DeVilles used to cruise through their hometown \u2014 a 2019 Toyota Sequoia S.U.V. \u2014 comes in part from industry money, as Lisa\u2019s mother receives large royalty payments from production on the land she owns, wealth she uses to help support her family.Besides royalties, residents also receive disbursement checks cut from the oil and gas money the tribal government collects. Some 16,500 members received $3,000 each last year.\u201cI am not against oil and gas \u2014 my family benefits too,\u201d Ms. DeVille said. \u201cI just want the industry to held accountable for impacts they are causing here. What are you going to tell your children\u2019s children: \u2018I am sorry I took the money, and so now you don\u2019t have clean air and clean land and clean water to live\u2019?\u201dThe intensity of the flaring \u2014 which has surged on Fort Berthold since 2016 \u2014 is on display across the reservation, where flares burn with so much power that they sound almost like jet engines. In warmer months, wheat fields need to be sprayed with water so the intense heat does not light them on fire.A larger share of gas is flared in Fort Berthold than almost anywhere else in the United States. There is a severe shortage of pipelines and processing plants in the area, driving the need to burn. But it is more than just a matter of flames licking the sky.As part of a broad strategy to slow climate change and also reduce wasteful burning of natural gas that if captured could be sold, the Obama administration adopted a rule in 2016 that put legal limits on the amount of flaring and leaking. The caps would have gotten tighter each year until 2026, when 98 percent of all gas produced on federal lands and Indian reservations was to be captured.The rule also required companies to perform semiannual inspections of their equipment on Indian reservations and federal lands to ensure there were no leaks, and to repair any within 30 days.Moreover, it forced companies to get ahead of the leaks by replacing so-called high-bleed pneumatic controllers, designed to release pressure by letting gas leak, with low-bleed devices.\u201cImproving the control of methane emissions is an important public health and air quality issue,\u201d Mr. McCain said, explaining his decision.The story of oil and gas at Fort Berthold, in a way, is the story of a long-delayed payback for injustices experienced by the three affiliated tribes that call Fort Berthold their home.The plight grew even more extreme by the 1950s when the United States government built a dam on the Missouri River, which splits Fort Berthold in two. The project flooded the center of the reservation and its most fertile lands, forcing most of the residents to relocate.But there was a secret lurking here deep underground \u2014 a formation of oil and gas called the Bakken. When new drilling technologies emerged about a decade ago, they transformed Fort Berthold into one of the hottest spots in the world for energy production.\u201cWithout choice, we were stuck here by the government,\u201d said Mr. Hood, the director of the M.H.A. Nation\u2019s Energy Division. \u201cLo and behold, we were put on top of one of the richest natural resources in North America. We end up being in a very lucrative position.\u201dThis explains, in part, why some tribal leaders are pleased that the Trump administration has repealed most of the Obama Administration\u2019s gas rule. The Interior Department is now telling the M.H.A. Nation that it will be allowed to decide on its own how it wants to regulate methane flaring and venting.But Mr. Hood said that some kind of action was needed.\u201cI got some flaring going on over here, and I got some flaring going on over there that you can\u2019t see at the moment,\u201d Mr. Carson said, pointing in just about every direction visible from his office window.\u201cIt is really a big concern for us as a nation,\u201d he said, \u201chaving to breath this methane, benzene, all those dangerous elements that are in the natural gas itself. I really want to do the best that I can to protect the air for our people.\u201dMr. Hood\u2019s solution, as well as that of the chairman of the tribe, Mark N. Fox, is to encourage the construction of pipelines and processing plants near or on the reservation to capture and ship out the gas \u2014 a process that could take years, and hit a wall if oil prices fall.The tribes, Mr. Hood said, have also focused on trying to curb venting, the most harmful way to dispose of the unwanted gas, by sending a compliance officer to oil and gas sites with an infrared camera that can detect the emissions. But when pressed to detail how that effort was proceeding \u2014 and how much in fines his office had imposed for the widespread violations \u2014 Mr. Hood said he would not discuss the matter.\u201cWe are sort of powerless \u2014 this is our reality,\u201d said Mr. DeVille as he and his wife completed their drive though the most intense Fort Berthold flaring zones. \u201cThis is our reality now.\u201dThe leaking of that gas is also harmful, and is a major contributor to climate change. The chemicals are in some cases carcinogens, while air pollution associated with the releases can lead to asthma and even heart attacks.Starting in 2018, producers were required under the rule to capture 85 percent of the gas, with that number jumping to 98 percent by 2026. The Interior Department estimated that this would save 41 billion cubic feet of gas a year \u2014 enough to supply about 740,000 households.An earlier version of this article misstated the location of the John E. Amos Power Plant. It is downstream from Charleston, not upstream.\u00a0Advertisement"}

Japan\u2019s closely watched Nikkei 225 stock index fell 5 percent on Tuesday and entered bear market territory, meaning it has fallen 20 percent from its high. Shares in China fell by a much smaller amount in thin trading around the region, thanks to holiday-related market closures around the world.\u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on with the administration and all those data points in conjunction with a market that\u2019s already so negative, it\u2019s just pushing everything down,\u201d said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis.The idea that the Treasury secretary was calling banks to ensure the financial system was functioning properly, Mr. Gibbs said, \u201cjust added to the negative feeling and gave investors another excuse to sell.Stock trading ended earlier than usual on Monday, at 1 p.m., and markets were set to be closed Tuesday for the Christmas holiday.On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq entered bear-market territory. It is now down almost 25 percent from its August high after falling 2.2 percent more on Monday.Energy stocks were among the day\u2019s worst performers, with crude oil futures in the United States falling below $45 a barrel.The meltdown in the markets could hurt the broader economy if it begins to limit spending by companies and consumers or lending by banks.Borrowing in the corporate bond markets has already slowed as nervous investors demand higher interest rates on risky debt. The plunge in stocks could discourage investments, acquisitions or other types of corporate spending by executives unwilling to gamble on uncertainty.But there has been no evidence so far that the financial system is not functioning properly, corporate profits continue to grow at a rapid clip and the economy has remained robust.\u201cWhile stocks, in my opinion, have gone in the past couple of months from very richly valued to merely the high end of fair value, they\u2019re not cheap by any measure \u2014 much less insanely cheap like they were a decade ago,\u201d Whitney Tilson, founder of the investment fund Kase Capital Management, said in a note to investors.Markets ended lower in Europe following a mixed day in Asia.Alexandra Stevenson and Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Self-Styled \u2018Tariff Man,\u2019 Issues China a Warning", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump warned China on Tuesday that if President Xi Jinping failed to make good on the trade promises reached during their weekend meeting, the United States would impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said during a WSJ CEO Council event on Tuesday that markets were in a \u201cwait and see\u201d period and trying to determine the chances that a deal will get done. He maintained that the two presidents made concrete agreements, though he did not detail what those entailed.The United States and China have announced only vague commitments and started a 90-day clock to try and reach a trade deal, but Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited specific agreements from China that Beijing has yet to confirm.That includes more purchases of American farm products, which Mr. Trump \u2014 seemingly trying to remind Mr. Xi \u2014 has said will begin \u201cimmediately.\u201d\u201cPresident Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a post on Twitter. \u201cBut if not remember, I am a Tariff Man.\u201dThe White House has already faced criticism this week for a lack of detail and mixed messages about what the leaders agreed to at their dinner. The Trump administration and Beijing have essentially reached an agreement to pause the trade war for 90 days while the two sides try and reach a formal trade deal. But any such pact is not a guarantee, given deep divisions that remain between the countries, including the administration\u2019s insistence that China end its practice of pressuring American companies to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets.On Monday, the White House said that Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative who is a longtime China skeptic, would lead the talks with Beijing. The choice of Mr. Lighthizer, who has a reputation as a tough negotiator, conveyed a tough road ahead.The days since the agreement have also been marked by confusion over the timetable to reach a deal. The White House said on Monday that the two sides had until March 1 to reach an agreement but Mr. Trump suggested in one of his tweets that the deadline could be extended.The lack of clarity has not pleased investors, who were briefly relieved after initial reports of a trade truce. Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, including those in the industrial sector, which is widely exposed to risks related to the trade fight between Washington and Beijing. Shares in Boeing and Caterpillar, companies with significant sales in China, tumbled.Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team continued to temper optimism about a deal on Tuesday.Mr. Mnuchin said that China had agreed to buy $1.2 trillion of American products, but he could not offer specifics on what would be bought and when.\u201cThey have said that these are targets and that that is their expectation,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told the Fox Business Network. \u201cAnd that in the short term there would be some very specific commitments.\u201dMr. Kudlow was careful to downplay suggestions that the Trump administration was really seeking a full overhaul of America\u2019s trade relationship with China through the talks.That includes China\u2019s requirement that American companies hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there.\u201cChina needs to change their joint venture system. That\u2019s nearly the root of all evil,\u201d he said.China has a reputation for making big promises on trade and not fulfilling them. Some trade experts have suggested that China could be using the new 90-day window to stall additional tariffs as officials work to stimulate their slowing economy.Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary, said on CNBC that it was too soon to say that a deal was done.\u201cWe shall see how serious the Chinese actually are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell how serious they are.\u201dChina has so far offered little about the meeting beyond its official statement outlining what would be discussed in the coming months. That list differed from the official statement released by the White House, with the Trump administration saying China had agreed to negotiate on issues like intellectual property and the Chinese statement mum on that topic.\u201cThey claim they\u2019ve never done any of these things,\u201d he said \u201cThey can hardly agree to negotiations about them.\u201dAt a press briefing on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, Geng Shuan, did not address questions about what American officials have said was agreed to by both sides.\u201cThe two sides reached consensus and agreed to stop levying additional tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe working teams from the two countries will follow the consensus reached by the two heads of state to step up consultations in the direction of lifting all additional tariffs, strive to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and endeavor to bring the China-U.S. economic and trade relations back to the normal track as soon as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Weakened China Tries a Different Approach With the U.S.: Treading Lightly", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The recent arrest of a top Chinese tech executive at the Trump administration\u2019s request seemed certain to provoke a geopolitical showdown pitting Beijing against Washington.China\u2019s tempered approach is born, in part, out of a position of weakness. The country\u2019s economy is in a sharp downturn, putting political pressure on President Xi Jinping to reach a deal with President Trump. American officials recognize the leverage they now have, wielding tariffs to extract concessions that Beijing has long delayed or rejected altogether.While the agreement was initially presented as a temporary truce in the trade war, both sides are pushing for a long-term deal that creates a framework for closer, more stable relations between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. Vice Premier Liu He on Tuesday called the United States Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to lay out an initial road map for negotiations, with the goal of face-to-face talks next month.\u201cThe Chinese government really wants to negotiate a deal with the United States to calm down the conflict, not only because of economic difficulties right now in China but also for the sake of long-term relations with the United States,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, the executive dean of the China Institute for World Trade Organization Studies in Beijing.The trade truce, though, remains tenuous, and the negotiations could easily be derailed. While Beijing has made some overtures, it has not gone far enough to address some of the biggest sticking points for the hawks in the Trump administration, like forced technology transfers and the trade deficit. And the Huawei situation could easily escalate, putting pressure at home on the Chinese president to act.If nationalistic tempers flare, the relationship could suffer. In previous tense moments, a thaw has taken time.When the United States accidentally bombed China\u2019s embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1999, the deaths of three Chinese citizens personalized the episode and triggered a wave of anger and indignation against the United States. The chill to Sino-American relations lasted for months, even though the Chinese leader at the time, President Jiang Zemin, had previously taken a friendlier approach with the United States than Mr. Xi.The Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 at the behest of American authorities, who claimed she deceived financial institutions and caused them to violate sanctions against Iran. Huawei has said it is unaware of any wrongdoing on her part.\u201cIf Ms. Meng is extradited to America, then it will be difficult for the government to control the public\u2019s anger \u2014 then the government will have to be tougher on Canada and the United States,\u201d Mr. Tu said.Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers were pleased by the tenor of his dinner with Mr. Xi in Buenos Aires. The Chinese leader was deeply engaged in the conversation, eager to convince the Americans that he was willing to go further in accommodating their grievances than any of his predecessors.Along with the agreement in Buenos Aires, China\u2019s leaders are also preparing a series of moves to open up the economy to more trade and foreign investment, an overhaul timed to the 40th anniversary later this month of the country\u2019s initial post-Mao economic reforms. Such moves, like further tariff reductions, would provide Mr. Xi an opportunity to introduce market-friendly measures without seeming to give in to American pressure.It\u2019s unclear what will satisfy the administration \u2014 and more important, Mr. Trump.Mr. Mnuchin has pushed for an agreement that obtains some concessions quickly, in order to reduce the potential economic fallout of an intensified trade war. Mr. Trump, concerned about the volatility in the stock markets, wants to get a big deal done, while also avoiding anything drastic that would damage his relationship with Mr. Xi, according to several officials with direct knowledge.But Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers are also watching China with a high level of caution. Some, like Mr. Lighthizer, the top negotiator in the talks, are highly doubtful that China will do anything more than is necessary to remove the threat of new tariffs.Beijing has a history of making promises it doesn\u2019t keep or doesn\u2019t fully implement. Some of the recent moves by China would provide superficial wins for the Trump administration, without requiring Beijing to substantially change anything.China has expressed a willingness to cut tariffs on American cars to 15 percent, from 40 percent. But that\u2019s what China already charges the rest of the world; the higher tariffs were merely a retaliatory measure imposed after the United States started a trade war. And China still maintains a 16 percent value-added tax that applies to all cars, including imported ones.David Malpass, Treasury\u2019s under secretary for international affairs, said during a congressional hearing on Wednesday that the Trump administration would not accept promises from China without verification. \u201cThe proof is in the pudding,\u201d said Mr. Malpass, who has engaged in midlevel negotiations with the Chinese. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire within the discussions to have specificity, to have firm timelines and deadlines and enforceable kinds of conditions.\u201dWilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary, said on CNBC on Wednesday that the Made in China initiative had provoked backlash from other countries but that he did not believe China was doing away with the program. \u201cIf you\u2019ll search the recent clips, you\u2019ll find they haven\u2019t been talking that much about it,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve dropped it.\u201dAs the talks progress, China\u2019s hand could ultimately be forced by economic weakness.It\u2019s hard to tell exactly how bad the economy has gotten in China. Many economists regard Chinese data as unreliable, and Beijing keeps a tight grip on information. But some sectors, like real estate and cars, indicate the plunge is getting steeper with each passing month.Car sales plummeted faster this autumn than during the global financial crisis, an abrupt downturn that auto industry leaders attribute to a crumbling of business and consumer confidence triggered mainly by the trade war. Many multinationals are reconsidering their heavy reliance now on China, endangering the country\u2019s ability to attract plentiful foreign investment and know-how in such industries.\u201cWithout Volkswagen, China would not be No. 1 in auto production today,\u201d said David Li, a prominent Tsinghua University economist, at a conference that the university hosted on Sunday to review policy lessons from the last 40 years, since China opened up after the death of Mao.The trade war, the sharp slowing of the economy and the prospect of diminishing foreign investment have also precipitated drops in China\u2019s stock market and currency this year. Those, in turn, appear to have weakened Mr. Xi\u2019s popularity, at least within the country\u2019s political and economic elite in Beijing and Shanghai. Complaints about his management, very seldom heard six months ago, have become unusually common in private conversations.For Mr. Xi, balancing those internal and external pressures will be critical as China enters the next phase of negotiations. Whatever additional leverage the United States enjoys in the current talks is predicated on the threat of tariffs, and Mr. Xi, like Chinese negotiators before him, still believes Mr. Trump will blink, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.The Huawei incident \u201cdoesn\u2019t give Trump any additional leverage. The tariffs do, whether you think they are a good idea or not,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. \u201cAnd, based on what Trump has done so far, the Chinese think that we ultimately chicken out just like we have done every other time.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Alan Rappeport and Glenn Thrush from Washington.Advertisement"}

But maybe I could win by losing.Ms. Winter is a comedian.My dog wags her tail whenever I say no.If 100 seems absurd, recall all those stats about how today\u2019s young adults are essentially rejection magnets: We change jobs and careers more frequently than ever before, are more likely to rely on the gig economy, relocate more and need new friends in those new cities, and we\u2019re marrying later. It feels as if the only constant is change, and that means we\u2019re forever at the whim of other people\u2019s judgments, opinions and decisions. It\u2019s unsettling at best. At worst, it\u2019s crippling.As 2018 began, though, I felt empowered by the knowledge that turning my failures into accomplishments would mean I\u2019d be gaming the system. Both acceptances and rejections would count as a sort of win, and I liked those odds.But, of course, I couldn\u2019t just take the compliment and move on. Instead, I explained that statistically speaking, I\u2019m a giant, pathetic failure.[Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.]Had it all been a terrible idea? I emailed Angela Duckworth, the author of \u201cGrit: The Power and Passion of Perseverance,\u201d to ask her what she thought of my rejection resolution. She made me feel scientifically sane.Dr. Duckworth explained that what I was doing was \u201cexposure therapy\u201d\u2014 making myself more comfortable with failure to reduce my fear of it. It was a relief, sitting at my desk, scrolling through the same inbox that contained messages like \u201cnot at this time,\u201d \u201cnot a fit\u201d and \u201cunfortunately,\u201d to see an expert in tenacity and achievement say that all this rejection was actually helpful. She argues that grit is more important than innate talent when it comes to success. So I kept at it.It\u2019s the middle of December and I have 101 rejections and 39 acceptances. I\u2019m so tired, and that\u2019s how I know I did it right. If I weren\u2019t exhausted, it would mean I\u2019d just spent the last year asking for things without putting in the work to earn them. To me, there\u2019s nothing more off-putting than entitlement.When we compared notes, we admitted that our experiments weren\u2019t a magic solution. Andy is still unattached, and I\u2019m still living paycheck to paycheck. But we\u2019ve taken more chances and come closer to getting the things we want.So I don\u2019t regret committing to this masochistic rejection project. It made me feel embarrassed, depressed, overwhelmed and self-indulgent. But I also felt that I was moving forward instead of standing still.Advertisement"}

This is especially true in technology investigations because the subject matter is so detailed; combing through data and conducting technical tests is time consuming.At the same time, Natasha, Adam and I contacted companies that use location data, clients of those companies, former employees, app makers and computer security researchers. We interviewed over 50 people for this piece and corresponded by email with dozens of companies to make sure we got their side of the story.Finally, we were ready. We had a rough draft of an article about an interesting new economy using people\u2019s location data. We found that these companies, many of them small start-ups, examined location data to determine people\u2019s preferences and target them with advertising. They were using it to help retailers learn more about their customers, or hedge funds beat the market by analyzing foot traffic at stores. Some of them also sold the data.Then I talked with someone who had access to some information from one of the dozens of companies in this industry and thought the public should know more about it. When we reviewed this data, we realized we had something the average smartphone user would never typically see. It blew us away.Michael Keller, a reporter and programmer on the tech investigations team with me, put the data points on a map, and they covered the entire city. With this amount of data, the first mapping program he tried was frustratingly slow. So he built a program he called QueryMe, which let us look at the phones passing through different locations or at the paths of individual devices.We had committed to not identifying anyone without permission, so we looked at our own paths first. We were curious whether there were devices that spent a lot of time in our own apartment buildings as well as at our offices. Unfortunately, our entire team is fairly tech-savvy, and many of us don\u2019t have location services enabled all the time. We weren\u2019t in this slice of data, as far as we could tell. Fortunately, I found a few people who allowed us to pull their location data and be identified.We realized we needed to show people what this data looked like. The maps were so viscerally powerful to us, and words couldn\u2019t do them justice. Michael worked with Richard Harris, a graphics editor on the Investigations team, and put together the maps that went with this story. They show how powerful and even beautiful the data can be, but also how much it reveals.Advertisement"}

The agency did not respond to a message asking what would happen to them next.Customs officers at Kennedy Airport have intercepted finch smugglers on at least seven occasions this year, seizing at least 184 birds, the agency said. As happened last week, the birds are given to the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the smugglers \u2014 usually not American citizens \u2014 are sent back to Guyana.And in April, two men, Victor Benjamin and Insaf Ali, were arrested at J.F.K. and charged with smuggling 26 of the birds between them in hair curlers rolled into their socks, court records show. Mr. Ali pleaded guilty to one count of smuggling in August, and Mr. Benjamin is due back in court in January.Finches and their rapid singsong chirps are prized in parts of South America and the Caribbean, including Guyana, Trinidad, Suriname and Brazil, where finch handlers compete for prizes and prestige at tournaments and informal competitions.That pastime has been transported to New York, where finch smuggling has become a big business. Not only do gamblers place bets on the winning chirper, but there is also big money to be made in the bird trade.A bird flu outbreak in 2015 caused $850 million in damages and required the culling of 50 million commercial turkeys and chickens, he said.Advertisement"}

Both cities are hot spots in the region\u2019s Ebola crisis, and the commission blamed the outbreak in announcing the exclusion.

The center houses patients whose Ebola cases are not yet confirmed before they are sent to a different location to be treated. Four of the missing were still awaiting test results, while the other 17 had tested negative.Most Congolese are impatient for a change in leadership. Mr. Kabila had a promising start after succeeding his father, who was assassinated in 2001, inviting foreign companies to invest in minerals like copper and cobalt and helping the economy grow during his tenure. Still, for a country with a wealth of natural resources, little of the profits filtered down to ordinary people.The election delays have set off violent protests over the past week, and security forces have responded by firing tear gas and live ammunition into crowds. Protesters burned parts of the Ebola triage center in Beni and looted it, walking off with chairs and tables, according to the Ministry of Health.Photos taken by Sami Kavota, a candidate in local elections, showed tarpaulin burned and ripped off metal structures at the center. Plastic gloves were scattered on the ground.Aruna Abedi, the deputy director of the government\u2019s Ebola response, said that protesters had also attacked its offices in Beni before United Nations peacekeepers pushed them back. Demonstrators were \u201cchanting songs hostile to the government and demanding elections,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cThey threw projectiles.\u201dLocal politicians have denounced the election delays as an attempt to disenfranchise a swath of a population that would back the regime\u2019s two main opponents, Felix Tshisekedi, the son of a charismatic opposition leader, and Martin Fayulu, a former Exxon manager.President Kabila earlier this year surprised many by announcing as his successor a former interior minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. His name is not widely known across the country, which is two-thirds the size of western Europe.Mr. Shadary is on a list of those penalized by the European Union over the brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters last year.On Thursday, the government said it was ousting the European Union\u2019s envoy to the country in retaliation for the sanctions.Just a few weeks ago, the president of the electoral commission, Corneille Nangaa, promised that the elections would go ahead despite the Ebola outbreak. Then, a mysterious arson at an election center in Kinshasa, the capital, burned some 8,000 of the 10,000 voting machines.Mr. Nangaa said the election could not be held on time because the commission needed to replace the machines.Then the election commission said that Beni, Butembo and Yumbi wouldn\u2019t be allowed to participate in the elections for president, Parliament and provincial governors.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the consequences of these people who make decisions without basis,\u201d said Mr. Kavota, a candidate in the provincial elections. \u201cEven the Ministry of Health confirmed today that the delay was unnecessary because all precautionary measures have been taken.\u201dSince Ebola broke out in eastern Congo in August, the authorities have recorded 583 confirmed or probable cases, 354 of them fatal so far.Lamuka, the main opposition coalition, called for a nationwide strike on Friday to protest the exclusion of Beni, Butembo and Yumbi, which account for about 1.2 million of the 40 million voters across Congo.About a hundred members of LUCHA, a prominent youth organization, demonstrated peacefully in Beni on Thursday and showed photos of barricades being set up around the city, where local civilians are often attacked with no apparent reason by a notoriously violent rebel group operating on the city\u2019s outskirts.The Union for Democracy and Social Progress, an opposition party, called for peaceful protests if elections don\u2019t take place this Sunday and urged ongoing action \u201cuntil the departure of Mr. Kabila and his system.\u201dAlain Daniel Shekomba, a presidential candidate, accused the electoral commission of running a \u201csuicide operation to blow up Congo\u201d and announced his intention to withdraw his candidacy out of frustration.\u201cThe dangerous experimentations and the sleights of hand\u201d conducted by the electoral commission, as well as the \u201cmilitary maneuvers ordered by the government have put in place a parody of a plebiscite that I cannot support as a candidate, voter, and citizen of Congo,\u201d Mr. Shekomba said.Steve Wembi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Best Dance of 2018", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur critics choose the best dance moments of a year crowded with major retrospectives and important new works.Alastair MacaulayIt was easy to choose a Top 10 for 2018, but a Top 20 would have been easier yet: There\u2019s been an abundance. Gia KourlasThe Judson collective, among other things, eschewed affectation and mannerism in performance, and for that reason Pat Catterson was an especially riveting sight. At 72, after 50 years of dancing, she performed for the final time in a program of works by Yvonne Rainer at MoMA. Her grounded presence and lack of artificiality allowed the movement to happen in such a direct, matter-of-fact way that it took on a sense of the ethereal.The same was true of Lucinda Childs in \u201cParticular Reel\u201d (1973), a solo in which she took deliberate steps to create distinct pathways across the white stage of MoMA\u2019s atrium. At 78, Ms. Childs, serene as ever, has astonishing control. In stark opposition was Ms. Tharp \u2014 at 77, she\u2019s wilder than ever \u2014 who performed a madcap number that followed the revival of her exceptional \u201cEight Jelly Rolls\u201d (1971) at the Joyce. She even let herself be flipped upside-down and later, in a solo turn, zigzagged across the stage like a manic butterfly with feet for wings.Throughout her career, Valda Setterfield, the 84-year-old dancer and muse to David Gordon, her husband, has rarely been less than mesmerizing. In \u201cThe Matter @ MoMA/2018,\u201d she surpassed herself. Just as Mr. Gordon\u2019s production, both refined and freewheeling, showed what a living archive could be \u2014 the accompanying Judson show is anything but \u2014 Ms. Setterfield proved that aging in dance isn\u2019t about showing how a body can look good doing less. It\u2019s that an older body is a living archive, too. It holds everything. Brian SeibertIn all performing arts, but in dance especially, present performances of past works often fail to measure up to contemporaneous accounts, the memories of those who there or the longing of those who missed out. That\u2019s the risk of retrospectives, and this year was heavy with them.For me, the best resurrection was the least likely one: Sara Mearns dancing Isadora Duncan solos in \u201cDances of Isadora.\u201d In Duncan\u2019s day, the first decades of the 20th century, she was revolutionary \u2014 more even than George Balanchine or Judson Dance Theater or Twyla Tharp (each the subject of retrospectives this fall). Or so the histories say. No films exist of Duncan dancing for longer than a few seconds, and her works in performance tend to look quaint, faded, antique.Not when Ms. Mearns danced them. It could have been a cheap irony or even a betrayal of Duncan, who considered ballet her enemy, to cast a famed ballerina like Ms. Mearns in her work. But Lori Belilove, who has devoted her life to preserving Duncan\u2019s legacy, did right in inviting Ms. Mearns to try.For once, the dancing had enough definition and scale that its simplicity felt like eloquence rather than limitation. You could see the economy of the small gestures and the freedom of the large motions, so everything was persuasive as an instinctual response to the music. More than a century old, what Duncan called her \u201cDance of the Future\u201d was breathing.Siobhan BurkeAt New York City Ballet, applause usually comes when a work is over. But at the premiere of Kyle Abraham\u2019s \u201cThe Runaway\u201d in September, ecstatic cheers erupted midperformance for this electrifying addition to the company\u2019s repertory.And for now, he\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cThe Runaway\u201d returns in January.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s #MeToo Moment: Actress Shares Account of Assault", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Accusations of rape made by an actress against a fellow actor have gripped Argentina and started a broader conversation about violence against women in the country.Thelma Fardin, an Argentine actress, accused Juan Darth\u00e9s, an older male colleague, of raping her in 2009. She was 16 and he was 45. \u201cI\u2019m truly overwhelmed,\u201d Ms. Fardin said Thursday. Making her story public was very difficult, she said, but she hoped that it might help others.\u201cIf it inspired five people to come forward, it would have been worth it. Now look at what\u2019s happened,\u201d Ms. Fardin said. \u201cMy story has now become secondary. This was clearly an issue that needed to be talked about. People yearned to discuss it, they just needed a trigger.\u201dShe first spoke publicly on Tuesday, at a news conference surrounded by dozens of fellow actresses on a stage in downtown Buenos Aires. In an emotional video, shown during the news conference and later shared on social media, Ms. Fardin described how Mr. Darth\u00e9s had lured her into his hotel room when they were touring with the theater version of the hit musical soap opera \u201cPatito Feo\u201d \u2014 \u201cUgly Duckling\u201d \u2014 and, she said, had raped her. During the encounter, Ms. Fardin said, Mr. Darth\u00e9s forced her to touch his erection and said: \u201cLook at what you do to me.\u201dThe phrase seemed to place the blame on Ms. Fardin. Before Ms. Fardin went public, three other women had accused Mr. Darth\u00e9s of sexual abuse that did not involve rape, and two said he had used that same phrase. Their accusations received little attention. One of them, Calu Rivero, an actress and model, was the first to come forward late last year. Ms. Rivero said she felt abused when the two had to share intimate scenes in a soap opera. \u201cThelma\u2019s story, told in the first person, was devastating,\u201d Ms. Rivero said. \u201cIt really showed how a woman has to expose herself completely in order to be believed. What she had to live through was truly horrifying.\u201dAfter Ms. Fardin posted the video of her account on Instagram with the hashtag #MiraComoNosPonemos, it was seen more than 1 million times and garnered tens of thousands of responses. The hashtag is meant as a message of solidarity among women and a rejection of the idea that they are somehow responsible for sexual assaults on them. Thousands of women shared their own stories using the hashtag and expressed support for Ms. Fardin. The organizers of a sexual abuse hotline say calls have soared. Many in the country were outraged by Mr. Darth\u00e9s\u2019s appearance in a government-funded public service video advertisement against gender violence. President Mauricio Macri of Argentina said in a Twitter posting on Wednesday that the video ad had been pulled, \u201cout of respect\u201d for Ms. Fardin.A lawyer for Ms. Fardin, Sabrina Cartabia, said a criminal complaint against Mr. Darth\u00e9s had been filed in Nicaragua where the alleged rape took place.\u201cThey have the public presence and the respectability to fill that space that the average woman can\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Brysk said of the actresses speaking out. \u201cBut it\u2019s coming a little bit in reverse order in Latin America. The grass-roots organizing has been around for awhile, and the sort of \u2018Me Too\u2019 movement is just arriving.\u201d\u201cWe want this case to be the tip of the spear,\u201d said Jazm\u00edn Stuart, one of the actresses who helped Ms. Fardin publicize her accusation.\u201cIt all has to do with sovereignty over our own bodies,\u201d Ms. Stuart said.\u201cLatin America as a region is growing rapidly, but with a lot of inequality and crime and conflict,\u201d Ms. Brysk said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for gender violence, unfortunately.\u201dEarlier this year, women\u2019s rights advocates came out in force to support a bill to legalize abortion, and used the same slogan: #NiUnaMenos.It is unclear whether calls in Argentina for an end to sexual violence against women will have the same resonance, but there is little doubt the region is watching. The show in which Ms. Fardin and Mr. Darth\u00e9s shared screen time years ago was popular across Latin America.For Ms. Fardin, the link with the #NiUnaMenos movement was clear: it had pushed her to think about what she had lived through while a child star.\u201cI\u2019ve said what I needed to say,\u201d Ms. Fardin said. \u201cNow the space is open for other people to come forward.\u201dDaniel Politi reported from Buenos Aires, and Megan Specia from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Citizens United, a Vicious Cycle of Corruption", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnconstrained outside spending on elections is corrosive to our democracy.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.So how did they conduct this delicate transaction?First, Ryan, Coleman and others \u201claid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House,\u201d according to Politico\u2019s report. Then Ryan \u201cleft the room, Coleman made the \u2018ask\u2019 and secured the $30 million contribution.\u201dThe crucial section of Citizens United reads as follows:The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse \u201cto take part in democratic governance\u201d because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker.The surge in outside spending unconstrained by contribution limits is a central element of current campaign finance practice.Four decades later, there\u2019s little need for furtive fund-raising or secret handoffs of cash. Many of the corporate executives convicted of campaign-finance crimes during Watergate could now simply write a check to their favorite super PAC or, if they want to keep it secret, to a compliant nonprofit group. Corporations can spend as much as they want to help their favored candidates, no longer prohibited by law from spending company cash on elections. The political world has, in many respects, come full circle since a botched burglary funded by illicit campaign cash brought down an administration. In fact, there are scholars on both the left and right who agree with Citizens United because they think restricting campaign spending by businesses constitutes an incursion on First Amendment rights that could lead to censorship, for example, of books and newspapers.Allowing government to control who can spend enough to get heard on a grander scale would render freedom of speech illusory.implausibly downplaying, and at times all but denying, the baleful corruption of American politics by means short of criminal bribery \u2014 by means that are lamentable precisely because they are lawful.The key changes in campaign finance practices over the past eight years stem from the ruling in Citizens United and Speech Now that contributions to independent expenditure committees, including super PACs, pose no threat of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d political corruption. There is no corruption, Justice Kennedy wrote in Citizens United, because \u201can independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\u201dThe supposed barrier between candidates and unrestricted super PACs is flimsier than ever. As midterm elections approach, complaints are rolling into the F.E.C. from both parties about super PACs that share vendors, fund-raisers and video footage with the politicians they support.Candidate assistance with super PAC fund-raising efforts has pushed at the boundaries of this legally mandated independence, allowing a level of coordination that many observers believe creates a real threat of quid pro quo corruption.Although these groups may not coordinate their expenditures with those of an official campaign, their managers often understand that their job is to attack an opponent while the candidate they support takes a higher road. Super PACs have been called \u201cthe attack dogs and provocateurs of modern politics.\u201d The advertisements they produce contribute to the nation\u2019s cynicism about politics, a cynicism that runs especially deep among young people. The candidates they support need not take responsibility for what they say, and the groups usually disappear once an election is over.A strong critic of the Supreme Court decision, Sanford Levinson, a member of the law school faculty and the department of government at the University of Texas, argued in an email to me that:Citizens United reveals the importance of having a Supreme Court completely devoid of a single individual who has ever participated in electoral politics. This helps to reinforce, I believe, the tendency of the Justices to think in terms of arid formalistic abstractions \u2014 including Kennedy\u2019s views about corporations and the First Amendment \u2014 rather than address the actual realities of our political system.It is the height of hubris for the Court, by a vote of five justices on a bench of nine, simply to dismiss concerns for electoral integrity on the ground that electoral integrity is a question of law rather than of social fact.In one section of a detailed critique he sent me, Wertheimer wrote:The Court in Citizens United stated, \u201cLimits on independent expenditures, such as (the ban on corporate expenditures) have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government\u2019s interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.\u201d This is a remarkably misguided statement in that the Court is asserting that the foundational need of our nation to be able to protect itself from the corruption of our government is outweighed by the constitutional right of a corporation to make unlimited expenditures to influence elections.The court, Wertheimer continued, was \u201cmisguided and na\u00efve\u201d in making theassertion in Citizens United without citing a single piece of evidence for this finding that \u201cthe appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy.\u201dIn the face of all this criticism, does Justice Kennedy, the now-retired author of Citizens United, have any second thoughts?intervention in the political process has been defined by a lack of prescience or success. What the majority in Citizens United had to say about corporate independent expenditures and the risk of corruption seemed entirely divorced from reality.The court has createda world in which both the parties and candidates can indirectly but effectively raise and benefit from unlimited donations purportedly expended on an \u201cindependent basis.\u201dJustice Kennedy, Bauer continued,Because Buckley prohibited the state from regulating independent expenditures while allowing it to regulate contributions, it \u201cproduced a system in which candidates face an unlimited demand for campaign funds (because expenditures generally cannot be capped) but a constricted supply (because there is often a ceiling on the amount each contributor can give) \u2026 The result is an unceasing preoccupation with fund-raising.\u201dCitizens United has turned campaign finance into a system universally disdained by the public, a system even more ethically unmoored than the one obtained before Watergate in the days when, to quote Eggen again:The money poured into Richard M. Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign from all corners: Six-figure checks flown by corporate jet from Texas; bundles of payments handed over at an Illinois game preserve; a battered brown attach\u00e9 case stuffed with $200,000 in cash from a New Jersey investor hoping to fend off a fraud investigation.The difference now is that the checks are bigger.How did this come about? Essentially, by legal fiat: a declaration by five Supreme Court justices that what looks, smells and feels like corruption is not in fact corruption.Tribe has summed up the decision succinctly:The Supreme Court\u2019s sin in Citizens United is not that it has been wrong to recognize and embrace the libertarian values that inhere in the First Amendment. But the libertarian campaign finance law the Court has developed fails in the broader project vital to First Amendment jurisprudence: the sensitive accommodation of competing constitutional values. The Court has not only underemphasized the egalitarian strain in First Amendment law \u2014 it has rejected that strain outright. And it has failed to recognize the range of plainly legitimate conceptions of democracy that Americans hold, instead privileging one view, democracy-by-financial-contributions, above all others.The likelihood that the current conservative majority would take into account the \u201cegalitarian strain in First Amendment law,\u201d as described by Tribe, is zero.state-created advantages not only allow corporations to play a dominant role in the Nation\u2019s economy, but also permit them to use \u201cresources amassed in the economic marketplace\u201d to obtain \u201can unfair advantage in the political marketplace.\u201dThe American system of campaign finance, undergirded by a Supreme Court whose conservative members feign innocence, has become the enabler of corrosive processes of economic and political inequality. Surely the justices are not benighted enough to believe that Paul Ryan and his ilk have no idea what they are doing.The Citizens United Court took the narrowest possible view of corruption, maintaining that the only legitimate government interest in this field is the prevention of quid pro quo corruption. But, as many have argued in response, quid pro quo corruption is far too narrow a governmental interest to identify as constitutionally relevant. It is an interest that does not begin to reflect the full stakes at issue in the campaign finance realm: the health of American democracy itself. Unless the notion of interests sufficiently compelling to count in the First Amendment calculus is strangely truncated to exclude interests this fundamental simply because they appear imprecise or diffuse, courts must recognize a compelling interest in combating corruption broadly defined as a distortion in the political process, understood to include a deviation from the ideal of equal representation embodied in Federalist 57.As resources flow toward the already most advantaged Americans, their ability to use those resources to shape policy increases. Of course rich Americans hold diverse preferences, just as the poor and the middle class. But despite some prominent liberal counterexamples, rich Americans tend to support the economic policies from which they have so greatly benefited. This raises the disturbing prospect of a vicious cycle in which growing economic and political inequality are mutually reinforcing.We are seeing that vicious cycle in operation today, with a Supreme Court incapable of applying either reason or common sense to stop the madness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s New President Promised a Revolution. Has It Begun?", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 In barely three weeks in office, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico has been on a relentless gallop to upset the status quo.He has championed a new law to cut the highest government salaries and raise the lowest ones, and proposed the expansion of social programs benefiting the poor and marginalized, whom he has declared to be his primary concern.He has aggressively moved forward on a plan to cancel construction of an expensive, partially completed airport.And in a move replete with symbolism, on the day of his inauguration, he turned the official presidential residence into a cultural center and opened it to the public \u2014 producing images of ordinary people, once sealed off from the site by a fierce perimeter of security, freely wandering its grounds in amazement and joy.His message was immensely popular with Mexican voters, who handed him a landslide victory in July and gave his party, Morena \u2014 which didn\u2019t even exist in the last presidential election \u2014 a majority in both chambers of Congress.These are early days yet in Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s six-year term. But the alacrity with which he has burst out of the gates, measured against the supremely high expectations he cultivated has led some to ask: Is Mexico on the cusp of a historic turning point \u2014 or a historic disappointment?He seems to know full well that this is the query on everyone\u2019s lips, and that the skeptics and critics are circling, vigilant for the first hints of hypocrisy and failure.\u201cStarting now, a transformation is underway, peaceful and orderly, but at the same time profound and radical,\u201d he said during his inauguration speech on Dec. 1. \u201cBecause the corruption and impunity that impede Mexico\u2019s rebirth will end.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador spent some of his early political career as an organizer for poor indigenous populations in his home state, Tabasco. Since then, he has sought to keep at least one foot, if not both, firmly planted among the nation\u2019s marginalized.In doing so, he has struck a sharp contrast with his predecessor, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.Where Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, a member of a politically well-connected family, was viewed by many as remote and elitist, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has sought to be accessible, a commoner among commoners.Where Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was polished, with television-ready good looks and sleek suits, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is rumpled, his face often bent in a rictus of annoyance, like a guy who just walked in off the street and isn\u2019t having a great day.When Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador invited the public into the presidential residence, for generations the most exclusive domain of Mexican political power, he was fulfilling a popular campaign promise.He has said he will continue to live in his home in southern Mexico City until his youngest son finishes primary school and then will look for what he calls \u201ca modest house\u201d near the National Palace, his office in the city center.He continues to get around Mexico City in his old Volkswagen, eschewing a presidential limousine. He disbanded the presidential secret service, surrounding himself with a security detail of 20 unarmed citizens representing a cross-section of Mexico society.\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my close relationship with citizens, with the people,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be fenced off.\u201dWhere Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto rarely met with the press and even more rarely took questions, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has held daily televised news conferences.For Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador these sessions, which begin at 7 a.m., not only reinforce the culture of accessibility but have also allowed him to set the day\u2019s news agenda.One of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s boldest executive moves came before he even took office.In late October, he announced that he intended to cancel construction of a new airport after an informal referendum organized by his own party and involving fewer than 2 percent of the nation\u2019s eligible voters. He said the $13 billion project was wasteful and plagued by corruption.The move to cancel the project, which is one-third complete, sank the peso and the Mexican markets and spread uncertainty among investors and business leaders, who feared Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador would take an arbitrary approach to managing the economy.The effort to shut down the project is now on hold while the government wrestles with investors over the terms of a construction bond buyback.But it was an initial salvo in Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s declared war on wasteful government spending.Under the proposed new law to cut the highest government salaries and raise the lowest ones, no bureaucrat can earn more than the president. And since Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has set his salary at about $5,350 per month \u2014 less than half of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s salary \u2014 that meant sharp cuts in the wages of more than 30,000 public officials.The law also slashed the pensions of the last five presidents.\u201cWe can\u2019t have a rich government and poor people,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said at a news conference last week.The legislation was met with a blizzard of lawsuits, and the Supreme Court has suspended the law pending a final ruling.A budget submitted by Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s finance minister over the weekend, expected to be approved by Congress in the coming days, was applauded by analysts for its sobriety and fiscal prudence.On the campaign trail, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador attacked a longstanding policy of using the military to fight the drug war. He emphasized reconciliation, even raising the possibility of amnesties for low-level criminals.But on his first full day in office this month, he backpedaled, lauding a bill that would keep the military on the streets as part of a newly created National Guard that would also integrate civilian police.\u201cThe people of Mexico need their armed forces to address this grave problem of insecurity and violence right now,\u201d he said during a speech, flanked by generals. \u201cWe trust the armed forces.\u201dCritics have pounced on the proposal as evidence that at least some of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s campaign promises were hollow showmanship. The plan has also worried human rights advocates, who say it will amount to the same heavy-handed and ultimately unsuccessful approach advocated by his two most recent predecessors.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has said he plans to put the issue to a public referendum in the coming months.In June, a federal court in Mexico ordered the government to form a \u201ctruth and justice commission\u201d consisting of federal officials and victims\u2019 representatives. On Dec. 3, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador created that body.\u201cWe are not going to wash our hands of this,\u201d he declared.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has repeatedly vowed to look out for all citizens, with special attention given to the poor.His administration\u2019s proposed budget seemed to deliver in part on this promise, and includes increases in social security spending for the elderly, an expansion of scholarship initiatives for students, and billions of dollars to fund job-training and other programs for unemployed youth.This was followed by the announcement of a 16 percent minimum wage increase across the country.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has also promised to focus attention on the impoverished southern states of Mexico, proposing to step up development in the region, including an ambitious train project connecting the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula to the state of Chiapas that he says will spur employment and tourism.\u201cI said during the campaign: Look after everyone, listen to everyone, respect everyone, but give special attention to the humble,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said at a news conference. \u201cFor the good of all, the poor first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Playing Host to Climate Conference, Poland Promotes Coal", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKATOWICE \u2014 As thousands of environmental experts from around the world arrived for a conference on climate change, hoping to find a way to stem the damage caused by burning fossil fuels, their Polish hosts arranged for a band to greet them.The Polish Coal Miners Band, dressed in smart black uniforms and wearing traditional miners\u2019 caps, struck up a tune as confused-looking delegates arrived at the convention center in Katowice, a city in the heart of southern Poland\u2019s coal mining country.Coal was proudly displayed in cases around the convention pavilions. Coal, fashioned into jewelry, was for sale. A coal-based cosmetics company even touted products that it claimed would treat both \u201cbody and soul.\u201d\u201cThere is no plan today to fully give up on coal,\u201d President Andrzej Duda said in his opening remarks on Monday. \u201cExperts point out that our supplies run for another 200 years, and it would be hard not to use them.\u201d\u201cEven as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, not moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption,\u201d said Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general.But the Polish government\u2019s choice to use the forum to showcase its devotion to coal offered a discordant note to the start of the convention \u2014 part of the much broader challenge facing Mr. Guterres and others who are urging countries to aim for net zero carbon emissions by 2050.To meet that goal, burning coal would need to be nearly completely eliminated.The goal of the two-week United Nations meeting in Poland is to establish rules for carrying out the Paris agreement to limit the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.While Poland\u2019s dependence on coal is well known, the government\u2019s use of the global forum to promote its energy agenda was striking.In another provocative move, Poland decided to partner with the biggest coal enterprises in the country to organize the United Nations conference.Even before the European Commission recently unveiled its strategy for a net zero carbon economy in the bloc by 2050, Poland and other states argued that if the biggest polluters, like the United States, do not intend to meet their emissions reductions goals, the smaller countries should not be expected to accept tougher targets.Poland, which has the highest domestic coal production in Europe, burns coal to provide nearly 80 percent of its energy. The government announced plans to reduce that to around 60 percent by 2030, partly through investing in modern, clean technologies.President Duda reminded the conference that Poland had managed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by almost one-third compared with the base year of 1988, and talked about making sustainable development a priority.In a country where about 100,000 people still worked in the mining industry as of 2015, he said, planning for the transition to a low-carbon economy needs to include maintaining economic development and jobs.\u201cIt\u2019s completely stupid that in 2030 we will be still reliant on coal in 60 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cSure, the mining sector is an enormous source of income in the region and it will be very difficult to switch. But we need to start as soon as possible.\u201dMr. Bialas acknowledged that coal is \u201ca very strong part of our identity.\u201d\u201cBut it is also a part of our past,\u201d he added. \u201cOur future is in the renewables.\u201dFor Mr. Duda, the focus was on the present, and he used the second day of the conference to reinforce his pro-coal message. Skipping the meeting, he visited a mine in Brzeszcze, in southern Poland, and participated in celebrations of \u201cBarborka,\u201d the feast day of St. Barbara, patron saint of miners.\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with scientists how much human activity affects natural environment, including climate,\u201d Mr. Duda said. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t worry.

{"Headline": "Investors Have Nowhere to Hide as Stocks, Bonds and Commodities All Tumble", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks? Messy. Bonds? Meh. Commodities? Not pretty.Most years, financial markets are a mixed bag. A bad year for risky investments, like stocks, might be a great one for safe bets like government bonds. Or, if worries about inflation are hurting bond investments, commodities like gold tend to do well.Not this year.If this persists, or grows worse, it could create a damaging feedback loop, with doubts about the economy hurting the markets, and trouble in the markets undermining growth.Pessimism emanating from the stock market could leave consumers and businesses scared to spend. The rout in junk bonds makes it more expensive for financially fragile businesses to borrow. The collapse in crude oil prices discourages new investment and hiring in the oil patch, which has been a source of job growth.In that sense, the markets are both a gauge of what investors expect to happen in the economy, and a potential catalyst for their decisions. The mood in the financial markets ultimately feeds into spending by companies and consumers, and if they pull back, based on panicky ups and downs, growth could suffer.\u201cPeople look to the financial markets as a source of information, as a signal, about what\u2019s going to happen and what\u2019s going to come,\u201d said Itay Goldstein, finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd when they see markets going down, they start thinking pessimistically about the outlook for the real economy.\u201dThere\u2019s scant evidence that the worst-case scenario will play out. The American economy remains strong: Unemployment is near 50-year lows, and growth is steady. And it wasn\u2019t that long ago that financial markets were feeling good about the global economy, shrugging off troublesome issues like the trade war, Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and the debt levels of developing nations.On Sept. 20, stock investors in the United States were sitting on a nearly 10 percent gain for the year. Benchmark American crude oil prices were up more than 20 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 15 percent.But those profits are gone.Since October, an index of commodities that includes oil and copper has swung from gains of 20 percent to losses for the year. A similar move took place in risky corporate bonds. So far this year, after another steep drop on Friday, the S&P 500-stock index is down about 2.8 percent.\u201cIn a typical year there\u2019s going to be some winners and losers,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at the equity market research firm Ned Davis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you get nothing working.\u201dHis firm recently looked at eight types of investments going back to 1972. In every year, at least one of these categories generated a return of 5 percent or more. A separate study by JPMorgan Chase analysts found that \u201c2018 has delivered losses on almost every asset class and investing style.\u201dThe widespread market jitters have accompanied a tectonic shift in the investing world, as central banks have begun to withdraw the extraordinary support provided to the global economy in response to the financial crisis a decade ago.For nearly seven years, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero and bought trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of government bonds, which pushed interest rates \u2014 that move in the opposite direction of prices \u2014 sharply lower. Money in the bank earned next to nothing, so investors eagerly bought anything they expected to generate some kind of return: risky debt, real estate, stocks, technology start-ups.The Fed\u2019s support, bolstered by similar efforts from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, proved to be a huge tailwind for global financial markets. Everything seemingly moved up in tandem.\u201cWhat was once a tailwind is now a headwind for markets,\u201d said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pimco, a bond investment firm with $1.7 trillion under management, in Newport Beach, Calif.At least on the margins, the turmoil in the financial markets is already reverberating in the real economy.For instance, as Treasury bond prices have declined this year, interest rates \u2014 which move in the opposite direction \u2014 have risen.In recent weeks, the broad investment declines have worsened while anxiety grows over the trade war between the United States and China. This fight, between the world\u2019s two largest economies, may already be dragging on global growth.The experience of 2015 could be a useful road map for investors. That year was uncomfortable as the Federal Reserve planned to raise interest rates against a backdrop of soft global growth.

{"Headline": "China Is Willing to Make a Deal", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIts leaders are talking tough, but privately, many Chinese officials are worried about their economy and eager to end the trade war.Professor Prasad is an economist at Cornell University.The official word is that everything is fine. China\u2019s economy, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, continues to grow at a robust pace and follow a steady path of \u201creform and opening up.\u201dIn private, Chinese officials admit they are worried. During a trip to Beijing last week, I encountered varying degrees of concern about the economy among bureaucrats, academics and business executives. Most of them agreed that the Chinese economy is slowing down, although some view this as better than the breakneck growth of the past.Against this backdrop, there is a real opportunity for a deal to end the damaging trade war with the United States.The trade war comes at a delicate time. It hurts foreign and domestic investor sentiment: investor nervousness has pulled China\u2019s stock market down by about 25 percent this year. Domestic investors are taking their money out, and foreign investors are no longer keen on China, which in turn puts downward pressure on the currency. This reduces the government\u2019s room to maneuver, by forcing it to spend foreign exchange reserves to prop up the currency and making it harder to cut interest rates.The economy has relied for far too long on such investment, mainly by state-owned enterprises, fueled by a surge in corporate debt. The \u201cdeleveraging\u201d campaign, which makes it harder for corporations to borrow from banks, will prevent more bad loans piling up in the banking system. To avoid shifting these risks to the \u201cshadow banking\u201d system of non-bank lenders, Chinese regulatory authorities have tightened the screws on informal financial institutions. This has starved the private sector of credit, which has also dampened growth.The Chinese government faces some important decisions. It should stick with financial deleveraging, improve the functioning of corporate debt and stock markets as alternative sources of finance, and cut corporate and household taxes to support growth. Another challenge is how to deal with the Trump administration\u2019s demands.Remarkably, some reform-minded officials now actually speak about President Trump as a positive force. Many reforms have been stalled, but under American pressure the opening up of China\u2019s economy that Mr. Xi proclaims might actually be translated into action, bringing greater access for foreign firms, better protections for intellectual property rights and an increased ability for foreign investors to participate in financial markets.China sees some of these moves as in its interest, but it wants to pursue these changes in its own way and at its own pace. American pressure could give added momentum to the movement for reform.With significant support inside China, the prospect of a trade deal early in the new year is real. The United States won\u2019t get all it asks for. China is not about to abandon its state-owned enterprises, although it may be willing to subject them to greater market discipline. The best outcome for negotiations is that tariffs imposed by the United States won\u2019t get higher and broader. So the expectation is that any deal will lead to a cessation of further hostilities but not a rollback of trade sanctions.Such an agreement would give the United States and Mr. Trump a major victory. But if American negotiators refuse to settle for anything less than total capitulation by China, his administration will squander an opportunity to help the United States and the world\u2019s economy.Eswar Prasad is a professor at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and the author of \u201cGaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in \u2026 Mexico", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational real estateIn the city of Monterrey, new developments (and prices) are rising to meet greater demand for luxury properties.16 PhotosThe apartment, which occupies the building\u2019s 10th floor and roof, was formed by joining two penthouses for greater space and privacy. It includes an exclusive two-level roof deck that has a swimming pool and views of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range to the south.One side of the living room has a large, pale sectional and a bar topped with black marble, while the other side has a dark gray sectional, a television and a baby grand piano and drum set. The dark, wide-plank floors and earth-toned walls and furnishings give the interior a modern rustic aesthetic, while the floor-to-ceiling windows bathe it in natural light. \u201cIt\u2019s an awesome space for parties,\u201d Mr. Stroming said of the penthouse.There is a half bath near the entrance, as well as a guest bedroom with a large en suite bathroom. From the bar, a door leads to the generous master suite, which has a sitting area and large pull-down shades covering a wall of windows. The master bath, with marble floors, and bedroom share a private terrace.Opposite the master suite, the dining room connects to an open kitchen with stainless-steel appliances and a granite countertop. Adjacent to the kitchen are an en suite guest bedroom and a small en suite staff bedroom, as well as a hallway with storage and a laundry area. On the other side of the dining room, a cozy lounging corner is accented with white bricks and dark beams, and outfitted with candles, throw pillows and a constellation of hanging ceiling bulbs. A sliding-glass door opens to an expansive terrace, with dining and lounging areas, offering views of Monterrey and the mountains in the distance. The rooftop terrace includes an infinity pool on a raised deck, two hot tubs, a billiard table, a kitchen and several covered eating spaces. Two sets of stairs \u2014 inside, near the front door, and outside, by the kitchen \u2014 lead up from the penthouse. The property comes with four below-ground parking spaces. The building has a gym, a billiard and game room, a bar, a sauna, and entertaining and catering spaces. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high-end boutique building, so there\u2019s a lot of personal care,\u201d Mr. Stroming said.Monterrey, Mexico\u2019s third-largest city, is known as the industrial and economic center of the country\u2019s northern region, as well as a hub for modern art and culture. The suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, part of the Monterrey metropolitan area, offers a wealth of retail and restaurants, all a short walk from High Park. (The building itself includes two levels of retail spaces.) Barrio Antiguo, Monterrey\u2019s historic district, and the city center, with its museums and parks, are about five miles east, while Monterrey International Airport is about 20 miles away.With a population of about 1.2 million in the city and 4.5 million in the greater metropolitan area, Monterrey is one of Mexico\u2019s largest and most active real estate markets, with some of its most expensive properties, agents said.Buyers gravitated toward older and more affordable units, and also toward rental properties rather than purchases, in part because of rising inflation, said Jorge Paredes, the chief executive of Realty World Mexico and the report\u2019s author. But Monterrey\u2019s luxury properties also performed well. Between January and August of this year, sales of the highest priced properties in Nuevo Le\u00f3n increased more than 6 percent over the same period in 2017, Mr. Paredes wrote, while luxury sales dropped almost 8 percent across Mexico. As the region\u2019s economy continues to develop, more executives are buying properties in Monterrey\u2019s best neighborhoods and suburbs, agents said. Most prized is San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, just outside the city center, where real estate prices are among the highest in Mexico.Gerardo Gutierrez, chief executive of Gerencia RED, a national real estate agency, said prices of luxury properties there typically range from $1 million to $6 million. Prices in desirable areas of Monterrey have increased sharply in the past two years, he said, from about $2,000 to $3,000 a square meter ($185 to $285 a square foot), because of rising demand.The city\u2019s real estate stock has been shifting in recent years, she added, from predominantly \u201chorizontal\u201d designs to more \u201cvertical\u201d developments that include both residential and office towers.There aren\u2019t many foreigners buying homes for vacation or retirement in Monterrey, agents said. And foreigners who move to the city for work usually do so on a contract basis, so they rent. Ms. Bermudez estimated that only about 10 to 20 percent of her agency\u2019s buyers are from outside Mexico, noting that the number includes buyers of commercial, industrial and residential properties.Mr. Gutierrez said about 15 percent of the luxury home buyers he sees in Monterrey are foreign, most of them from the United States, South Korea and China, usually relocating for work. Notaries handle real estate transactions, but he recommended hiring a bilingual attorney to ensure the title is clear. There are \u201csmall details that have to be looked at by a Mexican attorney, and very often a bilingual attorney will be more helpful with foreign individuals,\u201d he said.Spanish; Mexican peso (1 peso = $.05)Annual property taxes are 17,000 pesos (about $834), Mr. Stroming said, and the monthly condominium fee is 31,000 pesos ($1,520).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Should Have the Right to Sue Apple", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Apple v. Pepper, the Supreme Court will decide whether iPhone App Store customers are entitled to make their case against the tech giant.Ms. Slaughter is a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.Some app buyers allege that the App Store is an illegal monopoly and that Apple forces them to pay higher prices for apps than they would have paid in a competitive market. The question before the Supreme Court is not whether Apple has engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of the law. Instead, this case is about whether app buyers are entitled to present the facts of their case to a court \u2014 and the decision will have consequences for the ability of all Americans to hold corporations accountable for illegal monopolistic conduct.The Justice Department supported Apple\u2019s reasoning before the court. I sit on the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is jointly responsible, with the Justice Department, for enforcement of antitrust laws, and I strongly disagree with our sister agency\u2019s position. Apple users can buy apps only through Apple\u2019s App Store. They must deal directly with Apple as a distributor of iPhone apps rather than with the individual app developers. That is why the lower court decided that consumers are indeed \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d and eligible to sue under the antitrust laws.Putting aside the merits of the underlying antitrust claim, this case comes down to first principles. Should the consumers who are potential victims of alleged antitrust violations be allowed to make their case before a judge or jury? Should citizens play a role as a meaningful check against anticompetitive corporate conduct? I believe the answer is yes. America is grappling with serious questions about the levels of concentration and competition in our economy, and the Supreme Court should reinforce rather than constrict the ability of consumers to seek justice for illegal abuses of market power.For people who have been victims of anticompetitive corporate conduct, private lawsuits are the primary means for getting compensation. A 2013 study found that 60 of the largest successful private antitrust cases from 1990 to 2011 resulted in at least $33 billion in compensation to victims. Private enforcement also bolsters the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s efforts to stop anticompetitive conduct \u2014 for example, in the pharmaceutical industry.A Supreme Court decision that treats iPhone app buyers as too far removed from Apple to bring a federal antitrust suit against the company would undermine Congress\u2019 intent to permit any victim of antitrust violations to seek justice. Worse, it would give a free pass for antitrust law violations in cases in which consumers are the victims with the greatest incentive to go to court. App developers, who Apple claims are the \u201cdirect purchasers\u201d of their app services, may not be inclined to bring an antitrust case against their business partner. Apple is the gatekeeper to the apps\u2019 millions of target customers.The case before the court is not simply about one company or one group of consumers. It is about the right of citizens to hold corporate monopoly power in check in industries across our economy.Rebecca Kelly Slaughter is a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Hiring Slows, Employers Say It\u2019s Getting Harder to Find Workers", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 At Western Building Products\u2019 banana-shaped factory on the lip of the Menomonee River outside Milwaukee, the company\u2019s president, Mark Willey, is wrangling with a stubborn problem: not enough workers.\u201cIf someone is here a year, they never leave,\u201d Mr. Willey said. \u201cOur problem today is just finding people who want to work.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an economy that is well in expansion mode but that is coming off the boil after a strong second and third quarter,\u201d said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management. \u201cSo the state of the job market is good. It\u2019s just that the pace of job creation is slowing a little bit.\u201dThe average monthly job gain clocked in at 170,000 for the last three months and more than 200,000 for the year.Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in November, keeping the year-over-year average at 3.1 percent for the second month in a row, a level not seen since the recession. \u201cIf you have solid wage growth while productivity is improving, that is the best of both worlds,\u201d Mr. Donabedian said.The labor shortage has been a boon to workers who were hit hardest during the recession: Minimum-wage earners, African-Americans, Latinos and Americans with a high school degree or less have all seen their jobless rates decline in recent months.Many of them were able to find jobs in health care, manufacturing, and transportation and warehousing, which were among the strongest job-creating sectors.Employers added 27,000 manufacturing jobs in November, on top of nearly 300,000 positions in the previous 12 months.Those who are doing the hiring, though, have repeatedly complained that the field of available workers has been picked through, and that people with sufficient skills are particularly scarce.This December has been unusually busy, said Mr. Willey, who is finishing up his 42nd year at the factory, where he started as a seasonal worker. The company has 217 people on staff and expects to raise the total to 230 next year.Entry-level wages are $12.50 an hour, while the typical worker earns nearly $17 an hour plus benefits. Because the business is 100 percent employee owned, workers build up equity in the company after a year, which Mr. Willey said amounted to a 25 percent raise. He and his colleagues have batted around the idea of raising starting wages to $16 an hour, but \u201cwe have to have the productivity for it to make sense,\u201d he said.Western has used temporary agencies and employs inmates from a nearby correctional facility as part of a work-release program. \u201cWhen they get released, we hire them,\u201d Mr. Willey said. \u201cSome we even hire while they\u2019re still in.\u201dThe company is also working with local high schools that teach students the building trades. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few coming by, hoping they\u2019ll want to work here when they graduate,\u201d Mr. Willey said.A growing number of workers say they are willing to take the risk of hopping to another job in search of higher pay and more responsibility, according to Gartner, a research and consulting firm that conducts a quarterly national survey of 20,000 employees at companies valued at $100 million or more.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s harder for employees to get promoted nowadays,\u201d said Brian Kropp, vice president for human resources at Gartner. In 2006, for example, it took an average of about two and a half years to get a promotion, compared with four and a half years now.The result has been growing dissatisfaction and resentment. The share of employees who say they are willing to go above and beyond at work has dropped, Mr. Kropp said. One in four employees used to report giving work an extra oomph \u2014 something Gartner calls \u201cdiscretionary effort.\u201d Now, it\u2019s closer to one in six.The reason, Mr. Kropp said, is simple: Workers are not being rewarded for their efforts.At Western, business has been good enough that the 82-year-old company is scouting for a location to build a bigger factory. Mr. Willey, though, is worried that the economy will cool over the next couple of years.A shortage of workers in the building trades has caused projects to back up. At the same time, interest rates have climbed and tariffs put in place by President Trump have bumped up the cost of materials. Mr. Willey pointed to the aluminum sills that run along the bottom of doors, and the steel hinges bolted onto the sides.As a result, some buyers may simply choose not to go forward.\u201cEverybody\u2019s keeping their fingers crossed,\u201d Mr. Willey said, referring to hopes of a trade agreement between the Trump administration and China. If no deal is reached, the president has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent, from 10 percent.Uncertainty about trade policy is fueling anxiety in all corners of the economy.\u201cThat is the biggest impediment now,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said. \u201cThe ball is in the president\u2019s court to make sure the China deal is still on.\u201dManufacturing and related sectors tend to be more susceptible to economic cycles and are particularly vulnerable to tariffs.Friday\u2019s jobs report, which provided a welcome counterpoint to slowdowns, layoff announcements and stock market swings, is unlikely to deter policymakers at the Federal Reserve from raising benchmark interest rates when they meet on Dec. 18 and 19.Next year is a different story. Most analysts expect that the slowing pace of job creation will encourage the central bank to take a more cautious approach in the future.The jobs report, of course, is a temporary and incomplete snapshot of the labor market. Last month\u2019s figures will be revised twice. Revisions announced in this report trimmed 12,000 job gains from the September and October data.Whether a tightening market can bring in sidelined workers is still a subject of keen debate. The share of adults in the work force remains stuck at unusually low levels \u2014 under 63 percent in November. A broader measure of unemployment that includes workers too discouraged to search for a job, and part-timers who would prefer full-time work, ticked up to 7.6 percent in November, from 7.4 percent the previous month. Long-term unemployment is also double what it was in the early 2000s.\u201cEven now, at this point in the recovery,\u201d Martha Gimbel, research director at the job-search site Indeed, said, \u201cone of the fastest growing jobs search terms on Indeed is people looking for \u2018full-time work.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

A New kind of human adaptationResearchers have reported a new kind of human adaptation \u2014 to the ocean. According to the journal Cell, a group of people known as the Bajau, who traditionally live in houseboats or houses on stilts in villages in Southeast Asia, have evolved to be better divers. The researchers\u2019 findings reveal that the Bajau \u2014 regardless of whether they\u2019re divers or have other jobs \u2014 have spleens that are about 50 percent bigger than those who live 15 miles inland.

The company\u2019s success is all the more impressive considering that Huawei has failed to make inroads in some of the world\u2019s largest markets, including the United States, in part because of corporate and government espionage fears.10.

Students between the ages of 3-15 will have to leave their smartphones, tablets and any other digital devices at home or turned off on school premises, with exceptions for disabled students or during extracurricular activities. Some lawmakers scoffed at the new law as overkill, citing an existing rule that already prohibits smartphone use during instruction time in classrooms.13.

{"Headline": "After Amazon Contest, N.Y. Lawmakers Want to Block Negotiations Done in Secret", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs cities around the country made bids to land Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, lawmakers and residents were purposely left in the dark.Now, New York lawmakers are taking aim at this kind of secretive process. On Thursday, Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn will introduce legislation that would ban New York City from entering into nondisclosure agreements during negotiations for prospective development projects. A similar bill will be introduced in Albany by State Senator Michael N. Gianaris of Queens in the upcoming legislative session.The efforts comes amid a nationwide backlash against Amazon and its HQ2 sweepstakes, which critics said allowed the online retail behemoth to collect data from cities across the nation and resulted in economic development officials offering massive incentives without public debate. In New York, officials gave Amazon city and state tax incentives and a state grant that together is worth roughly $3 billion, and approval to skirt the city\u2019s land use review process.\u201cThe process that Amazon required and that New York City acquiesced to forced cities to bid against one another in secret,\u201d Mr. Lander said.\u201cThat helped Amazon maximize tax breaks and features for its own benefit, but it hid the public economic development policy from the public. And that is bad for transparency, bad for economic development, bad for all of the cities that participated and, I think, bad for democracy.\u201dDuring the so-called HQ2 competition for a second headquarters, activists across the nation called for more transparency from Amazon and the cities that submitted bids. In places such as Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, city officials were pressured to reveal their bids. But that push for transparency has died down, said Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who closely tracked the Amazon selection process.Now, even as New York contemplates banning nondisclosure agreements, Mr. Jensen said cities need to go further to fundamentally change the control that corporations have in economic development projects. For example, he thinks city councils should be able to vote on incentives a city might offer.Ultimately, Mr. Lander argued the federal government should take the lead.\u201cIn the ideal world, there would be federal policy to push back against the kind of crony capitalism that too often passes for economic development. But since we\u2019re not going to get help from Washington, cities are going to have to do it for ourselves,\u201d he said.Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration pushed back against Mr. Lander\u2019s proposal, highlighting the benefits Amazon will bring to New York City.\u201cThe city has secured thousands of good-paying jobs that will improve the lives of working families and give them security in a 21st-century economy,\u201d Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for City Hall, said in a statement. \u201cWe will review any proposed legislation, but we remain very confident we took the right approach, and that the process ahead will foster significant public input.\u201dMr. Lander and the two co-sponsors of the bill, Jumaane Williams and Jimmy Van Bramer, seem to have the initial support of the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, potentially setting up yet another confrontation between the City Council and Mr. de Blasio.\u201cI am deeply concerned about the use of NDAs in general and with the Amazon deal in particular, so I look forward to reviewing this bill as it moves through the legislative process,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThe public should have as much information as possible about these deals.\u201dCompanies, including Amazon, have often argued nondisclosure agreements are necessary to protect proprietary information. But, Mr. Gianaris said New York\u2019s Freedom of Information Law already protects that information.\u201cThe idea that we allow private corporations to dictate what governments can and cannot share with the people they represent is offensive on many levels,\u201d he said.Mr. Lander\u2019s bill is also the latest effort by the City Council to strip power from the mayor at a time when many lawmakers have expressed their displeasure with not being involved in the discussions surrounding Amazon\u2019s move to Long Island City.\u201cI don\u2019t like that the city shielded its bid from the public,\u201d Mr. Lander said, adding that the bill was \u201ccertainly motivated by a desire to prevent that from happening again.\u201dJ.

{"Headline": "Trump Wants the Fed to \u2018Feel the Market.\u2019 That\u2019s Pretty Good Advice, Actually.", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the ability to feel it accurately, in a time of mixed signals like the current moment, is not so simple.Usually, older businessmen who are unhappy about what the Federal Reserve is doing grumble to their golfing buddies, or maybe appear as guests on CNBC. The president prefers Twitter.But in his latest complaints about monetary policy, President Trump actually made a somewhat profound observation about one of the eternal dilemmas of central banking.Fed policymakers are meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, and are likely to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point \u2014 the fourth such rate rise this year and the eighth since the central bank began raising rates three years ago. At the same time, the Fed is shrinking the portfolio of bonds it acquired through its quantitative easing programs that concluded in 2014, to the tune of $50 billion a month. This measure, sometimes called quantitative tightening, reduces the supply of money in the economy.I hope the people over at the Fed will read today\u2019s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, don\u2019t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B\u2019s. Feel the market, don\u2019t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!It really is the case that the turbulence in financial markets in the last couple of months is driven by fears that the Fed has moved too far, too fast to tighten the money supply.That is evident in the sectors that are taking it on the chin \u2014 especially heavily indebted industrial companies, and the interest-rate-sensitive housing and automobile sectors.And it has been evident in the flattening of the yield curve. When longer-term bonds are yielding only slightly more than shorter-term bonds, as now, it implies that markets expect the Fed will need to curtail rate increases sooner than Fed officials themselves have been signaling.But the most memorable part of the president\u2019s tweet \u2014 and one that actually is a pretty good guideline for all central bankers \u2014 was, \u201cFeel the market, don\u2019t just go by meaningless numbers.\u201dIt is the ability to do this effectively that separates the successful central bankers from the failures. The great challenge is to separate signal from noise, to successfully differentiate when markets are sending useful information about the economic future and when they just represent erratic, random movement.Back in the summer and fall of 2007, for example, global credit markets were becoming strained, bond yields fell and stock prices began gyrating wildly. What would eventually be known as the Great Recession began in December of that year.In both those cases, the Fed was wise to adjust its policy in response to what markets were doing (and with hindsight did so too slowly and reluctantly). But the flip side is that sometimes markets move for reasons that don\u2019t really tell us anything about the economy.There\u2019s an old joke that the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. In the last decade, that has been more like nine of the last zero recessions.Remember the great sell-off of late January and early February 2018? It resulted in a drop of about 9 percent in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index \u2014 yet 2018 has turned out to be the strongest year of economic growth in a long time, even as the Fed maintained a steady course of gradual rate increases.When the Fed has too itchy a trigger finger in trying to protect the economy against market gyrations, it can have negative consequences. In 1998, the Fed cut interest rates amid crises in emerging market nations. The economy roared ahead in 1999, fueling a dot-com bubble that would subsequently pop with damaging consequences.As the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, and his colleagues gather around the big table to make their decision, it really does boil down to whether this is just a market disruption that needs to be allowed to run its course, or the early stages of something that will damage the ability of ordinary Americans to earn a good living.What makes the decision tricky is that the recent bout of market volatility has offered conflicting signals.The drop in stocks since early October has, at least in its recent phases, been accompanied by falling bond yields, which tend to be more closely tied to economic ups and downs than the stock market is.Also accompanying falling stocks are a drop in the prices for oil and other commodities. This can both reflect soft global growth and cause further economic weakness in energy- and agriculture-focused parts of the nation\u2019s economy, as happened in 2015-2016.In the Fed\u2019s decision Wednesday \u2014 both on whether to raise interest rates as expected and what to signal about 2019 plans \u2014 Mr. Powell will essentially be forced to judge which of these sets of signals to believe.In other words, he needs to feel the market, and not just go by meaningless numbers. The problem is that some numbers are very meaningful indeed, and making the right decision depends on knowing which is which.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Frustrated by Shutdown, States Spend to Keep National Parks Open", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe federal government was about to shut down. But on Friday evening, a Utah state employee had a delivery to make: three checks, totaling $46,034 and payable to the government in Washington that would soon close indefinitely.Utah officials viewed the checks as lifelines, the only way they knew to keep some of their state\u2019s most popular and lucrative national parks running at close to normal at the height of the holiday season.\u201cWe don\u2019t like having to do it, and the federal government should be doing it,\u201d Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah said in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re frustrated \u2014 we\u2019re probably beyond frustrated, maybe even angry \u2014 but we\u2019re prepared.\u201dFrom Albany to Phoenix, state governments are choosing not to wait on a breakthrough in Washington to end the year\u2019s third federal shutdown. Instead, they have begun tapping their own treasuries to keep a patchwork of federal properties open and maintained during the spending standoff. The strategies could collectively cost states, as well as private companies and groups that sometimes step in, more than $590,000 a week, and likely far more.\u201cIt\u2019s no way to manage one of America\u2019s crown jewels,\u201d said David J. Hayes, who was deputy secretary of the interior for parts of the Clinton and Obama administrations. \u201cIf we\u2019re put in a situation as a country where we have to plan for government shutdowns and develop sophisticated contingency approaches for providing full services in the absence of funding, we\u2019ve entered some sort of twilight zone.\u201dIt is not clear when this government shutdown, which began on Saturday, will end. Congress is not expected to reconvene until Thursday, and the White House has signaled that the shutdown, which centers on President Trump\u2019s insistence on funding for a wall along the southern border, might extend into 2019.All the while, states are making deals. Utah moved to make sure visitors\u2019 centers at Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks would not immediately go dark. New York is spending $65,000 a day to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open to tourists. Puerto Rico agreed to pay up to $80,000 for two weeks of services at the San Juan National Historic Site. Arizona has agreed to spend about $9,200 a day to make the shutdown \u201cinvisible to visitors\u201d at Grand Canyon National Park, as the governor\u2019s spokesman put it on Monday.Although many parts of the park network were closed or mostly unstaffed, the National Park Service said Monday that it had reached more than 40 agreements with states, concessionaires and partner groups \u201cto provide various visitor services at a number of national parks.\u201d In California, for instance, workers for the State Department of Parks and Recreation are cleaning restrooms and removing trash at Redwood National and State Parks. In Mississippi, the Vicksburg National Military Park is open for \u201cbasic operations\u201d because of a private organization\u2019s donation.Government officials, especially those responsible for tourism and economic development, said they had worried that failing to act \u2014 and allowing parks to remain closed, or open and uncleaned \u2014 would tarnish carefully cultivated reputations and turn off visitors.Carla Campos, the executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, which is a part of the island\u2019s government, predicted that there would have been \u201csevere repercussions\u201d if the territory\u2019s leading attraction had been unavailable. The $80,000 payment to the federal government, she argued, represented \u201ca minimal investment,\u201d even in an area that has been economically battered.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely optimistic about the fact that this will ensure that the visitors who come to Puerto Rico will have the experience that they expected to have,\u201d Ms. Campos said.The frantic negotiations between state and federal officials have their origins in shutdowns past. In 1995, Arizona\u2019s governor threatened to use the National Guard to force the reopening of the closed Grand Canyon park. And some governors were outraged in 2013 when the Obama administration ordered a sweeping closure of the national park system during a shutdown, a decision that they said imperiled rural economies that depend on tourists.The federal government soon reached agreements with Arizona, Colorado, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah to operate parts of the park network, including Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, according to the Interior Department. In a report after the shutdown, the Park Service said that every dollar that states used to reopen parks early had led to about $10 in spending by visitors.The 2013 agreements also created the contemporary foundation of the accords that are being reached now.\u201cThe states that write checks to open the parks make the case that shutting the government down is tough on them,\u201d said Sally Jewell, who helped negotiate the 2013 deals when she was the secretary of the interior. \u201cThe states that would want to keep them open would be those that have a strong economic incentive to do that and run the risk of losing a lot of revenue, like Utah would.\u201dThe Trump administration has adopted a different approach to Park Service shutdowns than the one Ms. Jewell oversaw. The Interior Department\u2019s plan for this year\u2019s shutdown, which called for furloughs of 21,383 Park Service workers, has allowed many areas of national parks, including open-air memorials and trails, to stay open to visitors. But ordinary services, like restroom maintenance, trash collection and snow plowing, are not being offered. Officials have the discretion to close \u201csensitive natural, cultural, historic, or archaeological resources vulnerable to destruction, looting, or other damage.\u201dEven with that discretion, the administration\u2019s strategy has alarmed former officials like Ms. Jewell, who argued that open but largely unmanned parks posed risks to visitors and properties alike.\u201cWe\u2019ve got the worst of all worlds right now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a dangerous situation, and a situation where our nation\u2019s treasures are put at risk. There is now a very small number of law enforcement who can patrol and stop poaching, looting and vandalism, as well as people not realizing the risk and potentially hurting themselves.\u201dBut with no solution in sight, some states regard their stopgap agreements with Washington as the only feasible solution.\u201cSymbolically, while we\u2019re watching government at its worst in Washington, the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America at her best,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said in a radio interview with 1010 WINS. \u201cSo, keeping the torch lit I think is a perfect metaphor while this situation is devolving in Washington.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s government has underwritten Statue of Liberty operations in the past, and he and other governors have been settling into something of a routine for shutdowns. In February, after the second of what would become three government shutdowns in 2018, Arizona\u2019s governor signed an executive order that demanded a state-level plan to keep the Grand Canyon open during future shutdowns.\u201cWhereas,\u201d the order noted acidly, \u201cthis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened \u2014 and unfortunately, it likely won\u2019t be the last.\u201dBut officials across the country said Monday that they did not expect their states to prop up the parks indefinitely, or even with regularity. For now, though, they said the emergency payouts \u2014 technically classified as donations to the Park Service \u2014 are warranted.\u201cThe reality is, we invest monies all the time in places we think are important, and this has allowed us to say, \u2018Well, the federal government is not functional. They\u2019re dysfunctional. We\u2019ll put some money up here to keep the economy going for rural Utah,\u201d Mr. Herbert said.Still, there was little joy in Salt Lake City last week while state officials hammered out the latest deal with their counterparts in the federal government.\u201cI just paused at one point in the call and said, \u2018We\u2019ve gotten pretty good at this,\u2019\u201d Vicki Varela, the managing director of the Utah Office of Tourism, Film and Global Branding, recalled.\u201cWhat a strange thing to be proud of.\u201dReporting was contributed by Jack Healy, Tyler Pager, Campbell Robertson and Liz Robbins.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Could This Be the Year California Sends Four Teams to the N.B.A. Playoffs?", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Since it\u2019s just a few days after Christmas, I thought now would be a good time to check back in on the N.B.A. Christmas, after all, is perhaps the most celebrated day of the regular season, and a signal that we are almost halfway through it.As Marc pointed out, all four teams have winning records. Here\u2019s his quick take on where each of them stands:Warriors (23-13) The champs are 15-5 when their four best players (Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson) have been healthy enough to play together \u2014 so no one is deeply worried about them just yet. But Green and Thompson are mired in shooting slumps, depth and advancing age are two more concerns and the team\u2019s marquee off-season acquisition, DeMarcus Cousins, has yet to appear in a single game. It\u2019s a good thing for the Warriors that the rest of the West, while ridiculously deep with competent teams, doesn\u2019t appear to house a consensus threat to the overwhelming preseason favorites.Clippers (20-14)L.A.\u2019s \u201cother\u201d team is thriving amid all the attention (and pressure) heaped upon LeBron\u2019s Lakers. Little was expected of the Clippers before the coming off-season \u2014 when they plan to make their own aggressive free-agent pitches to the likes of Kawhi Leonard and Durant \u2014 but flashes of All-Star potential from Tobias Harris combined with the gritty group of veterans on the roster around him have put the Clippers on a surprising 48-win pace.Lakers (20-15)Kings (19-16) Sacramento ranks up there with the West-leading Denver Nuggets as the league\u2019s foremost Cinderella story as it bids to bring a halt to the league\u2019s longest active run without a playoff berth (12 seasons). Maintaining this level of success will be difficult in a Western Conference in which 14 of the 15 teams harbor legitimate postseason aspirations, but the fast-paced Kings \u2014 led by the speedy point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox \u2014 have already defied doubters for nearly three months after being picked to post one of the league\u2019s worst records.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)It was stunning to see so many arresting images together in one place. I\u2019m a breaking news reporter, but even for people who don\u2019t deal with the news directly, looking back on the year that was can be overwhelming.\u201cThe images here compel us to look closely, look twice, look slowly,\u201d Valeria Luiselli writes in the text that accompany the pictures. \u201cAnd in doing so, we can ask ourselves: How do we react to what we see \u2014 not only in the moment we look at it, but in our daily lives? How does that reaction prepare us for the way we will face the future?\u201dI encourage you to look closely, look twice, look slowly too.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C. Berkeley.A headline on an earlier version of this article misstated a hypothetical scenario for California\u2019s N.B.A. teams.

{"Headline": "Bad Faith, Pathos and G.O.P. Economics", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn professionals who sold their integrity, and got nothing in return.Opinion ColumnistAs 2018 draws to an end, we\u2019re seeing many articles about the state of the economy. What I\u2019d like to do, however, is talk about something different \u2014 the state of economics, at least as it relates to the political situation. And that state is not good: The bad faith that dominates conservative politics at every level is infecting right-leaning economists, too.This is sad, but it\u2019s also pathetic. For even as once-respected economists abase themselves in the face of Trumpism, the G.O.P. is making it ever clearer that their services aren\u2019t wanted, that only hacks need apply.What you need to know when talking about economics and politics is that there are three kinds of economist in modern America: liberal professional economists, conservative professional economists and professional conservative economists.By \u201cliberal professional economists\u201d I mean researchers who try to understand the economy as best they can, but who, being human, also have political preferences, which in their case puts them on the left side of the U.S. political spectrum, although usually only modestly left of center. Conservative professional economists are their counterparts on the center right.But let me leave the pure hacks on one side for a moment, and talk about the people who at least used to seem to be trying to do real economics.Do economists\u2019 political preferences shape their research? They surely affect the choice of subject: Liberals are more likely to be interested in rising inequality or the economics of climate change than conservatives. And human nature being what it is, some of them \u2014 O.K., of us \u2014 occasionally engage in motivated reasoning, reaching conclusions that cater to their politics.I used to believe, however, that such lapses were the exception, not the rule, and the liberal economists I know try hard to avoid falling into that trap, and apologize when they do.But do conservative economists do the same? Increasingly, the answer seems to be no, at least for those who play a prominent role in public discourse.Even during the Obama years, it was striking how many well-known Republican-leaning economists followed the party line on economic policy, even when that party line was in conflict with the nonpolitical professional consensus.But the real test came after 2016. A complete cynic might have expected economists who denounced budget deficits and easy money under a Democrat to suddenly reverse position under a Republican president.What explains this epidemic of bad faith? Some of it is clearly ambition on the part of conservative economists still hoping for high-profile appointments. Some of it, I suspect, may be just the desire to stay on the inside with powerful people.But there\u2019s something pathetic about this professional self-abasement, because the rewards center-right economists long for haven\u2019t come, and never will.So what we\u2019ve learned about economics these past two years is that many conservative economists were, in fact, willing to compromise their professional ethics for political ends \u2014 and that they sold their integrity for nothing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Saudi Regime\u2019s Other Victims", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi has focused attention on Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights abuses. We need to remember all of the thousands in prison.Ms. Zoepf is a journalist who writes about the Middle East.In November 2015, I spent a couple of weeks reporting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It had been less than two years since my last visit to the country and just 10 months since King Salman\u2019s ascension to the throne, but the mood among local activists and intellectuals had darkened considerably. On my final evening, my friend Fahad al-Fahad, a marketing consultant and human rights activist, offered to take me on a tour that, he suggested, might help to explain the new atmosphere.\u201cEvery time my doorbell rings, I think someone has come to arrest me,\u201d Fahad said.But despite continuing anger over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate, too little attention is being paid to the crown prince\u2019s treatment of dissidents inside the kingdom, who often lack the resources to consider lives in exile, and who are now being imprisoned in record numbers. More than 2,600 Saudi dissidents, including prominent scientists, writers, lawyers and women\u2019s rights campaigners, are in detention in Saudi Arabia, according to Prisoners of Conscience, a Saudi group that tracks political prisoners. Most were convicted under the kingdom\u2019s counterterrorism laws, receiving sentences for such nonviolent offenses as \u201ccriticizing the royal court\u201d and \u201cridiculing religious figures.\u201d Few of these people are as well known in Western capitals as Mr. Khashoggi was, but their stories are no less important.Saudi Arabia was not always like this. Viewed from afar, Saudi kings may look like one long, undifferentiated line of autocrats. But the degree to which dissent is tolerated has fluctuated over time, depending on the temperament of the ruler and the pressures he faces.Though King Salman\u2019s predecessor, King Abdullah, was often castigated by Western human rights groups, Saudi conservatives attacked him for encouraging public discussion of reform. In 2003, while he was still crown prince, Abdullah initiated a series of meetings that brought together representatives from diverse sectors of Saudi society to examine potential solutions to the kingdom\u2019s problems. After becoming king in 2005, he gave hundreds of thousands of young Saudis scholarships to European and North American universities. By 2010, Saudis were among the world\u2019s most avid users of social media, taking to Twitter and Facebook to campaign for greater rights and freedoms, particularly for women.After King Salman took the throne in January 2015, the pace of arrests accelerated. Executions spiked, reaching levels unseen for two decades. Alongside this crackdown came a deliberate shift in narrative, led by Prince Mohammed, who, within months of his father\u2019s coronation, had been put in charge of oil, economic policy and the armed forces. Public discussion of social reform was sharply reduced. The national conversation about progress was now limited to technology and entrepreneurship. This new emphasis struck many Saudi intellectuals as cynical, calculated to impress Western visitors, who came away from meetings with the crown prince gushing praise.In the 18 months since Prince Mohammed became heir apparent, the message to those inside the kingdom has become clear: The prince\u2019s need to control the narrative is so great that he will brutally suppress not only dissidents but also those who agree with him \u2014 should they dare to express their views in public. The intended message to outsiders is clear, too: Prince Mohammed is Saudi Arabia\u2019s only hope and savior, a visionary bent on dragging his resistant subjects into the future.That narrative is now fraying. The killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a relatively mild critic of the kingdom, has exposed Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government\u2019s intolerance of any kind of dissent. But the thousands of political prisoners should be part of the conversation, too, even if they didn\u2019t write columns for major Western newspapers or were never popular dinner-party guests in Washington and London.Advertisement"}

You can read more about Brad\u2019s impressions from his trip a little farther down in this newsletter.About the Paris Agreement: Three years later, how are we doing?The backdrop for this year\u2019s big United Nations climate talks seemed, at first, a bizarre choice. Diplomats from across the globe converged on Katowice, a city in the heart of Poland\u2019s southwestern coal-mining region, to discuss how the world\u2019s nations could accelerate their efforts to shift away from fossil fuels.Lately, climate-policy makers around the world have been grappling with the fact that even the best-laid plans to tackle global warming will falter if they don\u2019t take into account people who might lose out from a shift to cleaner energy. And Poland offered a sharp illustration of just how difficult that can be in practice.Signs of this transformation were everywhere. In the city center, a 131-foot-high former mine shaft tower now offers sightseers panoramic views of the city center. On the site of a former mining waste dump, the city had built a saucer-shaped arena complex that hosted all the United Nations delegates arriving to debate new details of the Paris climate agreement. Dozens of electric buses prowled the streets.I traveled with a local photographer, Karolina Jonderko, to the Nikiszowiec neighborhood of Katowice, which was built in 1908 to house local coal miners. After the fall of Communism in the 1990s, many of the nearby mines went out of business. The neighborhood was soon racked by joblessness and crime.But local leaders banded together to revitalize the area. Today, we found, Nikiszowiec\u2019s charming cobbled streets have become a popular tourist stop; its brick buildings now house artist workshops and young families.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong community here,\u201d said Grzegorz Chudy, 46, a local artist who moved here ten years ago.Friday is the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, so we\u2019re thinking about cold weather, and home heating.Tuning up your heating system so that it runs more efficiently will help slash both your carbon dioxide emissions and your energy bills. This can make a big difference, since heating accounts for about 45 percent of the average American family\u2019s energy bills, according to the agency.Experts recommend that you hire a technician to tune up your heating system. The contractor will clean the burner so it burns fuel properly; replace parts, if necessary; and test to ensure that the flue and chimney are not blocked.A complete tuneup will set you back at least $100, but it can reduce your heating bill by up to 10 percent, according to the group.If you have a boiler system that relies on radiators to distribute heat through the house, you could consider installing an outdoor reset control, a device that modulates the temperature of the hot water in the radiators based on the temperature outdoors.Beyond tuning up or upgrading your system, the most important thing you can do is to make sure you\u2019re not overheating your home.\u201cIf you\u2019re at home and you feel slightly cold, wear a sweater and appropriate clothes for the season,\u201d Ms. Amann said. \u201cOvernight, most people are comfortable at 63 to 65, with a nice comforter on.

The two shared a stage two weeks ago in Manhattan, at a news conference they organized to announce plans to set up a $100 million fund to investigate corruption and aid people they deem victims of Chinese government persecution.\u201cWe both naturally despise the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Mr. Guo said in an interview last week, referring to Mr. Bannon. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve become partners.\u201dIt\u2019s an unusual partnership between two political gadflies with a common, if overly grand, objective: bringing about the demise of the Chinese Communist Party.One is an exiled businessman who claims to have evidence of corruption at the highest levels of government in China. The other is a former Goldman Sachs banker who delights in lobbing political grenades at what he calls the \u201cparty of Davos,\u201d a band of global elites that he says has undermined America\u2019s interests at home and abroad.Mr. Bannon is, in effect, reprising the role of political provocateur he played before joining the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016. Back then, he was running the conservative news site Breitbart, and helping promote conspiracy theories through the publication of books like \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d which aimed to destroy Hillary Clinton\u2019s White House bid.In an interview in his hotel room two weeks ago, Mr. Bannon, 65, said the new China-related fund he will head, without pay, will gather evidence, share it with authorities \u2014 in the United States and elsewhere \u2014 and publish it in the media. The fund also targets Wall Street banks and law firms, which he says are complicit in China\u2019s misdeeds.The project, he says, is consistent with his populist and nationalist agenda. China\u2019s reckless behavior, he contended, is endangering the global economy, and sapping America\u2019s strength.\u201cAs a populist, this is outrageous,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, noting that American financial institutions have helped back the worrisome global buying sprees of Chinese companies, with cash raised from ordinary people, including government pension funds. \u201cThe elites in this country have to be held accountable. We have to get the facts on the table.\u201dMr. Guo, 50, insists that the fund offers a way to strike back at Beijing. China has pressed the Trump administration to extradite him so that he can face a raft of charges in China \u2014 allegations he strongly denies. Billions of dollars in assets he controlled have been frozen by Beijing. And Interpol, the global police organization, has issued a warrant seeking his arrest. He now travels with a phalanx of security guards, saying he fears for his life.The Chinese Embassy could not be reached for comment. But the Guo-Bannon alliance has alarmed some analysts, who view the two men as purveyors of conspiracy theories fueling anti-China sentiment.\u201cThe problem with these types of reckless, loose-cannon accusations is that they undermine the ability of responsible analysts and policymakers to identify the genuine cases of Chinese wrongdoing and fashion realistic and effective policy responses,\u201d said Michael D. Swaine, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.For Mr. Bannon, the new effort plays to a longstanding and complicated interest in China. As a young naval officer in the 1970s, he patrolled the South China Sea. He also lived for a time in Shanghai, where he ran a small online gaming company. In recent years, he has come to view China as a military threat to the United States, and a fierce economic rival that refuses to play by the rules.It was during his time at the White House, Mr. Bannon says, that he first heard about Mr. Guo. The Chinese billionaire was living in New York, broadcasting allegations of high-level government corruption in China on Twitter and YouTube \u2014 some credible, some outlandish and still unproved. By then, he had also applied for political asylum.Inside the White House, there were disagreements over how to deal with Mr. Guo. Several Western businessmen, apparently eager to cozy up to Beijing, lobbied President Trump to accede to China\u2019s demands, according to people familiar with the talks.Mr. Bannon said he sided with those in the administration who opposed any handover, viewing Mr. Guo as a potentially valuable \u201cintelligence asset.\u201dThey met only after Mr. Bannon was forced out of the White House. Mr. Bannon says he received a call from Bill Gertz, a Washington journalist who has long been critical of China. Mr. Gertz told him that Mr. Guo was scheduled to give a talk in Washington at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. The talk was canceled at the last minute.Over lunch, Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon discussed China\u2019s military capabilities, as well as the financial implications of Beijing\u2019s rule, including what impact the country\u2019s mounting corporate debt might have on its economy. A friendship emerged.\u201cIt was fantastic. He really impressed me,\u201d Mr. Bannon said of his first meeting with Mr. Guo. \u201cWe talked about President Trump\u2019s approach to China, and he went into corruption in the Chinese Communist Party.\u201dMr. Bannon later introduced Mr. Guo to people in the hedge fund community, including J. Kyle Bass, who has soured on China and sought to profit by short-selling the Chinese currency.As Mr. Bannon sharpened his critique of China\u2019s rise, he also began meeting privately with some of America\u2019s leading experts on China, to seek their counsel and outline his agenda. Few welcomed his strident remarks, according to people who attended some of the sessions. But more recently, analysts say, his positions have gotten a warmer reception.\u201cThe tectonic plates are shifting,\u201d says Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cMany analysts would have totally rejected him two years ago. But people are more sympathetic now that engagement with China has been defrocked.\u201dMr. Schell adds, \u201cOn the China question, he\u2019s no longer the skunk at the party.\u201dBut Mr. Bannon is getting blowback from some of Beijing\u2019s friends. On a trip abroad this year to drum up support for nationalist and populist leaders in Eastern and Central Europe, Mr. Bannon says, he was scolded for his positions on China by Milos Zeman, president of the Czech Republic and one of Beijing\u2019s closest allies in the region.\u201cHe threw down on me hard,\u201d Mr. Bannon says. \u201cHe said: \u2018Tell Trump you didn\u2019t learn from Hitler. You can\u2019t fight on two fronts. You can\u2019t take on radical Islam and China. You will end up in the bunker, like Hitler.\u201dA spokesman for President Zeman said that he had challenged Mr. Bannon on American tariffs against China, and that the two men had parted ways in a very \u201ccold atmosphere.\u201dMr. Bannon is unbowed. He has agreed to serve as chairman of the so-called Rule of Law Fund, the $100 million effort that Mr. Guo is financing. The fund plans to publicize its findings and offer financial support to businessmen, government officials and others who run afoul of the Chinese authorities \u2014 including those who flee overseas, like Mr. Guo himself.Mr. Bannon has also joined Mr. Guo in targeting the HNA Group, the huge Chinese conglomerate that borrowed heavily and spent billions around the world, before debt and regulatory pressures forced the company to curb its global ambitions.At their joint news conference last week, Mr. Bannon took the stage at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to say, \u201cLiterally hundreds, if not thousands, of the best and brightest\u201d in China have disappeared, been imprisoned or committed suicide under unusual circumstances and without due process.\u201cToday is about recklessness and accountability,\u201d he added, noting that American financial institutions have close ties to political elites in Beijing. \u201cWho profited off this? Who looked the other way?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Leader Says Party Must Control \u2018All Tasks,\u2019 and Asian Markets Slump", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Facing deepening tensions abroad and anxieties at home, China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, delivered an unabashed defense of his policies on Tuesday, using a key anniversary to argue that his recipe of guided growth under strong Communist Party control must not waver.Mr. Xi made his case to some 3,000 officials and guests gathered in the imposing Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commemorate 40 years since China embarked on far-reaching economic changes after decades of upheaval and malaise under Mao Zedong.\u201cIt was precisely because we\u2019ve adhered to the centralized and united leadership of the party that we were able to achieve this great historic transition,\u201d Mr. Xi said.Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, lasting nearly one and half hours, came at a pivotal, potentially fraught moment in the country, when all the contradictions in its governance appeared in stark relief. Mr. Xi\u2019s political power is as great as that of any leader in decades, yet his party\u2019s tightening of controls over the economy and ever more aspects of society suggest a deep-seated insecurity at the highest levels.Mr. Xi said that a country of China\u2019s size and influence was right to hold \u201clofty aspirations.\u201d\u201cChina will never develop itself by sacrificing the interests of other countries,\u201d Mr. Xi said, but he added that China also would not \u201cabandon its own legitimate rights and interests.\u201dThroughout his speech, Mr. Xi performed similar rhetorical swerves, promising both greater openness and assertiveness, both strong state companies and prospering private businesses.Mr. Xi\u2019s speech risked leaving Chinese officials no clearer about his policy agenda at a time when relations with the United States in particular have deteriorated badly.\u201cWhen everything is a priority, nothing is a priority,\u201d Yuen Yuen Ang, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, who studies China, said by email after watching the speech. \u201cToday, many policy goals in China are in tension with one another. Which ones take precedence? This is what officials will need to know to carry out their work on a practical level.\u201dBut Mr. Xi\u2019s speech on Tuesday was likely to dampen hopes of a breakthrough, said Ryan L. Hass, a former director for China at the National Security Council who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Hass said his Chinese contacts had \u201cdescribed the speech as the place where Xi would send a signal to Trump on his own terms about the market openings and other reforms on the horizon.\u201d\u201cIf those messages were embedded in the speech,\u201d he added, \u201cthey appear to have been well concealed.\u201dMr. Xi warned that the future contained \u201call kinds of risks and challenges,\u201d but he said repeatedly that the party had expertly guided the country thus far and must continue to do so. He emphasized twice that the party had been \u201ccompletely correct\u201d in its embrace of economic overhauls, a remark that brushed over the many internal debates, as well as ups and downs, that accompanied those changes.Mr. Xi called for revitalizing Marxist-Leninist doctrine, a reflection of the party\u2019s fears that it could lose its grip over a younger, increasingly wired and well-traveled generation. \u201cLet contemporary Chinese Marxism shine even more brilliant rays of truth,\u201d he said.According to Julian B. Gewirtz, a scholar at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard, who watched the speech while visiting Beijing, \u201cThis was a speech about the party more than anything else.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether Mr. Xi\u2019s remarks will reassure Chinese private companies, as he has tried in recent weeks to do. Business leaders and economists have complained about meddlesome officials, heavy and capricious tax burdens, restrictions on investment and banks that prefer to channel loans to big state companies that enjoy the patronage of party leaders. They have welcomed Mr. Xi\u2019s promises, but also warned that the economy remains troubled by risks.\u201cOf all the anniversaries related to the reforms \u2014 20 years, 25 years, 35 years \u2014 this 40th anniversary is perhaps the least optimistic I have seen,\u201d said Ding Xueliang, a professor emeritus at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who has long studied China\u2019s reforms.\u201cPeople in very senior positions also have no clear idea of the direction,\u201d he added. \u201cNot a single person in the past half year who I talked with in China, not a single person, said he or she is clear about the next stage.\u201dAdding to the anxiety were signs that the government was tightening the release of local economic data amid a sharp slowdown. Last month, the southern province of Guangdong stopped releasing the results of a monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2014 a survey that takes the temperature of China\u2019s important factory sector \u2014 citing a notice from the National Bureau of Statistics. The bureau said on Tuesday that the province had violated regulations on statistics gathering.In his speech, Mr. Xi repeatedly touted the huge advances China has made since \u201creform and opening\u201d began in 1978, rattling off detailed statistics on personal incomes, education and life expectancy. Gone are the days when food and clothing were rationed, he said.\u201cHunger, food shortages and poverty, which plagued the Chinese people for thousands of years, have been generally left behind,\u201d he said.Mr. Xi has repeatedly promised to ensure that China offers businesses and foreign investors an open, fair market, but many have become skeptical that he will follow through. Instead, many say, Mr. Xi\u2019s drive to extend party control, stifle public debate and defend the state sector have stymied economic liberalization.The occasion of the speech on Tuesday was the anniversary of a party meeting in 1978, when Deng and other veteran leaders who had fallen during Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution began to reassert their power and lay out ideas for restoring the economy after decades of strife.The meeting now features in the party\u2019s heavily mythologized history of that time as a watershed, although it was only years afterward that \u201creform and opening up\u201d became an official party formula.Before Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, Chinese economists who favor market reforms had openly voiced frustration with what they said was the slow, muddled pace of change. They appear likely to be disappointed, and even worried.\u201cWe\u2019re sincerely hoping that this big meeting will be able to sound a clarion call for deepening reform,\u201d Xiang Songzuo, a senior economist at Renmin University in Beijing, said at a forum in Shanghai over the weekend.He cited an estimate from researchers at an unidentified official institute who concluded that China\u2019s real rate of economic growth this year could be just 1.67 percent, or even lower. That projection is at the very low end of economists\u2019 estimates, but Chinese growth is widely believed to be lower than official estimates, which forecast an expansion of 6.5 percent this year.If there was no strongly reformist call from leaders, Professor Xiang said, \u201cMy final conclusion will be that China\u2019s economy is headed for a plight that will last for a considerable time and be very, very difficult.\u201d He did not respond to emails or messages after Mr. Xi\u2019s speech.Albee Zhang contributed research from Beijing, and Ailin Tang from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cleaning the Congressional Stables", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe House Democratic class of \u201919 is planning a major push on voting, ethics and campaign finance reform. All that stands in the way is the Senate. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.From petty grifting to allegations of treason, the early Trump era has offered a survey course in how to diminish public faith in democratic institutions. All signs are that the coming years will prove even more instructive.Which is why it\u2019s crucial for Democratic lawmakers to stay focused on and fired up about their emerging, much-hyped crusade to clean up Washington.Inspired by the rolling spectacle of Trumpian corruption, Democrats ran hard on a midterm message of reform. They pitched an overhaul of the nation\u2019s political system built around a trio of broad aims: improving access to and the integrity of the voting system, strengthening ethics laws and slashing the influence of big money.Enter H.R. 1, a comprehensive package of revisions to current political practice that House Democrats are looking to introduce in the opening weeks of the next Congress. While the details are still being hashed out, H.R. 1 will attempt to: establish nationwide automatic voter registration; promote online voter registration; end partisan gerrymandering; expand conflict-of-interest laws; increase oversight of lobbyists; require the disclosure of presidential tax returns; strengthen disclosure of campaign donations; set up a system of small-donor matching funds for congressional candidates; and revive the moribund matching-fund system for presidential campaigns. A plan for repairing the Voting Rights Act will move along a separate track.The package is, by design, ambitious. Now is not the time to piddle with closing this loophole and improving that reporting rule, say reformers. Such a change wouldn\u2019t stem the flood of outside money deforming the political system, but it would give candidates an alternative way to run \u2014 and provide not-so-rich Americans a greater sense that their voices can be heard. It is the foundation on which other anti-corruption efforts rest, reformers say, with a warning that if lawmakers don\u2019t address this problem, their credibility will remain in the toilet.At this point, the hunger for reform is so fierce among the Democratic base that the caucus will need to work to temper expectations. While H.R. 1 is near the top of the to-do list of the incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the package will take a while to make its way to a floor vote. At least five committees have oversight of pieces of it, and even among Democrats there are competing visions for various provisions that must be worked through. Democratic House leaders are hoping to get a bill passed early in the year. And then it is likely to go nowhere fast.Realistically speaking, enacting even pieces of a bill like H.R. 1 is more of a medium- to longish-term legislative goal. But this does not diminish the urgency of passing the package in the House as a declaration of Democrats\u2019 commitment. Its champions seem to grasp this. Mr. Sarbanes expressed optimism that serious revisions could be achieved within a couple of election cycles \u2014 but only if Democrats move quickly to get people fired up and then \u201ckeep the pressure on.\u201dEven the most ethically bankrupt politician can spout drivel about \u201cdraining the swamp.\u201d For the next couple of years, Democrats\u2019 challenge is to keep this issue hot enough to make life uncomfortable for reform foes like Mr. McConnell \u2014 and to make clear to voters what must be done if they want to take this crusade beyond one chamber of Congress.An earlier version of this editorial referred incorrectly to one of the proposals. It would promote online voter registration, not early and online voting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Huawei Arrest Tests China\u2019s Leaders as Fear and Anger Grip Elite", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The arrest of one of China\u2019s leading tech executives by the Canadian police for extradition to the United States has unleashed a combustible torrent of outrage and alarm among affluent and influential Chinese, posing a delicate political test for President Xi Jinping and his grip on the loyalty of the nation\u2019s elite.The outpouring of conflicting sentiments \u2014 some Chinese have demanded a boycott of American products while others have expressed anxiety about their investments in the United States \u2014 underscores the unusual, politically charged nature of the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to counter China\u2019s drive for technological superiority.In part, that is because Ms. Meng, 46, is so embedded in that establishment herself.She is one of China\u2019s most prominent businesswomen \u2014 well-traveled, fluent in English, the heir apparent to a global technology firm that is a source of pride for both ordinary Chinese and the ruling Communist Party.She is also the daughter of the company\u2019s legendary founder, Ren Zhengfei, who built the company after a stint in the People\u2019s Liberation Army. That makes her corporate royalty in China \u2014 the equivalent of someone like Sheryl Sandberg, if Ms. Sandberg were also the daughter of an American tech pioneer such as Steve Jobs.\u201cHer arrest will have phenomenal repercussions in China,\u201d said Tao Jingzhou, a corporate lawyer in Beijing.\u201cThe wealthy have already been worried for a long time about their safety and their wealth in America,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the U.S. is going to pursue corruption and extraterritorial laws, that will increase.\u201dThough Mr. Xi\u2019s status as China\u2019s paramount leader is unchallenged, his management of the economy and relations with the United States had come under criticism before Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, with some blaming him as pushing overly ambitious policies that aggravated the Trump administration and provoked the trade war.Others said Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest would embolden those who have long suspected that the United States is determined to block China\u2019s rise. \u201cThis will just confirm everyone\u2019s worst suspicions about the U.S.,\u201d said one retired businesswoman with family ties to the party leadership, speaking on condition of anonymity.Deng Yuwen, a political analyst in Beijing, said conservative forces in the Chinese government and society could use Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest to resist concessions as trade talks unfold in the next few months.\u201cIf the U.S. makes an example of Huawei, the conservative nationalist forces in China and also the military will be very unhappy, and that will make it even more difficult to make compromises with the United States,\u201d he said.\u201cIn the short term, the United States might gain from playing this card, but in the longer term, it doesn\u2019t gain from this,\u201d Mr. Deng added. \u201cThis will make it harder for the reformers to speak up.\u201dMr. Xi has not publicly commented on Ms. Meng\u2019s detention, but the Chinese Foreign Ministry has objected forcefully and demanded her release. A spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Washington needed to explain why Ms. Meng was being held and accused Canada and the United States of violating her rights.On Friday, a Canadian prosecutor said Ms. Meng had \u201cdirect involvement\u201d in a scheme in which Huawei used a Hong Kong company to make transactions in Iran and do business with telecom companies there. Banks cleared financial transactions for Huawei, inadvertently doing business with the Hong Kong company, the prosecutor said.In a statement, Huawei said it had \u201cevery confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion.\u201dBut Chinese social media has lit up with commentary on American wickedness. Many users have maintained that Ms. Meng has essentially been abducted by the United States, and argued that Chinese are no longer safe anywhere. Others have accused the United States of overreach, asking why Huawei\u2019s activities in Iran should be subject to American laws.In one widely distributed video, an investment consultant named Chen Shouhua drops an iPhone on the floor and smashes it with a hammer. He calls for a nationwide boycott of Apple products in an accompanying article.\u201cDuring the Sino-U.S. trade war, let\u2019s not buy any American products and let\u2019s not travel to the United States,\u201d wrote another internet user.The backlash against the United States can be traced in part to national pride in Huawei, which is seen in China as a homegrown corporate success story \u2014 a local firm that has bested foreign rivals to become one of the world\u2019s dominant manufacturers of telecom hardware and other cutting-edge technology.Based in the southern city of Shenzhen, it employs about 180,000 people around the world, and Huawei phones are the most prized possessions of tens of millions of Chinese, far outselling the iPhone in China.While foreigners may be interested in whether Ms. Meng was traveling on a Chinese passport, \u201cfor the Chinese public, it doesn\u2019t matter. We know she is the daughter of Ren Zhengfei. That is enough,\u201d said Yu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \u201cThis is China\u2019s best company.\u201dWu Xinbo, a professor of international studies at Fudan University, said many Chinese will see Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest as part of an attempt by the United States to force China to continue manufacturing low-end consumer goods and prevent it from moving up to produce more advanced and valuable products.People in China are aware that Washington considers Huawei to be an arm of Chinese intelligence and has cited security risks in urging allies around the world to avoid its equipment. But they think that is unproven and unfair.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to kill Huawei,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cTo kill Huawei is like killing Boeing.\u201dOne young entrepreneur, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not seem to understand that going after Huawei would be seen as an insult by many Chinese. But he indicated that many in the Chinese elite were worried about the deteriorating relationship between China and the United States.After Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, he said, his friends joked that they would no longer be able to send their children to American boarding schools and would have to invest in the Chinese education system instead.China\u2019s state-controlled news media has exercised restraint since the start of the trade war, refraining from a full-throated campaign of anti-American propaganda. But there has been an uptick of such rhetoric since Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest.Hu Xijin, the editor of The Global Times, one of the nation\u2019s most nationalistic outlets, wrote that the arrest amounted to \u201ca declaration of war\u201d against China.\u201cWe call on the Chinese government and society to offer moral support to Huawei, and Chinese diplomats to offer timely assistance to Meng,\u201d the newspaper wrote in an editorial. \u201cWe also support Huawei in its legal battle with the U.S. to prove its innocence and thwart America\u2019s plot to throw the company off track.\u201dWang Xiaodong, a Communist Youth League researcher and prominent nationalist writer, suggested the government go further and retaliate by detaining Americans.\u201cThey can make up a criminal charge to arrest Ren Zhengfei\u2019s daughter,\u201d he wrote in a social media post, referring to Huawei\u2019s founder. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we make up some criminal charges so we can arrest all Americans in China?\u201dWhile Mr. Wang is known for his heated rhetoric, experts said a similar kind of retaliation was not out of the question.\u201cIf I was a U.S. tech executive,\u201d said James A. Lewis, the director of the technology program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to China for a while.\u201dAn earlier version of this story gave an incorrect age for Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei.

{"Headline": "New Google Campus Accelerates Tech\u2019s March Into New York", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle said on Monday that it planned to create a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. The internet company\u2019s push into one of Manhattan\u2019s most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of New York\u2019s biggest occupants of office space, allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than 14,000 over the next decade.\u201cLaw, medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at New York University who studies the city\u2019s economy.The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John\u2019s Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet.Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.Other big tech companies quickly followed. Amazon and Facebook each now have more than 2,000 employees in New York, while Apple and Salesforce each employ more than 1,000. LinkedIn has a large office in the Empire State Building, and IBM chose New York as the base for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Since 2009, jobs in tech and advertising in New York have increased 31 percent to 360,600, while financial-services jobs in the city increased about 12 percent to 475,500, according to an analysis of federal data by Ken McCarthy, principal economist at the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. By contrast, the education and health sectors employ about one million people in New York, while the hospitality industry employs 465,800, according to his analysis.Mr. McCarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer, meaning any bank employee is counted as finance. But New York\u2019s traditional industries \u2014 banking, retailing and consulting \u2014 have also added thousands of tech jobs. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers, including many in new fields like data science, blockchain and machine learning.And New York\u2019s tech sector is accelerating. Over the past year, the share of New York postings on the job site Indeed increased nearly 13 percent for tech jobs and just 2 percent for finance and accounting jobs. About 5 percent of all New York jobs posted on Indeed are now tech related, the site said, compared with 3 percent for finance and accounting.That growth has made San Francisco, which is a gateway to Silicon Valley, a sort of sister city to New York. As a result, the air route between them is one of the nation\u2019s most competitive and heavily trafficked.\u201cThere is more economic connectivity between New York and San Francisco than between New York and any of the declining upstate cities,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Google has expanded quietly and has not asked for public subsidies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government,\u201d William Floyd, Google\u2019s head of external affairs in New York said this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it by the dint our own work.\u201dAnd some in Manhattan are wary that Google and other businesses will begin to spread into historic neighborhoods.\u201cMy concern is that with Google\u2019s concentration in that area, it\u2019s going to pull in even more intense pressure for office development, particularly tech office development, in adjacent neighborhoods like the Village and East Village, where we are seeing it happen already,\u201d said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.Mr. Berman said he did not oppose Google\u2019s expansion in Hudson Square, which in the past decade has transformed into a commercial district, with many of its lofts and factories converted to offices for more than 1,000 companies, many in technology, advertising and media. Today, more than 50,000 people work in the neighborhood, and thousands more have made their home there following a 2013 city rezoning that allowed residential development.But Mr. Berman said the growing demand for offices has led to the demolition of historic buildings, pushed out longtime businesses and residents, and resulted in modern office towers that are out of character with the rest of the neighborhood.Chelsea has also witnessed rapid development over the past decade as it has mostly shed its working class roots and identity as a hub of gay night life. It still maintains large public housing projects, but is dotted with art galleries, new condominiums and expensive restaurants.In response, Google invested in local nonprofit organizations and said it would pay for a ferry stop at Pier 57, where it is renting office space, earning some plaudits from local elected officials.\u201cIn terms of buying the new buildings, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not chasing anyone out,\u201d said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been awfully good neighbors in Chelsea.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting from New York, and Ed Shanahan from London.Advertisement"}

Given that India imports more goods than it exports, the effects are potent. Any increase in cost, any factor discouraging companies from hiring, strains a country in which one in five people survive on no more than $1.90 per day, according to the World Bank.\u201cIndia is a country that is very vulnerable to the fallout to the readjustment of global interest rates,\u201d said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist at Columbia University, and a former chief economist at the World Bank.Concerns are mounting about rising debt levels as the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashes spending aimed at winning popular support ahead of next year\u2019s elections. Worries fester over bad loans choking a banking system still dominated by the government.All of this has combined to prompt investors to yank their money out of India, pushing the rupee down.In Gujarat, Mr. Modi\u2019s home state, and a center of business, many local industries require imports to make their wares \u2014 especially petroleum products. Gujarat\u2019s largest city, Ahmedabad, a dusty, traffic-choked metropolis of six million people, is home to factories that produce plastics, from packaging materials to the film covering greenhouses.Many of the necessary petroleum products have risen in price by as much as 35 percent. At the same time, a glut of plastics factories worldwide has prevented producers from raising prices, hurting profit margins.\u201cWe are very much affected,\u201d said Jigish Doshi, president of the Plastindia Foundation, an alliance of plastic industry trade groups that collectively represent more than 50,000 plastics companies across India.Mr. Doshi\u2019s own company, the Vishakha Group, makes plastic pipes used for irrigation. The fall in the rupee has lifted the cost of the raw materials by 15 percent over the last year. \u201cWe are slowing our production,\u201d he said.Gujarat is also a major source of dyes used for coloring textiles and plastic household goods. The fall in the rupee has supplied Indian exporters a competitive advantage, reducing the price of their wares in dollar terms.So has the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods. Indian companies are gaining orders from American manufacturers seeking alternatives to Chinese suppliers, said Bipin Patel, a director at Jay Chemical Industries Ltd., which operates four dye-making factories in Ahmedabad and exports to some 75 countries.But the raw materials used to make dyes have risen in price, cutting Jay Chemical\u2019s profit margin in half. That trend may still be unfolding.\u201cThe rupee is unsustainable,\u201d said Sebastian Morris, an economist at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. \u201cIt can fall quite a bit more.\u201dAt a Mercedes dealership in the center of Ahmedabad, where the most expensive model, the Maybach S 650 sedan, sells for 35 million rupees (more than $486,000), sales staff fret that the weaker rupee has inflated the costs of the vehicles. The top models are imported from factories in Germany.Two blocks away, on a patch of garbage-strewn dirt within view of the dealership\u2019s spinning Mercedes logo, some 600 people live without electricity in shacks fashioned with boards, plastic tarps and sheets of corrugated aluminum. Women scrub pots using water delivered once a day by a municipal tanker. Children pound sticks in the dirt for lack of toys.Most of the families are migrants from villages who survive as so-called ragpickers, earning less than $3 a day as they scour city streets for discarded materials they can sell \u2014 plastic bottles, scraps of paper, pieces of metal.Laxman Gohel, a 38-year-old father of two, saved enough from ragpicking to open a tea shop. He boils water over a charcoal fire, making sales of about 1,500 rupees a day (about $21). But the price of charcoal has more than doubled over the last year, leaving him with perhaps 300 rupees in daily profit. He cannot pass on the costs.\u201cThese poor people cannot pay me more,\u201d he said.Across an alleyway, Shahbaz Ansari, 17, works part time repairing truck tires at his father\u2019s roadside stall. He is in his final year of high school. After graduation, he imagines a job inside an air-conditioned office.Mr. Gohel scoffed. \u201cDo you have money to pay a bribe to get a job?\u201d he said. \u201cNobody gets a job after 12th grade.\u201dEven the children of middle-class homes worry about declining opportunities.As they sipped fresh juice procured from a sidewalk stand, four students enrolled in a three-year college program in business administration expressed fears that the program may not deliver them to their desired management jobs.\u201cThe rupee is falling day by day,\u201d said Vatsal Thakkar, 18. \u201cWages are falling, so I\u2019m thinking about going to Canada.\u201dThirty miles northwest of Ahmedabad in the town of Kadi, the Singh family\u2019s fortunes are firmly tethered to their land.Last year, torrential rains destroyed their cotton cop. This year, an insect infestation has cut it by half.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Singh\u2019s wife, Sonal Ben, stood in the 95-degree heat, pulling puffs of cotton from the plants that have flowered, and depositing them into plastic bags. Mr. Singh will use his tractor to haul the crop to a trader in town.The diesel that fuels his vehicle has increased in price by one-fifth. Yet when he brings his crop to market, he cannot recoup the additional costs.\u201cThe traders decide on the price,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t decide.\u201dThe traders themselves insist they are themselves at the mercy of global forces, accepting whatever price is dictated by commodity pits from New York to S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cNow, we are losing money,\u201d said Prahlad Bhai Patel, owner of a cotton mill in Kadi.Ordinarily, Mr. Patel\u2019s company sells half the product to domestic factories that spin cotton, and exports the other half to China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Pakistan.Lately, he just piles up bales at a loading dock, waiting for better days. The price for his exports is now too low to cover his costs, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s 2018 Venture Capital Binge Could Turn Into a Hangover", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsChina\u2019s venture capital party may be about to get quieter.This year, for the first time, Chinese start-ups raised more cash than their Silicon Valley counterparts, notching up $56 billion in six months. But the excitement may be cooling as the year ends, thanks to tougher regulation and a slowing economy. A shakeout could easily follow.It has been a blowout 2018. For the first half of the year, a study released this week by the data provider Preqin and Insead business school suggests that China beat the $42 billion raised in the United States by some way. That\u2019s largely thanks to a huge funding round for Alibaba\u2019s financial affiliate, Ant Financial, as well as some other chunky efforts. But it\u2019s a high-water mark regardless. As is, perhaps, SoftBank\u2019s mooted move to place a team in China to help spend its giant Vision Fund, after years of investing remotely.The coming months look less exuberant. The likes of SoftBank and Singapore\u2019s Temasek still have plenty of money to plow into splashy names like the news and video-sharing app ByteDance. Others are less enthusiastic, if figures for China-focused venture funds are anything to go by. In the 11 months to mid-November, around 70 such funds raised just over $15 billion, Preqin estimates; that compares to $40 billion or so raised by 330 funds in all of 2016.All of this suggests increased nerves. The vast majority of Chinese unicorns that listed this year, including the takeaways-to-taxis app Meituan Dianping and the smartphone-maker Xiaomi, are now underwater. Just a small fraction of those $1 billion-plus companies, including video-streaming companies Huya, Bilibili and iQiyi, have risen above their initial public offering prices. Rocky starts like that of the Alibaba-backed parenting site Babytree, which debuted last month at a valuation below its last funding round, won\u2019t help.What most of this year\u2019s debutantes have in common is that they bet on local consumers, one way or another. But those shoppers look more fretful. Changes to rules on education, fintech and gaming have only added to the strain. Weaker companies may fall by the wayside.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a National Security Investigation of Huawei Set Off an International Incident", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a message that federal authorities had grown accustomed to hearing: The global bank HSBC belatedly realized it had been processing financial transactions that might have run afoul of American law.HSBC had repeatedly been penalized for helping clients launder money. Now, though, there was a different problem. From 2009 to 2014, HSBC helped the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei move money in Iran, in breach of United States sanctions. This time, the bank said, it had a good excuse: Huawei, and one of its top executives, tricked HSBC into handling the business.The details of the criminal charges against Ms. Meng, filed under seal, remain murky. But court filings in Canada and interviews with people familiar with the Huawei investigation show that the events leading to her arrest were set in motion years ago.They grew out of an Obama administration national security investigation into Chinese companies \u2014 including Huawei \u2014 that act as extensions of the country\u2019s government, according to the people familiar with the investigation. The focus only recently shifted to whether Huawei, and specifically Ms. Meng, deceived HSBC and other banks to get them to keep facilitating business in Iran. Former federal prosecutors said pursuing Ms. Meng, 46, for alleged bank fraud proved to be a better line of attack than trying to build a case on national security grounds.American national security experts believe China has bolstered its economy \u2014 now the world\u2019s second largest \u2014 by stealing corporate, academic and military secrets. Among the concerns is that Chinese telecommunications equipment could be used to spy on American citizens. The top United States intelligence agencies told senators this year that Americans should not buy Huawei products.Counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors began exploring possible cases against Huawei\u2019s leadership in 2010, according to a former federal law enforcement official. The effort was led by United States attorney\u2019s offices in places where Huawei has facilities, including Massachusetts, Alabama, California, New York and Texas.As they investigated Huawei, F.B.I. agents grew concerned that company officers were working on behalf of the Chinese government, according to current and former federal officials.But criminally charging Huawei or its executives for espionage or other security crimes was not likely to be simple. Former federal prosecutors said doing so often risked exposing the sources of confidential information. As a result, they said, prosecutors often look to bring more conventional cases involving crimes such as bank fraud. Think of it as the Al Capone strategy: Prosecutors went after the notorious gangster by charging him with tax evasion.That is where HSBC came in.While American companies are legally restricted from doing business with people and institutions in countries under United States sanctions, nothing stops Huawei from doing so. But if an international bank like HSBC moves money through the United States on its way to or from Iran, that potentially violates American law \u2014 which is what HSBC executives were apparently worried about with Huawei and Skycom.Huawei sent Ms. Meng \u2014 a daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei \u2014 to try to assuage HSBC\u2019s concerns. In August 2013, she gave a PowerPoint presentation to HSBC officials in which she denied that Huawei was connected to Skycom. She also said Huawei had complied with American sanctions and would not use HSBC for any transactions in Iran, according to Canadian court filings.While Ms. Meng\u2019s presentation was in Chinese, Huawei later sent an English version to the bank. \u201cHSBC has been working with Huawei for a long time and has a deep understanding of Huawei\u2019s history of growth around the world,\u201d the presentation said. \u201cWe have been and will continue to be transparent.\u201dThe presentation was kept on file at HSBC. Several of the bank\u2019s risk-assessment committees relied on it to justify continuing to do business with Huawei. By 2014, the bank had unwittingly cleared more than $100 million in transactions with Skycom in Iran, according to federal prosecutors.In 2015, HSBC appeared to have a change of heart about doing business with Huawei. The bank\u2019s reputational risk committee met in New York on April 15 and decided not to do business with Huawei\u2019s American subsidiary.In the documents, the executives said ZTE should follow the example of a rival company, called F7. American officials concluded that was a reference to Huawei, prompting them to intensify their scrutiny of the company, according to a senior Obama administration official.By early 2017, HSBC and the court-appointed monitor inside the bank had disclosed the Iran transactions to federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, according to a person briefed on aspects of the federal investigation. HSBC provided the prosecutors with Ms. Meng\u2019s 2013 PowerPoint presentation. HSBC said this week that it was cooperating with the government and was not under investigation itself.In April last year, Huawei learned of the investigation when prosecutors subpoenaed one of its American subsidiaries, according to the Canadian court documents.Federal prosecutors concluded that Huawei secretly controlled Skycom and used it to dodge international sanctions in Iran from 2009 to 2014.This summer, the prosecutors decided to file criminal charges against Ms. Meng \u2014 fulfilling their yearslong goal of going after Huawei executives for allegedly acting as an extension of the Chinese government.Prosecutors filed the charges, under seal, on Aug. 22, and a federal judge in Brooklyn signed a warrant for Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest. The charges focused, at least in part, on her allegedly tricking at least four banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, into facilitating the company\u2019s Iranian transactions.While Ms. Meng\u2019s main home is in Shenzhen, China, she regularly traveled to Canada; she and her husband own two houses in Vancouver. The authorities figured it was only a matter of time before she traveled there, and the United States and Canada have an extradition treaty.On Dec. 1, Ms. Meng flew from Hong Kong to Vancouver International Airport, where she stopped for a 12-hour layover before flying to Mexico. As she got off the plane, the Canadian police arrested her.The United States is seeking her extradition, but federal prosecutors haven\u2019t unsealed the charges against her.Much of what is known about the charges comes from a three-page letter that the Brooklyn prosecutors sent to their Canadian counterparts on Dec. 3. Court filings by the Canadian authorities largely rely on the facts provided by the United States. The filings were made public during Ms. Meng\u2019s bail hearing this week.In their three-page letter, the prosecutors argued that Ms. Meng had lied to banks about Huawei\u2019s connections to Skycom to keep doing business in Iran. They said her 2013 presentation to HSBC \u201ccontains multiple material misrepresentations as to the nature of Huawei\u2019s business in a high-risk jurisdiction.\u201d A spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn declined to comment.Federal authorities have 60 days from Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest to file extradition papers in Canada.David Martin, one of Ms. Meng\u2019s lawyers in Canada, did not respond to requests for comment. During the bail hearing, he said Ms. Meng\u2019s presentation to HSBC had been prepared by Huawei\u2019s legal team. He said his client was innocent and planned to fight extradition.In China, online chat forums and social media are buzzing with ire toward the United States and Canada. The Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese media outlet, has floated the idea of a boycott of Canadian tourism and products like Canada goose jackets.Alexandra Stevenson, Kate Conger and Edward Wong contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

President Trump and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, agreed last Saturday to the 90-day trade truce, during which time there would be no additional tariffs as the two sides talk.\u201cI don\u2019t know, by the way, that this necessarily spills over into the trade talks,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, adding that he doubts it will stall the negotiations. \u201cI think it\u2019s a separate track.\u201dMr. Kudlow said he remained optimistic that China\u2019s car tariffs would \u201ccome down rapidly\u201d and that Mr. Xi would make good on commitments made to Mr. Trump. The Trump administration has said that China promised to purchase $1.2 trillion in additional goods and services over the next several years, and that it has expressed a willingness to address concerns about protection of American intellectual property.It is possible, Mr. Kudlow said, that the 90-day window for negotiations could be extended if the talks are constructive.\u201cThe president has indicated if there\u2019s good solid movement and some good action, he might be willing to extend the 90 days,\u201d he said.The timing of the Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest has raised questions about whether the White House was briefed by the Justice Department before Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi met for dinner at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina last weekend. In a separate interview on Fox Business Network, Mr. Kudlow said that the arrest caught the White House by surprise. \u201cPresident Trump did not know; none of us knew, as a matter of fact,\u201d he said.The United States has questions about links between Huawei and Chinese security agencies and the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, is a former army engineer who has become one of China\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs. American officials are pressing other countries not to enter into deals with Huawei on developing fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless service networks.Current and former Trump administration officials have compared the Huawei case with that of ZTE, although the extent of Huawei\u2019s violations was not immediately clear.Ms. Meng was expected to appear in court for a bail hearing in Vancouver on Friday as she awaits extradition to the United States.China has demanded her immediate release and called her treatment a \u201cgross violation of human rights.\u201dDespite the trade truce, federal officials continued to move aggressively against Beijing over its trade practices. On Friday, the United States International Trade Commission, an independent federal investigatory agency that reports to several cabinet departments, unanimously ruled that American manufacturers have been \u201cmaterially injured by unfairly traded imports\u201d of Chinese aluminum alloy sheets used in a range of consumer goods.The Department of Commerce had previously imposed steep duties on imports of common alloy aluminum sheet from China. Since the investigation was initiated earlier this year, imports of aluminum alloy sheets have dropped 90 percent, the department reported.Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

So much for the idea, common on the right, that this is the most pro-Israel administration ever.Powers that maintain a reputation as reliable allies and formidable foes tend to enhance their power. Powers that behave as Trump\u2019s America has squander it.But leave that aside and consider the Trump presidency from a purely Israeli standpoint. Are Israelis better off now that the U.S. Embassy is in Jerusalem? Not materially. The move was mostly a matter of symbolism, albeit of an overdue and useful sort. Are Israelis safer from Iran now that the U.S. is no longer in the Iran deal and sanctions are back in force? Only marginally. Sanctions are a tool of strategy, not a strategy unto themselves.What Israel most needs from the U.S. today is what it needed at its birth in 1948: an America committed to defending the liberal-international order against totalitarian enemies, as opposed to one that conducts a purely transactional foreign policy based on the needs of the moment or the whims of a president.From that, everything follows. It means that the U.S. should not sell out small nations \u2014 whether it was Israel in 1973 or Kuwait in 1990 \u2014 for the sake of currying favor with larger ones. It means we should resist interloping foreign aggressors, whether it was the Soviets in Egypt in the 1960s, or the Russians and Iranians in Syria in this decade. It means we should oppose militant religious fundamentalism, whether it is Wahhabis in Riyadh or Khomeinists in Tehran or Muslim Brothers in Cairo and Ankara. It means we should advocate human rights, civil liberties, and democratic institutions, in that order.Trump has stood all of this on its head.Is any of this good for Israel?If you think the gravest immediate threat to Israel is jihadist Hezbollah backed by fundamentalist Iran backed by cynical Russia, the answer is no.If you think the gravest middle-term threat is the continued Islamization of Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 gradually transforming the country into a technologically competent Sunni version of Iran \u2014 the answer is no.If you think that another grave threat to Israel is the inability to preserve at least a vision of a future Palestinian state \u2014 one that pursues good governance and peace with its neighbors while rejecting kleptocracy and terrorism \u2014 the answer is no.And if you think that the ultimate long-term threat to Israel is the resurgence of isolationism in the U.S. and a return to the geopolitics of every nation for itself, the answer is more emphatically no.Advertisement"}

Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.Does Bush\u2019s passing cause you to rethink the way you viewed him when he was in office?Also, the complete absence of malice. Bush 41 was probably the last president who refused to govern in a state of remorseless partisan war with his opponents. Obviously that wasn\u2019t true of his political campaigns, particularly against Mike Dukakis in 1988, but it did typify his time in office. It\u2019s almost hard to imagine that we could recover that style of politics.With that in mind, what are you looking forward to when Democrats take over the House come January?Anything you hope Congress will or won\u2019t do?I say this with some reluctance, ideologically speaking. I think a lot of huge infrastructure projects are boondoggles of dubious long-term economic value \u2014 even if they create jobs while they are being built. And, as we\u2019ve learned from the Second Avenue subway misadventure, it\u2019s easy to inflate costs massively when the taxpayer is footing the bill and government isn\u2019t controlling the costs.That said, every time I go through Penn Station I\u2019m reminded of how awful our rail lines are next to every other developed country. And any time I fly from JFK to Hong Kong or another Asian destination I feel as if I\u2019m departing from the 20th century and arriving in the 22nd. So, yes, infrastructure.We haven\u2019t talked about global warming in a long time. Any reactions?I\u2019m less clear, say, that we should attribute events like the devastating forest fires to climate change alone as opposed to a host of additional causes, including too many people living in fire-prone areas (and often causing the fires), as well as poor forest-management practices.I\u2019m also skeptical that we have any genuinely practical solutions right now to climate change \u2014 at least solutions that don\u2019t create environmental or political problems of their own. \u201cDo something\u201d may be an emotionally satisfying statement, but it\u2019s a lousy guide to policy.Worst possible response is to gut the existing regulations and then just say, \u201cWait and see.\u201dOne of the reasons I\u2019m in the \u201cDo something\u201d camp is because there are plenty of strategies that would be helpful even if they didn\u2019t turn out to do much over the long run for the global warming. We already mentioned mass transit, controlling overdevelopment of beaches and other fragile areas. Reducing car emissions makes the air better. Encouraging the solar heating industry and wind power gives us an economic boost.And if I go on I will wind up once again pointing out that the worst possible approach is the one the president is taking \u2014 overturning the existing anti-warming regulations and shrugging his shoulders as if the whole issue was slightly less important than the weekend golfing schedule.We spend a lot of time jointly beating up on Trump: Is there anything he\u2019s doing that you\u2019d want to praise with a little holiday-season cheer?\u2026. thinking.\u2026. thinking.What about you? Anything to like?But here goes: that was the tackiest White House Christmas display ever. Of all time. It looked to me as if Derek Zoolander had been brought in as style consultant. And that he, in turn, had subcontracted the task to Imelda Marcos. It looked like a staging for an avant-garde version of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s \u201cBodas de Sangre.\u201d It looked \u2014 if looks could sing \u2014 as if \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d were being performed by Ozzy Osbourne just as he bit the head off a bat. It looked as if John Bolton had been chosen to perform an exorcism, sadly not on the president.Otherwise: pure class!On the Trump plus side, the National Football League will be happy to know that, thanks to the president, I have developed a modest affection for professional sports. You have to live in Trumpland all week, but on the weekends you can turn it all off and watch people tossing balls around.

{"Headline": "\u2018Already an Exception\u2019: Merkel\u2019s Legacy Is Shaped by Migration and Austerity", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOutside, 2,500 protesters shouted: \u201cMerkel must go!\u201d Inside, 120 people \u2014 more polite but scarcely less hostile \u2014 had come to challenge the chancellor on her legacy, which on this November afternoon was mostly reduced to one thing: her 2015 decision to welcome more than a million migrants into Germany.\u201cYou said we would manage,\u201d one man said, quoting Ms. Merkel\u2019s now famous mantra back at her. \u201cBut we\u2019re not managing.\u201dAs Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic Party gathers this week to choose her successor as party leader \u2014 and the likely future chancellor of Germany \u2014 the values she embodied through 13 years in power are in danger. Some now ask whether her leadership, in particular on migration and economic austerity, helped plant the seeds of the forces now tearing Europe apart.Ms. Merkel has pledged to finish out her term, which ends in 2021. But even if she defies the political obituary writers, the time in between is likely to be less than a victory lap for a chancellor who has been the face of stability in Germany and Europe, for better or worse.\u201cI know my face is polarizing,\u201d Ms. Merkel conceded in Chemnitz. That is true in Athens, Budapest and Rome as well.Ms. Merkel has been both chancellor of Germany and the leader of Europe. She steered her country and the continent through successive crises as she helped Germany become Europe\u2019s leading power for the first time since two world wars.Ms. Merkel allowed Germans to be proud again, but on her watch the old demons of nationalism stirred back to life, too. The European Union she fought so hard to preserve is assailed by populist leaders.Those contradictions rest at the core of the Merkel legacy. As German chancellor, Ms. Merkel oversaw a golden decade for Europe\u2019s largest economy, which expanded by more than a fifth, pushing unemployment to the lowest levels since the early 1980s.As the United States was distracted by multiple wars, Britain gambled its future on a referendum to leave the European Union and France failed to reform itself, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Germany was mostly a haven of stability.But her decision to embrace more than a million asylum seekers unsettled that cozy status quo. Outside Germany, the austerity she and her longtime finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble imposed on debtor countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and, especially, Greece sowed misery and resentment that fester to this day.Some, like the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, compare Ms. Merkel\u2019s austerity politics to the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed punitive economic measures on Germany after World War I, humiliated the country and fanned the flames of populism.\u201cThis is now what is feeding the political beasts,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said.Ms. Merkel\u2019s legacy is more fragile.She gave power a female face, and some say she softened politics and made it easier for her country to resume its historic dominance in Europe. She was careful never to boast about what had been regained. But she also failed to instill in her people a sense of responsibility and solidarity for fellow Europeans.Her modest and moderate governance style, absent ideology and vanity, is the polar opposite of that of the strongmen now strutting the world stage. Her Germany \u2014 that \u201cvulnerable hegemon,\u201d as the intellectual Herfried M\u00fcnkler calls it \u2014 became a beacon of liberalism.But like her friend and ally President Barack Obama \u2014 America\u2019s first black president, who was succeeded by President Trump \u2014 Ms. Merkel will be judged by what comes next.\u201cAngela Merkel personifies the best Germany we\u2019ve ever known,\u201d said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European Studies at Oxford University. \u201cShe managed Germany\u2019s rise to once again become Europe\u2019s leading power. But she failed to prepare Germans sufficiently for what that means.\u201dOn a sunny afternoon in June 2006, Ms. Merkel was standing at the window of the chancellery in Berlin, waving to the crowd of soccer fans below who were making their way to a gigantic outdoor screen.An avid soccer fan herself, she had been chancellor for only seven months when Germany hosted the men\u2019s soccer World Cup \u2014 and when, across the country, German flags began fluttering proudly from car mirrors and apartment windows.The German team came third that year. But the tournament soon entered folk memory as \u201cthe summer fairy tale\u201d \u2014 the rebirth of a liberal German patriotism in a country where national pride had long been taboo.\u201cThat fledgling national pride that had been kept down for so long was allowed to come out, because at the very top was someone who was incredibly sensitive,\u201d said Evelyn Roll, one of Ms. Merkel\u2019s biographers.Or as Ines Pohl, the editor in chief of the public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, put it: \u201cAngela Merkel allowed Germans to be proud again.\u201dMs. Merkel has never been one for rousing speeches. (\u201cWe had those kinds of speeches 70 years ago,\u201d Ms. Roll said. \u201cHer lack of talent and interest in this department was a good thing.\u201d)She never boasted that Germany got what it wanted after summit meetings (though it mostly did). But as exports and domestic demand boomed, Germany prospered and so did Ms. Merkel\u2019s popularity ratings.Some say her status as a double outsider \u2014 a woman who had grown up in the East succeeding in a world of Western, mostly male politicians \u2014 ultimately changed Germany.Gregor Gysi, a fellow Easterner and political opponent from the Left party, said that spending half her life under Communism gave her a visceral thirst for freedom \u2014 but also made her more socially conscious than other Western conservatives.Over the decade that followed, she nudged her country and her conservative party to the left: New parents obtained generous new benefits, nuclear power was abandoned and same-sex marriage became legal.\u201cMerkel knows a different form of social and societal equality,\u201d Mr. Gysi said, adding of her former center-left rivals: \u201cThat made her so much more open to adopting ideas from the Social Democrats.\u201dIt helped that she could be an incredibly skilled, even ruthless, tactician.\u201cI know something about coalition politics,\u201d an aide to David Cameron recalled her telling Britain\u2019s then prime minister in 2010, when he entered a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, but your junior partner will be destroyed.\u201dIndeed, now in the third so-called grand coalition with the Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel\u2019s habit of taking inspiration from (and credit for) their ideas has left the party a shadow of itself.It has also opened her own party to challenges on its right flank, leaving room for the emergence of the nationalist Alternative for Germany, which capitalized on her decision on asylum seekers.Nine years after the 2006 World Cup, Germany\u2019s summer fairy tale had a short-lived sequel.Ms. Merkel\u2019s own image as the austerity chancellor had troubled her, she told her biographer Stefan Kornelius. In the throes of the migrant crisis, she showed neighboring countries a more generous Germany. It was a moment of redemption for her nation.The French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and his British counterpart Margaret Thatcher had both worried about a resurgence of \u201cbad Germans.\u201d Ms. Merkel\u2019s greatest achievement, Ms. Roll said, was that \u201cshe came to represent the good Germans.\u201dHer 2015 decision won her admiration from far beyond her own political camp.\u201cIn this world where more and more walls are being built, literally, she did the right thing,\u201d said Claudia Roth, vice president of the German parliament and a member of the Greens. \u2018\u2018She had principles.\u201d\u201cIt won Germany incredible respect \u2014 this image of a friendly humanitarian Germany, a Germany that protects,\u201d Ms. Roth said. \u201cShe marked that image.\u201dThree years later, the party is the third largest in the federal parliament and sits in all regional parliaments, too.\u201cGerman populism is perhaps not her child,\u201d said Henrik Enderlein, the dean of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. \u201cBut it is a child of the Merkel era.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s decision on migration was the most defining moment of her chancellorship. It softened her image. But in her immediate neighborhood, coming deep in a lost economic decade, it did not quite have the healing effect she intended.To some, it cemented her reputation as dictating terms to the rest of a reluctant Europe, particularly in a south that had borne the brunt of the continent\u2019s dual economic and migration crises.Even before the migration crisis arrived, the debt crisis provided a pivotal test for a chancellor at the helm of a newly dominant Germany.And it led to criticism that Ms. Merkel, while leading humbly, was no less the hegemon \u2014 prioritizing German interests; manipulating European Union institutions to Germany\u2019s abiding benefit; turning southern countries into captive export markets; tightening the hold of German banks.Was hers a European Germany, one that saw Europe\u2019s interests as its own? Or a Germany that ultimately wanted a German Europe?Many economists, and even Mr. Obama, called for looser policies, but Ms. Merkel held firm. The debate still rages over whether greater flexibility would have restored growth faster, as her critics contend, or whether fiscal restraint was needed to safeguard the euro currency, as Ms. Merkel and her supporters argued.The real missed opportunity, observers say, was to use the crisis to propel a more far-reaching build-out of European Union institutions, which remain unprepared for the next financial meltdown.If there was ever a time to make a bold push to complete the institutions of the eurozone, this was it, said Joschka Fischer, a former German foreign minister.\u201cAn Adenauer or a Kohl would have done it,\u201d Mr. Fischer said. But Merkel, who had grown up behind the Iron Curtain and without the Western pro-European mind-set, \u201cwasn\u2019t there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cHer European conscience was not fully formed yet.\u201dThe absence of vision at that time is \u201cthe biggest minus on her record,\u201d said Mr. Garton Ash, of Oxford.But if Ms. Merkel\u2019s upbringing meant that her European consciousness took longer to form, it perhaps made her bolder in other areas, like standing up to Russia and Mr. Trump, as well as her decision not to close Germany\u2019s borders to migrants.\u201cOf course you can build walls,\u2019\u2019 said Gerald Knaus, the founding chairman of the European Stability Initiative, who has advised Ms. Merkel on migration for over a decade.\u201cBut she always made clear: \u2018I don\u2019t build deadly walls,\u2019 \u201d he recalled her saying. \u201cShe grew up behind one.\u201dOne early verdict on Ms. Merkel\u2019s legacy will be pronounced on Friday, when delegates of her Christian Democrats gather at a party congress in Hamburg and vote for a new party leader.\u201cIf A.K.K. succeeds Merkel, it would be her masterpiece \u2014 another woman, confident, unpretentious, who continues her liberal course,\u201d Mr. Knaus said.In Germany, too, politics has become noisier and nastier. Open sexism has entered the chamber with Alternative for Germany, said Ms. Roth, the vice president of the parliament.\u201cMerkel has been the target of countless attacks, gendered attacks, sexualized dirt,\u201d Ms. Roth said.\u201cShe is the enemy, and the way she has been personally attacked as a woman is awful,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would not happen to a white man. And still, she remains upright, chin raised, and keeps working.\u201dSome have begun to referring to Merkelism, a modest but steadfast liberalism built on consensus rather than confrontation, as a recipe for democratic governance in the 21st century. Others fear that Merkelism will disappear with her.\u201cShe is so unvain that she does not overly care about leaving behind a blueprint for the West 4.0,\u201d said Mr. Kornelius, her biographer. \u201cShe primarily wants to preserve what she can.\u201dShe has prevented crises rather than carried out visions, Mr. Kornelius said, and has been reactive rather than proactive. \u201cBut that is incredibly valuable at a time when we are dealing with questions of our liberal order in an unraveling world \u2014 and with leaders like Donald Trump.\u201dTo her fans she is a reminder of a time when liberal democracy was expanding across the world.Today, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Germany can feel like a liberal island in a growing sea of illiberal forces. She has not changed \u2014 the world around her has.\u201cShe is already an exception today,\u201d Mr. Knaus said. \u201cI hope she is not a relic of an era that is coming to an end.\u201dEven some of her fiercest enemies look with trepidation to a future without her.\u201cShe was a catastrophe,\u201d said Mr. Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, \u201cand she will be missed, because who comes next will certainly be worse.\u201dChristopher F.

Powell, said he now understands he lacks the authority to do so.One of the advisers, Mick Mulvaney, the incoming acting White House chief of staff, made his comments on Sunday, echoing comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Mr. Trump previously told advisers that Mr. Powell will \u201cturn me into Hoover,\u201d a reference to the Great Depression-era president Herbert Hoover. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly criticized the Fed for increasing interest rates, criticism the president doubled down on this weekend even as he denied suggesting firing Mr. Powell.In response to a question about whether Mr. Trump believes he has the authority to fire Mr. Powell, Mr. Mulvaney said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the president did not believe he did.\u201cI did speak with the treasury secretary last night about a bunch of things, including the lapse in appropriations and the shutdown, and he did mention that to me,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is set up to be independent of the presidency,\u201d Mr. Shelby said. \u201cAlthough I disagree with Powell at times, I\u2019ve been on the Banking Committee longer than most people ever have, and I chaired it.

{"Headline": "France Suspends Fuel Tax Increase That Spurred Violent Protests", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Trying to quell its most serious political crisis, the government of President Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday that it would suspend the gasoline tax increase that had set off three weeks of increasingly violent protests in Paris and around France by the so-called Yellow Vest movement.\u201cNo tax warrants putting the unity of the nation in danger,\u201d said Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe after briefing lawmakers in a closed-door meeting in Parliament. \u201cOne would have to be deaf and blind not to see or hear the anger,\u201d he said.\u201cThis anger is rooted in a profound injustice, that of not being able to live decently from the fruits of one\u2019s work, of not being able to provide for the needs of one\u2019s children,\u201d he added.The Yellow Vest movement has been named for the roadside safety vests adopted by its protesters as a symbol of their distress and despair. The gas tax increase, which was scheduled to start in January and was equivalent to up to 25 cents a gallon, proved to be a tipping point in a country that already has some of the highest taxes in Europe.Largely organized over social media, the movement is as diffuse as it is distrustful of authority. The government\u2019s announcement of merely a six-month suspension of the gas tax increase \u2014 not a scuttling of it \u2014 left those who have emerged as Yellow Vest spokesmen wary, at the very least.\u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied, because the French have been struggling for years now,\u201d Benjamin Cauchy, one of the spokesmen, said on BFM TV, a television news channel. \u201cThis could have been done weeks ago, and we would have avoided all these problems.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Our demands are much bigger than this moratorium,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018We want a better distribution of wealth, salary increases. It\u2019s about the whole baguette, not just the crumbs.\u201dLionel Cucchi, a spokesman in Marseille, told BFM TV that protesters were prepared to continue.\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t be back in six months,\u201d he said of the gas tax. \u201cThere will be more demonstrations. We remain mobilized.\u201dAlong with a suspension of the gas tax increase, the government said it would also delay new vehicle inspection measures and increases in electricity rates that were intended as part of Mr. Macron\u2019s plans to transition France toward cleaner energy.But to the protesters, Mr. Macron is concerned about the end of the world, while they are worried about the end of the month. They say that their purchasing power has dwindled so much that they have trouble making ends meet in rural areas and in the suburbs and exurbs of big cities.There, working people need cars to get to jobs and conduct their daily lives, unlike many wealthier city dwellers who are unburdened by the gas tax increase and form much of the core of Mr. Macron\u2019s support.The protests, responsible for millions of dollars in property damage and lost tourism revenue, have highlighted a deep socioeconomic split in the country.On one hand, there are a few prosperous cities, where many residents strongly supported Mr. Macron in the 2017 election; on the other, there are the struggling rural areas and small towns of the postindustrial era that either voted for candidates on the extremes or did not vote at all.It is that second France that has come into the streets against Mr. Macron in recent weeks, furious over his perceived tilt toward the wealthy and demanding his resignation. The French president has until now tried to sail above the discontent, deploying lofty abstractions and determined to discourage the French from using cars.That response has gone down badly in the provinces, with protesters erecting mock presidential palaces at traffic circles and demanding his resignation.Although the protests have been modest in size, they have been unusual in their spontaneous and widespread nature, and have received enormous support on social media and near-constant coverage by the French news media.The movement has so far failed to name representatives who could negotiate with the government. A meeting between Mr. Philippe and moderate members of the Yellow Vests was canceled on Tuesday after two of them said they had received death threats from within their own movement.The demonstrations spread on Monday to high school students, who blocked more than 100 schools to protest some of the government\u2019s education policies and to show support for the Yellow Vests movement.Members of Mr. Macron\u2019s party have warned against the rigid, solitary governing style of the president, while the far-right and far-left leaders, Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, have called for the dissolution of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament.\u201cEmmanuel Macron must question himself,\u201d Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a former Green Party member of the European Parliament and a supporter of the president, said on France Inter radio.\u201cThe moratorium is not enough,\u201d he said of the suspension of the fuel tax. \u201cIt\u2019s not a shame to back away.\u201dProtesters have already argued that the government\u2019s concession would not be enough.\u201cWe have to stop stealing from the pockets of low-income taxpayers,\u201d said Mr. Cauchy, one of the Yellow Vests, on BFM TV. He also asked for increases in the minimum wage and pensions.\u201cWe are not going to drop our guard,\u201d he added, calling for another weekend of protests.Elian Peltier and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland Releases \u2018Sobering\u2019 Contingency Plan for No-Deal Brexit", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe document, published in Dublin on Wednesday, concludes that the Republic of Ireland would have to \u201cfocus on crisis management\u201d in the event of an abrupt divorce by Britain, which would \u201cpotentially involve severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral impacts.\u201d Though it has deep economic ties to Britain, Ireland will remain in the European Union.The plan identifies at least 45 pieces of legislation that would have to be passed by the Irish Parliament to maintain the country\u2019s close relationship to Britain in areas such as security, health, education, border cooperation, tourism and trade. All other parliamentary business may have to be set aside in January to pass these laws, officials said, if London and Brussels cannot agree by then on an orderly Brexit plan.Irish imports and exports depend heavily on trucks crossing by ferry to and from the Island of Great Britain, which acts as Ireland\u2019s \u201cland bridge\u201d to the rest of the European Union. If, after decades of being in a common market, Britain and the rest of the bloc erect customs and regulatory controls between them, Ireland could suffer severe disruption to supply chains, including vital sources of food and medicine.Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, described the plan as \u201cstark\u201d and \u201csobering.\u201d It lays out the need for a range of legal and regulatory measures to deal with such a crisis, including the reintroduction of inspections at Irish ports and airports of goods originating in Britain.But it pointedly omits any consideration of restoring physical checks on goods or people crossing Ireland\u2019s 310-mile land border with Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom. The lack of physical checks on that border has contributed greatly to the success of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which ended 30 years of violence during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.Mr. Coveney indicated that instead of planning for a hard border, Ireland would seek to hold Britain to the commitment Prime Minister Theresa May has made to a \u201cbackstop\u201d arrangement, which would prevent the reintroduction of border checks.\u201cWe are committed in all circumstances to preventing border infrastructure, but the conversations we would have to have and the responsibility on London to do that \u2014 given the commitments they have given and the obligations they have towards protecting the Good Friday Agreement as a co-guarantor of the agreement \u2014 are significant,\u201d Mr. Coveney said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be helpful in this document to be dominated by the border debate.\u201dPrime Minister Leo Varadkar told journalists on Thursday that he hoped border checks could be avoided for a time, even after a hard Brexit, unless British trading conditions, currently fully aligned with the European Union, began to diverge. Ireland has no plans for a hard border, he said.\u201cWe have made no preparations whatsoever for physical infrastructure or anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly do not want it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201dBritain\u2019s withdrawal is scheduled to take effect on March 29, but Mrs. May is struggling to win support in the British Parliament for the agreement she negotiated with the European Union, in large part because many lawmakers object to the backstop. They argue that it would leave Britain tightly tied to the union for the foreseeable future, and impose trade rules that divide Northern Ireland from the rest of the country.Ireland\u2019s contingency plan addresses security problems that could arise with a no-deal Brexit, including Britain\u2019s possible departure from the European policing union, Europol. The European Arrest Warrant, which operates under Europol, greatly reduces the difficulty of extraditing criminal suspects, including political militants, between countries.\u201cPolicing cooperation is very close now between the police on both sides of the border, and between Dublin and the Home Office, and I think those ad hoc contacts would probably continue even if the U.K. leaves Europol,\u201d said Prof. Edward Burke, an expert on Irish and British security matters at the University of Nottingham.\u201cBut I think you would see problems if they lose the European Arrest Warrant,\u201d he added. \u201cIt would put routine extradition cases back in the courts, where they\u2019d quickly become log-jammed.\u201dProfessor Burke said he believed that Dublin would attempt to preserve the status quo on the border in the early states of a chaotic Brexit, by allowing trade to flow as before. But that would not be a long-term solution for the European Union, which would be concerned about unregulated products entering its territory.Although the Irish government says it will not make any plans for new border infrastructure, its contingency plan acknowledges the need for new health and standards checks on goods and animals entering and leaving the island.The trade in live animals and food products is a major contributor to the economies of both Ireland and Northern Ireland, with some ingredients for processed items \u2014 such as Irish cream liqueurs, processed meat and dairy products \u2014 crossing the border several times before being ready for market.If the worst-case scenario remains on the table in January, hundreds of new customs and veterinary inspectors will have to be hired to operate new facilities already planned at ports and airports.Economists have warned that a chaotic Brexit without a deal would cut the value of the British pound, raising the cost of imports. That could badly damage Ireland\u2019s small manufacturers and exporters, who depend heavily on trade with Britain.A hard Brexit would be an \u201cexceptional economic event, which will be met with exceptional measures to support the continued operation of the Irish economy and our international trading links,\u201d the Irish contingency plan says.Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Ireland and Britain would remain linked through their Common Travel Area agreement, which predates their membership in the European Union, and that gives citizens of both countries extensive rights to live, work and travel in each other\u2019s territory.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nashville\u2019s Star Rises as Midsize Cities Break Into Winners and Losers", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNashville and others are thriving thanks to a mix of luck, astute political choices and well-timed investments, while cities like Birmingham, Ala., fall behind.NASHVILLE \u2014 Forty years ago, Nashville and Birmingham, Ala., were peers. Two hundred miles apart, the cities anchored metropolitan areas of just under one million people each and had a similar number of jobs paying similar wages.Not anymore. The population of the Nashville area has roughly doubled, and young people have flocked there, drawn by high-paying jobs as much as its hip \u201cMusic City\u201d reputation. Last month, the city won an important consolation prize in the competition for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters: an operations center that will eventually employ 5,000 people at salaries averaging $150,000 a year.Birmingham, by comparison, has steadily lost population, and while its suburbs have expanded, their growth has lagged the Nashville area\u2019s. Once-narrow gaps in education and income have widened, and important employers like SouthTrust and Saks have moved their headquarters. Birmingham tried to lure Amazon, too, but all it is getting from the online retail giant is a warehouse and a distribution center where many jobs will pay about $15 an hour.Nashville and the other Amazon also-rans, like Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis, are thriving because of a combination of luck, astute political choices and well-timed investments. At the same time, Birmingham and cities like it, including Providence, R.I., and Rochester, are falling further behind.Last week, for example, Apple said it would invest $1 billion in Austin, Tex., and could eventually employ 15,000 people in the area, up from 6,000 now. Like Nashville, Austin is a booming state capital with a prominent university and it has a lively music scene.Nashville started with advantages. But local leaders also made some smart decisions like merging the city and county government in the 1960s, allowing Nashville and its suburbs to work together rather than at cross-purposes. And in the 1990s, when many downtowns across the county were struggling, the city built a convention center, a hockey arena and a new home for the Country Music Hall of Fame.By contrast, economic misfortune and poor choices have hobbled Birmingham. Once a center of steel production, the city suffered when that industry declined in the 1980s because of foreign competition and corporate bankruptcies. Local leaders tried to pivot by luring banks and insurers, but that bet soured during the financial crisis, and the city hasn\u2019t recovered the jobs it lost then.\u201cA place like Birmingham hasn\u2019t fallen off the map, but it\u2019s been bypassed by these places that have moved into this more clearly defined second tier,\u201d said Adam Kamins, an economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s treading water, and treading water tends to not be enough.\u201dAsk Ralph Schulz, president of Nashville\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, why this city has done so well and he begins with the Civil War. Nashville surrendered early, allowing it to avoid the destruction that befell many Southern cities. Union troops used the city as a logistics hub, which laid the groundwork for its postwar economy.Nashville stood apart in other ways, too. The city was less dependent on manufacturing, in part because being Tennessee\u2019s capital brought lucrative \u2014 and relatively recession-proof \u2014 public investments. Its colleges and universities, anchored by Vanderbilt University, earned it a reputation as the \u201cAthens of the South.\u201dThe music business, which grew out of a 19th-century publishing industry, gave the city an international reputation, while the growth of Hospital Corporation of America in the 20th century turned the city into a health care hub.As a result, Nashville had a diversified economy and an educated work force that left it well positioned for the 21st century. But success wasn\u2019t inevitable. As recently as the 1990s, the city was portrayed as a backwater on the variety show \u201cHee Haw.\u201dRonald L. Samuels, a local banker and civic leader, recalled being asked about Graceland \u2014 which is in Memphis \u2014 when visiting New York with the Chamber of Commerce in the 1980s.\u201cWe had to answer the \u2018Where\u2019s Nashville?\u2019 question many times,\u201d Mr. Samuels said.Beginning in the early 1990s, though, political, business and nonprofit leaders tried to promote Nashville. State and local leaders adopted a regional approach to economic development to recruit companies such as Bridgestone, Nissan and UBS. Tennessee overhauled its community college system and work force development efforts to align better with the jobs being created.Starting under Mayor Phil Bredesen, who later became Tennessee\u2019s governor, the city invested in big projects that helped revive downtown, a key part of the city\u2019s success.Economists disagree about what policies are most effective at helping cities grow \u2014 or if policies matter much. Some, such as Michael Porter of Harvard and Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, have emphasized the importance of cultivating a \u201ccreative class\u201d of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. Others, such as Jan Rivkin of Harvard, stress the importance of civic leadership. Pretty much everyone agrees that having an elite university is a big advantage.Whatever the exact ingredients, Nashville hit on a winning recipe. The urban renewal that began under Mr. Bredesen turned into a boom after the Great Recession, which, thanks to Nashville\u2019s diverse mix of industries, was comparatively mild here. The Gulch, a former rail yard and industrial district, was transformed into a vibrant neighborhood full of hip bars, luxury condominiums and boutique hotels.Tourism took off, thanks in part to the ABC television country-music drama \u201cNashville.\u201d Some of those tourists stuck around: The number of college graduates younger than 35 nearly doubled over a decade, to 155,000 by 2017.Employers soon followed. Among them are Eventbrite, a San Francisco tech company, and EY, the accounting firm, which last month announced plans to open an office downtown for 600 workers. AllianceBernstein, an investment company, decided in May to move its headquarters to Nashville, from New York, in part because of the big-city-worthy cultural amenities and the small-city cost of living.The company has been flooded with calls from finance industry workers interested in moving to Nashville, said Karl Sprules, an AllianceBernstein executive who is helping lead the transition.In recent decades, the most successful cities have achieved a kind of economic gravity drawing the best jobs and most talented workers. That\u2019s why few economists were surprised when Amazon chose New York and the Washington area for its big expansion.But the effect isn\u2019t limited to a few urban giants. Mark Muro, who researches cities for the Brookings Institution, likened it to a fractal pattern: Look past the top cities and there is another layer of inequality. \u201cNashville is not a superstar, but it\u2019s at the top end of this next echelon,\u201d Mr. Muro said.The success of the superstars and the substars like Nashville has come at the expense of Birmingham and other smaller cities.Birmingham\u2019s great boom arrived a century before Nashville\u2019s, when the region\u2019s iron and mineral deposits helped it become one of the nation\u2019s largest steel producers. But as the steel industry declined across the country, Birmingham struggled to find a replacement.But Birmingham also has some significant assets. It has a research university, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with a top-flight medical school and hospital. Research conducted at the university has helped fuel a budding start-up scene, and an affiliated incubator in a former Sears store, Innovation Depot, is home to more than 100 new companies.Last year, the city elected a young mayor, Randall Woodfin, who has put economic development at the center of his agenda. He has created a Neighborhood Revitalization Fund to fix up homes and demolish dilapidated structures, and wants to use business tax incentives to help lift wages, not just create jobs.\u201cAs a midsize city, we have to be very intentional about diversifying our economy,\u201d Mr. Woodfin said. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting on Amazon or some other company to come in and save Birmingham.\u201dThe question for city leaders is whether they can overcome the economic forces driving inequality among cities.Birmingham\u2019s work force is also less educated than the work forces in other cities of comparable size, and its schools aren\u2019t training workers with the skills they need, the report concluded.Mr. Woodfin faces another challenge: Instead of collaborating, cities and towns in the area often compete against one another. Birmingham proper accounts for just a third of the population of Jefferson County, with cities frequently offering multimillion-dollar tax incentives to lure businesses across town lines.Mr. Sher would like Birmingham to follow Nashville in merging the city and county governments. He noted that Louisville, Ky., saw substantial growth after it did that in 2003.But even as some look to Nashville as an example, they want to avoid repeating its mistakes. Nashville\u2019s boom has brought congestion and soaring housing costs, making the city unaffordable for many longtime residents, particularly African-Americans.\u201cWhat is the policy, other than growth?\u201d asked Paulette Coleman, a local affordable-housing activist. \u201cIf economic growth is only benefiting a small percentage, you just keep getting these widening disparities.\u201dThose concerns raise questions about Nashville\u2019s future. The city has thrived in part by being an affordable alternative to New York and Atlanta. It may soon have to compete with them directly by trying to become a superstar in its own right.In Birmingham, Mayor Woodfin said the city must follow a different path.\u201cI am 100 percent convinced we do not have to be the next Nashville or the next Austin or the next Charlotte,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be the best Birmingham.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conglomerates Will Never Die", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsMarkets can be a costly business. Ronald Coase won a Nobel Prize in economics in 1991 for pointing that out. He said that companies are created to save on transaction costs, and, according to one interpretation, the savings are often large enough to justify pulling together quite diverse businesses.Problems at General Electric and the breakup of United Technologies show why that analysis is only partly right.If the best deal were always the one available in the market right now, the world would look rather different. Companies would rent labor and working space every day. In reality, the cost of constantly negotiating contracts often exceeds the gains from getting the best price on demand. Businesses scale up because they can spread their research, legal and management skills more widely. Bigger firms also save by bulk borrowing and through better tax management.Mr. Coase, like most economists, purposely oversimplified human nature. Normal people could simply say that bigger teams that do many things often work better than smaller, specialized ones. They might call it a cooperation benefit or, being a little more technical, economies of multiple scales.The gains are often subtle. It is hard to measure the value added by the cross-fertilization of ideas, the deepening of a long-term employee\u2019s professional skills, the ready availability of loyal experts and the flexibility on opening and closing businesses. It is even harder to count up the losses sidestepped by having to deal with fewer untrustworthy outsiders and of not being deprived of credit in tough times.Still, those gains are big enough that many have pursued them successfully. The different enterprises of the Japanese zaibatsu, the Korean chaebol and Turkish and Indian groups such as Koc and Tata have profited by working together both formally and informally. The gains of staying close are often especially large in developing economies, where credit, trust, expertise and good government relations are all very costly, if they can be purchased at all.It can work in developed economies too. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway and many private equity groups claim that excellence is spreadable across many product lines. Consumer goods giants like Unilever and Procter & Gamble are essentially built on Mr. Coase\u2019s premise: Paper towels and toothpaste, two product lines at P&G, may seem to have little in common, but there can be synergies in marketing, distribution and competence.Then there are times when Coase-advantages go stale. The American conglomerate United Technologies said on Nov. 26 that it was breaking into three parts after considerable pressure from activist investors, and would spin off its elevator and building parts divisions to shareholders.G.E. provides another example. In the company\u2019s early decades, it gained greatly from spreading its electric expertise over everything from light bulbs and radios to power plants and locomotives. Managers also kept finding synergies in building up related businesses, eventually including health care, plastics and financing.But by the 1980s, the product synergies were fading. Jack Welch, then the chief executive, decided that G.E.\u2019s main Coase-advantage was management expertise. He thought that brilliant buying and selling of companies, regular culls of weak executives and a shared focus on perfection in design and execution would allow the company to expand simultaneously in many businesses, including finance.Mr. Welch was lauded at the time, but he was deeply wrong, especially about finance. The failures of G.E. Capital have deeply wounded the enterprise. G.E.\u2019s market capitalization was well over $500 billion in 2000 \u2014 now, after multiple losses, write downs and divestments, it is less than $70 billion.At least Mr. Welch has company. Efforts to profit from lower frictional financial costs \u2014 whether from raising money, managing risks or pleasing investors \u2014 have poisoned many companies, including a collection of conglomerates. For example, back in the 1970s the quest for savings from buying companies with expensive stock and cheap debt first fueled and then felled such enterprises as ITT and Gulf & Western. More recently, Enron and Tyco suffered because aggressive financing multiplied the damage from vastly overestimating the gains from low-friction management.Stories of conglomerate failure can give the wrong impression. While dreams of financial riches seem to deprive many managers of their common sense, the Coase-effect is crucial to the success of modern economies. Without the ability to bring disparate businesses and skills together, costs in most firms would be higher, revenues lower and many new and improved products would never have been created.All big companies have something of the conglomerate about them, because they do many things. Corporate fashions come and go, and managers of companies like G.E. may fall prey to stultifying complexity and financial overreach. But Mr. Coase was right enough about costs. Diversified enterprises, by one name or another, will play a big role in the business world for a long time.Advertisement"}

Which Will Win Out in 2019?", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoves like Mnuchin\u2019s phone calls to bank C.E.O.s could create a broader crisis of confidence.Sometime in the last couple of months, predictions of a major economic downturn or recession in 2019 went from being a crank view to the conventional wisdom.The real risk is not that insurmountable challenges knock the economy off course. It is that poor leadership converts moderate economic shocks into a crisis.It was the kind of disclosure that risked causing more damage than it was intended to prevent. If a top health official announced that he had convened conversations with top pharmaceutical C.E.O.s and was pleased to learn there were no drug shortages, your first response would not be relief but to ask, \u201cWait, we need to worry about drug shortages?\u201dIt all raises the possibility that if things do get worse, the United States government will be an agent of chaos rather than the source of steadiness and calm it is normally known for during crises.It is a lack of confidence in global leadership that explains this paradox: an economy that is doing this well and yet widespread conviction that things are about to turn bad.The most concrete warning signal is coming from financial markets. But the bond market is generally more closely tethered to economic ups and downs than the stock market, and while it is suggesting slower growth ahead, it is not at recessionary levels.At this point in December 2007, which we now know was the beginning of the Great Recession, the Fed\u2019s target interest rate was 4.25 percent. But the bond market was already pricing in more cuts in the years ahead, with the two-year yield ending the year at 3.12 percent.Most economic and financial indicators are not pointing toward some economic collapse in 2019, but rather to a return to the kind of moderate economic growth that was completely normal from 2010 to 2017.In this story, 2018 has been the aberration \u2014 fueled by a commodity boom and the temporary effects of tax cuts. To the degree there is a market correction and adjustment in business sentiment, it is about realizing that we\u2019re returning to the old new normal.There are some rumblings of things that could go wrong in the financial system. Companies that loaded up during the era of ultralow interest rates are facing high debt burdens. Some may find themselves in bankruptcy. Oil prices have fallen enough that it seems it will be a tough 2019 in energy-producing areas. But the biggest worry for 2019 is not so much that any of these disruptions proves so large as to cause a recession. The real fear is that shaky policy allows small shocks to create a broader crisis of confidence.Beyond the attacks on the Fed and odd communication from the Treasury, there are other risks from Washington. Further escalation of the trade war \u2014 including into the economically consequential automobile industry \u2014 remains a distinct possibility. Divided government could lead to paralysis.It is quite a contrast with the 2008 crisis, when the United States government was stocked with highly experienced economic policymakers and a president who trusted their judgment, when no one had heard of Brexit, and when a trade war seemed unfathomable.It was a key moment in ending the 2008 crisis. Given geopolitical developments since, it is hard to imagine that harmony happening today. It\u2019s easier to imagine conflicting signals and an every-nation-for-itself breakdown of communication.But we\u2019re not there yet. And throughout the expansion of the last nine-plus years, the United States economy has proved stubbornly resilient to challenges, whether the chaos of the eurozone crisis in 2010 or a commodity collapse in 2015.The question is which will prove more important, the economic fundamentals or leadership. And to be an economic optimist means counting on the fundamentals to prevail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rwandan Women Paddle Into the Male World of Fishing", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bysurfacingLAKE KIVU, RWANDA \u2014 In the evening, the green leaves of the verdant hills of Lake Kivu turned black against the orange sky, and a calm settled across the water. And then, out of the silence, came a call: \u201cHere we go! May God watch over us!\u201d It\u2019s a refrain that is a tradition here on Lake Kivu, where for generations men have cast out at sunset on small wooden boats to fish through the night. But that night, it was chanted by women.Zawadi Karikumutima, 32, readied her boat for a night on the water. She was not alone. Several other women loaded wooden rafts with supplies, while their children watched them from the muddy banks, and prepared themselves for the long night ahead. \u201cI am very tired when I come back,\u201d said Ms. Karikumutima as she pushed the boat around in the muddy shore. Sometimes she comes back with enough fish to sell to support her family for weeks at a time. \u201cBut sometimes I return with pretty much nothing,\u201d she said.Some fishermen and women on Lake Kivu cast their nets at sunset and return before dawn to collect their trappings. But that method can be risky: the nets can be tampered with, or the catch scooped up by interlopers in the midnight hours while everyone else is asleep. So instead, many of the fisherwomen choose to spend their nights on the water.But nights on the lake can be uncomfortable and even dangerous, for any number of reasons \u2014 wind and pirates, among others. Last year, as a single mother, Ms. Karikumutima had no choice but to bring her infant baby out on the wooden boat with her at night, lying the baby down on a blanket in the hull of the canoe while she paddled from one net to another in the cold and the rain. The intense physical work and danger that comes with fishing on Lake Kivu, along with reinforcement from traditional gender roles, kept women from fishing for generations, tending to backyard farms instead. But in post-genocide Rwanda, that seems to be changing. On a recent early morning at the collective, the sambaza had just been delivered from the night fisherwomen. Dozens of women at the cooperative meticulously arranged them so that no fish overlapped with another; the idea was to allow the sun to dry all the fish evenly, which happens after about 48 sunny hours. Sold dry sambaza go for a higher price than they do fresh. And in Eastern Rwanda, they form a central part of the edible economy; almost every dish in the restaurants along the lush banks of Lake Kivu incorporates sambaza, but perhaps most tastily as the crispy fried accompaniment to a sunset beer. \u201cDon\u2019t argue with me! It\u2019s 2,000 francs. Dried is 6,000. Cash in person,\u201d Ms. Nyirarvshisha said. She hung up the phone with a humph, and a satisfied smile. Five years ago, Ms. Nyirarvshisha\u2019s life was very different. She\u2019s from the Rwandan capital of Kigali, about a four-hour bus ride away, and took on odd jobs to support her two children. But in just the past few years, women like Ms. Nyirarvshisha have broken into the world of fishing, with a focus on the business side. Though not even five feet tall, Ms. Nyirarvshisha stands out for her bullheaded business style; she\u2019s the top seller among the women in the cooperative.Part of the reason women have entered the world of fishing in recent years has to do \u2014 as so many things do in Rwanda \u2014 with the country\u2019s history.In rebuilding the country, the new government insisted on policies underpinned by the concept of equality, and the slogan \u201cWe are all Rwandans.\u201d That included women.The genocide left Rwanda with a population that was 70 percent female; many women started fishing out of necessity, with so many primary breadwinner killed. But women in Rwanda have also started fishing thanks to changing concepts of gender; post-genocide, Rwandan society suddenly opened to the idea of female labor equality.There is a male leader at the top of Projet P\u00eache \u2014 the only man involved: Robert Ngendahayo. Mr. Ngendahayo, 36, said the reason women were only now entering the fishing marketplace is because for many years, no one fished. \u201cIt was not safe to be out on the boat for many years after 1994. Someone would come and attack you and stab you,\u201d he said. The dark water of the lake at night became a kind of secondary war zone, where the new government controls being installed hadn\u2019t yet reached, and where you could still be killed on the basis of your perceived ethnicity. Mr. Ngendahayo estimates that night activity on the water started up again about seven years after the genocide, and then, only minimally and with caution for another decade, he said.Plus, spending the night on the boat with men was just not considered suitable for women. \u201cWomen farmed instead, and fishing was for men,\u201d said Albert Ngeze. Mr. Ngeze, 57, is a boat builder who bends the wood by hand to make the boats used on Lake Kivu. A former fisherman himself and now one of the oldest boat builders in the area, he has seen firsthand the way that things here have changed. \u201cWhen I was young, and before the genocide, it was impossible to see women fishing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today we are happy for women to join us on the water. I think only a small percentage of men do not understand that. I think this century, everyone must understand that.\u201dToday, Mr. Ngendahayo calls the lake \u201c100 percent safe,\u201d but that\u2019s not entirely true. For one, there\u2019s the wind, which blows hard, especially during March and April. In the middle of the lake, a capsized boat can mean a long wait for help, if it makes it. There are also pirates, who, depending on the security conditions on land in either Rwanda or Democratic Republic of Congo, where there has been armed conflict for over 25 years, will maraud with impunity, leaving the already-poor fishermen and women with nothing, save their lives \u2014 if they\u2019re lucky. As Ms. Mukabideri and Ms. Karikumutima set out with other women, they fell into a rhythm. Once out on the open water, they synchronized, and their chant became a kind of meditation, a hum as powerful as a drum beat, both soothing in its repetition and exciting in its rumble as it bounced off the hillsides.\u201cHere we go!\u201d_____Shannon Sims, Holly Pickett, and Cl\u00e0udia Prat were 2018 African Great Lakes Reporting Fellows with the International Women\u2019s Media Foundation.Advertisement"}

In a radio interview Friday morning, Mr. Orban dismissed opposition to the changes as \u201chysterical shouting.\u201dSince re-entering office in 2010, Mr. Orban has made a series of moves that have set off alarms among European allies and others in Hungary: curbing judicial independence, restricting news media freedom and plurality, and blatantly enriching his business allies. But few of his actions have ignited such anger as the changes to the labor law.The government argued that overtime would remain optional. But analysts said that outside Budapest, where there are few alternative forms of employment, workers are at the mercy of their employers.\u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of workers who are not in a position to say no,\u201d said Janos Kollo, research director of the Institute of Economics at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.Analysts say the labor law changes have struck a rare chord among ordinary Hungarians, including outside the opposition heartland of the capital, Budapest, because the issue affects their daily lives.Balazs Barany of the left-wing party MSZP told the rally on Friday that \u201ca new opposition has been born,\u201d because the protests had united rival political factions in an unprecedented fashion, according to news reports.The wave of discontent \u201creached social categories that didn\u2019t go to demonstrations previously and didn\u2019t necessarily feel concerned by the issues that usually prompt protests,\u201d said Attila Juhasz, an analyst at Political Capital, a policy research institute in Budapest.The government needs Hungarians to accept longer hours because the country is running out of workers.As many as 350,000 Hungarians, or more than 5 percent of the country\u2019s working-age population, are working in another part of the European Union, according to Mr. Kollo.The high level of emigration has led to a significant labor shortage, partly because it has not been counterbalanced by similarly high levels of immigration.In fact, Mr. Orban has repeatedly discouraged foreigners from coming to Hungary through a combination of physical barriers on the border and xenophobic campaigns in the international news media.That rhetoric has bolstered Mr. Orban\u2019s popularity at home. But it has also created \u201cthe impression that it might not be good for people to move to Hungary,\u201d said Csaba Toth, strategic director for the Republikon Institute, a research group based in Budapest.But there is more to the labor shortage, Mr. Kollo said.By placing around 200,000 unemployed Hungarians on government-run workfare programs instead of encouraging them to enter formal employment in the private sector, the government has prevented a large group of potential workers from entering the primary job market.\u201cThere is a great reserve of work force here but the economy either cannot or doesn\u2019t want to absorb it,\u201d Mr. Kollo said.The situation is exacerbated by the country\u2019s low birthrate. Each Hungarian woman gives birth to an average of 1.4 children in her lifetime, well below the rate needed to maintain a population at its existing level.Opponents of the changes argue that they were passed as a favor to multinational companies like German automakers, which have built plants in the country in recent years and whose economic model depends on a cheap and flexible work force.But wages have increased substantially since Hungary joined the European Union, while the minimum wage could increase further within the next year, making Hungary less attractive to foreign investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rocket-Boosted but Going Nowhere Fast: The Navy\u2019s Failed Munitions Programs", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarWhen the Navy retired its last aged battleship in 1992, it pledged to the Marine Corps that it would continue fulfilling one of the warships\u2019 missions: naval gunfire support for troops ashore. More than a quarter of a century later, and after more than a billion dollars spent, the service\u2019s intended replacements \u2014 rocket-assisted GPS-guided shells \u2014 have yet to materialize.The effort has been marked by a string of technological disappointments. Rocket motors failed to ignite. Guidance fins wouldn\u2019t pop out. Antennas couldn\u2019t acquire satellite signals before shells smashed to the ground. In decades of testing, the Navy has been unable to build replacement weapons that reliably worked, much less at an affordable price. This research-and-development failure has resulted in 36 new warships with advanced deck guns, but not the specialized munitions they were designed to fire. The Navy intends to commission 13 more ships the same way and has no immediate plan or clear option for fulfilling its promise to the corps.Officials at the Marine Corps\u2019 Combat Development Command in Quantico, Va., where the service sets its weapons requirements, said the Navy\u2019s current gunfire shortfalls pose a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to amphibious attacks, which at one time required artillery that can reach an adversary\u2019s shore from 40 nautical miles away to support invading forces. The Navy\u2019s current deck guns can only fire as far as 13 nautical miles.The Government Accountability Office has periodically raised questions about why the Navy has not fulfilled its commitment. A 2006 G.A.O. report pointed to the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 inability to agree on what their naval surface fire support requirements should be for more than a decade, and to the Navy setting unrealistically low cost estimates for its proposed rocket-assisted guided shells. Additionally, defense analysts point to the Navy\u2019s prioritization and funding of newer technologies \u2014 notably precision-guided munitions from aircraft \u2014 over naval gunfire. \u201cPriorities in one space can have a chain effect and drive up costs in another program,\u201d making it untenable, said P.W. Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at the New America Foundation. \u201cThe Navy would say it takes naval gunfire seriously, and the Marines would say, \u2018Not seriously enough,\u2019 and the two will never agree.\u201dThe effort to develop a modern replacement has had multiple phases, each an expensive disappointment. Battleships, huge armored ships from a bygone era, were once the Pentagon\u2019s most capable gunfire support ship. They carried turrets with 16-inch-diameter guns that fired 2,000-pound shells as far as 21 nautical miles. In the 1990s, the Navy sought to replace all that bulk and hardware with lighter and more precise shells that could fire from comparatively diminutive five-inch-diameter deck guns on Ticonderoga-class cruisers and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. Those guns fired unguided shells that didn\u2019t reach the distances the Marines required for supporting amphibious assaults. The Navy proposed a conceptual change: a gun firing rocket-boosted GPS-guided shells, dubbed Extended Range Guided Munitions, with warheads initially designed to carry and distribute cluster munitions as far as 50 miles away.When the program started in 1996, the Navy\u2019s contractor, Raytheon, was to deliver the new shells for ships by 2010. In anticipation, the Navy installed updated guns in 2001 that could fire both the older unguided rounds and the Extended Range Guided Munitions. But after 12 years of development and approximately $350 million spent, the contract failed to produce a reliable shell at an affordable cost \u2014 even after the Navy changed the warhead to a simpler high-explosive design. The service shut down the program in 2008. During the same period, the Navy was also experimenting with a similarly designed shell called the Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition, made by Alliant Techsystems. After spending $70 million, the program was canceled in 2007.As the development of new projectiles foundered, the Navy was simultaneously pursuing another concept: a ship with a gun of intermediate size that would fire rocket-boosted shells at targets on land. In the 1990s, it planned to build 32 new destroyers, at the cost of about $1 billion per ship, each armed with two 155-millimeter deck guns. These ships, named for Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, were designed for \u201cland attack,\u201d and their deck guns were to fire heavier shells at farther distances than their predecessors\u2019 five-inch guns.With the ships in production, the Navy then spent $700 million to have BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin develop the Long Range Land Attack Projectile for the Zumwalt deck gun. It also came to nothing. The Navy originally intended to build 32 Zumwalt-class destroyers \u2014 a number that dwindled over time. In 2016, the Navy cut the number of land-attack ships to just three. Sharply unfavorable economies of scale drove the purchase price for the shells above $1 million per shot, rivaling the cost of the Tomahawk cruise missile, which has a 1,000-mile range. The shells became too expensive to buy, and the ammunition program for the Zumwalt-class destroyers was soon canceled. In December 2017, the Navy announced that its \u201cland-attack\u201d ships were \u201csurface-strike\u201d ships that would engage other vessels at sea instead of targets ashore.All three of the failed projectile programs had similar design features and shared a fundamental conceptual problem. \u201cWhen you try to make a rocket-boosted projectile that can steer itself to a target, you basically have built a guided missile,\u201d said Tony DiGiulian, a retired engineer who has studied all these weapons and runs NavWeaps, a website on the subject of naval weapons and technology. One problem with gun-fired guided shells, he said, was that, when fired, sensitive electronics inside the projectile were exposed to exponentially more stress than if they were launched in a traditional missile. Protecting those electronics, DiGiulian said, added to the shells\u2019 cost. \u201cSo why not just build missiles in the first place?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019ll end up with anyway.\u201dNavy officials said they are evaluating a new shell, called the \u201chypervelocity projectile,\u201d that is lighter and narrower and could potentially be fired from the upgraded five-inch guns at targets 40 miles away. The program is experimental and in its early stages, and it is unlikely to produce a viable weapon soon. With a gap in fire support now running beyond a quarter of a century, the Marine Corps said it \u201cencourages continued study\u201d of yet another idea: installing vertically launched missiles on San Antonio-class amphibious ships, a type of ship much larger than a cruiser or destroyer that is meant to launch Marines ashore in landing craft and helicopters and is not typically outfitted with offensive weaponry itself. The Marine Corps did not specify which kinds of missiles could be used for that role.The Navy was even less forthcoming with details about what might come next. In a written statement, Rear Adm. Ronald Boxall, who leads the Navy\u2019s surface warfare division, said the service continues \u201cto monitor developing technologies and adapt to changing requirements, from gun-based systems and advanced projectiles to land attack missiles. We take this partnership seriously and are committed to providing the Marines with the naval fire support they need to fight and win.\u201dThe Navy fired its last major naval gunfire missions during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, when the battleships U.S.S. Missouri and U.S.S. Wisconsin blasted more than 1,100 rounds at a variety of targets in the campaign to drive Iraq\u2019s military out of Kuwait. In what appears to be the sole fire mission ashore since then, the U.S.S. Chafee, a destroyer, shot its single five-inch gun at Somalia in 2007 to support Special Operations forces, according to a speech by Adm. Harry Harris, who commanded the United States Pacific Command until he retired earlier this year.Beyond that mission, little has changed since the Government Accountability Office examined the state of naval gunfire in 1997 and reported that \u201cthe Navy admits that it currently has no credible surface fire capabilities to support forced entry from the sea.\u201dJohn Ismay is a staff writer who covers armed conflict for The New York Times Magazine.

{"Headline": "The Ghost of Trump Chaos Future", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySorry, investors, but there is no sanity clause.Opinion ColumnistTwo years ago, after the shock of Donald Trump\u2019s election, financial markets briefly freaked out, then quickly recovered. In effect, they decided that while Trump was manifestly unqualified for the job, temperamentally and intellectually, it wouldn\u2019t matter. He might talk the populist talk, but he\u2019d walk the plutocratic walk. He might be erratic and uninformed, but wiser heads would keep him from doing anything too stupid.In other words, investors convinced themselves that they had a deal: Trump might sound off, but he wouldn\u2019t really get to make policy. And, hey, taxes on corporations and the wealthy would go down.But now, just in time for Christmas, people are realizing that there was no such deal \u2014 or at any rate, that there wasn\u2019t a sanity clause. (Sorry, couldn\u2019t help myself.) Put an unstable, ignorant, belligerent man in the Oval Office, and he will eventually do crazy things.But market behavior has, until recently, been a different story.But let\u2019s play devil\u2019s advocate here: Does all this Trump chaos matter for the economy, or for the stock market (which isn\u2019t at all the same thing)? At first sight, it\u2019s not all that obvious.And even trade war might not do that much harm, as long as it\u2019s focused mainly on China, which is only one piece of U.S. trade. The really big economic risk was that Trump might break up Nafta, the North American trade agreement: U.S. manufacturing is so deeply integrated with production in Canada and Mexico that this would have been highly disruptive. But he settled for changing the agreement\u2019s name while leaving its structure basically intact, and the remaining risks don\u2019t seem that large.The truth is that most of the time, presidential actions don\u2019t matter much for the economy; short-term economic management is mainly up to the Fed. But when bad things happen, we do need the White House to step up. In 2008 and 2009, it mattered a lot that officials of both the outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration responded competently and intelligently to the financial crisis.Unfortunately, there\u2019s no reason to expect a comparable degree of competence if something goes wrong again.Now imagine how this administration team might cope with a real economic setback, whatever its source. Would Trump look for solutions or refuse to accept responsibility and focus mainly on blaming other people? Would his Treasury secretary and chief economic advisers coolly analyze the problem and formulate a course of action, or would they respond with a combination of sycophancy to the boss and denials that anything was wrong? What do you think?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Peddled on the Streets of Los Angeles: Ice Cream, Hot Dogs, and Fake Social Security Cards", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Among boisterous vendors hawking ice cream, hot dogs and assorted wares from carts in the heart of Los Angeles, an illicit business quietly caters to undocumented immigrants eager to work in the United States. Its purveyors softly call out, \u201cMica, mica,\u201d Spanish slang for the laminated cards they are offering to potential clients.\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d asked a woman on a crowded sidewalk facing MacArthur Park, the epicenter of the trade, clutching a notebook in which she prepared to jot down an order. \u201cShe can get you anything fast,\u201d added a man who was with her.A set of documents \u2014 a Social Security card and a green card \u2014 can be obtained for $80 to $200, depending on the customer\u2019s bargaining power and the quality of the forgery. The fakes are a worthwhile investment for undocumented immigrants, opening the possibility of employment at a restaurant, hotel and many other establishments in the country\u2019s second-largest city and beyond.The failure by Congress to agree on new immigration legislation or viable guest worker programs to meet the demands of the United States economy has ensured the survival of the counterfeit identification industry, which sprouted after lawmakers last passed immigration reform, in 1986. The Immigration Reform and Control Act legalized undocumented immigrants in the country since 1982 and also prohibited employers from hiring unauthorized workers.\u201cOne of the most predictable unintended consequences of our failure to address the demand side of labor migration is to create a robust false documents industry,\u201d said Wayne Cornelius, a migration scholar at the University of California, San Diego.\u201cGood quality false documents don\u2019t come cheap, but migrants consider it a necessary expense to gain access to U.S. employment,\u201d said Mr. Cornelius, who is director emeritus of the university\u2019s Mexican Migration Field Research Program.About eight million undocumented immigrants participate in the United States labor force. A 50-year low in the unemployment rate means there are plenty of jobs for newcomers \u2014 and employers willing to hire them.Norm Langer, president of Langer\u2019s Delicatessen across from MacArthur Park, readily admits that it is likely that he unknowingly employs undocumented immigrants.\u201cThey need me and I need them. There\u2019s nobody else to do the work,\u201d said Mr. Langer, whose 71-year-old eatery, a Los Angeles institution, sits at a corner where the counterfeit trade unfolds and is sometimes captured on its security cameras.Asked if he crosschecks documents presented by new hires, Mr. Langer retorted, \u201cI\u2019m not here to do the government\u2019s detective work.\u201dBoth Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant on the club\u2019s payroll, and Sandra Diaz, a legal resident employed there for three years when she was undocumented, said they used counterfeits with made-up numbers. Two other former housekeepers at the club, who are in the country unlawfully, said they were hired in the same manner.A fifth worker who also came forward this month, Emma Torres, said in an interview that management at the golf club knew her documents were fraudulent when she was hired in 2015, to work first as a housekeeper and later in the kitchen.Her documents were easy to obtain, said Ms. Torres, who is from Ecuador. A fellow immigrant gave her the phone number of a broker, who told her to meet someone at a restaurant who would be dressed in a yellow shirt and cap. Ms. Torres said she gave the person her name and birth date, two pictures and $150. A few hours later, she said, she returned to collect a Social Security card and a green card.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have documents, you don\u2019t get work \u2014 unless you want to be paid cash,\u201d Ms. Torres said.In recent years, peddlers of phony documents have increasingly moved from immigrant enclaves, like Pico-Union in Los Angeles and Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, to private residences and the internet. Production has migrated from primitive printing shops \u2014 with typewriter, scissors and laminate \u2014 to operations equipped with top-notch computers and printers that churn out authentic-looking counterfeits, complete with security features like holograms.The illicit industry also flourishes with the help of social media and sophisticated technology, and some players operate across international boundaries. Payment methods outside the traditional banking sector, such as Venmo, have become common, according to investigators. Marketing is discreet, sometimes over the dark web.\u201cStaying ahead of counterfeiters is a constant battle. We are seeing document mills becoming more complex,\u201d said Christopher Kuemmerle, a Homeland Security Investigations agent at Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles who supervises a document and benefit task force composed of local, state and federal agencies.Last year, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services began issuing green cards with security enhancements, such as embedded holographic images, in an attempt to deter fraud.Because counterfeiters may not be capable of replicating the exact features, their green cards would probably not pass official inspection at United States ports of entry, such as airports. Employers, however, might not be able to tell the difference.But pressure on employers has also mounted, further fueling the counterfeit document boom. The Trump administration has stepped up raids and audits of companies believed to hire undocumented immigrants.Companies that have federal contracts must use E-Verify, an electronic system to snuff out fake IDs. In addition, 22 states mandate that at least some private and public employers use the system. (New Jersey and California are not among them.)Determined to get work, immigrants in the country unlawfully are increasingly acquiring the authentic documents of legal residents or citizens of the United States to elude the heightened screening.Puerto Rico, home to more than three million people with mainly Spanish surnames, has become a hub for networks trafficking in genuine documents, in part because birth certificates there are widely circulated for a variety of uses and relatively easy to make use of. \u201cThis is the market where stolen identities come out of,\u201d said Timothy Henwood, the first assistant United States attorney for Puerto Rico.\u201cOnce you get a real birth certificate from Puerto Rico, you can get a real Social Security card and driver\u2019s license. You assume that stolen identity and integrate into society and the job market,\u201d Mr. Henwood said.In February, Mr. Henwood\u2019s office prosecuted a Dominican national who pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to steal and sell the identities of Puerto Ricans to unlawful residents of the United States. The defendant, Reynaldo Rodriguez-Canario, said he worked with co-conspirators on the mainland who sold Social Security cards and other documents for prices ranging from $500 to $1,300 per set.In Boston, also in February, the United States attorney\u2019s office and ICE announced that a federal judge had ordered sentences ranging from eight months to two years for several people who sold stolen Puerto Rican IDs to undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts.In July last year, 25 people were charged in federal court in Boston with using the identities of citizens in Puerto Rico to obtain documents and public benefits, such as Medicaid, unemployment and housing subsidies, according to the United States attorney\u2019s office in Massachusetts.The counterfeit networks thrive within specific ethnic groups. Homeland Security investigators have encountered mills that produce passports and documents for Chinese nationals. Communication usually happens over WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, which is tough to intercept.\u201cThe targets we are pursuing are driving nice cars, living in nice homes and making a good living. There is little overhead. They are making pure profit,\u201d said Mr. Kuemmerle, the agent at Homeland Security Investigations.Nationwide, the unit\u2019s work to take down document counterfeit rings resulted in 1,258 arrests, 997 indictments and 710 convictions in the 2018 fiscal year.Southern California is the region with the biggest population of undocumented immigrants in the country, and many migrants who cross the border pass through Los Angeles on their way eastward \u2014 and stop at MacArthur Park.During a recent afternoon at the busy park, document sellers solicited customers by brandishing their thumb and indicator fingers wide enough apart to convey the shape of a card.When a pair of police officers appeared, they swiftly took leave of their posts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America Could Lead the Transition to a Digital Currency Reserve", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewAfter spending decades as the dominant global reserve currency, the dollar\u2019s position is being challenged.The greenback\u2019s share of global central-bank reserves has declined in nine of the past 10 quarters, the International Monetary Fund reported in September. The slide is hardly new: It began a decade ago when European leaders attempted to replace the dollar with a euro-based \u201cbasket\u201d of currencies as the common global reserve.But the United States should not fight against the forces of globalization that challenge the dollar\u2019s reserve-currency status. Instead, it must seize the opportunity to incubate technologies that will enable future digital currencies, which could go on to power a transnational currency \u2014 perhaps the best next option for a future global reserve.Committing to this course would provide a check on attempts to supplant the dollar\u2019s role in the global financial system with other sovereign currencies. It would also put the United States at the heart of a more open and equitable financial system.There are lessons in America\u2019s technological history that should inform future policy relating to digital currencies. More than three decades ago the United States government supported the development of the internet. Doing so unleashed huge economic impact on America that can still be seen today in the successes of the nation\u2019s biggest technology companies. The digital financial revolution that the world is on the cusp of has the potential to be just as significant for job creation and economic development.Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, could prove to be as important to commerce as email and text messaging were to communications. New financial systems built on it could help connect people around the world who lack access to traditional banking services. And these innovations could be leveraged by developers in much the same way as entrepreneurs built web services on the internet \u2014 from eBay to Facebook \u2014 with the same enormous impact on the American economy.Countries around the world are racing to lead the next revolution in financial technology. While it is clear that the United States and companies like Coinbase were early entrants in this global movement, it is also true that many nations and individuals are jockeying for leadership. There are currently more than 1,400 digital currencies and tokens available, serving a variety of uses. Central banks from China to Sweden to Uruguay are considering issuing their own.America must maintain its leadership role by leading the way on research and development of cryptocurrency technologies \u2014 just as it did in the early days of the internet \u2014 rather than stifling it. And if it does, it could ultimately build dominant cryptocurrency technologies that become the backbone of the 21st Century financial system.Doing so could yield all sorts of wonderful possibilities. In the 21st century when a national market undergoes a major fluctuation, America could enable an alternative currency. It could make it easier for American farmers to sell to foreign customers without the friction of foreign exchange. And its development agencies, like U.S.A.I.D., could \u201cairdrop\u201d cryptocurrencies to hard-hit regions of the world that lack access to banking infrastructure.That the dollar is under pressure as the world\u2019s reserve currency should only lend more urgency to the endeavor, as America should not come to rely on global cryptocurrency technologies that have been developed by other nations. The United States can retain its leadership role in the global financial system \u2014 but only if it nurtures the development of the technologies that will underpin its future.Brian Brooks is the chief legal officer of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Accuses Chinese Nationals of Infiltrating Corporate and Government Technology", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration ramped up its pressure campaign on Beijing on Thursday, as the Justice Department accused two Chinese nationals with ties to the country\u2019s Ministry of State Security of infiltrating the biggest providers of internet services and boring into government computer systems, including a major Department of Energy laboratory.The Justice Department action also comes amid other Trump administration pressure on the Chinese. The United States helped coordinate the arrest of a top executive of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, on suspicion of committing fraud related to sanctions against Iran. Her arrest, while she was changing planes in Canada, has set off a geopolitical standoff, with China arresting three Canadians on its own soil.Last week, American investigators said that a long-running hack of Starwood Hotels, now part of Marriott International, was a Chinese intelligence-gathering operation. And the United States has taken steps to block Chinese investment and student enrollments in the United States.It is not clear how, if at all, the latest indictment will affect Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to reach a trade agreement with Mr. Xi that would end an escalating tariff war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The United States has set a March 2 deadline to reach agreement with Beijing on a range of issues, including what the White House says is a pattern in which China has pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets as a condition of doing business there.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website that it does not support stealing trade secrets and that the move \u201cseriously violates the basic norms of international relations and has severely damaged Sino-U.S. cooperation.\u201dIt said that American monitoring of foreign governments, businesses and individuals has long been an \u201copen secret.\u201dThe statement was a reminder of how cyberspace has become a primary battleground between the two nations.In the new case, the government said it had charged two Chinese nationals, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, with conspiracy to hack into computer systems and commit wire fraud and identity theft. The government accused them of targeting unnamed aviation, telecommunications, pharmaceutical and satellite companies, and said several government entities were attacked, including the Navy and NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The indictment does not describe any specific technology stolen by the group but said they \u201csuccessfully obtained unauthorized access\u201d to a range of entities, including the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, an Energy Department lab in California.Security firms have been tracking the Chinese hackers, Mr. Zhu, also called \u201cGodkiller,\u201d and Mr. Zhang, also called \u201cBaobeilong,\u201d for 13 years, under various names including APT10 and Stone Panda. At the National Security Agency, intelligence analysts tracked the two, along with a third Chinese hacker, whom they called \u201cLegion Opal.\u201d All targeted an exhaustive list of individuals and companies in aerospace and defense, naval, energy, natural resources, automotive, electronic and government sectors, as well as the occasional Chinese dissident.But as recently as 2013, intelligence officials were not sure what to make of the hackers\u2019 relationship to Chinese state officials. All three were based in Tianjin, and that year, a classified intelligence assessment was vague in describing any tie to Beijing. The \u201cexact affiliation with Chinese government entities is not known, but their activities indicate a probable intelligence requirement feed,\u201d one N.S.A. document obtained by The New York Times said.The hackers worked for private tech companies, but their targets \u2014 particularly in aerospace and defense \u2014 were of value to China\u2019s civilian spy agency. Other targets in the energy, automotive, electronic and national resources industries closely aligned with China\u2019s economic priorities.\u201cThis is outright cheating and theft, and it gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of law-abiding businesses and countries that follow the international rules in return for the privilege of participating in the global economic system,\u201d Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, said at a news conference.APT10 has rapidly changed its approaches and technology after private cybersecurity firms discovered its attacks. It constantly shifted its internet protocol, or IP, addresses to avoid detection and bypass security filters, the indictment alleged, allowing it to remain on its victims\u2019 systems far longer.Between 2006 and 2018, according to the indictment, the APT10 group hacked computers in at least a dozen countries and broke into companies and the American government to steal information and data on various technologies.Beginning in 2014, APT10 began to target companies that provide computer services like cloud computing and networking support. It penetrated those networks and stole confidential business data from companies around the world, the indictment says.In doing so, the administration said, Beijing violated its 2015 agreement not to steal American technological secrets. Not only did it use the stolen information to give its companies a competitive advantage, but it also used the intelligence to rapidly advance the capabilities of the People\u2019s Liberation Army as it worked to increase its influence in the Pacific region.In addition to its corporate espionage, the group compromised the Navy\u2019s computer systems, downloading the private information of more than 100,000 Navy personnel, the Justice Department said.\u201cChina stands accused of engaging in criminal activity that victimizes individuals and companies in the United States, violates our laws and departs from international norms of state behavior,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said.He accused China of trying to \u201cdominate\u201d other countries through economic espionage, and said the response \u201crequires a strategic, whole-of-government approach to the threats that China poses.\u201dThe legal assault on China comes as Mr. Trump tries to end a trade war with Beijing that has begun inflicting economic harm on both sides of the Pacific. But while the administration has tried to divorce trade talks from law enforcement actions, Mr. Trump has eagerly conflated the two, potentially complicating an already complex negotiation.Mr. Trump has suggested that he could intervene in the Huawei case if it would help secure a trade agreement with China. And he previously intervened in another sanctions case involving a Chinese telecom firm, ZTE, which had been barred from buying American components after China\u2019s president, Mr. Xi, personally appealed to the president.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the charges against Chinese hackers would not derail the trade negotiations. He said that while cybersecurity had been discussed, this specific situation had not been raised.Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018America Is Respected Again!\u2019 Trump Tweets as Allies Question His Leadership", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump retooled a campaign slogan on Monday to defend his worldview, declaring that \u201cAMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!\u201d during a four-hour Twitter tirade as foreign allies braced for the potentially destabilizing effects of his policy decisions on national security.Democratic leaders accused the president of \u201cplunging the country into chaos\u201d on Christmas Eve.In the midst of posting, he even lamented, \u201cI am all alone (poor me).\u201dI am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!\u201cTo those few Senators who think I don\u2019t like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a pair of tweets critical of Jim Mattis, his departing defense secretary. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade.\u201dMr. Trump added: \u201cGeneral Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!\u201dGlobal leaders have also echoed Mr. Mattis\u2019s rebuke of Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview.Focusing on money saved, Mr. Trump sent more than 10 Twitter posts in four hours.In one, he declared that Saudi Arabia would \u201cspend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States.\u201d It was not immediately clear how or when that would happen.The damage in Syria is estimated in the hundreds of billions.As he assailed critics of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach, Mr. Trump also targeted Mr. McGurk, the envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State.The president misleadingly called Mr. McGurk an Obama-era appointee, and accused him of \u201cloading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH & sending it to Iran\u201d as part of the nuclear deal that world powers struck with Tehran \u2014 an agreement from which Mr. Trump has withdrawn the United States.On the domestic policy front, Mr. Trump saved his ire for Democrats and furthered his longstanding, one-sided feud with Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Trump said on Twitter that a \u201ccomplete\u201d border wall would be paid for with \u201cshutdown money.\u201dDemocrats have refused to give in to his demand of $5 billion for the wall, prompting a stalemate that has shut down much of the government. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what \u201cshutdown money\u201d was.\u201cNothing new on the shutdown,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he called children who were hoping to hear from Santa. \u201cWe need more border security.\u201dEarlier, as he has done in recent days, Mr. Trump again castigated the leadership of Mr. Powell, sending the markets crashing toward their worst year since 2008 and the largest December decline since the 1930s.\u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a feel for the Market, they don\u2019t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders.\u201dThe president\u2019s market-shaking tweeting caught the attention of top Democrats. In a joint statement, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the two Democratic leaders, accused Mr. Trump of \u201cplunging the country into chaos.\u201d\u201cThe stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve \u2014 after he just fired the secretary of defense,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it.\u201dNoah Weiland and Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington, and Ben Hubbard from Tripoli, Lebanon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trouble Looms for Mexico\u2019s New President", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new leader will face many challenges, starting with his American counterpart. Damage control will be his first task.Mr. Casta\u00f1eda was foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003.MEXICO CITY \u2014 Amid nervous financial markets, a buildup of thousands of Honduran migrants in Tijuana eager to enter the United States, pressure from the Trump administration on immigration and doubts over the eventual ratification of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement by the United States Congress, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador will be inaugurated on Saturday as Mexico\u2019s new president.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is only the fifth democratically elected president in the country\u2019s history, but he received a broad mandate for change last July. He takes office during a troubled era in relations between Mexico and the United States, ushered in two years ago when Donald Trump entered the White House. The new Mexican leader will have to concentrate on damage control \u2014 because Mr. Trump has done a great deal of damage. The danger is that AMLO, as he is widely known, might well aggravate that damage. He is not well equipped for this challenge.Relations came to such a low point that AMLO\u2019s predecessor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, didn\u2019t visit Mr. Trump in the United States or meet with him as president in Mexico. This was the first time in the modern history of bilateral relations. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has to deal with this situation, and doing so will not be simple.He is restricted from the left by his old-style, chip-on-the-shoulder nationalism, his radical base and the perception in Mexico that the outgoing president kowtowed to Washington all too often. He is pressured from the right by politicians concerned with Mexico\u2019s weakening economy (a battered peso and a wilting stock exchange), its integration with the United States and the country\u2019s vulnerability to any type of Trumpian retaliation for perceived or existing sins.Finally, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s sympathy for the regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, given the United States\u2019 animosity toward them, will add more tensions to the relationship. If AMLO and his team had any experience in handling these matters, or if Mr. Trump showed any inclination to back off on trade, immigration and drugs with Mexico, all of these disagreements could be managed, as they have been in the past. Neither of these two conditions exists today.Misguided policies like the cancellation of a new Mexico City airport by AMLO via popular referendum; the authoritarian drift seen in the militarization of Mexican public safety and law enforcement; the sending of American troops to the common border by Mr. Trump, and his insistence on building a wall along the border and recklessly imposing trade sanctions all show just how trigger-happy both leaders can be.The Mexican economy has collapsed at least four times over the past 40 years. It can happen to any country. But not all countries can prevent collapse, or fix it. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and Mr. Trump are on their own, together and terribly mismatched. Hoping that everything will work out is perfectly understandable, and perfectly na\u00efve. Troubled times, indeed.Jorge G.

{"Headline": "How to Revive Small-Town America", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersReaders offer their ideas, including improving access, helping family farms and giving rural residents more respect.To the Editor:Both my husband and I are Midwesterners by birth. I appreciate this thoughtful analysis of the difficulties facing rural America. However, I suggest that more attention be given to one of the basic problems facing rural regions: access. It is difficult to provide goods and services in these isolated areas. Attracting companies and new businesses is much more difficult because of their remoteness.We have not lived in the Midwest for several years but have family members there. Visiting them from our home on the West Coast involves flying to Denver or Minneapolis, transferring to a regional carrier to take us to Sioux Falls, then renting a car to drive the remaining 150-plus miles to a small rural community in South Dakota. It takes the whole day to make this trip.A century ago small rural towns were connected to the rest of the country by railroads. The loss of these connections has exacerbated the isolation. The access problem is not easily solved.To the Editor:The new economy includes the wide-open green energy industry, which rural-state politicians have demonized. And rural voters have largely hurt their pocketbooks by buying into the vilification of unions.Rather than complaining about being left behind by the \u201celites,\u201d rural residents might want to look at why it is that new-economy companies flock to big cities and progressive states, and bring their values in line with what will be needed to compete in the global economy. To the Editor:But here in rural New York State, we are well aware that while federal farm legislation is splendid for giant industrial-style farm operations, it offers little to the small farms characteristic of our area and essential to its economic health. Clearly, this complex legislation needs to be revisited. \u201cNo Farms, No Food\u201d says a bumper sticker you can see around here. Take it seriously.To the Editor:I have witnessed jokes on TV shows directed at the tradespeople who are an essential spine of the economy where we are resettling. Party platforms call for \u201cfree college education,\u201d excluding training in the trades. Editorials write off small-town workers as necessary casualties of progress.While I believe that rural Americans\u2019 support for Donald Trump is misguided, I also believe that the derogatory labels applied to them are equally misguided. Every social justice movement over the past 50 years has begun with pride. Can our platforms and remedies not hold the same respect for rural Americans that we hold for every other group in our country?To the Editor:We could organize underpopulated areas as locations that would provide health care, shopping, dining and meal delivery for the elderly. Hospitals would need to be built, providing jobs. Plumbers and electricians would have work.Amazon isn\u2019t going to build a facility in Perry County, Kentucky. But reorienting who lives there and what services they would need could transform the landscape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Tumble After Fed Signals More Rate Rises in 2019", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt wasn\u2019t what stock market bulls were hoping for.Stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, citing the strength of the economy, signaled that it planned to keep raising interest rates and shrinking the extraordinary amount of support it has provided to financial markets in the decade since the financial crisis.The S&P 500 stock index finished 1.5 percent lower, bringing its losses for the month so far to 9.2 percent. The benchmark had been higher ahead of the Fed\u2019s 2 p.m. announcement about interest rates and a news conference that followed.The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate another quarter percentage point.That increase had been widely predicted. But in the financial markets, hopes had been high that the Fed would simultaneously signal its growing concern about the outlook for economic growth.Such an outlook is known as \u201cdovish\u201d in financial market jargon. And there had been broad consensus among stock market analysts that the Fed would announce a \u201cdovish hike\u201d \u2014 that is, an increase paired with language that indicated it would slow the pace of tightening substantially \u2014 on Wednesday.They were disappointed.\u201cThere was no give,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cYou were looking for a dovish hike. And it turned out to be just a hike.\u201dThe Fed did acknowledge growing expectations that the world economy could be slowing. Chairman Jerome H. Powell emphasized that the bank would tailor its policy in response to economic data.But generally, the central bank highlighted the ongoing strength of the American economy, a reason not to ease off interest rate increases too fast. Unemployment is near 50-year lows, growth in 2018 has been the fastest in years, and even as stock markets have sold off sharply, incoming numbers show little indication that the economy is turning sour.\u201cThe Fed message to the markets is, take a breath,\u201d said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. \u201cThe Fed did its job today.\u201dThe market did not make a decisive move lower until Mr. Powell\u2019s post-decision news conference. Close observers of the stock market noted that losses in the S&P 500 accelerated after Mr. Powell answered a reporter\u2019s question about the whether Fed had discussed changing its efforts to shrink the large stockpile of safe government bonds it is holding on its balance sheet.\u201cI think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cI don\u2019t see us changing that.\u201dIn the years after the financial crisis, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet ballooned as the central bank engaged in multiple rounds of so-called quantitative easing. The policy, in which the Fed effectively created new money and used it to purchase Treasury bonds in an effort to push longer-term interest rates lower, was also credited with helping to push a broad range of other asset prices \u2014 including stocks, corporate bonds and commodities \u2014 up sharply as well.Now, the Fed is shrinking its holdings of bonds on the balance sheet by around $50 billion a month, in a process that some call quantitative tightening. And those efforts have been getting more attention lately, since they were highlighted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed from a former Fed official, Kevin Warsh, and the financier Stanley Druckenmiller earlier this week. President Trump appeared to be referring to the balance sheet reduction when, in a Twitter message earlier this week, he urged the Fed to \u201cStop with the 50 B\u2019s.\u201dIncreasingly, some see the phenomenon as playing a role in the unusually broad headwinds financial markets have faced this year. For the first time in decades, almost every broad asset class has declined or posted minuscule gains this year. And after the sell-off on Wednesday, the S&P 500 is now down 6.2 percent for the year.\u201cIf interest rates are going to be normalized higher, that means stock prices need to be normalized lower,\u201d said Matt Maley, equity strategist with institutional brokerage firm Miller Tabak in Boston. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s been going on.\u201dOf course, this year\u2019s losses have to be put in perspective. Since the market bottomed in March 2009, the S&P is up 270 percent.\u201cThe plan for the Fed has been, as the economy heals and approaches something that looks more like a healthy state, they should gradually back away from their support of financial markets and kind of let them fend for themselves,\u201d said Julia Coronado, a former Federal Reserve economist and president of the economic consulting firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cThey have to sort of stand on their own now.\u201dStanley Reed and Kevin Granville contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Tax Dollars Help Starve Children", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe famine in Yemen could become the worst the world has seen in a generation.ADEN, Yemen \u2014 He is an 8-year-old boy who is starving and has limbs like sticks, but Yaqoob Walid doesn\u2019t cry or complain. He gazes stolidly ahead, tuning out everything, for in late stages of starvation the human body focuses every calorie simply on keeping the organs functioning.Yaqoob arrived unconscious at Al Sadaqa Hospital here, weighing just over 30 pounds. He has suffered complications, and doctors say that it is unclear he will survive and that if he does he may suffer permanent brain damage.\u201cThe risk of a major catastrophe is very high,\u201d Mark Lowcock, the United Nations humanitarian chief, told me. \u201cIn the worst case, what we have in Yemen now has the potential to be worse than anything any professional in this field has seen during their working lives.\u201dBoth the Obama and Trump administrations have supported the Saudi war in Yemen with a military partnership, arms sales, intelligence sharing and until recently air-to-air refueling. The United States is thus complicit in what some human rights experts believe are war crimes.The bottom line: Our tax dollars are going to starve children.After witnessing the human toll and interviewing officials on both sides, including the president of the Houthi rebels who control much of Yemen, I find the American and Saudi role in this conflict to be unconscionable. The Houthis are repressive and untrustworthy, but this is not a reason to bomb and starve Yemeni children.What is most infuriating is that the hunger is caused not by drought or extreme weather, but by cynical and failed policies in Riyadh and Washington. The starvation does not seem to be an accidental byproduct of war, but rather a weapon in it. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, backed by the United States, are trying to inflict pain to gain leverage over and destabilize the Houthi rebels. The reason: The Houthis are allied with Iran.The governments of Saudi Arabia and the United States don\u2019t want you to see pictures like Yaqoob\u2019s or reflect on the suffering in Yemen. The Saudis impose a partial blockade on Houthi areas, banning commercial flights and barring journalists from special United Nations planes there. I\u2019ve been trying for more than two years to get through the Saudi blockade, and I finally was able to by tagging onto Lowcock\u2019s United Nations delegation.After a major famine, there is always soul-searching about how the world could have allowed this to happen. What\u2019s needed this time is not soul-searching a few years from now, but action today to end the war and prevent a cataclysm.Yaqoob was especially vulnerable. He is the second of eight children in a poor household with a father who has mental health problems and can\u2019t work steadily. Moreover, the father, like many Yemenis, chews qat \u2014 a narcotic leaf that is very widely used in Yemen and offers an easy high. This consumes about $1 a day, reducing the budget available for food. The family sold some land to pay for Yaqoob\u2019s care, so its situation is now even more precarious.A few rooms down from Yaqoob was Fawaz Abdullah, 18 months old, his skin mottled and discolored with sores. Fawaz is so malnourished that he has never been able to walk or say more than \u201cMa\u201d or \u201cBa.\u201d\u201cI used to be able to buy whatever I wanted, including meat and fish,\u201d she told me. Since fleeing, she said, war-induced poverty has meant that she hasn\u2019t been able to buy a single fish or egg \u2014 and that is why Fawaz suffers severe protein deficiency.\u201cThey asked me to buy milk for Fawaz, but we can\u2019t afford it now,\u201d she said.We think of war casualties as men with their legs blown off. But in Yemen the most common war casualties are children like Fawaz who suffer malnutrition.\u201cThese children are the future of Yemen,\u201d Dr. Aida Hussein, a nutrition specialist, told me, looking at Fawaz. \u201cHe will be stunted. How will he do in school?\u201dIn the capital, Sana, I met a child who was suffering both malnutrition and cholera. The boy was Saddam Hussein (he was named for the Iraqi leader), eight years old, and the parents repeat the mantra I hear from everyone: Life is much worse now because of the war.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we will eat tomorrow,\u201d Saddam\u2019s mother told me.Yemen began to disintegrate in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, and then the Houthis, a traditional clan in the north, swept down on Sana and seized much of the country. The Houthis follow Zaydi Islam, which is related to the Shiite branch dominant in Iran, and the Saudis and some Americans see them as Iranian stooges.In some ways, the Houthis have been successful. They have imposed order and crushed Al Qaeda and the Islamic State in the parts of Yemen they control, and in Sana I felt secure and didn\u2019t fear kidnapping.However, the Houthis operate a police state and are hostile to uncovered women, gays and anyone bold enough to criticize them. They recruit child soldiers from the age of about 12 (the Saudi- and American-backed forces wait until boys are about 15), interfere with food aid, and have engaged in torture and attacks on civilians.The foreign minister on the Houthi side is Hisham Sharaf Abdalla, a congenial American-educated official.After our conversation, he brought me over to his desk and showed me his assault rifle and two handguns. \u201cWhen I was in the U.S., I was a member of the N.R.A.,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would like to have an N.R.A. chapter in Yemen.\u201dMr. Sharaf talks a good game but is not himself a Houthi, just an ally, so I wondered if he was a figurehead trotted out to impress foreigners. Later I interviewed a man whose power is unquestioned: Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, the president of the Supreme Revolutionary Committee. As his name signifies, he is a member of the Houthi clan.An aide picked me up and ferried me to him, for President Houthi changes locations daily to avoid being bombed by the Saudis. President Houthi, a large, confident man with a traditional dagger at his belly, was friendly to me but also suspicious of the United States and full of conspiracy theories. He suggested that Washington was secretly arming Al Qaeda and that the United States was calling the shots for Saudi Arabia in Yemen, at the behest of Israel.Still, he said that he wanted peace and that although the Houthis have fired missiles at Saudi Arabia, his side would pose no threat to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis would only end their assault on Yemen.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for enmity with the United States,\u201d he told me in Arabic, and that seemed a message he wanted me to convey to Washington and the American people.I asked President Houthi about the sarkha, the group\u2019s slogan: \u201cGod is great! Death to America! Death to Israel! Curses on the Jews! Victory to Islam!\u201d That didn\u2019t seem so friendly, I said.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing against the American people,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s directed toward the system.\u201dWhen I asked about Saudi and American suggestions that the Houthis are Iranian pawns, he laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s just propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask you: Have you ever seen one Iranian in Yemen? Do we speak Farsi?\u201d This was all a trick, he said, analogous to the allegations of weapons of mass destruction used to justify war with Iraq.While the Houthis are called \u201crebels,\u201d they clearly rule their territory. In contrast, the Saudi- and American-backed \u201cinternationally recognized government\u201d of Yemen is a shell that controls almost no territory \u2014 hence it is based in Riyadh. The \u201cpresident\u201d of this exile government, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is said to be gravely ill, and when he is gone it will be even more difficult to sustain the fiction that this is a real government.More broadly, I don\u2019t see any hint of a Saudi or American strategy. There\u2019s little sign that bombing and starvation will actually dislodge the Houthis, while the Saudi military action and resulting chaos has benefited the Yemeni branches of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. In that sense, America\u2019s conduct in Yemen has hurt our own national security.In one sign of the ineffectiveness of the Western-backed government, the hunger is now as severe in its areas as in the rebel-held north. I saw worse starvation in Aden, the lovely seaside city in the south that is nominally run by the internationally recognized government, than in Houthi-controlled Sana.And while I felt reasonably secure in Houthi-controlled areas, I was perpetually nervous in Aden. Abductions and murders occur regularly there, and my guesthouse offered not a mint on the pillow, but a bulletproof vest; at night, sleep was interrupted by nearby fighting among unknown gunmen.What limited order exists in Aden is provided by soldiers from the United Arab Emirates and allied militias, and I worry that the U.A.E. is getting fed up with the war and may pull them out without alternative arrangements for security. If that happens, Aden may soon plunge into Somalia-like chaos.Mohamed Zemam, the governor of the central bank, believes that there are ways to shore up the economy and prevent starvation. But he cautions that the risk of another Somalia is real, and he estimates that there may be two million Yemenis in one fighting force or another.\u201cWhat they have is the way of the gun,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t solve that, we will have problems for 100 years.\u201dAnother danger is that the Saudi coalition will press ahead so that fighting closes the port of Hudaydah, through which most food and fuel come.I stopped in Saudi Arabia to speak to senior officials there about Yemen, and we had some tough exchanges. I showed them photos on my phone of starving children, and they said that this was unfortunate and undesired. \u201cWe are not devils,\u201d one said indignantly. They insisted that they would welcome peace \u2014 but that they must confront the Houthis.\u201cThe most important thing for us is national security,\u201d the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed Al-Jabir, told me. Dr. Abdullah Al Rabeeah, an adviser to the royal court and director of a fund that provides aid to Yemen, told me that Saudis don\u2019t want to see hunger in Yemen but added: \u201cWe will continue to do what it takes to fight terrorism. It\u2019s not an easy decision.\u201dSaudi and U.A.E. officials note that they provide an enormous amount of humanitarian aid to Yemen. This is true, and it mitigates the suffering there. But it\u2019s difficult to give the Saudis much credit for relieving the suffering of a country that they are bombing and starving.To avert a catastrophe in Yemen, the world needs to provide more humanitarian aid. But above all, the war has to end.That solution will entail strong American backing for a difficult United Nations-backed peace process involving Yemeni factions and outsiders, aiming for a measure of power sharing. This diplomatic process requires engaging the Houthis, not just bombing them. It also means a cease-fire and pressure on all sides to ensure humanitarian access and the passage of food and fuel. The best leverage America has to make the Saudis part of the solution is to suspend arms sales to Riyadh so long as the Saudis continue the war.In conference rooms in Riyadh and Washington, officials simply don\u2019t fathom the human toll of their policies.In a makeshift camp for displaced people in Aden, I met a couple who lost two daughters \u2014 Bayan, 11, and Bonyan, 8 \u2014 in a bombing in a crowded market.\u201cI heard the bomb and I went running after them,\u201d the dad, Ahmed Abdullah, told me with an ache in his voice. \u201cThey were dead. One had her skull burst open, and the other had no arms or legs left.\u201dAnother son died of fever when the family could not afford to take the boy to a hospital. There are several other children, and none of them are going to school any more; a 10-year-old daughter, Baraa, who is next in line to be married, couldn\u2019t tell me what seven plus eight equals.A bit hesitantly, I told Ahmed that I thought that my country, America, had probably provided the bomb that had killed his daughters. He was not angry, just resigned.\u201cI am not an educated person,\u201d he told me earnestly. \u201cI am a simple parent.\u201d And then he offered more wisdom than I heard from the sophisticated policy architects in America and Saudi Arabia: \u201cMy message is that I want the war to stop.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Dyson: \u2018The Public Wants to Buy Strange Things\u2019 ", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "corner officeHe made billions selling vacuums. Now he is backing Brexit, building an electric car \u2014\u00a0and making antiquated comments on \u2018racial differences.\u2019Supported byJames Dyson is unapologetically British.The product of the English boarding school system, Mr. Dyson found his calling as an industrial designer and built one of the most successful private companies in the United Kingdom by selling his distinctive vacuums. He was knighted in 2007, served as the provost of the Royal College of Art in London and is one of the country\u2019s richest men. Yet in a globalized economy, Mr. Dyson remains intently focused on what he believes is Britain\u2019s exceptional place in the world. He wistfully refers to the British Empire, and unlike most in the business community, is in favor of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, believing Brexit will make the country stronger economically and culturally.In this interview, Mr. Dyson expressed antiquated and at times offensive views on \u201cracial differences\u201d and Japanese culture. He also referred to growth markets in Asia as the \u201cFar East.\u201d When asked to clarify his remarks, Mr. Dyson declined to comment further. (Read a portion of his comments on Japan below.)Mr. Dyson discovered his passion for design at an early age, and eventually began work on his signature product, the bagless vacuum cleaner. It took several years, but he brought the product to market, founding Dyson Ltd. in 1991. Soon, Dyson was expanding internationally and developing new products, including washing machines, fans, heaters, air purifiers, hand dryers and hair dryers. It is now at work on an electric car.This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in New York. What was your childhood like? My father died when I was quite young. He was a teacher at a boarding school, but he didn\u2019t have life insurance, so the school allowed my brother and I to continue there. Boarding is pretty harsh stuff. You\u2019re sent away for 14 weeks, and your parents could visit you one Saturday a term, and that was it. \u201cFeelings\u201d is a word I didn\u2019t know until I was about 50.How did you get interested in design? I did art at boarding school, which I really enjoyed. So I decided to go to art school in London. That\u2019s where I discovered design and thought, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to be doing. I want to be designing and creating things.\u201d I started off with architecture, and then I discovered Buckminster Fuller, the great American inventor, entrepreneur. And suddenly, the thing that was interesting me the most was the thing I always thought was incredibly boring, which is engineering.What was your first job? When I was in college, I went to this industrialist at an engineering company. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you some design jobs.\u201d He had this idea for this high-speed landing craft for the military and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you design that?\u201d I knew nothing about boats, though I didn\u2019t dare say it, but it sounded fun. So we built a prototype, and then the chairman of the company said, \u201cWell you better start selling it.\u201dI looked at him slightly blankly and said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t I have to do some market research?\u201d And he said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother. It\u2019s a good product. Anyway, you\u2019re the engineer, you know every nut and bolt of the thing.\u201d And you sold them? I didn\u2019t look like a business man or anything. I had flowing trousers, long hair, flowered shirts. But I set up the company and manufacturing, and I sold them for five years. We sold them to militaries all over the world, to oil companies, construction companies, smugglers bringing American cigarettes into Italy.Smugglers? He came in a leather jacket and paid cash. I asked him what he was going to do, and I didn\u2019t think smuggling cigarettes was particularly naughty. The point is, here\u2019s this longhaired art student in the mid-\u201960s, getting asked to design something he knew nothing about. Then he\u2019s told to set up a company, which he knew nothing about. That\u2019s what I do today with my people. I try to recruit everybody as a graduate, because they have no baggage, they have enthusiasm and curiosity. I think experience can be fine in certain situations and with certain companies. But when you\u2019re doing something very different, it\u2019s often best done by people who have done nothing before.How did you come up with the idea for the vacuum?I decided to pick a modest product and do a completely different version and see what happened. But the retailers weren\u2019t interested, because they said it was too different and they said they didn\u2019t have space for a different thing made by a nobody. So I decided to advertise in newspapers. And what I learned is that the public wants to buy strange things, as long as there\u2019s purpose to them. As long as they can see what\u2019s new and different about it, they\u2019ll buy them. And what was so different about your vacuums? I saw the problem, and I saw a possible solution, which was the huge cyclones outside cement plants and timber yards that collect dust all day long. So I started building various versions of that technology. As it happens, it didn\u2019t work. I had to spend four or five years coming up with different types of cyclonic separation devices in order to make it work.It took a lot of empirical work. I had to build the prototypes, one or two a day, which sounds tedious, but actually it was fascinating. I\u2019m still doing it today. It always is a wonderful adventure of excitement and disappointment. Almost everything you do is a failure, until you get the one success that works.How did you pay for all that research and development before you had a product to sell? I was borrowing it all from the bank. Going deeper and deeper into debt. By the time I launched the vacuum cleaner, I was two million pounds in debt. I think the bank got in a bit deeper than they intended to, but I had an interesting bank manager. I asked him why he lent me the money, and he said, \u201cI went home to my wife and said, \u2018What do you think about vacuum bags and vacuum cleaners?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Dreadful, dreadful.\u2019\u201dOnce you gained traction in the U.K., how did you expand into the United States? A junior buyer at Best Buy took our vacuum cleaner home and used it for three weeks and came back to her boss and said, \u201cThis actually is a really good vacuum. It doesn\u2019t make a mess.\u201d And he said, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s give it a go in 50 shops.\u201d It sold well, and then everybody else wanted it. It was just one brave junior buyer, convincing her manager.When we met earlier in the year, you told me something about Japan.Whenever we went there, we thought you had to learn to behave like a Japanese person, you know, bowing. What I quickly learned is that\u2019s not what they wanted from us at all. They wanted our eccentricity and difference. So, I carried on being an Englishman.What are you working on now? I\u2019ve been working on an electric car. We bought an old World War II airfield, so we\u2019ve got a place to do it. Tesla proved that people want electric cars, though I don\u2019t think governments have realized it yet. People are trying to ignore pollution and the damage that pollution does. Apart from that, the electric car is a much nicer and easier car to own. You don\u2019t have to go to gas stations, which aren\u2019t very nice.I don\u2019t really look at markets at all. Otherwise, I would have never gone into hand drying. When we have technology we feel could do something interesting, we go into that field. It\u2019s entirely technology- and product-led. It\u2019s not led by market size. Hand dryers are not a sexy business, but we had the technology which did it better, and it happens to be a perfectly reasonable business. It\u2019s not like computers or mobile phones, but we wanted to do it and we enjoyed it. We still enjoy it. I choose unpopular fields to go into, because they\u2019re more interesting. I want to play the bassoon, please. Playing the guitar is much more sexy, but the bassoon is more interesting.I think we should be independent. Europe has become more and more of a unified society where all the laws are made in Brussels. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ever been right for Britain.Britain has always been a globally facing country, with our empire, if I dare mention that, covering half the globe. We have a pioneering and global outlook. There\u2019s no room for us in Europe.All cars coming into England from America have a 10 percent duty on them, and most of that goes to Brussels. Europe is a protectionist setup designed to keep competitors out. It\u2019s not a good thing to be in. We believe in free trade. And if any bankers are leaving London, it\u2019s got nothing to do with Brexit. It was the right decision for Britain.An earlier version of this article said incorrectly that Mr. Dyson referred to China as the \"Far East.\" He used the term to refer to Asia more broadly. Also, a question preceding an exchange on Japan has been expanded to give more context to Mr. Dyson's response.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Keystone Spies", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe once-terrifying Russian military intelligence agency has been so sloppy and prone to fumbling that you have to ask: Why does a strongman brought up in the K.G.B. put up with it?Ms. Latynina is a Russian journalist who has been a visiting expert at the Kennan Institute.But earlier this year, in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, this grandiose image of the Great Evil was forever destroyed in a Chernobyl-scale meltdown experienced by the G.R.U. in the wake of the British indictment of two G.R.U. hit men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who bungled an attempt to poison their former colleague Sergei Skripal and his daughter.The two intended killers were no James Bonds. They were clowns. Murderous, for sure. But clowns nevertheless.After all, such botches were nothing new. \u201cSpying is one of the most important jobs in the world,\u201d President Putin proclaimed recently. But if he really thinks it\u2019s so important, why does he put up with such sloppy spycraft?The easy answer is: because there\u2019s no efficient state machinery. The state apparatus is customized for graft, ineptitude and corruption. Spies are no exception.Then why doesn\u2019t he clean up the apparatus?The blunt answer is: because he is afraid to. An efficient military could stage a coup against him. So inefficiency is a price Mr. Putin will pay.And when did the sloppiness start?The first public poisoning we know about \u2014 apparently with dioxin \u2014 was the attempt on Sept. 5, 2004, to kill Viktor Yushchenko, a candidate opposing a pro-Kremlin favorite in a Ukrainian presidential election. He recovered and won the presidency.But the attacks were not always successes. The agents blew up an old pipeline, mistaking it for a new one. Instead of blowing up a wall of the American Embassy, they blew up an adjacent wall. When a bomb set to blow up a railway bridge on Oct. 2, 2010, didn\u2019t go off, the agent responsible for the attack tricked his handlers by claiming, incredibly, that the Georgians were hushing up an explosion. To check his story, Major Borisov\u2019s deputy called a European Union monitoring mission in Georgia with profuse offers of help, all but admitting the provenance of the device. Five days later, it was discovered intact, completing the major\u2019s humiliation.Why is all this history important? Because the timing hints at the motivation behind all of this skulduggery. The Yushchenko poisoning occurred on Sept. 5, 2004. The attacks on Georgia started a week later \u2014 in the wake of \u201ccolor\u201d revolutions for democracy in Ukraine and Georgia, and also during the American-led war in Iraq. When the color revolutions swept through Georgia and Ukraine the next year, Mr. Putin \u2014 then a 51-year-old ex-K.G.B. lieutenant colonel \u2014 acted as if they were the result not of political mistakes, miscalculations and the inability of corrupt governments to contain discontent in those former Soviet republics.No, he apparently thought, all of this was one nefarious plot hatched in Washington to encircle Russia deep in its historical sphere of influence. Americans had smiled when they persuaded him in 2002 to accept Lithuania and Poland as new NATO members, and all the time they were just waiting to plant a dagger into his back.We need to understand that in the Kremlin\u2019s warped worldview, the Yushchenko poisoning or the Georgian explosions were not attacks, but payback. To the Kremlin, Mr. Yushchenko was a United States agent, simply because he had an American wife who worked for the United States Treasury and whom he had met by chance on a plane. It seems never to have occurred to Mr. Putin\u2019s spymaster that Russia was losing influence because of its own actions. Which leads to a final question: Why is Mr. Putin doing all this?The answer is obvious: because he thinks he has no other choice \u2014 that Americans, not Russians, are the aggressors, and he\u2019s just striking back. And he can\u2019t renounce this view. It would be tantamount to renouncing his vision of himself as a powerful leader who wants to Make Russia Great Again. He\u2019d have to acknowledge the truths that he, not America, is turning Russia into a third-world country hemorrhaging its smartest brains, with a failing economy and no chips with which to bargain with the rest of the world.So more of the same is to follow, and God help us all.Yulia Latynina is a Russian journalist with Echo of Moscow and Novaya Gazeta, and is a recipient of the Defender of Freedom Award from the United States State Department.Advertisement"}

Cheating on exams. Even pornography.North Korea on Tuesday warned against the disruptive influence it said smartphones could have on its isolated population, as the devices have begun to expose young people in particular to information and trends from the outside world.In the hermetically sealed North, South Korean officials estimate that the number of mobile phones has risen to six million since 2008, when cellular phone service began as a joint venture between the Egyptian telecommunications firm Orascom and the North\u2019s communication ministry. The country has a population of 25 million.On Tuesday, the North\u2019s main state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, published an article listing what it called \u201cnegative repercussions\u201d from the introduction of smartphones in schools around the world, including the use of phones during classes, cheating during exams and the circulation of pornographic material.\u201cThis proves that mobile phones have become an avenue to instill students with unhealthy ideology,\u201d it said. \u201cMost educators and parents around the world believe that various corrupt and reactionary cultures spreading through mobile phones are confusing students as they shape their lives\u2019 values.\u201d\u201cMore serious is the fact that erotic messages, novels and video files, as well as electronic games with violent content, are spreading unlimited through mobile phones,\u201d the article said.The article did not say what actions, if any, North Korea planned to take.With smartphones proliferating, the North Korean authorities have struggled to maintain their tight control over what information the population receives, even as the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, has helped to encourage the use of the devices, according to North Korean defectors and South Korean officials.North Korea still walls off its computers and smartphones from global communications networks, including the internet, and rigs all radio and TV sets so they can only receive propaganda-filled government broadcasts. Such information control is seen as key to maintaining Mr. Kim\u2019s totalitarian grip on power and the personality cult surrounding his family, which has ruled the North since its founding at the end of World War II.Nevertheless, North Koreans have begun using their phones to watch outside entertainment smuggled in from China, including South Korean TV dramas. The files are shared between smartphones and other mobile devices through tiny memory chips, or the wireless data-exchange technology Bluetooth.But Mr. Kim\u2019s government has also recently begun blocking North Korean smartphones\u2019 Bluetooth capabilities to prevent file sharing. It is also installing software in smartphones that makes it difficult to open outside files and enables the authorities to track what users have been watching, according to defectors and South Korean officials.When used near the Chinese border, such phones can connect to Chinese mobile networks. North Koreans use them to coordinate smuggling operations across the border and exchange text messages and even video files, as well as voice calls, with relatives who have fled to South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Men Held in Tourist Killings in Morocco. Denmark Calls It \u2018Act of Terror.\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 The authorities in Morocco said on Thursday that three more suspects had been arrested in the killings of two Scandinavian tourists in the Atlas Mountains, in what Danish officials suggested was an act of terror linked to the Islamic State.The authorities said that the bodies of the victims, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, of Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway, were found on Monday by other tourists in an isolated area of the High Atlas Mountains, an area popular with hikers and six miles from the village of Imlil. Both women had been studying at the same school in Norway to become tour guides.Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen of Denmark said on Thursday that the killings might be \u201cpolitically motivated, and thereby an act of terror.\u201d He added that \u201cthere are still dark forces that want to fight our values\u201d and that \u201cwe must not give in.\u201d\u201cWhat should have been a holiday trip turned into a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said. He vowed to do everything possible to solve the crime.A video posted on social media purported to show one of the victims screaming while a man cut her neck with a knife. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said it was working to authenticate the video.In the statement, the intelligence service said it was an \u201cunusually gruesome\u201d case: \u201cThe video and preliminary investigation according to the Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organization Islamic State.\u201dThe video, which was shared on Twitter, showed the men vowing fealty to the group\u2019s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and saying that they \u201ccannot remain seated, witnessing the destruction caused by Crusader planes,\u201d terminology typically used by the group to refer to Western airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway called the killings \u201ca senseless attack,\u201d adding that the case \u201cemphasizes the importance of combating violent extremism.\u201d She said that Norway would assist the Moroccan authorities in their investigation.The deaths have shocked Morocco, a popular tourist destination where attacks on foreigners are extremely rare. But the country has battled Islamic extremism for years, and thousands of Moroccans have joined the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. The last terrorist attack happened in Marrakesh in 2011, when a bomb attack in a cafe killed 17 people, including 11 Europeans.Abdellah Rami, a Moroccan expert on Islamist movements, said that if the terrorism link were to be verified, it would be the first terrorist attack outside Morocco\u2019s urban areas.\u201cThe ideological identity is clear, but the organization they\u2019re affiliated to isn\u2019t,\u201d he said on Thursday of the suspects. \u201cSo the question is, did they commit this independently or was it a sleeper cell?\u201dHe noted that the attack \u201ctargets very sensitive matters like tourism, which is an essential component of the Moroccan economy.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is hard for the authorities to protect these areas and easier for organizations like ISIS to start operating in these places.\u201dMs. Ueland\u2019s mother, Irene Ueland, was quoted in a regional newspaper as describing the killings as \u201cpure madness.\u201dMs. Jespersen wrote a post on Nov. 21 on Facebook about her coming trip: \u201cDear friends, I\u2019m going to Morocco in December. Any of you guys who\u2019s around by then or any mountain friends who knows something about Mount Toubkal?\u201dThe site where the bodies were found is often the starting point for treks to Mount Toubkal, North Africa\u2019s highest peak.Ms. Jespersen\u2019s family told Danish news media that she had traveled to Morocco on Dec. 8 to celebrate Christmas and to practice climbing with her Norwegian friend. Since the age of 18, her relatives said, she had a habit of traveling for the holiday.On their last phone call before the trip, Ms. Jespersen told her mother, Helle Jespersen, who lives in Grindsted, west of Copenhagen, that she was excited and busy with exams at the Norwegian school where she was studying to become a tour guide.According to Moroccan news reports, investigators recovered surveillance footage showing three suspects putting up a tent near the victims\u2019 tent and leaving the area after their deaths.Martin Selsoe Sorensen reported from Copenhagen, and Aida Alami from Paris.

{"Headline": "Teaching Children Regardless of Grade", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesEducators in a remote valley in India devised a community approach to instructing students when teachers were sparse. It\u2019s catching on.Ms. Dharssi is a journalist who reports on global development, sustainability and immigration.One day at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year in the rural Rishi Valley region of Andhra Pradesh, India, two dozen children in Grades 1 through 5 gathered quietly around four tables on colorful mats on the floor of their one-room school, working with books and worn laminated materials. Few looked up when I walked in. Their school has no chairs and is more than three hours from Bangalore, the closest major city. But the students were working with learning aids so effective that by now they\u2019ve been adopted by more than 250,000 schools across India and in more than a dozen countries, including Kenya, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The common problem they address is one of the thorniest in education: teaching in primary schools where one teacher instructs children at multiple grade levels at once.But experts, including Mr. Antoninis, say that Rishi Valley\u2019s pedagogy, which lets children study at their own pace, offers a solution to the problem. The approach has also been found to be useful in wealthier countries like Britain and Germany, and is applicable in countries like the United States, where teachers often manage large classes of students who have varied levels of understanding even within the same grade.In the Rishi Valley school when I visited, students in different grades were studying Telugu, the local language, side by side. At one table, a teacher helped six students, including a 5-year-old girl learning the alphabet with foam letters and a girl in fourth grade reading a song about diversity in India. At another table, a boy in first grade helped a girl learn the word for \u201cmuddy road.\u201d Nearby, two fourth graders took turns rolling dice in a game with words they recently learned.The method is meant to let students study at their own pace. They work through the curriculum by following subject-specific \u201clearning ladders\u201d that outline lessons with various levels of support from the teacher. Each rung of the ladder represents a learning milestone; the cards outline activities that introduce the student to a new concept, give him or her a chance to practice it and evaluate his or her understanding of it, along with possibilities for enrichment and remediation. To help children relate to concepts, activities incorporate local dialects, folklore and natural materials from the local environment. The curriculum also incorporates community festivals and group activities like singing and puppetry.Students typically begin learning milestones at a table for teacher-supported work, where the teacher introduces the concept. Students follow the ladder to identify their next activity and then move through other tables to do work that is either teacher-supported, peer-supported, partly teacher-supported or independent. Teachers track student progress and adjust tasks as needed. This way, the process engages learners who differ in natural quickness, prior knowledge and time to study. Child laborers, who frequently miss school for work, can pick up where they left off.The method allows for a \u201cpersonalized education that one usually associates with very developed economies\u201d and \u201cmakes that affordable for low-resource environments,\u201d said Fabio Segura, head of international programs at the Jacobs Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit organization focused on improving child and youth development worldwide. Starting in 2015, the foundation considered more than 3,600 models to improve education in Ivory Coast\u2019s cocoa-growing communities. Rishi Valley\u2019s model is one of 12 the foundation is testing, with assistance from cocoa companies and the government, Mr. Segura said.In Germany, about 150 schools use the method, according to Ulrike Lichtinger, a professor at Vorarlberg Teaching University in Austria. She spreads the approach with educators like Thomas M\u00fcller, professor of special education at Julius Maximilian University in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany. When he introduced it at a school for children with emotional and behavioral problems where he was headmaster, students became more attentive and behavioral problems dropped \u201cnearly to zero,\u201d he said.The approach gives students greater control over learning than conventional classrooms, said Kathrin Trimborn, a German teacher who studied the method for her doctorate and works with students with emotional and behavioral problems. \u201cWorking with the learning ladder, they always know, \u2018O.K., I\u2019m here and I have to do \u2014- for the next week \u2014- this, this, this. So many steps.,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they see how they improve and that\u2019s what\u2019s really, really motivating for them.\u201dNevertheless, the way this teaching method overturns classroom and teaching norms has inhibited its spread in some places. In India, the pedagogy runs into a \u201cchalk-and-talk\u201d culture in which teachers stand in front of a class, lecturing from textbooks, and evaluate students based on memorization, said Venu Thane, coordinator at the Rishi Valley\u2019s educational resource institution. The problem was that most teachers were poorly trained or didn\u2019t understand the model. Others didn\u2019t take it seriously, which means they didn\u2019t appreciate how it could enhance their teaching. Some schools reverted to textbooks instead of activity cards, or didn\u2019t adapt activities to make lessons relevant for their students.The findings underscore what Mr. Rao describes as the biggest challenge to using the model to improve education, \u201cdilution.\u201d What\u2019s needed is political backing, buy-in from teachers and long-term support for teachers, he added.Such setbacks are to be expected, Mr. Vijayakumar said, noting that teachers have lectured at children in rows for centuries. Reform, he said, is not magic. \u201cChanging the mind-set of so many teachers and so many parents and millions and millions of children, it takes time,\u201d he said.Even so, the approach is having a notable impact. Children in Indian states that use it performed \u201csignificantly better\u201d on a national survey of learning achievements last year, said Begur Ramachandra Rao, an education specialist at Unicef India, in an email.The Rishi Valley institute is now more deliberate about assuring that the model is adopted rigorously. The institute prefers contracts of three years or more so it can adequately support teachers and troubleshoot, Padmanabha Rao explained. This is a departure from a previous model, in which the institute helped with curricular adaptation and initial teacher trainings before moving on.The institution is also incorporating technology into the method with support from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation and the World Economic Forum. The institute has developed digital training guides, including videos, to help officials and teachers understand it. Last year, the institute also added activities involving tablets to the method in government schools in Andhra Pradesh. Students\u2019 results are uploaded to a database where officials can pinpoint which schools need more support, Mr. Rao said.Alia Dharssi, a freelance journalist in Vancouver, reports on global development, sustainability and immigration.

The global and domestic worries are undercutting the prospects for manufacturers, technology companies, regional banks and airlines, intensifying the sell-off in stocks. The S&P 500 lost more than 3 percent on Tuesday, after rallying the day before on the hope of a deal with China.\u201cThey actually want to see a positive resolution where this problem is solved so they don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist at the brokerage firm William O\u2019Neil & Company.The losses looked more measured in Asia in morning trading on Wednesday, as shares in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai fell, but by half as much or less.Since the Trump administration started to impose tariffs on imports from China, the United States economy has been largely insulated from the trade war. The economy is on pace for its best year since 2005, unemployment is near 50-year lows, and corporate profits are surging.But investors are now grappling with the potential for a protracted conflict, as the president signaled the negotiations could be more contentious than expected. Deep divisions remain between the two countries, including the administration\u2019s insistence that China end its practice of pressuring American companies to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets.Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed on Saturday not to impose any additional tariffs for 90 days while the two sides work toward a formal agreement. Raising optimism about the deal, Mr. Trump repeatedly cited specific agreements from China, including more purchases of American farm products.The deal faced almost immediate doubt. Beijing never confirmed those details, while the White House sent mixed messages about what agreements the leaders had made. Then on Monday, the White House said that Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative and a longtime China skeptic, would lead the talks with Beijing. The choice of Mr. Lighthizer, who has a reputation as a tough negotiator, signaled a tough road ahead.By Tuesday, the optimism had completely faded as Mr. Trump once again called out China for its trade practices. In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, he pushed the Chinese to buy American agricultural products \u201cimmediately,\u201d and questioned whether a \u201creal deal\u201d with Beijing is actually possible. \u201cWhen people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so,\u201d he wrote.The mood of the market worsened throughout the day, with companies most exposed to the costs of the trade fight bearing the brunt of the pain. Shares of Boeing and Caterpillar \u2014 large exporters with significant sales in China \u2014 fell sharply, 4.9 percent for Boeing and 6.9 percent for Caterpillar.Chip companies, which depend on extensive networks of factories and subcontractors in Asia, also slumped. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped nearly 5 percent. Advanced Micro Devices shares plummeted nearly 11 percent, making it the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index.Despite the threat of an escalation in the trade war, China expressed confidence in the trade talks on Wednesday. Both sides would continue to put their trade commitments into effect, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a brief statement on its website. But trade wasn\u2019t the only issue on Tuesday. The Russell 2000 index of small companies \u2014 which typically depend far less on foreign sales \u2014 fell 4.4 percent, while regional banks, automakers, airlines and home-building shares all dropped.The bond market also flashed warning signs. The gap between the interest rates on short- and long-term United States government bonds fell sharply on Tuesday, and by some measures hit its lowest point since before the financial crisis. Many analysts say long-term rates could soon fall below short-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inversion of the yield curve.\u201cThe inversion has always preceded the recession so you can\u2019t just pooh-pooh it,\u201d said Vinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Office.Automobile makers, already buffeted by rising steel costs because of the trade war, now face plateauing sales at home. General Motors last week said it would idle five factories in North America and cut roughly 14,000 jobs in a bid to trim costs. On Tuesday, the low-cost retailer Dollar General said that the next phase of tariffs in the trade war between the United States and China \u201ccould have a more significant impact on our business and on our customer\u2019s budgets.\u201d Its shares fell 6.8 percent.The home builder Toll Brothers, facing sluggish sales in the face of rising mortgage rates, reported that orders for new homes fell for the first time since 2014, helping to set off a decline in home-building stocks. \u201cInvestors are worried about the economy,\u201d Mr. Watts said. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly what this is showing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Empty Homes and Protests: China\u2019s Property Market Strains the World", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA glut of unwanted apartments gets part of the blame for a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In some places, homeowners are taking to the streets.JURONG, China \u2014 For Hu Peiliang, Jurong was a city of cranes, concrete and opportunity. He was so sure it was on the cusp of a boom that last year he moved his family there.On an overcast day last month, Mr. Hu, a 31-year-old real estate agent, pointed to one new building after another as evidence. New city blocks have been built, crosswalks and streetlights erected overnight. One development straddling several blocks called Yudong International will include 120 buildings when completed.But who will buy all those apartments? Mr. Hu paused before answering. \u201cI was wondering that myself,\u201d he said. Since July, he has sold only a handful.Unwanted apartments are weighing on China\u2019s economy \u2014 and, by extension, dragging down growth around the world. Property sales are dropping. Apartments are going unsold. Developers who bet big on continued good times are now staggering under billions of dollars of debt.\u201cThe prospects of the property market are grim,\u201d said Xiang Songzuo, a senior economist at Renmin University, said during a lecture at Renmin Business School this month. China is grappling with an economic slowdown brought on by efforts to curb debt and worsened by the trade fight with the United States. But any solution will have to contend with the country\u2019s property problems. More than one in five apartments in Chinese cities \u2014 roughly 65 million \u2014 sit unoccupied, estimates Gan Li, a professor at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu.\u201cWe are already in a difficult economic situation,\u201d Mr. Gan said. \u201cThe decline will only get worse.\u201dIn places like Jurong, homeowners are paying the price. Some property developers have slashed prices on new apartments to gin up business or cut corners to save money. That undercuts the property values of earlier buyers, who increasingly are taking to the streets to protest.In October, dozens of apartment buyers in Jurong gathered outside the sales office of Center Park, a 22-building residential complex pitched by Country Garden, the developer, as China\u2019s version of Central Park in Manhattan. Security guards barricaded the entrance to prevent protesters from storming the building to demand their money back.\u201cI am very angry,\u201d said Jia Rui, 24, who bought a Center Park apartment a year ago. He watched last year as property prices rose for months before deciding to buy the apartment, which will be bigger than the one he currently lives in with his wife and parents. When he learned that similar apartments were later being sold at nearly half the price, Mr. Jia said, he felt helpless.\u201cIt is not possible to get a refund,\u201d Mr. Jia said. Then again, he added, Jurong will have a subway line connecting it to Nanjing, a major city, by 2023. \u201cMaybe the price will go back up by then,\u201d he said.\u201cYou never know when the music will stop in China, so you try to do as much as possible before the music stops,\u201d said Nicole Wong, a property analyst at CLSA, a stock brokerage. \u201cWhich it did.\u201dThat store of wealth is looking increasingly shaky. Sales in terms of gross floor area on the market have dropped sharply since September. The share of apartments in new developments that are being sold has plunged since the summer. The number of failed land auctions has doubled this year, indicating that property developers are unwilling or unable to buy land for new developments.Now people are angry, and Chinese officials and property developers are doing something about it. Officials tried various measures to take steam out of the market last year and are now reversing some of them. In recent months, they have loosened mortgage requirements, eased restrictions on when homeowners can resell their properties and made it easier for university students to continue living in the cities where they are studying after they graduate, potentially increasing housing demand. In some cities, property developers have cut deals with home buyers to give them back the difference between the current price and the one they originally paid.As housing prices begin to fall \u2014 in some cities by as much as they did during the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009 \u2014 some buyers have made their displeasure known. Jurong, a small city by Chinese standards of 600,000 people about a 45-minute drive from Nanjing, has experienced at least six protests alone in recent months.Jurong represents a bet by home buyers that a buoyant market in Nanjing, a former Chinese capital and one of its more picturesque cities, will spread to surrounding areas. Many home buyers are retired workers or farmers who have moved to the city from the surrounding countryside.Today the city appears to be preparing for a future in which its population more than doubles. There are 19 other projects like Center Park.Country Garden, the developer behind Center Park and other residential complexes around the country, has endured slumping sales and has slashed prices. It has faced fury from buyers, some of whom have taken to smashing in the windows of sales offices in at least one city, according to the local news media, which posted images and video. In a written statement, Country Garden said fluctuating home prices were \u201ca normal market phenomenon\u201d and said it would \u201cmake proper arrangements\u201d to assuage angry home buyers.Hu Peiliang, the real estate agent in Jurong, and his friend Wang Liwei were selling homes in Nanjing before they decided to make the move to Jurong. If prices were so high in Nanjing, it seemed only logical to both men that prospective buyers who were unable to afford a place there \u2014 or who were locked out of the market because of residential restrictions \u2014 would look to Jurong. The government\u2019s plan to build a metro system made the city even more appealing.At first they were right. In 2016, some 49,000 apartments were sold in Jurong, a remarkable number for a city where the annual average is closer to 4,000, according to Huifeng Li, a research director at the Purple Mountain Digital New Media Research Institute in Nanjing. The majority of the new buyers these days are speculators, he said.Mr. Hu added: \u201cMostly it\u2019s buyers who are looking for investments who come here. They see opportunities here.\u201d Hundreds of buildings sprang up, offering a glimpse of a future bustling city. Now, these partly constructed buildings have more of a ghost town feel.At the Center Park development site, green netting drapes over a dozen half-built apartment buildings, construction cranes on top of each. Men with white gloves stand at the sales office, from which soft jazz music is playing, waiting to greet prospective buyers. But there are few customers, and the greeters mostly look bored.At the back of the office, a dozen real estate agents sit around coffee tables and stare at their phones.After a tour of the show apartments, Mr. Wang said quietly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy an apartment from them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats in New Jersey Have a Firm Grip on Power. They Want Even More.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRENTON \u2014 Legislative power brokers across the country have long designed district lines in back-room deals that entrenched their control for years, if not decades. But now, Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey are carrying out a power grab in an unusually public fashion: They are seeking to make Republicans a permanent minority by essentially writing gerrymandering into the State Constitution.The New Jersey plan comes amid a national reckoning over the consequences of gerrymandering and has been met by fierce opposition across the political landscape \u2014 and not just from Republicans and nonpartisan watchdog groups.Republicans have also come under fire for legislative gerrymandering in states like North Carolina.Eric H. Holder Jr., a former attorney general under President Barack Obama and a potential presidential candidate in 2020, called on the Democratic lawmakers in the New Jersey Legislature, who have significant majorities in both chambers, to rethink their plan.\u201cThe American people want redistricting reforms that help level the playing field so that elections are decided on who has the best ideas, not which party was in charge of drawing the lines,\u201d Mr. Holder said in a statement.\u201cAs currently constructed, the proposal in New Jersey fails to live up to those standards,\u201d he said.The Democratic lawmakers\u2019 proposal would amend the New Jersey Constitution, and New Jersey voters would need to approve it through a ballot measure.It overhauls the makeup of a redistricting committee to give more power to legislative leaders. It also establishes a \u201cfairness test\u201d requiring district maps to reflect how major political parties perform in statewide elections for governor, senator and president.In New Jersey, which has not elected a Republican senator since 1972 and where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 1 million voters, that standard ensures that the redistricting process would begin on an uneven playing field. (New Jersey did elect a Republican governor in 2013, but the state has been trending Democratic.)\u201cIt institutionally strips away the will of the voter,\u201d said Tom Kean Jr., the Republican leader in the Senate. \u201cThe will of the Republicans and unaffiliated voters in New Jersey would be ignored to the benefit of incumbent majority party legislators forever more.\u201dProponents of the plan, Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president, and Nicholas P. Scutari, a co-sponsor of the bill, argue that the redistricting process is too often conducted behind closed doors by unelected officials and where deals are hashed out without any voter input.By putting their plan before the electorate, supporters argue, New Jersey Democrats are letting voters decide how redistricting should be done.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing gerrymandering about it,\u201d Mr. Scutari said. \u201cIf we have a significant advantage in voters, then you\u2019re going to have a significant difference in legislative districts. If you took this matrix of guidelines and put it in Texas, you\u2019d probably get significantly more legislative districts that favored Republicans.\u2019\u2019At two separate hearings on Thursday in Trenton, over 100 people testified against the proposal. The sole note of support in the Senate came from Mr. Scutari.Democratic leaders are turning to an obscure legislative maneuver just to try to put the proposal on the ballot.Typically, a proposed constitutional amendment requires a three-fifths majority in the state legislature before it can get on the ballot. But since no Republican supports the redistricting plan, it seems unlikely that it would ever succeed in either chamber in Trenton.Instead, Democratic leaders are digging into the state\u2019s laws and using a provision allowing an amendment that passes the state legislature with a simple majority in two consecutive calendar years to be placed on the ballot.Democrats have scheduled a vote on the redistricting plan for Monday, the final day the legislature is to meet this year. Then they are likely to bring it up again in early January, satisfying the two-year requirement in less than a month. Should the measure pass in both instances, the proposal could be put on the ballot in November.The quick procedural move, in particular, has provoked an outcry, including from Gov. Philip D. Murphy. Though Mr. Murphy is a Democrat, the redistricting plan would greatly weaken his ability to influence the process.\u201cI have as much a concern about the process as I do even about the substance,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the substance, but this is classic jam something through, and I got elected to stand up against that and I\u2019m going to.\u201dThe plan makes significant changes to the way the state\u2019s redistricting commission is established. Currently, the Republican and Democratic state party chairs each nominate five people to the redistricting board, and the state Supreme Court selects someone to serve as the tiebreaker. Mr. Murphy is closely allied with the chairman of the Democratic state party, John Currie, giving the governor sway over some of the commission\u2019s members.The redistricting plan would increase the size of the commission by two members, to 13, and state party chairs would only be allowed two nominees each. The Senate president, Senate minority leader, Assembly speaker and Assembly minority leader would each get to nominate two members, at least one of which must be a state legislator.The notion of including legislators on panels that draw legislative districts runs counter to what many advocates for redistricting reform are demanding and the approach that other states are taking.But the main criticism of New Jersey\u2019s plan centers on setting the benchmark for drawing districts based on statewide election results.In effect, competitive districts could still have Democratic majorities of as much as 60 percent.\u201cThe map becomes permanently slanted,\u2019\u2019 said Patrick Murray, the director of polling at Monmouth University. He noted that of the state\u2019s 40 legislative districts, at least 25 would have to be majority Democratic under the redistricting proposal.\u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite of where the reform movements are going right now,\u201d Mr. Murray added. \u201cNot only are they using formulas to give one party an advantage over another, but they\u2019re actually moving away from considering political metrics in their drawing of districts. That includes past vote, voter registration, where incumbents live and a whole host of other things. So this is even a step backward from what the national Democrats are doing.\u201dThe proposal also creates the possibility that Democrats could redraw competitive districts around safe incumbents who have enough support that they would win even with more Republicans added to their district. Party leaders could then add more Democrats to weaker districts.This scenario has provoked strong criticism from Democratic incumbents who tend to win by large margins in Democratic strongholds like Hudson County in northern New Jersey. \u201cThis proposal would create an imbalance of power with representation of North Jersey counties being diluted in the legislature,\u201d Senator Nicholas Sacco of Hudson County said in a statement, \u201cand given that our region is continuing to grow and propel the state\u2019s economy forward that outcome would be fundamentally unfair.\u201dA growing backlash against the redistricting plan has left the fate of the proposal unclear with just a thin margin of support among Democrats in the Senate.\u201cIf they succeed, and I hope they don\u2019t, I will fight it right through to the ballot box, and you should assume that we ain\u2019t giving up this fight,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cI\u2019m a proud Democrat, let there be no doubt. I want to win stuff fair and square, and this is not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "George H.W. Bush, Public Servant", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Yet, at the moment of his passing, it is difficult not to take note of the profound differences between the 41st president of the United States and the current occupant of the White House, Donald Trump. Beyond a desire to be president \u2014 Mr. Bush was more competitive and ambitious than his self-effacing personality sometimes suggested \u2014 there is almost nothing in common: the one gracious and modest, the other rude and vain; the one prudent, the other brash; the one steady, the other unmoored.Mr. Bush\u2019s death on Friday is also a moment to recall a less quarrelsome political order, when relations with traditional allies were more cordial than combative, when government attracted people of talent and integrity for whom public service offered a purpose higher than self-enrichment, when the Republican Party, though slowly slipping into the tentacles of zealots like Newt Gingrich, still offered room for people with pragmatic policies and sensible dispositions.Mr. Bush\u2019s tenure was shorter than he had hoped, and ended ingloriously in a lopsided defeat at the hands of an upstart governor from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, presaged by a huge drop in Mr. Bush\u2019s approval rating from nearly 90 percent at the time of the 1991 Gulf War to the mid-30s in the summer before the election. Fingers pointed in every direction after his defeat \u2014 a deteriorating economy, a divisive convention in Houston, a disjointed campaign. But one big reason for Mr. Bush\u2019s precipitous fall was Mr. Bush himself, chiefly his inability to convince Americans that he understood the depth of their fears or could summon up a coherent plan for addressing them.What Mr. Bush had impatiently dismissed as \u201cthe vision thing\u201d \u2014 in an interview with a Time magazine writer in 1987 who had pressed him for his governing philosophy \u2014 turned out to be precisely what the voters found missing in him five years later. Even after four years as president and a quarter-century in public life, Mr. Bush seemed to many Americans a distant and diffident figure, a caretaker without strong purpose or compelling strategy.Mr. Bush\u2019s political persona was no less baffling. He could be charming on the campaign trail, sometimes in an endearingly goofy way. On that same foray into New Hampshire he got so wound up trying to show his down-home persona by quoting a song from the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band that he called the band \u201cthe Nitty Ditty Nitty Gritty Great Bird.\u201d On another occasion, he referred to the endangered spotted owl, a source of contention among loggers in the Pacific Northwest, as \u201cthat little furry-feathery guy.\u201dYet, often in the heat of combat, Mr. Bush\u2019s good manners and amiable disposition gave way to bombast and shrill exploitation of fears of race and crime. His 1988 campaign infamously strove to tie his opponent, Michael Dukakis, to an African-American named Willie Horton who committed rape after being released on a weekend furlough program \u2014 an effort for which Mr. Bush\u2019s attack-dog campaign manager, Lee Atwater, later apologized.So hapless was Mr. Bush\u2019s last year in office that it was easy to overlook his early successes. He began smartly, moving quickly to end the ideological combat of the Reagan years, broke cleanly on environmental issues with his indifferent predecessor \u2014 the upgrade of the nation\u2019s clean air laws was a major achievement \u2014 faced up to the savings and loan scandal and offered creative approaches to the debt of developing nations, especially in Latin America.His second big achievement was the skillful orchestration over many months of a collective global response to Iraq\u2019s aggression in the Persian Gulf. A war that began on January 17, 1991, was over in weeks, with Saddam Hussein\u2019s air force neutralized and his ground troops on the run.Some critics have said that Mr. Hussein would not have been so bold as to invade Kuwait had Washington not shamelessly cultivated him over the years; others faulted Mr. Bush for not pushing Mr. Hussein all the way back to Baghdad and removing him from power. Such a course, Mr. Bush said later, would have \u201cincurred incalculable human and political costs \u2026 We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq.\u201d Which is exactly what his son, George W. Bush, a less cautious man, set out to do 12 years later \u2014 with disastrous results.Behind these and other successes \u2014 removing a dictator from Panama, ending a crippling debate over Nicaragua \u2014 lay an ability to muster a principled explanation of his objectives and a willingness to exercise the power of his office to achieve them. Would that he had summoned the same resolve on matters closer to home. Even when he did something that was both courageous and right, like reversing his famous \u201cread my lips, no new taxes\u201d pledge at the convention that nominated him in 1988, he failed to defend the reversal coherently. Worse, in that case, he apologized for it.Perhaps, in a second term, Mr. Bush might have found a clearer sense of direction on domestic issues. We will never know. But if he is measured by his leadership and choices on the global stage, historians will almost certainly treat him more kindly than the voters did in 1992.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growth of Health Care Spending Slowed Last Year", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The growth of national health spending, which surged as millions of Americans gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, slowed last year, the Trump administration said on Thursday.Health spending in the United States totaled $3.5 trillion last year, up 3.9 percent from 2016, or about $10,740 a person. It accounted for 17.9 percent of the economy, officials said.But the rate of increase for the major categories \u2014 drugs, doctors and hospitals \u2014 was more modest than in recent years.For the first time in several years, health spending grew at about the same rate as the economy as a whole in 2017. So the share of the economy devoted to health care stabilized. By contrast, over the past few decades, health spending has generally grown faster than the economy.The 3.9 percent increase last year \u2014 down from 4.8 percent in 2016 \u2014 was the lowest since 2013.\u201cThe relatively low rate of health spending growth in 2017 was similar to the average annual growth during 2008-13, which predated the major coverage expansions,\u201d said Anne B. Martin, an economist in the office of the actuary at the Department of Health and Human Services.In addition, more people with insurance have high-deductible health plans, which tend to make them cost-conscious because they are personally responsible for a larger share of their medical costs.Health spending grew rapidly in 2014 and 2015 because of the expansion of Medicaid and private insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, as well as the use of expensive but highly effective new drugs to treat hepatitis C.The Affordable Care Act was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010, and the main provisions expanding coverage took effect in 2014.Federal spending on health care shot up nearly 11 percent in 2014, mainly because of the expansion of Medicaid, but the growth has slowed every year since then, the report said. Federal spending on health care totaled nearly $1 trillion last year, and that does not count the huge tax subsidies for health care and coverage.Spending on Medicaid, which now covers more than 70 million low-income people and is financed jointly by the federal government and the states, continued to grow in 2017, reaching a total of $582 billion, the report said. But the rate of growth slowed for the third straight year.Medicaid spending \u2014 the total of federal, state and local funds combined \u2014 increased last year by 2.9 percent, following growth of 11.8 percent in 2014, then 9 percent in 2015 and 4.2 percent in 2016, the administration reported.President Trump and Republicans in Congress tried last year to roll back the expansion of Medicaid, but ultimately failed.Federal Medicaid payments increased less than 1 percent last year, following growth of 4.6 percent in 2016 and double-digit growth in 2014 and 2015.Despite alarm over high drug prices, the administration reported that spending on prescription drugs at pharmacies, grocery stores and other retail outlets increased last year by just four-tenths of 1 percent, to $333 billion. That was the slowest growth since 2012, when many blockbuster drugs lost patent protection, driving down prices and total spending.Those figures do not include spending on drugs in hospitals, where patients receive some of the most expensive drugs.Declines in generic drug prices, lower price increases for existing brand-name drugs and a reduction in the number of prescriptions for pain medications contributed to the slower growth in drug spending last year, the administration said.The growth of Medicare spending for hospital care also slowed last year, and federal officials said one reason was increased enrollment in private Medicare plans. Older Americans in these private Medicare Advantage plans \u201ctend to use more physician and less hospital services,\u201d compared with people in the original government-run Medicare program, the study in Health Affairs said.More than one-third of the 60 million Medicare beneficiaries are in private plans, offered by companies like Humana and UnitedHealth.Although the United States spends more on health care per person than any other country, the growth of spending here has slowed in the last decade.\u201cHealth care spending growth averaged 4.3 percent per year during 2008-17, compared to an average annual rate of 7.3 percent over the 1998-2007 period,\u201d the report said.Household spending on health care also slowed last year, increasing 3.8 percent after growth of 4.8 percent in 2016. The main reason, officials said, was slower growth in consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket spending, which includes co-payments, deductibles and payments for services not covered by insurance.Out-of-pocket spending grew 2.6 percent last year, to $365.5 billion, which was slower than the 4.4 percent growth in 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yuan Mu, Face of China\u2019s Tiananmen Square Crackdown, Dies at 90", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYuan Mu, a Communist Party propaganda official who defended the Chinese military\u2019s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square in 1989, died on Dec. 13 in Beijing. He was 90.But Mr. Yuan is mainly remembered as the public defender of the government\u2019s response to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in Beijing in June 1989; the repression resulted in the deaths of hundreds of pro-democracy protesters and bystanders, perhaps more, when troops were ordered to open fire on them.Mr. Yuan made the government\u2019s first extensive public comments on the crackdown two days later, playing down the military\u2019s responsibility for the violence and casualties.That same month, he told Tom Brokaw of NBC News that \u201cnot one person\u201d had died in the square on the day it was cleared of protesters.Mr. Yuan moved into government work in the 1970s, putting his journalistic background to use in drafting party and government documents before becoming a spokesman.As the government\u2019s public face during the tumultuous late 1980s, Mr. Yuan had to navigate the leaders\u2019 shifting and divided positions as students and intellectuals mobilized to demand political liberalization and an end to official corruption.As for the international outcry over the bloodshed in Beijing, Mr. Yuan said China could put up with any reprisals by foreign governments.\u201cWe are not afraid of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe Chinese people will not allow them to interfere in China\u2019s domestic affairs, either by condemnations or by sanctions.\u201dZhang Lifan, an independent historian in Beijing, said of Mr. Yuan that the events of June 1989 had \u201cnailed him to the pillory of history.\u201d\u201cIf he had stayed a reporter, he might not have become a high-ranking official,\u201d said Mr. Zhang, who left the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences after 1989. \u201cBut at least he wouldn\u2019t have become infamous.\u201dMr. Yuan\u2019s performance in June 1989 did not derail his career. He remained a government spokesman even after the Communist Party leader, Zhao Ziyang, was purged later that year for having supported students during the Tiananmen Square protests.Mr. Pomfret said that Mr. Yuan\u2019s ability to \u201cskate over\u201d a factional battle between Mr. Zhao, who supported a more liberal version of Chinese Communism, and Mr. Li, a conservative hard-liner, testified to his instinct for political survival.Years after the Tiananmen episode, Mr. Yuan played down his role in interviews with reporters.Mr. Yuan finished his career as a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body; he stepped down in 2000.In 2012, after the mother of a 17-year-old who had died in the crackdown asked Mr. Yuan to \u201ccome clean\u201d about the government\u2019s armed suppression of protests, he said he did not know much about it.The Chinese state news media have rarely mentioned Mr. Yuan over the years, and initial reports about his death were removed from Chinese websites.That report also said that Chinese leaders, past and present, sent floral tributes to Mr. Yuan\u2019s funeral, including Premier Li Keqiang, former President Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, the former premier whose policies Mr. Yuan had defended.\u201cConfronted with grave and complex developments internationally and domestically, he thoroughly promoted the policy directions of the party and government,\u201d an account of Mr. Yuan\u2019s life issued at his funeral said, according to the Hong Kong report. \u201cIn particular, at a crucial moment, his stance was firm and clear.\u201dZoe Mou and Chris Buckley contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chat With Progressive Leaders About the Future of the Left", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.During the Trump era, Democrats have largely been able to avoid making tough choices. With little power, their most pressing question has been whether to object to everything the president does or just, you know, most things.That all ends in two weeks.When they take over control of the House in January, Democrats will gain real legislative and investigative power \u2014 and will carry the burden of making decisions. And the three dozen Democrats flirting with a presidential run will quickly have to decide whether to actually take the plunge.With all of those decisions over the next year, there\u2019s sure to be a robust debate about what the future of the Democratic Party looks like. A big part of that discussion will center on the progressive wing \u2014 what they want, what they believe and how they\u2019re shaping the presidential race.It was an expansive, 45-minute conversation, which we had to condense quite a bit for the newsletter. Here\u2019s what they had to say about their new roles, 2020 and how progressivism is changing.LISA: So you three are all relatively new in your jobs. Nina, you took the helm at Our Revolution about 18 months ago. Maurice, you started as the director of the Working Families Party in April. And Yvette, you\u2019ll become the CEO of Democracy for America next year.What do your appointments say about the state of the progressive movement?It\u2019s the idea that when brown and black people lead us, we not only take care of brown and black people, we take care of all the people. You all mentioned that there\u2019s this perception that \u201cprogressive\u201d means white. Why do you think that has persisted?If you look at a traditional Democratic Party, unfortunately, black folks and the issues of black folks haven\u2019t always been front and center, even though our vote and our movements and our strategies have been utilized in order to get elected. But I feel like this is a political realignment that we\u2019re experiencing, where black leadership is central.But what Maurice is saying, and what Nina said, is that is just not true.But I would argue that progressivism is by its very nature black, because you have to be progressive when you fight against the system that is treating you like a second-class citizen. Hopefully our very presence as the leaders of three very strong organizations says to the world, you need to tell the story differently. Now the lion is telling the story. We\u2019re having a conversation that\u2019s a lot about representation. And we could see a presidential field with multiple African-American candidates and multiple female candidates. What advice would you be giving those people?Number two, this is the time to be bold and be unapologetic in your agenda. And we want to see that. People who have been on the bubble too long, they use words like bipartisanship. The person down on the ground could care less about how you would get along with the person next to you. They want to know whether you\u2019re going make a change, if you\u2019ve got to do that by hook or by crook, by any means necessary. They want to see change in their real lives.I was preaching there a little bit, Nina, did you see that?And in 2020 we have a pivotal opportunity to do some course-correction in the country and hopefully give people a real choice. And I\u2019m going to say to Democrats not to equivocate at all who they are standing for, because we already know who the Republican president is standing for. So this 2020 opportunity, this is real in the field. It\u2019s go time.What I would say is we\u2019re not going to fall for the \u201cokie dokie,\u201d in the sense that somebody could just signal through cultural signifiers and identity that they\u2019re down with a particular set of politics or a movement. People have to show and prove, not just based on the fact that they might occupy a certain identity. We need to see it in their voting record, in the issues that they champion.It\u2019s easy in the moment of the \u201cresistance\u201d to signal that you\u2019re down with the resistance. But I\u2019m less interested in what you\u2019re against \u2014 I\u2019m interested in what you\u2019re for. The prerequisite for sanity in this country is to have an opposition to the Trump movement. What sways me is what you\u2019re trying to build. Which side were you on previous to the moment that you decided to take the mantle?____________________A note to On Politics readers: It\u2019s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. (And a lot like vacation.) We\u2019re taking off for the holidays. Best wishes for everything merry and bright. We\u2019ll see you in 2019!____________________It was only last November that President Trump and Jerome H. Powell walked together into the White House Rose Garden, where Mr. Trump introduced Mr. Powell as his choice to become the chairman of the Federal Reserve.\u201cHe\u2019s strong,\u201d said Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s committed. He\u2019s smart.\u201dBut that was before Mr. Powell started raising interest rates.Now Mr. Trump has taken to describing Mr. Powell as a \u201cgood man\u201d who keeps making mistakes. The Fed, he says, should stop raising rates. Its march toward higher rates is \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cfoolish,\u201d \u201cout of control.\u201dWhat happened to the warm regard Mr. Trump expressed just one year ago? The short answer is that Mr. Trump fears Mr. Powell, who holds a job sometimes described as the second-most powerful in Washington.Two key facts: The Fed is an independent agency; it answers to Congress, not the president. And it has considerable influence over the re-election prospects of any president, because it can drive the economy into a recession.Unlike many past Fed-White House duos, Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell do not have a personal relationship. They have rarely spoken with each other, although they have plenty of mutual acquaintances. Most notably, Mr. Powell regularly eats breakfast with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.Presidents often seek to put pressure on the Fed through such private channels, although it sometimes takes decades for the details to emerge.Mr. Trump, unusually, has decided to go public with his grievances, and Mr. Powell has responded with public displays of grim-faced, insistent indifference. The Fed, he says, does not take advice from politicians. It does not answer to the president. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said on Wednesday, after announcing another rate increase, \u201cwill deter us from doing exactly what we think is the right thing to do.\u201dMr. Trump, in his more reflective moments of public commentary, has said that he misjudged a man he barely knew. As Mr. Trump said of Mr. Powell in October, sounding rather glum, \u201cHe was supposed to be a low interest rate guy.\u201d_____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "Looking for \u2018New York\u2019s Secret Weapon\u2019? For the Next 42 Months, Try Prison", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis conviction further tarnished the reputation of a Capitol already known for corruption headlines, and cast a shadow on the development projects that Mr. Cuomo has made a centerpiece of his administration. (The governor has not been accused of any wrongdoing.)\u201cKaloyeros\u2019s willingness to lie and cheat tainted the Buffalo Billions with fraud and cynicism,\u201d the judge, Valerie E. Caproni, said before imposing the sentence, which also included a $100,000 fine.She told Dr. Kaloyeros that his prosecution \u201cshould serve as a warning to others in government everywhere: You are serving the public.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t live with that,\u201d she said, \u201cthen get out of government.\u201dDr. Kaloyeros, in brief comments to the judge, said the harm done to his family, former colleagues and taxpayers weighed heavily upon him.\u201cI feel an enormous responsibility for the hurt and loss I have caused others,\u201d he said.Dr. Kaloyeros is the last major defendant to be sentenced in a series of state corruption prosecutions first announced nearly four years ago by Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, in what he made a campaign against Albany\u2019s culture of secrecy and influence peddling.The government did not allege that Dr. Kaloyeros profited financially through the bid-rigging scheme, but rather that he used it to strengthen his relationship with Todd R. Howe, a former lobbyist with ties to Mr. Cuomo, and with the governor himself.Judge Caproni suggested the same motive in her remarks. While she called the lack of monetary gain a significant mitigating factor, \u201cregardless of whether he profited financially, he profited politically,\u201d she said.\u201cHe let his desire to earn Brownie points in the executive chamber overcome the normal, well-thought-out processes that treated all developers fairly,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether they were giving money to Cuomo campaign coffers or not.\u201dShe also noted that Dr. Kaloyeros had deleted incriminating emails from a personal account, an act that prosecutors had portrayed as an attempt to obstruct the investigation.Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement after the hearing that \u201cpublic corruption \u2014 especially at such a disconcertingly high level in Albany \u2014 contributes to the frustration and eroding faith\u201d of New Yorkers in their government.Mr. Berman\u2019s office had recommended a \u201csubstantial\u201d term of imprisonment for Dr. Kaloyeros. Matthew Podolsky, a prosecutor, acknowledged in court that Dr. Kaloyeros had been a titan in his field who had made \u201creal contributions to the economy of New York State.\u201dBut ultimately, Mr. Podolsky said, Dr. Kaloyeros decided that his loyalty lay not with taxpayers, but with preserving his own influence.\u201cWhen Dr. Kaloyeros\u2019s power was at risk, and when he wanted to expand that power, he was willing to abuse the authority that was conferred on him,\u201d he said.According to prosecutors, Dr. Kaloyeros and Mr. Howe had conspired to award lucrative contracts to two firms \u2014 LPCiminelli, a Buffalo construction management firm, and COR Development, a Syracuse-area company \u2014 whose executives were major donors to Mr. Cuomo.They said that Dr. Kaloyeros and Mr. Howe had tailored requests for proposals to fit the special qualifications of the two firms, both clients of Mr. Howe\u2019s, and to ensure that they were chosen for the projects.They accused Dr. Kaloyeros of engineering the plan to tailor the requests and said that he himself had sat at his computer to draft the \u201cfraudulent language\u201d they contained.LPCiminelli received a contract to build what became a $750 million solar-panel plant on the banks of the Buffalo River, while COR received contracts worth more than $100 million on other projects.Dr. Kaloyeros\u2019s lawyers, arguing for leniency, underscored that the scheme had yielded no financial gain for their client and had been aimed at furthering the state\u2019s revitalization. They asked for a sentence at the low end of a range of four to 10 months.After the hearing, the lawyers, Reid H. Weingarten and Michael C. Miller, called their client an innocent man who would appeal his conviction.\u201cAlain committed no crimes in connection with his work on the Buffalo Billion program,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cHe attempted at every stage to make sure that the people of the State of New York got the right contractor for the right job at the right price.\u201dAlong with Dr. Kaloyeros and Mr. Percoco, others convicted in the series of federal corruption trials in Manhattan were Sheldon Silver, the former powerful Democratic Assembly speaker; Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican Senate majority leader; and several executives whose firms did business with the state and who were major donors to Mr. Cuomo.

{"Headline": "With Early Israel Elections, Netanyahu Banks on Strengthening Support", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s governing coalition said on Monday that the country would hold elections in early April \u2014 an abrupt move that experts said was largely aimed at bolstering public support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he battles multiple corruption investigations.The immediate spark for calling the election was a brewing crisis over a proposed law to regulate the enlistment of ultra-Orthodox men in the military. The measure requires approval by a court-imposed deadline of Jan. 15, but does not have enough support to pass in Parliament.But Mr. Netanyahu is suspected of bribery and other crimes in three graft cases. The attorney general is expected to decide by the spring whether to prosecute him and, if so, on what charges.Mr. Netanyahu had previously said he wanted the government to complete its full term, which is scheduled to end next November.\u201cNetanyahu obviously has finally decided that he wants elections and he wants them fast,\u201d said Reuven Hazan, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.As the corruption investigations progressed, Professor Hazan told reporters, Mr. Netanyahu saw the possibility of prosecution as an increasingly serious threat.\u201cThe last thing he needs in the midst of an election campaign is the attorney general deciding to prosecute him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants to pre-empt this. He wants to win.\u201dThe professor continued: \u201cHe wants to turn around to the attorney general and say: \u2018Before you decide to prosecute me, pay attention. The people of Israel have re-elected me for a fourth time\u2019 \u2014 hopefully he will be able to say with more seats than ever before \u2014 \u2018You cannot overturn the results of a democratic election.\u2019\u201dAsked by a reporter whether he expected the attorney general to postpone a decision until after the election campaign, perhaps not wanting to be seen as swaying the outcome, Mr. Netanyahu replied, \u201cI have no expectations.\u201dPolitical analysts said the dispute over the enlistment law provided Mr. Netanyahu with a convenient premise for calling an early election, allowing him to blame the ultra-Orthodox politicians within his coalition and the opposition parties who are against the legislation.The looming crisis over the law allowed Mr. Netanyahu to control the timing both of the dissolution of Parliament, expected later this week, and of the next elections, which are expected to take place on April 9.Still, elections can be a gamble for Mr. Netanyahu, who is banking on winning a fourth consecutive term in office, and his fifth over all.Despite the corruption investigations, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s popularity does not appear to have been seriously dented, and his conservative party, Likud, performs far better than any other in polls.This is in part because many Israelis do not consider any of his current opponents on the right, in the center or on the left as qualified to be prime minister.Mr. Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister since David Ben-Gurion, has been in power for most of the past decade, in addition to serving a three-year term as leader in the 1990s.Speaking to a Likud party faction meeting in a live broadcast from the Parliament building shortly after the election announcement on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu opened his re-election campaign by listing what he called the \u201cgreat achievements\u201d of his departing government, including in security, the economy, transportation, tourism and infrastructure.\u201cWe will win,\u201d he said.He added that he saw his current coalition, made up of right-wing and religious parties, as the \u201cnucleus\u201d of the next coalition.When Mr. Lieberman stepped down, he cited the government\u2019s handling of the simmering conflict with Hamas in Gaza, calling its approach too tolerantSince then, Mr. Netanyahu has burnished his image as Israel\u2019s top security chief.He took on the role of defense minister, and the military began a campaign in the north to expose and block tunnels dug by Hezbollah beneath the border from Lebanon, diverting media attention away from Gaza and from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s political and legal problems.But Mr. Netanyahu arouses bitter opposition from critics who say he has used his years in power to entrench Israel\u2019s settlement project in the West Bank and to stave off a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as to try to curb the influence of the courts, critical news media and other liberal forces in Israeli society.Members of the political opposition celebrated the announcement of new elections.New, potentially strong opponents may now join the race, like Benny Gantz, a former military chief of staff who has been waiting in the wings, and could even try to bring the center-left parties together to run as a united bloc.And some analysts suggested that the attorney general could now face public pressure to expedite his decision regarding a possible indictment of Mr. Netanyahu.Orit Galili-Zucker, a former strategic communications adviser to Mr. Netanyahu and a political branding expert, said she would not rely on the polls\u2019 pointing to a Netanyahu victory, adding that pre-election polls \u201chave not been accurate in the past.\u201dIn addition, she said, the Israeli public has been exposed to a lot of embarrassing details from the investigations into Mr. Netanyahu over a long period that, cumulatively, could harm him.\u201cHe could find himself out of the prime minister\u2019s office and out of history,\u201d Ms. Galili-Zucker said, \u201chaving been defeated not on ideological grounds, but on personal grounds.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Top 10 New Restaurants of 2018", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurantsIn an unsettling year, Pete Wells finds many reasons to cheer. Staying focused on the soups and pies wasn\u2019t always easy this year. At the same time, everybody who writes about restaurants was still trying to metabolize last year\u2019s dismal revelations about the way some major chefs and proprietors are said to treat women in their establishments. We all know that we are in a new place, but its contours aren\u2019t firm yet. Each new turn in those stories started a fresh round of questions about restaurant culture and what its future should look like. Simultaneously, incidents of overt racism, sexism and anti-immigrant animus in the national news made it seem more urgent to face those problems in the restaurant business, where they are often so deeply embedded that they\u2019re taken for granted. But after I\u2019d complained in print that hoteliers and developers were handing too many plum projects to the same people who\u2019ve always gotten them, I was glad that a major builder in Brooklyn gave Missy Robbins the chance to build Misi in the redevelopment of the Domino refinery site. I was thrilled that when the Life Hotel couldn\u2019t make its new restaurant, Henry, work, it called in J.J. Johnson, a black chef with ambitious ideas about African food.And sometimes, I got to cheer for an entire cuisine. This year I watched a chef and his wife, both born in South Korea, open a restaurant that presents Korean food and culture in a new and often revelatory light. Its name is Atomix, and it easily won its spot at the top of my list.\u2605\u2605\u2605A restaurant isn\u2019t a particularly good medium for expressing philosophical concepts, but it\u2019s ideal for expressing a whole culture. Atomix seizes this opportunity to open our eyes to South Korea over the span of a $175, 10-course tasting menu. The architecture, uniforms, ceramics, glassware, woodworking and menu art blend tradition and innovation to present a living, modern view of Korean aesthetics. Junghyun Park, the chef, builds dazzling, unexpected dishes out of things like white soy and an exhilarating tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. The dishes are elaborate, with upward of 20 ingredients on some plates, but they never go out of focus. The whole restaurant is like that.\u2605\u2605\u2605The chefs, Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr, are veterans of the pseudo-brasserie scene who have finally opened their own restaurant after 20 years of cooking together in someone else\u2019s. Their menu is a skillful and refined homage to the heart-stopping food served at a few old-time places around Les Halles in Paris; it includes snails, brains, tripe, tongue and other things that don\u2019t exactly sell themselves in the United States. This might cause trouble with the chefs\u2019 boss it if they had one, but they don\u2019t, and they know just what they\u2019re doing. The organ meats are beautifully handled. So are less confrontational items like duck breast with paradigmatic fries and roast chicken served over planks of baguette laden with rotisserie drippings. Frenchette also happens to have one of the broadest and most drinkable collections of natural wine in the city. The wines taste idiosyncratic and unbridled, just the thing for food that is a celebration of sticking around long enough to do what you want.\u2605\u2605\u2605New York is filling up with omakase sushi meals so quickly it\u2019s hard to keep them straight, but 69 Leonard Street is one address to write on the back of your hand. The first half of the menu (available at three different lengths costing $190, $252 and $295) weaves some local ingredients into dishes that roughly follow the kaiseki format. This is a chance for the chef, Derek Wilcox, to freestyle a bit within that tradition\u2019s prescribed boundaries, resulting in memorable hybrids like a late-summer chawan mushi made with East Coast lobster. The second half is a sequence of exceptional sushi, sliced and seasoned in the gimmick-free Edo manner. Either the sushi or kaiseki segments alone would be among the best of their type in the city, but the only place that does both this well is Shoji.\u2605\u2605\u2605Missy Robbins has become the city\u2019s leading practitioner of the bright, energetic, produce-centered branch of Italian cooking. Even in the winter, her food tastes like the afternoon sun beating down on a tomato patch. Misi is Missy (get it?) pared down to the things that show her skill off to greatest advantage, pasta and vegetables. The noodles, made on site, are a catalog of shapes, from long strangozzi with pork rag\u00f9 to round, flat corzetti with cherry tomatoes warmed just enough to break their skins. For dessert there are six flavors of gelato, all with the same intensity and immediacy as the rest of the meal.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605The only rough patch at this breakfast-through-dinner cafe comes at the beginning, when your server informs you that every piece of tableware can be purchased at the adjoining shop. After that it\u2019s all as smooth as the melted butter in the pans where the crisp, savory buckwheat crepes are sizzled. Marie-Aude Rose, the chef, applies classical precision to eggs, salads, bouillon, boeuf bourguignon and other French cafe standards, which is more than you can say for some cafes in France.\u2605\u2605Mako Okano, the chef of this little Japanese hide-out on Delancey Street, loves shabu shabu so much that she decided to open a restaurant where she would cook it for every customer. Normally, it\u2019s a do-it-yourself affair, but Ms. Okano\u2019s evident pleasure in taking care of people brings a touching intimacy to the simple process of dunking meat and vegetables into hot broth. The shabu shabu meats are superb, from Wagyu beef crammed with fat streaks to exquisite chicken meatballs. But she has a lovely touch at the stove, too, whipping up an airy omelet before you notice her back is turned, or skimming swatches of yuba from hot soy milk to serve as a warm bed for a tongue or two of sea urchin.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605The Oaxacan food at Claro isn\u2019t the uncut stuff you\u2019d find in Mexico; kale and sunchokes are in play, for one thing. But T.J. Steele, the chef, is serious about his moles, which show off the different traits of various chiles in deep, complex layers. Pork cheek, for instance, is stewed in a mole rojo with a beguiling undercurrent of chocolate. Masa, which can be dismal in New York City, is ground and nixtamalized in the restaurant, and makes a delicious foundation for about half the things on the menu. Mr. Steele, who lives part-time in Oaxaca, has filled the place with items he has brought back, including the plates and a mezcal that he imports.Advertisement"}

Support as Tensions Rise With Russia", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ukraine won a new lending commitment from the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, a lifeline from the West for a country whose economy has been sapped by corruption and war with Russian-backed separatists.Before the new loan was announced, Ukraine had seemed headed toward default with $11 billion in debt coming due within two years.The I.M.F. has been demanding that Ukraine create an independent anticorruption court to crack down on the theft of budget money \u2014 which partly consists of Western aid \u2014 by government insiders. It is also urging the government to raise natural gas prices.The government has said an anticorruption court will be up and running next year.For decades, natural gas subsidies had left Ukraine vulnerable to Russian meddling, as the gas companies whose pipelines enter Ukraine from Russia and the Kremlin had insisted on dealing through middlemen. Some of those middlemen used their profits to finance a political party loyal to Moscow.A genuine market for gas, if it develops, is seen as a long-term solution for providing stability to Ukraine\u2019s economy, either by stimulating companies to tap the country\u2019s own large gas reserves or by importing from a diverse group of suppliers \u2014 rather than relying on a country Ukraine now considers its enemy.The government had resisted raising prices before an election, but agreed in October to increase them by 23 percent. Although the government had pursued the natural gas subsidies, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, said they had hurt the country.\u201cPopulism has led to the weakness of Ukraine,\u201d he said.The new program will last 14 months and will help a fragile recovery in Ukraine\u2019s economy, which is projected to grow by 3.5 percent this year, according to the I.M.F.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Airports of the Future Have Arrived", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo of the biggest airports in the world \u2014 Istanbul and Beijing \u2014 aim to make travel easier and faster for the passengers who use them.Air travel is growing in popularity across the world, and the global aviation system is undergoing projects big and small to keep up.\u201cWe\u2019re forecasting that traffic will double in the next 17 years,\u201d said Angela Gittens, director general for Airports Council International (A.C.I. World). \u201cMillions more people will be traveling.\u201dAnd those people, she said, won\u2019t just be in places where flying is already popular. \u201cAn emerging economy now will be an advanced economy later,\u201d Ms. Gittens said.New and expanded airports are needed to meet that demand. Istanbul, for example, has already begun opening its new airport in phases that will eventually be able to accommodate hundreds of millions of travelers a year. When it is completed, it will be the world\u2019s largest. Beijing is set to get its own new airport up and running next year, one that will come close to rivaling Istanbul\u2019s in size and ambition. (It was designed by the architect Zaha Hadid before she died in 2016.) The key to making both airports manageable for passengers, Ms. Gittens said, is taking advantage of technology to facilitate how people and goods pass through them.\u201cWe have to do things more efficiently. We have to have technology work more efficiently for us. We have to figure out how to process passengers, aircraft and cargo more efficiently in the air as well as on the ground,\u201d she said.The airports\u2019 designers agreed, and said that efficiency has to start with the buildings themselves.\u201cWe're starting to arrive at scales which were previously unimaginable for the size of these airport buildings,\u201d said Andrew Thomas, a partner at the architectural firm Grimshaw, which designed the Istanbul airport along with the Nordic Office of Architecture and Haptic Architects. \u201cIt almost doesn't matter what you put in it if the walks are so long that people are exhausted by the time\u201d they get to their gate.The designers of the Beijing airport agreed. \u201cYou keep it on the human scale,\u201d said Cristiano Ceccato, an associate director and director of aviation at Zaha Hadid Architects.  Ms. Gittens said that technological innovations will help passengers navigate the buildings more quickly and efficiently.\u201cI think one of the things we can really expect is that biometrics will be used throughout the entire process. If you can avoid people having to stop and queue \u2014 stopping and queuing takes up space \u2014 if people can move, they don't need as much space,\u201d she said.Mr. Thomas agreed that biometrics, including facial recognition technology, will likely take on a bigger role as those technologies develop, but he said other systems already exist that make airports more efficient than they used to be. For example, he said, automation is making it quicker and less stressful for most travelers to check in. \u201cThe process, as it becomes automated, becomes much more simple,\u201d he said. Istanbul will still have check-in staff, \u201cbut they move from behind the desks and they deliver much more personal customer service.\u201d Ms. Gittens said that kind of technology also makes airports more flexible, as multiple airlines can share the physical infrastructure more easily.Beijing\u2019s airport is taking automated check-in even further, according to Mr. Ceccato. Normally, he said, airports have two levels: one for departures and one for arrivals. But Daxing International will have a third floor with a new format.\u201cA purely self-processing level for domestic travelers \u2014 no ticket agents or anything,\u201d Mr. Ceccato said. \u201cThey realized that the full service check-in that you have upstairs, most people don\u2019t need that anymore. They just need to get on with it much like they\u2019re taking a train. That is a big facilitation to making the travel as seamless as possible.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the distinction of the Istanbul airport. When Beijing's airport is completed, it will not eclipse Istanbul in size. Istanbul will remain the world's largest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Renzo Piano Design Will Replace Collapsed Bridge in Genoa", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The construction of a new bridge to replace the viaduct that collapsed in Genoa last summer, killing 43 people, will be overseen by a native son of the city.The authorities announced on Tuesday that they had chosen a design by the architect Renzo Piano for the bridge, which connects the western and eastern sections of the city and provides a critical link in the route to southern France.Resembling the shape of a ship\u2019s bow, the 202-million-euro ($230-million) bridge will be a joint venture by three Italian companies. The state railway subsidiary, Italferr, will handle the engineering, with construction done by a major Italian company, Salini Impregilo, and the infrastructure subsidiary of the state-run shipbuilder Fincantieri.The government decided to exclude Autostrade per l\u2019Italia, the bridge operator, which it blames for the collapse of the Morandi Bridge.Mr. Piano said he sought to make the replacement bridge as \u201csober\u201d as the city of Genoa, and as \u201cslender\u201d as the original structure, which was designed by the engineer Riccardo Morandi, who was renowned for his artistry.The deck of the new bridge will be more than a kilometer long and illuminated by 43 lamps casting a light shaped like ships\u2019 sails, one for each victim of the collapse. It will be made of steel, not the concrete used in the Morandi Bridge. The three A-frames that were the signature of Mr. Morandi\u2019s bridge will not be replicated.A trial against the bridge operator is expected to start next year.Autostrade per l\u2019Italia, the bridge operator, has spoken of \u201cexternal causes\u201d like the action of winds, pollution and the weather. In a statement, the company said a failure in the stays was not the primary cause of the collapse.The new bridge should be completed by the end of 2019, Mayor Marco Bucci said Tuesday, although it may not be immediately accessible to motorists.\u201cTwelve months to help relaunch Genoa,\u201d Pietro Salini, chief executive of Salini Impregilo, said in a statement.Despite predictions of a speedy reconstruction, practical hurdles remain.Because of the investigation into the Morandi collapse, prosecutors have not yet allowed access to the remains of the collapsed tower at the eastern end. The demolition of the western end must still be done as well.Salini Impregilo also built the second bridge over the Bosphorus, and is building the Unionport Bridge in New York. The company has collaborated with Mr. Piano before to build concert halls in Italy and abroad, though not bridges.Mr. Salini said he also hoped to send a strong message to the entire country.\u201cPublic works can kick-start the economy and start to create jobs again,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Seething Pro-Brexit Town, Doubts Creep In About Leaving the E.U.", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySUNDERLAND, England \u2014 They train in a gym near the docks of this old shipbuilding city, men who see cage fighting either as an escape from hard times or as a livelihood, bringing in a few hundred dollars every weekend.But local programs like the gym \u2014 which rely on a charity that gets European Union funds for neglected communities \u2014 could soon become casualties of Britain\u2019s looming split from the bloc. Even as the British government tries to shield big businesses from the economic fallout, many in Sunderland say, with some bitterness, it is once again ignoring the concerns of people like them.\u201cThe City of London\u2019s protected at all costs,\u201d said Steven France, who runs the gym, \u201cbut that\u2019s no good for us on the outposts of England.\u201dWhere they once saw a vote to leave the European Union as a way to strike a blow against the establishment, they now see the process known as Brexit as just another broken promise made by the political elites.Perhaps as a result, some recent polls have shown a broad cooling of attitudes toward withdrawal, in Sunderland and other places that voted to leave. Many have come to doubt the promises trumpeted by the Leave campaign, including new trade deals, an infusion of money into the health care system and complete independence from the European Union.In dozens of interviews, residents said that what Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government has done since the referendum \u2014 pressing ahead with austerity measures, presenting a business-friendly Brexit plan that fails to deliver all the promised benefits \u2014 only reinforced the sense that their needs were being ignored.The resentment runs strongest among hard-line supporters of Brexit, who want a clean break with the bloc.\u201cShe should listen to what the voters said and come out \u2014 just come out \u2014 like the northeast said to,\u201d Matthew Newton, a 62-year-old retired council employee, said over a beer at a pub, the Peacock, referring to Mrs. May. \u201cShe thought, \u2018Oh, well, I\u2019ll see what the ones in London say.\u2019 But we\u2019re a part of England, too.\u201dPeople described the 2016 referendum as a chance to get London\u2019s attention after generations of elected leaders neglected its sagging economy, which was devastated after the shipbuilding industry collapsed and the mines closed.The vote was ostensibly a protest against the obligations of European Union membership, especially provisions that allow citizens of any member state to live and work in Britain. But it also reflected resentment toward the political elite and promises that the membership fees sent to the European Union would be used for Britons instead.Many in Sunderland say they are growing increasingly doubtful that those promises will be fulfilled, and mindful that northeastern England has received considerable funding from the European Union \u2014 more than 426 million pounds, or about $445 million, for the period from 2014 to 2020, according to local officials.But residents said that step alone was meager in the face of plummeting benefits, rising food prices and looming uncertainty across the work force, which in the northeast is heavily dependent on exports to European countries that could become costlier after Brexit.100 milesScotlandNorth SeaN.IrelandSunderlandBritainIrelandEnglandWalesLondonBy The New York TimesIn a no-frills pub in Southwick, one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, John Taylor, a 58-year-old bricklayer, said he had voted to leave the European Union to stop foreign workers from getting jobs and benefits in Britain. But he said he was also concerned that he might never receive the benefits that he had earned over a lifetime of paying taxes, saying he had not gotten any government help during a recent stretch of unemployment.\u201cEven though I\u2019ve paid in taxes 40 years,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t get nothing back.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s got the gumption to come all around the country and ask us for help after she\u2019s took all the money off us,\u201d he said, referring to benefit cuts.In a mall in the city center, Patricia Stokoe said the way London politicians treated Northern England told her all she needed to know about Mrs. May\u2019s draft deal.\u201cWhat she\u2019s agreed to, I don\u2019t know, but I think one way or another we will be still in the European Union,\u201d Ms. Stokoe said, adding, a bit wearily, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would take this long.\u201dAt the same mall, Paul Yearnshire, 44, a builder and a Brexit supporter, was taking a coffee break with his construction crew. Mr. Yearnshire said he worried about quitting the bloc without a deal but did not know if Mrs. May\u2019s plan was the right one.He was hopeful that Brexit would reduce migration and end what he described as the problem of multiethnic communities, views reflecting anti-immigrant attitudes that played a major role in the referendum campaign and that many people in Sunderland still hold. But he was less sure that leaving the European Union would do anything to improve schools or create jobs. His 17-year-old son, Ryan, was expelled after his school did not accommodate the family\u2019s pleas for extra attention. Now Ryan works beside his father on the same construction crew.\u201cPeople here are using food banks all the time,\u201d the elder Mr. Yearnshire said. \u201cHow will Brexit affect that? Will it make it worse, or will it make it better?\u201dThiemo Fetzer, an economics professor at the University of Warwick, has found that a significant number of people voted for Brexit not because they were ideologically opposed to the European Union, but rather because they wanted a way to protest after austerity cuts had left them feeling ignored by the government. Those same voters, he says, are now the most susceptible to doubts about Brexit being the best path forward, suggesting that, for them, pocketbook issues outweigh ideology.Perhaps reflecting those changing attitudes was well-regarded work by Survation, a research firm, that showed support for leaving had fallen around 10 percentage points in Sunderland since the referendum. This was not a traditional opinion poll, however, but an estimate based on responses from 20,000 people nationwide that were combined with information about the demographics and voting history of local areas.At Pop Recs, a music shop and cafe near the bus depot, three people who voted to stay in the European Union were debating a second referendum. Barry Cornell, 42, worried another public vote risked reviving the far-right U.K. Independence Party, which played a major role in the Brexit campaign. But the shop\u2019s proprietor, Dave Harper, said he did not much care whom a referendum angered, so long as it reversed Brexit.Laura Brewis, 37, an arts organizer and fund-raiser sitting beside Mr. Cornell at the counter, lamented that elected leaders had said nothing for years about the European Union funding that came to Sunderland.Grants from the bloc have contributed to an aquatic center and a university campus, and helped underwrite a business center that assists aspiring software entrepreneurs, though these amenities are not always within reach for residents.In a square in the city center, a monument features the shipyard workers who once made Sunderland the largest shipbuilding hub in the world. It looks like a local project through and through, except for a small bronze plaque nearby covered in browning grass.Describing the source of some funding, it features not a Union Jack, but the flag of the European Union.Advertisement"}

Not that any of these words fit. So then, if you looked at 1D, \u201cMailing from Lands\u2019 End or Williams-Sonoma,\u201d the first thing you\u2019d probably think of would be CATALOG. This time of year, you\u2019re probably swimming in them \u2014 unless you\u2019ve mastered the Art of Removing Oneself from Lists. So you\u2019ve got CATTLE running across in four squares, and CATALOG running down in five \u2026 Looks like we have a rebus and a pet this Thursday.I also wanted to ask how many people remember (or are still) sliding a furry beast off the newspaper, repeatedly, while they solved a puzzle? Hello Crossworld! I\u2019m Sophia, a junior at Carleton College studying computer science and math, and I\u2019m beyond hyped to have my first puzzle in the New York Times. I\u2019m a Seattle native, musical theater geek, competitive bridge player and the worst cook you\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019ve been solving crosswords with my family for as long as I can remember, and constructing on and off since high school.This puzzle came together fairly quickly compared to others I\u2019ve written \u2014 I finished a draft of the grid just a few hours after thinking of the theme. Originally, KITTYCORNER was the only revealer \u2014 It was truly a stroke of luck that I noticed in the midst of filling the grid that LITTER BOXES both fit symmetrically and described the same gimmick.This was my first New York Times submission ever, so I was truly stunned when I got the \u201cyes\u201d from the editing team (well, after a quick reconfiguration of the northeast corner!) Since I write crosswords nearly exclusively for my non-puzzle obsessed classmates, my cluing tends to skew easy and modern, so thanks to the team for upping the difficulty level. Looking back on this puzzle, I do wish there was some more snazzy short fill: DON\u2019T PANIC is definitely my favorite entry in the grid.Enjoy the puzzle, and I hope to be here again soon!What did you think?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron, Confronting Yellow Vest Protests in France, Promises Relief", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Faced with violent protests and calls for his resignation, President Emmanuel Macron of France said Monday that he had heard the anger of the many whose economic suffering has burst into the open in recent weeks and that he would take immediate steps to relieve their hardship.Mr. Macron\u2019s mea culpa on national television signaled a remarkable step back from his ambitions to reshape France\u2019s economy and become the European Union\u2019s foremost leader. For now, his chief goal is shoring up his own political support in France.He announced tax cuts and income increases for the struggling middle class and working poor, vowing to raise the pay of workers earning the minimum wage. He promised to listen to the voices of the country, to its small-town mayors and its working people.\u201cThere is anger, anger and indignation that many French share,\u201d he said in 13-minute prerecorded speech from the Elys\u00e9e, the presidential palace.Attempting to show that he understood, Mr. Macron acknowledged the anger of \u201cthe couple who earn salaries that do not finish the month, and who get up every day early and come home late.\u201d He sympathized with \u201cthe single mother, a widow, a divorc\u00e9e,\u201d whose life is no longer worth living, he said, and \u201chas no more hope.\u201dMr. Macron recognized the anger too, he said, of retired people of small means who have \u201ccontributed all their lives and often helped both parents and children, and no longer make ends meet.\u201dAnd in a rare admission of having fallen short, he said he took responsibility for having not responded more quickly, saying that he realized that people had the impression that he had \u201cother priorities\u201d and was not concerned about their problems.Mr. Macron said that the details of his relief steps would be announced by Prime Minister \u00c9douard Phillipe in Parliament on Tuesday, but that there would be a supplement of 100 euros, or about $115, to workers earning the monthly minimum wage starting in January; that taxes on overtime pay would be eliminated and that retirees whose earnings are less than 2,000 euros a month, about $2,270, would no longer be asked to pay a recent increase in social security taxes.Whether Mr. Macron\u2019s actions will ease the deep-seated resentment toward him in France was unclear at best. So were the particulars of his proposals, which could translate into less in people\u2019s pockets than he made it sound.Criticisms came quickly from many of Mr. Macron\u2019s political opponents, who said his proposals fell far short of people\u2019s needs. More sobering for Mr. Macron could be the disappointment of many in the Yellow Vests movement who said his proposals did not speak to their needs.While some protesters welcomed the president\u2019s announcements as a first gesture, and a few praised him for his contrition, many more criticized what they called \u201chalf measures.\u201dOn the dozens of Facebook groups dedicated to the movement that have buzzed over the past month, a majority of Yellow Vests protesters said they felt it was too little, too late. A number expressed dismay that he had not even mentioned the Yellow Vests movement by name.\u201cThere are a lot of forgotten,\u201d one user, Bruno Ceneda, said in the movement\u2019s main group. \u201cAnd the others only have the crumbs left.\u201d\u201cHe is kidding us,\u201d said another, Jean-Jacques Brial.Political analysts suggested that appeasing the anger toward Mr. Macron would require significantly more than what he promised.\u201cWhen one listens to the Yellow Vests, one hears many different demands, but there is more and more agreement that Emmanuel Macron should resign,\u201d said Thomas Sn\u00e9garoff, a professor of political science at Sciences Po in Paris. \u201cThe people allude to the French Revolution, \u2018We have to cut off the head of the king.\u2019\u201dAt the same time, many do not believe his departure would improve their situation, suggesting they are not sure themselves what would truly improve their lives.Mr. Macron, elected in 2017 to a five-year term, came into office promising to make France more economically competitive. One of his early moves was to cut taxes on the wealthy to stimulate investment. Such changes alienated many working people who called him a \u201cpresident of the rich.\u201dFor more than a year, Mr. Macron has positioned himself as the natural heir to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as the bloc\u2019s dominant political figure. He has put himself forward, at times, as an establishment champion for a Continent besieged by far-right populism and has called for reforming the euro currency union and building a European army.\u201cWith Macron, you had a very ambitious European agenda from a young president urging European renewal and reform,\u201d said Pierre Vimont, a former French ambassador to the United States. \u201cBut here we see a more subdued president facing a difficult situation, and whose prospects to shape the next European Commission are not as good as before.\u201dEarlier in the day, Mr. Macron\u2019s political vulnerability was on full display. He consulted with representatives of the major unions \u2014 a move he had largely spurned before \u2014 and met with business leaders, associations representing local politicians and parliamentary leaders, whose support he will need if he wants to push through new legislation.The notice to reporters announcing the Monday meetings made no pretense about their significance. \u201cAt this serious moment for the nation, the president is bringing together all forces, political, local, economic and social, to hear their voices, their proposals and with the objective of mobilizing them for action,\u201d it said.But Mr. Macron\u2019s assured and sometimes even condescending tone has also backfired. He has often been dismissive of complaints and suggested the complainers were not trying hard enough. That has fed the feeling that he represents the elites and not the vast majority of the French. At the same time, lawmakers in Mr. Macron\u2019s political party have also been criticized for lacking roots in the working class.\u201cHe has been insensitive to the kinds of popular concerns that make people feel they are drowning\u201d said Pascal Perrineau, a professor of political science at Sciences Po. \u201cHe has not been a president who brings people together.\u201dOn Friday though, Mr. Macron began to try.Karl Olive, the mayor of Poissy, a town on the outskirts of the Paris metropolitan area, said Mr. Macron lacked a feel for ordinary people such as those who lived in his town. So he brought a group of mayors from his department, Yvelines, to explain to Mr. Macron how he needed to change.The mayors insisted that Mr. Macron meet with them alone \u2014 and Mr. Olive said the president made a point of taking notes himself. The meeting was scheduled to last two hours, Mr. Olive said, but lasted nearly twice that long. \u201cThe president needs to understand that decisions have to come from the bottom up, the French people do not like it when it is top down,\u201d he said.Mr. Olive said many people in his town are not in the streets but agree with the concerns of the Yellow Vests. Yet, he said, they are open to hearing that Mr. Macron has had a change of heart. \u201cThey are looking for more social justice and a new program. He has to change the goals, but also changing the method is important,\u201d he said.Aurelien Breeden and Elian Peltier contributed reporting from Paris, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.Advertisement"}

The comment was apparently a reference to remarks of Beijing being \u201cconfident\u201d a comprehensive deal can be reached before a tariff freeze expires in 90 days.\u2022 \u201cMr. Trump and his advisers have been touting the trade truce reached in Buenos Aires as a victory, saying that China had agreed to buy $1.2 trillion worth of American products.\u201d\u2022 \u201cBut trade experts and industry insiders remain perplexed, anxiously awaiting information about the timing and composition of the $1.2 trillion, a number that dwarfs the $130 billion in goods that the United States exported to China last year.\u201d\u2022 \u201cIf China doubled the amount of goods it bought from the United States starting next year, it would take nearly a decade to reach the $1.2 trillion goal.\u201dThere\u2019s a huge business opportunity in climate change. Exploiting it is the hard part.\u201cWorries don\u2019t translate into solutions unless businesses devise products that emit dramatically less planet-warming greenhouse gases. The innovation is the easy part; getting people to buy it is the hard part. That requires incentives, which depend heavily on governments.

That\u2019s down from 8 percent in 2010, and the lowest level since 1980.Arend Kapteyn, UBS chief economist, said that greater labor market flexibility since the financial crisis \u2014 due to factors such as lower wages and the advent of the gig economy \u2014 had helped lower the natural rate of unemployment in many countries.The change has been particularly pronounced in Eastern Europe: Polish unemployment has fallen to 6.2 percent from 20 percent in 2002, for instance, and Croatia and Slovakia have similar stories. But unemployment has dropped in many of the largest economies too, including the U.S., Britain, Germany and Japan.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!
