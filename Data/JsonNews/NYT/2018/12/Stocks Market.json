{"Headline": "Wall St. Rises in Day of Unsteady Trading as Global Markets Drop", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street fought its way back from early losses on Monday, as another volatile day of trading highlighted investors\u2019 unease about the global economy and corporate profits.After slipping by nearly 2 percent in the morning, the S&P 500 finished the day 0.2 percent higher. Markets in Europe and Asia, however, ended Monday in the red.Among other technology stocks, Microsoft shares climbed 2.6 percent and Facebook rose more than 3 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 0.7 percent.Worries about global economic growth, trade and the strength of corporate America have been battering stocks. While that\u2019s cause for concern, it is important to put slides like this in context.Volatility has tormented stock investors in recent days, as they assess the impact of a trade war that is grinding on and has the potential to slow the global economy. Market watchers cautioned against reading too much into the upturn on Monday.\u201cThe tendency is to look at days like today as a major trend shift,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm. \u201cUsually, going forward, they don\u2019t really add up or amount to much.\u201dOne trigger for the early decline on Monday was the news that Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, facing a certain defeat in Parliament, would seek to delay the vote on a deal for her nation\u2019s exit from the European Union. British lawmakers had been expected to vote on the plan on Tuesday.In London, the FTSE 100 dropped about 0.8 percent. The pound also fell against the dollar, hitting its lowest level since April 2017.Economic data released on Monday also provided investors with more evidence of a slowdown among export-based economies. Figures from Japan showed that the country\u2019s economy shrank more in the third quarter than initially reported, and data from China revealed a sharp slowdown in trade last month.Energy producers, meanwhile, tumbled along with crude oil prices. Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.4 percent. Financial stocks also fared poorly.In a sign that investors were less worried about the situation, semiconductor companies, which rely on supply chains in Asia and have become a barometer of investor sentiment about United States-China relations, rose on Monday. Advanced Micro Devices, for example, rose 2.7 percent.But China is just one of several worries investors are fixated on. Others are rising interest rates and already sluggish sectors of the American economy, like housing and autos.\u201cInvestors are focused on a lot of these walls of worry that are out there,\u201d said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis. \u201cUntil we get some clarity on some of those, the market\u2019s going to continue to struggle.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Trump in 2019 Be Untamed or Contained?", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe political scenarios for another strange Trumpian year.Opinion ColumnistBack then the Trump tamers were his fellow Republicans \u2014 the mix of senators and cabinet officials who had steered his actual administration (not the Twitter version) into the channels of a semi-normal G.O.P. presidency. Back then you could make a list of the wilder Trump campaign promises (or threats) and note how few of them had actually been implemented or pursued. Back then you could look at Trump\u2019s economic agenda and his foreign policy and see something influenced more by Paul Ryan and James Mattis than by the president\u2019s distinctive impulses.That was 10 months ago, and since then the Trump-administration world that I described has been deconstructed, piece by piece. The normalizing figures have departed or been unceremoniously dumped \u2014 whisk, H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn; goodbye, Jeff Sessions; time\u2019s up, John Kelly \u2014 and their provisional replacements have more of the island-of-misfit-toys feel that characterized Trump\u2019s inner circle in the 2016 campaign.Meanwhile all year there has been more and more overt Trumpishness in the administration\u2019s policy moves \u2014 the trade warring, the end of the Iran deal, the performative cruelty and performative militarization at the border, the made-for-reality-TV dealmaking with North Korea, the president\u2019s strange fanboy encounter with Vladimir Putin.So here we are, with Trump finally unbound, just as everyone who once opposed him had feared. Except that Trump unbound is also Trump hemmed in \u2014 no longer steered by the departing General Mattis or guided by the unlamented Speaker Ryan, but opposed directly by a Democratic House armed with subpoena power and prepared for political war. And Trump unbound is also Trump alone, his electoral mystique gone with the midterms and Senate Republicans more inclined to distance themselves the further off the policy reservation he goes and not even Chris Christie willing to take the job of managing his White House.So the president is at once more dangerous and less so, more unconstrained and yet easier to balk, more liberated and more isolated \u2014 a strange state of affairs even by the strange standards of this administration. And to save myself the embarrassment of future mea culpas, I won\u2019t make predictions but just offer scenarios for how this combination might shape the next exciting year of Trump.The first possibility, and to my mind the least likely, is a return to (relative) normalcy. In this scenario Trump reacts to indicators he understands, the jittery stock market above all, by containing his impulses a little more, finding (somewhere) a new set of establishment hands to guide him, making the necessary deals with House Democrats, and hunkering down to survive what the Mueller investigation has to throw at him. D.C. politics becomes, by this presidency\u2019s standards, strangely boring; there is a grind of subpoenas and scandals but Republicans stick with Trump; there is zero policy progress and a basic Democratic advantage but no dramatic change.I find this scenario less likely than does Drew, but more likely than the return to normalcy. However it coexists with a third possibility that might be termed the Trump Vindicated scenario (or, for true Trump haters, the LOL Nothing Matters scenario), in which Trump unbound turns out to be no more unpopular than the tamed-by-the-establishment version, his preferred policies prove less destabilizing than all the wise men fear, and we get a 2019 in which Trump flails around but his approval ratings actually go \u2026 up?This possibility is, I think, a somewhat underrated one, because some (not all!) of Trump\u2019s Trumpiest ideas are either more sensible or more popular than the establishment alternative. Paul Ryan\u2019s agenda dragged down Trump\u2019s approval ratings, not the other way around, and the Kim Jong-un summit was as popular as anything he\u2019s done. Even in the chaotic controversies of the last few weeks there is at least a case for pulling out of Syria, perhaps a stronger one for pulling out of Afghanistan, certainly a case that the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies are hurting both stocks and workers \u2026 and little evidence that swing voters will be furious with Trump for ending poorly understood military missions or picking fights with central bankers.And of course the man and the crisis might meet. So the final possibility worth considering as 2019 dawns is the same one that informed my opposition to Trump two years ago, which is that we should fear most from an unbound Trump isn\u2019t bad policy or sleaze or norm violations. It\u2019s that with Mattis gone and McMaster gone and Cohn gone and Kelly going and only Mulvaney and Jared and Steve \u201cAll is well!\u201d Mnuchin at battle stations, the equivalent of 9/11 or the financial crisis will come along and things will get very, very dark before there\u2019s even time to read the full text of the 25th Amendment.On that note, Happy New Year, America. And stay frosty out there, Mike Pence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Bubble Bursts, Consider the Anti-Bubble", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are nations and industries in sound economic shape that are ignored by investors because they are not all about tech. Maybe that is about to change. Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.One answer, in any transition period like this one, is to look to anti-bubbles. Bubbles are driven by hype about the hot new thing and defined by mania, including unusually heavy trading and prices rising at an unusually rapid pace and reaching a level that can\u2019t be justified by underlying growth in the economy or company. Anti-bubbles are the mirror image, taking shape in overlooked corners of the world and defined by light trading, with prices stagnating at low levels despite solid growth in the economy or company.To be clear, anti-bubbles do not include legacy companies like department stores and newspapers whose very existence has been thrown into doubt by competition from tech giants. Anti-bubbles encompass countries and companies that would seem to have bright futures but that struggle to attract the attention of investors.Historically, the biggest stock market returns came in the fastest-growing economies. But that pattern changed in recent years, as investors chased technology at the expense of everything else. The highest returns came in slow-growth countries such as Taiwan. The lowest came in fast-growing economies like the Philippines. The reason: Taiwan is a tech-driven economy, the Philippines is not.But as big tech begins to crack, that behavior is beginning to change. Stock markets from the Philippines to Indonesia have started to emerge from anti-bubbles. And in the United States, sound industries that had been left in the dust by the tech giants are starting to make a comeback among investors, too, including telecommunications, real estate and consumer staples. It is not clear where they go from here, but it is not unusual for stocks caught in an anti-bubble one decade to perform well the next.In the 1980s, Japan was widely predicted to be the next dominant economic superpower. Though it accounted for only 15 percent of global economic output, Japan was sucking in nearly half of all the money invested in stock markets worldwide. The United States, where the economy was almost twice as large and growing robustly, was struggling in vain to escape the shadow cast by Japan. It was trapped in that era\u2019s anti-bubble. By the end of the decade, however, the Japan bubble had popped and the United States was poised to take center stage. The next big bubble rose in the United States during the tech craze of the late 1990s, which generated another series of anti-bubbles, particularly in companies and countries that relied for growth on commodities like oil and iron ore. By the end of the decade, big oil companies and commodity-driven economies from Brazil to Russia, rocked by sinking prices, had fallen off the radar of global investors, and their stock prices were dragging bottom. Though the boom in this period was lifting a particularly broad segment of companies and countries, anti-bubbles were as usual forming in overlooked corners of the world. Tech firms, in particular, had been shunned since the dot-com bust, and their stocks were lagging behind the rest of the market. A decade later, dot-com survivors like Apple and Amazon were at the forefront of a new tech boom. If the mood of a bubble is manic, as overexcited investors drive daily trading volumes skyward, the mood of an anti-bubble is the opposite, marked by little trading at all. In a telling sign of the current anti-bubbles, the markets of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia together trade less than $1 billion a day, compared with about $6 billion a day for Apple alone.There are many more anti-bubbles. Poland is a high-growth economy with low debt and a small deficit that is also light on technology companies. Yet among emerging markets, Poland continues to stumble along at lows last seen in the early 1990s, when it was struggling to recover from the fall of Communism. Mexico is another economy facing no obvious threat of financial crisis. Yet money has fled its stock market, helping to drive the peso close to lows last seen during the \u201ctequila crisis\u201d of 1994.The bright side of anti-bubbles is that they are very cheap places to go on vacation. In Mexico City, travelers can get a fancy hotel room for the equivalent of $80, a fancy meal for $15.Anti-bubbles share one thing with bubbles: They don\u2019t last. Eventually, people recognize that prices are out of whack, and adjust accordingly. They go back to looking for inexpensive growth stories, and find them among the forgotten countries and companies.Bubbles are compelling drama, in which the lead characters are always racing excitedly toward a sudden fall. Much less has been written about anti-bubbles, which are in their way equally compelling tales of underdogs moving quietly toward surprising comebacks. The big book on anti-bubbles doesn\u2019t yet exist, but this would be a good moment for it to be written.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Markets Tumble, Tech Stocks Hit a Rare and Ominous Milestone", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Facebook, Apple or Google looked shaky this year \u2014 as investors worried about growth, regulation or mismanagement \u2014 the rest of the market felt it. In recent weeks, as these companies have succumbed to concerns about the global economy, slowing profits or privacy concerns, they have led the decline in stocks.Now, technology companies are dragging stocks into an ominous territory that investors have not seen in nearly a decade: a severe decline known as a bear market.The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed on Friday at 6332.99, down almost 22 percent from its August peak, meaning it has officially entered a bear market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both of which also include the biggest tech companies, are not far behind after falling 17.5 percent and 16.3 percent from their respective highs. After a month of heavy losses, stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008.Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy. In the last 20 years, there have been only two \u2014 one that began with the financial crisis in 2007, and the other that started with the dot-com bust in 2000. Market downturns can gather steam even without strong evidence that economic and corporate fundamentals are weakening.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a feedback loop,\u201d said Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now, we\u2019ve seen some declines, and that emboldens some pundit to say, \u2018This is it.\u2019 They get attention, it puts thoughts in people\u2019s minds and they start thinking, \u2018Maybe I should exit.\u2019\u201dThe Nasdaq is not the only group of stocks in such distress. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks shares of smaller companies, entered a bear market earlier this week. Seven of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 industrial sectors are also at the level, led by energy stocks, which are down 28 percent from their highs earlier this year. That\u2019s in large part because oil has been in a bear market since November.If the broader stock market declines by more than 20 percent this year, it would end what was, by some measures, the longest bull run in history. From March 2009 until its peak in September, the S&P 500 surged 333 percent, a rally that provided a silver lining to the lackluster years that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Investors enjoyed trillions of dollars of gains from the stock market.Those profits are not close to being wiped out. The stock market is still well above where it was even at the start of 2017. But the longer bear markets last, the more pessimism they spread.The mood in the markets can change. The most recent bear markets have not lasted as long as some others in the past. During the two previous bear markets, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to stimulate the economy by slashing interest rates. Investors came to believe that corporate profits would recover and dived back into stocks.The current stock plunge is taking place at a time when the central bank is signaling that it will keep raising interest rates because the economy remains strong, with unemployment near 50-year lows. But on Friday, an influential Fed policymaker said the central bank would keep a close eye on financial markets as it set interest rates.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go into the new year with eyes wide open, willing to read the data, listen to what people are saying, and to reassess the economic outlook,\u201d John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with CNBC.The sudden downturn in technology stocks has many of the attributes of the sell-offs that periodically smash hot sectors in the stock market. But it also signifies how investors have taken a dimmer view of corporate America and the broader economy.They are far below those levels now. Apple is now worth around $715 billion. Amazon has lost nearly a third of its value since hitting its high, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is down 23 percent.Trade tensions and a possible slowdown in the global economy are prompting investors to wonder whether technology companies will grow as fast as expected. Expectations that iPhone sales in China could slow eroded Apple\u2019s value, while Facebook\u2019s slip-ups over data privacy and misinformation have drawn scrutiny from angry governments and made investors nervous.\u201cYou can\u2019t grow at huge percentages forever,\u201d Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said of the tech sell-off. \u201cPlus, I think that whether it\u2019s regulation, whether it\u2019s fear of the global slowdown, those kinds of things have played into it.\u201dAnd there is also the simple fact that they had risen so far so fast. When fear descends on the market, investors often sell the shares that have gone up the most, and at its August high, the Nasdaq was up more than 50 percent from the date on which President Trump was elected.\u201cToo many people had piled on the same side of the boat,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York. \u201cTypically when that happens, the boat tips over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Watch Ahead of the Fed Meeting", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFed Chairman Jerome H. Powell faces the challenge of convincing investors that the Fed is striking the right balance. The Fed will issue a policy statement and a set of economic projections at 2 p.m. Mr. Powell will then hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. to answer questions about the Fed\u2019s plans.Here is what to watch as we head into Fed Day.The Fed on Wednesday is widely expected to recognize the continued strength of the economy by announcing a quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate after a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. It would be the fifth consecutive quarter in which the Fed has raised its benchmark rate. The rate would move into a range between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent.The Fed also is expected to announce that it will continue to reduce its portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which it accumulated after the financial crisis as part of its broader campaign to hold down borrowing costs. The holdings, which peaked at about $4.5 trillion, have now declined to about $4.1 trillion, and the Fed is reducing its holdings by $50 billion per month.But with markets uneasy, the central bank is expected to emphasize that future rate increases will depend on continued economic growth. In other words, the Fed could signal that while there is no reason to be worried about the economy at the moment, it is paying close attention to data that could signal economic weakening both in the United States and abroad.Financial markets are well-prepared for a rate hike. Attention instead is focused on what the central bank says about its plans for next year. Mr. Powell already has emphasized that the Fed is shifting to a new phase of monetary policy, in which it will offer less guidance about its plans.Instead, the Fed will emphasize that economic developments will dictate the course of policy. If growth is strong, the Fed is likely to raise rates at least a few more times. If signs of faltering growth continue to emerge, the Fed could pause for a while to take the measure of the economy.Most Fed officials have said that they want to return the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to a neutral level, meaning that the Fed would neither be stimulating nor discouraging economic activity.Even as the Fed seeks to get out of the forecasting business, it is still planning to release a set of forecasts by the members of its policymaking committee, showing how many times they expect the central bank to raise rates next year.In the last round of forecasts, published in September, most Fed officials predicted the central bank would raise rates three times in 2019. Shaving those predictions would underscore the Fed\u2019s doubts about the economy\u2019s trajectory.The committee comprises the Fed\u2019s board of governors and the presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks.Mr. Trump has repeatedly warned the Fed to stop raising rates, saying it is going to snuff out the economic recovery and advising it to \u201cfeel the market.\u201d Mr. Powell has so far brushed off any suggestion that the Fed might pay attention to the president\u2019s admonitions but any signal that the Fed is slowing its pace of rate increases will undoubtedly raise questions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign is working.That said, while many economists think Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the independent Fed have been ill-advised, there is a growing school of thought that a slowdown in rate increases may be warranted given signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad.With a rate increase already baked in for December, investors will be reacting most heavily to the projections for next year. If the Fed signals it is slowing down, expect markets to applaud.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Holiday Rest, but Little Relaxing, as Traders Size Up the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks & BondsFor anyone closely watching the financial markets, the calm of Christmas on Tuesday was infused with anxiety.Traders were bracing for the possibility of bad news on Wednesday, something bigger than just another day of stock market declines: If stocks don\u2019t reverse their recent sell-off, the United States is poised to close the books on the longest bull market on record.The major benchmark stock indexes are nearing losses of more than 20 percent from their peaks, a bear market\u2019s official marker, which would end a nearly decade-long run of gains. From its high on Sept. 20, the S&P 500 is down 19.7 percent.The market has reached this point after a rare downward streak this month \u2014 stocks fell for four consecutive days through Monday. Investors have looked past evidence of economic strength, however, and toward a potential slowdown in 2019.Messages from the White House over the long holiday weekend kept investors on edge. President Trump was repeatedly critical of his handpicked Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell. In a Twitter post on Monday, he said, \u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\u2019t have a feel for the Market, they don\u2019t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders.\u201d Top advisers, however, tamped down talk that the president was considering trying to fire him.Those worries have joined other concerns, including weakness in global trade and the economic impact of a potentially lengthy government shutdown, to feed the volatility on Wall Street.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump again expressed dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve. Asked about Mr. Powell, he told reporters, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see. They\u2019re raising rates too fast. That\u2019s my opinion.\u201dBut in a seeming recognition that his criticism of the Fed is adding to jitters, the president noted that the recent decision to raise interest rates reflected the strength of the economy. \u201cThe fact is, the economy is doing so well that they raised interest rates, and that is a form of safety, in a way,\u201d he said.And he urged Americans to buy stocks.\u201cI think it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, a great opportunity to buy.\u201dInitial reaction was positive. In Japan, where stocks slumped 5 percent on Tuesday, the market opened on Wednesday 1.5 percent higher.But some investors remain cautious.\u201cThe market has only gone down basically in a straight line for the last two weeks. It\u2019s healthy to have corrections but to have no reprieves and no rallies during that time isn\u2019t good,\u201d said Matthew Turk, an investor in San Diego who manages his own money.Mr. Turk said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about what\u2019s in store for the markets on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy. It feels like it\u2019s never-ending right now.\u201dCharles Campbell, a managing director at MKM Partners, which provides trading services for big money managers like pension funds, hedge funds and mutual funds, said he began communicating with his clients at 6 a.m. on Christmas morning.Mr. Campbell said the Fed\u2019s rate increases had been weighing on the markets. Investors were beginning to fear a slowdown and wanted to see more acknowledgment from the Fed that it would change course in the face of economic weakness.Mr. Campbell said if the Fed did slow down its rate increases, it could provide relief the markets sorely need.King Lip, the chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, said he was looking toward big companies\u2019 earnings reports as a potential break from the bad news.Public companies try to avoid surprising investors, offering plenty of hints about how their quarterly results will look, and Mr. Lip said the indications for some of the largest companies were still positive.\u201cWe\u2019ve been following what companies have been telling us over the last few weeks and generally what they\u2019ve been saying has been pretty good,\u201d Mr. Lip said. The coming earnings season in January, he said, could bring a respite from the sell-off: \u201cEven if we dip into bear-market territory, I think it\u2019s going to reverse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After all, after the 2016 U.S. election and the Brexit vote in Britain, there was a lot of talk about a broad popular backlash against globalization. Over the past two years, however, it has become clear that this backlash was both smaller and shallower than advertised.But if there\u2019s no strong constituency for protectionism, why are we teetering on the brink of a trade war? Blame U.S. trade law.The creators of the U.S. trade policy system realized, however, that it couldn\u2019t be too rigid or it would shatter in times of stress; there had to be ways to relieve pressure when necessary. So trade law gives the executive the right to impose tariffs without new legislation under certain circumstances, mainly to protect national security, to retaliate against unfair foreign practices, or to give industries facing sudden surges in foreign competition time to adjust.In other words, U.S. trade law gives the president a lot of discretionary power over trade, as part of a system that curbs the destructive influence of corrupt, irresponsible members of Congress. And that setup worked very well for more than 80 years.Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t intended to handle the problem of a corrupt, irresponsible president. Trump is pretty much all alone in lusting for a trade war, but he has virtually dictatorial authority over trade.What\u2019s he doing with that power? He\u2019s trying to negotiate deals. Unfortunately, he really, really doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. On trade, he\u2019s a rebel without a clue.Markets plunged earlier this week as investors realized that they\u2019d been had. As I said, business really doesn\u2019t want a trade war.Let\u2019s be clear: China is not a good actor in the world economy. It engages in real misbehavior, especially with regard to intellectual property: The Chinese essentially rip off technology. So there is a case for toughening our stance on trade.But that toughening should be undertaken in concert with other nations that also suffer from Chinese misbehavior, and it should have clear objectives. The last person you want to play hardball here is someone who doesn\u2019t grasp the basics of trade policy, who directs his aggressiveness at everyone \u2014 tariffs on Canadian aluminum to protect our national security? Really? \u2014 and who can\u2019t even give an honest account of what went down in a meeting.Unfortunately, that\u2019s the person who\u2019s now in charge, and it\u2019s hard to see how he can be restrained. So the future of world trade, with all it implies for the world economy, now hinges largely on Donald Trump\u2019s mental processes. That is not a comforting thought.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Market Rout Has Trump Fixated on Fed Chair Powell", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has unabashedly hitched his political fortunes to a rising stock market. Now, with stock prices in retreat, he has become increasingly fixated on the idea that one man is to blame for the recent rout: Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Trump has said choosing Mr. Powell for the Fed job last year was the worst mistake of his presidency, and he has asked aides whether he has the power to fire him.But the volatile stock market, which just posted its worst week since 2008, is falling in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s own policies, including an escalating trade war with China, a shutdown of the federal government and the fading effects of the $1.5 trillion tax cut Mr. Trump ushered in at the end of 2017. While the Fed\u2019s rate increases have upset investors \u2014 who seem to have a darker view of economic growth than the central bank does \u2014 some analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s musings about the Fed would only exacerbate anxieties.\u201cIf Powell gets terminated, what we\u2019ve seen happen in the markets in the past few weeks will look like a walk in the park,\u201d David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said in an email on Sunday. \u201cThe dollar will go into a tailspin, and even confidence in the Treasury market will erode, especially among foreign creditors.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers scrambled over the weekend to reassure markets that Mr. Trump was not, in fact, planning to fire Mr. Powell. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump accepting that he did not even have the power to do so.Mick Mulvaney, the incoming acting White House chief of staff, implied on Sunday that Mr. Trump had, in fact, inquired about removing Mr. Powell, saying on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the president \u201cnow realizes he does not have the authority.\u201d But Mr. Mulvaney added that he had heard this from Mr. Mnuchin, not from Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has not addressed the issue directly, including on his own Twitter feed, which he has frequently used to criticize the Fed. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters on Saturday, \u201cI\u2019m aware of no plans to fire Mr. Powell\u201d \u2014 but that brief statement stopped well short of corroborating Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s account of the president\u2019s views.Mr. Mnuchin has worked in recent days to obtain Mr. Trump\u2019s assurance that he would not remove Mr. Powell, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that person cautioned that Mr. Trump could change his mind. The person noted Mr. Trump has a tendency to nurse grudges even when he temporarily sets a subject aside.Mr. Mnuchin has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to stabilize markets, which are on pace for the largest December declines since the 1930s. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to make sure their operations were running smoothly.Still, Mr. Trump is hardly alone in his opposition to the Fed\u2019s move. Some economists argue the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign to drive up employment and wages. They note that the Fed is about to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive year, suggesting there is no need to step on the brakes.Many investors had also wanted a pause, and the decision set off another slide in stock prices.But even investors who disagreed with Wednesday\u2019s decision generally do not want politicians to play a larger role in Fed policymaking, preferring to leave the management of interest rates primarily in the hands of technocrats. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.\u201cMarkets are in the business of looking forward, and looking forward to a world with greatly diminished central bank independence isn\u2019t something that markets should find comforting,\u201d Eric Winograd, senior United States economist at AllianceBernstein, said in an email.\u201cI\u2019d be very careful about doing that,\u201d Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters on Saturday. \u201cThe independence of the Fed is the foundation of our banking system.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said, \u201cGiven the Fed\u2019s consensus on monetary policy, any effort to remove Powell would hit the trifecta: unlawful, ineffective and damaging to the economy.\u201dA key question is whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to remove Mr. Powell. The Federal Reserve Act, which had its 105th anniversary on Sunday, says the president can remove members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, including Mr. Powell, only \u201cfor cause.\u201dNo president has ever tried, but legal scholars say the language is generally interpreted as meaning the president could not remove Mr. Powell over a policy disagreement.The law, however, does not address the president\u2019s authority to remove Mr. Powell from his role as Fed chairman without removing him from the Fed\u2019s board, a move that some of the president\u2019s advisers have urged.But it is far from clear such a decision would serve the president\u2019s purpose. A replacement for Mr. Powell would require Senate confirmation, and this person would join a policymaking committee that voted unanimously for the December rate increase. That committee also might be inclined, on future rate decisions, to demonstrate its independence from the president.While Mr. Trump has turned on his chairman, the Fed\u2019s trajectory should not have been a surprise.When Mr. Trump chose Mr. Powell as Fed chairman in the fall of 2017, he said, \u201cBased on his record, I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy through any challenges that our great economy may face.\u201dMr. Trump also chose three of the other four members of the Fed\u2019s board, all of whom joined Mr. Powell in voting for all four 2018 rate increases.In conversations with friends and advisers, Mr. Trump has acknowledged responsibility for the selection of Mr. Powell. He told Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, that it was \u201cone of the worst choices I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d according to Mr. Moore.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers have encouraged him to remove Mr. Powell, arguing that the decision would reverse recent stock declines.Others, including Mr. Mnuchin, have warned that Mr. Trump would harm his own interests.Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said presidents had often tried to shape Fed policy, but the current episode stood apart because Mr. Trump appeared to be acting against his own interest in a stable economy.\u201cI think what is the unusual part here is that it seems the president has created the crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cHis intervention certainly seems to be making things worse for him and worse for the Fed and worse for the economy. It\u2019s just very shortsighted, and we\u2019re not used to that.\u201dAlan Rappeport, Maggie Haberman and Katie Rogers contributed reporting from Washington, and Peter Eavis from New York.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Fall Back Into Negative Territory for 2018 as Economic Uncertainty Grips Investors", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street dropped again Friday, pushing the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year, as investors continued to fixate on how much the economy and corporate profits could slow next year.Until recently, the American stock market had been something of a standout performer among global markets. The S&P 500 was up 9.6 percent for the year well into September. But over the last few months those gains have disappeared as investors began to assess the potential fallout from a trade war between the United States and China and, rising interest rates.\u201cEssentially there is a scare in the market about the future growth prospects of the global economy,\u201d said Hari Srinivasan, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, an asset management firm.While the market initially rose slightly, those gains evaporated as the issue of a trade war resurfaced later Friday morning. Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, said on CNN that the United States would increase tariffs on Chinese imports if the two countries could not reach an agreement on trade by the end of a 90-day negotiating period. President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed on Saturday to the standstill on new tariffs, but confusion about the nature of the agreement has only added to recent volatility in the stock markets based on widespread expectation that the American economy will likely slow next year.The arrest could mark a risky new phase for many big technology firms, which depend on networks of factories and subcontractors in Asia and have bet on strong demand from Chinese consumers to fuel future growth.Shares of these companies fared particularly poorly on Friday. Companies that make networking equipment and cellphones in China were also sharply lower. The semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices fell more than 8 percent, while Apple was down more than 3 percent. Microsoft and Amazon both fell more than 4 percent. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell more than 3 percent.Industrial stocks also saw significant losses Friday, with the S&P 500 industrial sector dropping 2.6 percent. Large exporters Boeing and Caterpillar, which ship large amounts of goods to China, fell 2.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.\u201cIt is a slowdown and it is making investors nervous, and it could possibly slow down further,\u201d said Stephen Gallagher, director of research at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in New York. \u201cAnd the risks are pointed to the downside with the trade tensions just continuing to build.\u201dBut softer market sentiment soon touched the oil markets, where crude prices moderated their gains. After gaining more than 5 percent earlier in the day, Brent crude oil rose 2 percent, to $61.57 a barrel. West Texas crude, the American benchmark, rose 1.9 percent, to $52.48.The S&P 500 energy sector declined by 0.6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Markets Are Wild, but Bond Markets Can Be Dangerous", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sell-off in stocks isn\u2019t the only ominous economic sign emanating from financial markets. The bond markets, much more closely linked to the actual economy, are also flashing a warning.Ask someone how \u201cthe Dow\u201d is doing and, even if they don\u2019t know the answer, they\u2019ll know what you\u2019re talking about. Ask them about the bond market and you\u2019ll most likely get a blank stare.When it comes to the economy, however, bonds are far more important than stocks. Bond markets dictate the cost of borrowing money, and that can determine actual economic activity. The decision by a C.E.O. to build a plant or take the plunge on a new product is often decided by how much it will cost to borrow the money to pay for it. When that payment climbs too high, corporate activity slows, and so does the economy. Lately, borrowing costs have been rising quickly. Investors worried about corporate debt loads and the impact of a potential slowdown on profits are demanding companies pay them higher interest rates. And, in a recent troubling sign for the economy, fewer companies have been turning to the bond market to finance their businesses.As with the swooning stock market, weakness in the bond market doesn\u2019t mean the economy is destined for an immediate downturn. But signals being sent by bond investors will almost certainly arise in discussions among policymakers at this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on monetary policy, which will culminate on Wednesday with a decision on interest rates. Here\u2019s what you need to know.Like any borrower, a company raising capital in the bond markets pays interest. What they pay depends on how likely it is that a lender will get repaid. Consumers have credit scores. Companies have debt ratings. The greater the risk that a borrower won\u2019t be able to pay up \u2014 known as credit risk \u2014 the higher the interest rates. American Treasury bonds almost always have the lowest interest rates. That\u2019s because lending to the United States government \u2014 which has a virtually unblemished record of repaying creditors \u2014 is considered pretty much the safest investment on earth.Everyone else, even the most powerful, cash-rich corporations, must pay more. For example, Home Depot went to the bond market late last month, raising $1 billion by selling 10-year bonds. At the time, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 the federal government\u2019s cost to borrow for 10 years \u2014 was about 3.06 percent. Home Depot, considered a safe or \u201cinvestment grade\u201d borrower \u2014 paid an interest rate of almost 4 percent to borrow for 10 years. The difference between the low interest rate that the government pays and the higher rate of another borrower is called the credit spread. Riskier borrowers typically have larger spreads. Bankers who arrange bond issues for companies set the interest rate by looking at where the company\u2019s other bonds are trading and assessing the demand for the new bond.A higher credit spread can also reflect investors\u2019 concerns about things like the broader economy and the future ability of any company to pay money back. In recessions, for example, they rise for even the healthiest companies.\u201cAs the credit spread goes up, lenders are saying, \u2018We\u2019re really worried about making loans, riskier than lending to the government,\u2019\u201d said Philip Bond, a professor of finance at the University of Washington.Since early October, credit spreads have increased fast.Borrowers with investment-grade debt ratings (essentially higher credit scores) are paying more than 1.4 percentage points above Treasurys to borrow, up from less than 1 percentage point at the start of the year. Spreads on junk bonds, issued by companies that are considered significantly less creditworthy, have risen even more, from around 3.2 percentage points at the start of the year to more than 4.5 percentage points now, according to FactSet.The sudden increase \u2014\u00a0\u201cwidening\u201d in the bond market\u2019s lingo \u2014\u00a0is telling us that investors are suddenly more nervous about handing over their cash to corporations. The same change in sentiment is playing out in the stock market and the reasons are largely the same. A trade war that has no end, signs of a slowing world economy and a widely expected deceleration in growth the United States have all pushed investors to take less risk. At the same time, the Fed is slowly removing the helping hand it has extended to markets and the economy for the last decade, by raising rates and shrinking the stockpile of bonds it owns. Recent drops in oil prices are also making investors less willing to place their money with the smaller energy companies that tend to borrow in junk-bond markets.While the stock market sell-off may eventually affect sentiment among consumers and corporate executives, bond market moves can have an immediate impact on the economy by discouraging borrowing and investment. It is true that borrowing costs are still very low by historical standards, because the Fed only just began to step back from its post-crisis programs to keep them that way. But one concern among investors is that this effort to hold down costs encouraged borrowing to a point that could be problematic in a downturn. Netflix has gone from having very little debt in 2010 to having more than $10 billion now. Verizon now has $113 billion of debt, more than double the amount it had six years ago. By one measure, the ratio of corporate debt to G.D.P., the total level of borrowing is at all-time highs.In general, higher debt levels could make it tougher for companies to repay the lenders if there\u2019s a slump in the economy, or a hiccup in sales, or a decline in the value of assets.That turmoil didn\u2019t lead to a full-blown recession. But it did coincide with what some economists, including those at JPMorgan Chase, now call a \u201cmini recession\u201d between 2015 and 2016, in which industrial spending by companies in the manufacturing sector slowed sharply and dragged on growth.And with the American economy already expected to slow in 2019, the climbing costs of corporate borrowing could determine whether any slowdown turns into something much worse.Advertisement"}

They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street Stocks Inch Higher as Crude Oil Tumbles", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe panic that has gripped Wall Street abated on Tuesday, with stocks rising after a decline that had left the market at its lowest point in more than a year. The rebound was tempered somewhat by a slide in crude oil and energy stocks.Trading was volatile though, as the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymakers began a two-day meeting amid concerns that the global economy is weakening and corporate profit growth could slow. The Fed is still widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter point at the end of that meeting, on Wednesday, but the central bank is also expected to signal that it is aware that deteriorating conditions in financial markets could reflect real risks for the economy.Markets have been highly reactive to any indication that the Fed\u2019s plans are changing. When the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, seemed to suggest in early October that the central bank was intent on raising interest rates, stocks plunged. Weeks later, when he made comments that were taken as an indication that the rate increases were near an end, they rose sharply.Since stocks reached a high in late September, they have been brought lower by a range of concerns, from signs that the trade war between China and the United States is beginning to weigh on global growth to worries that higher interest rates will eat into corporate profits. The result has been a drop not only in stocks, but also risky corporate bonds and commodities.On Tuesday, the S&P 500 reversed a string of recent losses that had brought it to a new low for 2018, but only just. The benchmark rose just 0.01 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite fared better.Crude oil plunged nearly 8 percent to below $46 a barrel and energy stocks were among the day\u2019s worst performers. Exxon Mobil, for example, was down nearly 3 percent.Investors in energy markets are not just worried about economic growth. They are also concerned about a supply glut amid rising output in the United States and countries like Libya and Venezuela. OPEC has agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, but those cuts will not take effect until next year.Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, weighed in on the recent turmoil in stocks, predicting that it signals the end of a nearly decade-long bull market.Stocks in Europe were lower, while shares in Asia suffered a steeper decline after a speech on reform from China\u2019s top leader sent markets down on Tuesday.The speech by President Xi Jinping quoted Communist Party theory, failed to mention the trade war and offered little insight into Beijing\u2019s plans. Though Chinese officials do not usually use such events as a forum for announcing new initiatives, many investors had been hoping that Mr. Xi might introduce new efforts to prop up China\u2019s slowing growth or defuse trade tensions with Mr. Trump.\u201cThe main question for Chinese markets at the moment is to what extent the government will stimulate the economy and whether there will be a trade deal with the U.S.,\u201d said Tom Rafferty, China regional manager at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\u201cOn both those fronts, Xi\u2019s speech offered little in terms of specifics, and we remain highly skeptical that a deal with the U.S. will be done,\u201d Mr. Rafferty said.Advertisement"}

The S&P 500 ends the week down by 4.6 percent.By The New York TimesWhen a trade war broke out between the world\u2019s two largest economies in June, investors barely blinked. After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates \u2014 often a reason for investors to sell stocks \u2014 the markets kept climbing. As some of the world\u2019s largest economies began to slow down, American markets largely shrugged it off.Not anymore.Last week, elements of all of those combined to drive the S&P 500-stock index down by 4.6 percent, its worst weekly drop since March and one marked by stomach-churning price swings. Stocks are now down 1.5 percent this year.More volatility could be in store, as investors assess the allegations by prosecutors that President Trump directed illegal payments to ward off a potential sex scandal, and the possibility that he sought to secretly do business in Russia during his 2016 campaign for the White House.\u201cEvery eye is going to be focused on every piece of commentary on this trade deal,\u201d said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, which manages over $6 trillion in assets. \u201cBecause the impact on growth is so significant.\u201dWhile the large market swings on trade-related news underscore some investors\u2019 view that a resolution to the impasse between the United States and China will be crucial to the survival of the economic expansion, there are other political and economic risks as well. They include the fallout from the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the relentless staff churn in the Trump administration, the efforts to negotiate Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, and social unrest in France.\u201cThe fact is that politics is driving the economy to an extent that is very atypical,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, an institutional brokerage firm. \u201cWe would say probably to the greatest extent that we\u2019ve seen in our investing lifetime.\u201dLast week, markets whipsawed on headlines related to the trade war. On Monday, stocks jumped 1.1 percent on word that President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed to a 90-day halt on any new tariffs to provide space to negotiate key trade issues.The selling continued on Friday, when stocks fell 2.3 percent.The trade war has already taken a toll on large chunks of the global economy. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, is growing at its slowest rate in nearly a decade. The export-driven economies of Japan and Germany \u2014 the third and fourth biggest economies in the world, respectively \u2014 both contracted in the third quarter.The United States has so far been an outlier. Thanks in part to a burst of deficit-fueled stimulus, a large chunk from the tax cut, the American economy this year is on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2005. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a near 50-year low. Corporate profits and wages are growing at their fastest pace in years.For much of 2018, results like that helped Wall Street stand out even as major stock benchmarks around the globe tumbled. Chinese stocks are down more than 20 percent this year, and shares in Germany are down 16.5 percent. In Japan, stocks are down about 5 percent, and in Britain they\u2019re down more than 10 percent.But even in the United States, there are emerging pockets of weakness, particularly in parts of the economy that are sensitive to rising borrowing costs. Pending home sales have declined for eight straight months, as interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have climbed. Monthly auto sales have plateaued, prompting job cuts at General Motors and Ford.Worries about global economic growth, trade and the strength of corporate America have been battering stocks. While that\u2019s cause for concern, it is important to put slides like this in context.The stock market has mirrored those concerns since the summer. Shares of carmakers and auto-parts manufacturers are down more than 25 percent this year. Shares of homebuilders have slumped nearly 30 percent.And investors are growing more concerned about the outlook for corporate profits next year, despite third-quarter results that showed that profits at S&P 500 companies rose at the fastest pace since 2010. Instead of the strong results, investors zeroed in on commentary from executives about whether next year might signal the beginning of the end for the second-longest business cycle expansion on record.\u201cWe\u2019re very mindful once again where we\u2019re at in the cycle,\u201d Gregory Carmichael, chief executive of the Cincinnati-based lender Fifth Third, said at a conference last week. \u201cWe\u2019re well positioned to deal with the downturn in the economy, and we\u2019ll be very cautious.\u201dThat very caution from corporate America could itself sway the economy, should lenders pull back financing, or large businesses slow their growth plans.There are other risks to the economy, too, and high on many investors\u2019 lists of these is the Federal Reserve. The central bank has been raising interest rates and winding down other financial crisis-era stimulus that helped drive a global investment boom over the past decade. These higher rates pinch stock investors by making government debt a more appealing alternative, particularly in uncertain times, and also mean companies that binged on low-cost loans will have to spend more to cover their obligations.The market tumult, coupled with the increasingly uncertain path for the global economy, is part of the reason Mr. Rieder, of BlackRock, said he believed that the Fed might decide not to lift interest rates at its next meeting on Dec. 18-19.\u201cThe Fed should slow down and now take a step back and look at what has happened,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economy Faces Big Risks in 2019. Markets Are Only Now Facing Up to Them.", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne question people might be asking is, what took so long?After another week of exceptional volatility on Wall Street that has pummeled stock portfolios, there are two closely related questions worth asking.Second, what took so long? Why are markets just now recognizing the risks the economy faces in 2019, which have been obvious for months to anyone paying attention? The forces driving the recent swings \u2014 which have resulted in an 8 percent drop in the S&P 500 over the last two months, with some teeth-rattling ups and downs for stocks, bonds and major commodities along the way \u2014 are not anything new.First, three years\u2019 worth of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are finally starting to pinch interest-rate-sensitive sectors, particularly housing, the auto industry and companies with heavy debt loads. After years in which the economy has become heavily tilted toward industries that depend on low interest rates, a potentially painful rebalancing is underway.Second, investors worry that the trade war between the United States and China could start to pinch corporate earnings and economic activity more than it has to date. But that conflict has been building throughout 2018.Third, the tax cut that has lifted corporate earnings and economic growth in 2018 won\u2019t be repeated in 2019, meaning a harder slog for companies seeking higher profits. Growth will slow unless companies develop ways to extract greater productivity from their (increasingly hard to find) work force, which would be great for long-term economic prospects, but isn\u2019t the kind of thing you want to count on.So the answer to the first question, of why markets have become so turbulent when the economy is strong, is the simpler one. Markets look forward, and the risks looking forward seem increasingly ominous even as everything continues to go swimmingly, especially in the labor market, as 2018 nears its end.The consensus economic projections of Fed officials published one year ago show that they expected the economy to grow 2.5 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019. If anything, they were too pessimistic about 2018, which now looks likely to be north of 3 percent.But slower growth in 2019 and 2020 has been expected among mainstream economic forecasters ever since the tax legislation took shape a year ago.\u201cNothing in economics and markets happens in a straight line or without lags and feedback effects,\u201d said Blu Putnam, chief economist at the CME Group. \u201cThere are some big headwinds all coming from events in 2018 that we know about, but whose impacts are yet to be fully felt or appreciated.\u201dAnd knowing something bad will probably happen is not the same as knowing when. It evidently took another confusing series of developments in economic diplomacy between the United States and China for it to become clear.\u201cMost economists are good at analyzing fundamentals, but they know better than to forecast direction and timing in the same sentence,\u201d Mr. Putnam said.Part of the agita on financial markets in the last few weeks has come from fears that the Fed has been underestimating these risks, and is dead set on raising interest rates several more times next year even as the economy is still trying to adjust to the early rounds of increases.Those fears have eased some as Fed officials have signaled open-mindedness and flexibility about the path ahead in the last few days. But a tricky period for the Fed is only beginning.The optimistic case for 2019 is that a rebalancing of the economy is underway that will create both losers (interest-rate-sensitive industries and those that rely heavily on trade with China) and winners (everybody else).The risk is that this handoff doesn\u2019t happen as smoothly as an economic textbook might predict. There are always frictions that can leave certain regions and certain workers in a bad spot for extended periods.The tricky thing for the Fed is that it must set its policies for the whole of the United States; it can\u2019t set one interest rate for the service sector in big coastal cities and another for farm equipment makers in Iowa.With the unemployment rate at its lowest level since 1969 and average hourly earnings starting to rise a bit more rapidly, all the traditional signals point to continued interest rate increases being justified.So what markets have right is that this is shaping up to be a perilous time for the economy, in which bad luck or bad policy could easily create a major slowdown or recession. And that\u2019s the case no matter how strong things look at the end of 2018, or how long it\u2019s taken markets to reckon with that reality.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Whiplash on Wall Street as Tension About Global Economy Mounts", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, as concerns about the global economy, trade tensions and interest rates kept markets on edge.Stocks fell around the world after the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive intensified concerns that China and the United States, the world\u2019s two largest economies, could be entering a risky new chapter in their trade dispute. But Wall Street recovered most of those losses in an afternoon rally predicated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve may slow down on interest rate increases next year.At one point in the day, the S&P 500 was down as much as 2.9 percent, mirroring steep declines in Asia and Europe. A recovery late in the trading day, however, left the index down only about 0.2 percent at the closing bell.The dueling messages continued on Friday morning in Asia, where markets were mixed and futures that predict Wall Street\u2019s opening showed a modest drop.But the arrest of Ms. Meng, the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, threatened to open a riskier new chapter in a fight that investors increasingly see as a threat to financial markets and the economy.\u201cThis is going to continue to be a headwind at a time when people are worried about global growth,\u201d said Dan Clifton, a head of policy research with the analysis firm Strategas.For most of the year, the United States \u2014 less reliant on trade than most wealthy nations \u2014 had been a global standout, thanks in part to a burst of fiscal stimulus from the Trump tax cuts, while the trade war caused trouble in the rest of the world\u2019s financial markets.In China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost a decade, stocks have slumped more than 20 percent. Export-based economies that are closely tied to China \u2014 like Japan and Germany \u2014 have started to struggle too. Growth in emerging markets, which often supply the commodities that have fueled the Chinese boom in recent decades, has also been hurt.But in recent weeks, worry about the trade war has begun to take hold in the United States as well. Since its peak in late September, the S&P 500 has declined by 8 percent, as investors grew concerned about the outlook for corporate profits, the potential costs of the trade spat and rising interest rates, which are traditionally viewed as a negative for stocks.The rally did little for investors in energy shares. The sector has been hard hit by a slump in crude oil prices in recent weeks and was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500 on Thursday.Elsewhere, yields on government bonds dropped sharply early in the day as investors flocked to the safety of Treasury debt. But the declines in yields moderated late in the day, in tandem with the shift in stock trading.Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, tend to drop as investors downgrade expectations for growth and inflation.Those lower yields can crimp the profitability of banks, which charge interest rates that are based on government bond yields. The threat of such pressures has hammered American financial stocks in recent days. The S&P 500 financial sector index was the second-worst-performing part of the market on Thursday, dropping 1.4 percent.And while few expect a hasty end to the economic expansion in the United States, the recent swings in stocks suggest investors are increasingly worrying about any threats that could worsen growth forecasts.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a growth slowdown in place,\u201d said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock. \u201cThis is a very different environment from where we were this time last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

First, Macau\u2019s Gaming Inspection & Coordination Bureau said that gaming revenue for the Chinese gambling center had increased more than expected in November.Wynn could gain because of the thaw. Wynn generated nearly three-quarters of its revenue this year from its casinos in Macau, a special administrative region of China and a gambling haven for Chinese high rollers.Tariffs between China and the United States were unlikely to affect Wynn\u2019s revenue directly, but investors worried it could be hit by any retaliatory measures China took in response to the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Those could include potential restrictions on travel to Macau as well as license renewals.Wynn\u2019s exposure to China also meant that it was susceptible to a slowdown in China\u2019s economy and the impact that might have on wealthy Chinese gamblers. Wynn\u2019s shares tumbled 13 percent in early November after Wynn\u2019s chief executive, Matt Maddox, warned on the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings conference call that it had experienced a recent slowdown in its Macau business.Wynn\u2019s shares slid through the spring and summer as trade tensions between the two countries continued to escalate.

{"Headline": "Wall Street Hits New 2018 Lows as Fed Decision Looms Over Markets", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street notched a new low for the year on Monday, as worries about the economy continued to dog investors ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve decision on interest rates later this week.It was the latest in a string of volatile trading sessions that has left investors limping through the last weeks of 2018. Since stocks reached a record high in September, the market has been buffeted by a range of concerns, from signs that the trade war between China and the United States is beginning to weigh on global growth to worries that higher interest rates will eat into corporate profits.It made for a shaky day in the markets. Crude oil dove. Corporate bonds were lower. Stocks dropped almost across the board, with shares of tech, health care and small companies as well as blue-chip corporations all lower.When the dust had cleared, the S&P 500 was down 2.1 for the day and 4.8 percent for the year. Should the market fail to recover, 2018 would be Wall Street\u2019s worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago.Asian markets followed Wall Street\u2019s drop. By midday on Tuesday, shares in Tokyo, China and Australia were down 1 percent or more, as investors expressed disappointment over a lack of specific proposals in a closely watched speech by President Xi Jinping of China. Still, futures contracts tracking Wall Street suggested that it could open higher on Tuesday morning.The sell-off came after another indication that the American economy, while still strong, is showing signs of slowing. The Empire State manufacturing index, a somewhat limited gauge of economic sentiment among manufacturers in New York State, tumbled sharply. A survey of American homebuilders also showed sentiment continuing to fall in an area of the economy where rising mortgage rates have hurt affordability and sales.\u201cEvery part of the market has been acting like things are a lot slower,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth. \u201cEverywhere, every market is telling you the same thing.\u201dPresident Trump sent a Twitter message on Monday calling \u201cincredible\u201d the widespread expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when it concludes its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed to stop a rate-increase cycle that started in December 2015.Fed interest rate increases are traditionally viewed as a negative for stock prices, and as evidence mounted in recent weeks that the global economy was starting to slow, investors have increasingly attuned to comments about the Fed\u2019s plans. Many financial market analysts date the start of sharp slump for stocks to comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, in early October that seemed to suggest that the central bank was intent on raising interest rates further than many had expected.In late November, Mr. Powell sent stocks up sharply when he said the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate was \u201cjust below\u201d the neutral level, which many saw as a sign the central bank might not be as aggressive in raising rates as initially thought.Most investors still expect the Fed to lift its key interest rate when the central bank concludes the two-day meeting on Wednesday, but expectations are growing that the central bank will somehow signal that it is aware that conditions in financial markets have deteriorated sharply, and could reflect real risks for the economy.The Fed\u2019s decision is likely to be one of the last major events for markets in what has been a difficult year for investors. If investors are disappointed by the Fed\u2019s decision, the market slump could get worse.\u201cIf monetary policy doesn\u2019t change its direction, you will have a significant meltdown on this,\u201d said Steven Ricchiuto, chief United States economist with Mizuho Securities. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot riding on it.\u201dThe pain on Monday was not limited to stocks. In the commodities markets, prices for benchmark American crude oil fell close to 4 percent, tumbling below $50 a barrel.Investors moved to the safety of Treasury bonds, pushing yields \u2014 which move in the opposite direction of prices \u2014 on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.85 percent, the lowest level since early September. Typically, falling yields are associated with softening economic conditions. Borrowing costs in corporate bond markets rose, as investors shied away from risk.This year\u2019s sell-off is nothing like the collapse of stocks a decade ago, when the S&P 500 fell more than 38 percent. But in its own way, 2018 is emerging as a remarkable year for financial markets, with almost every type of investment and asset class \u2014 stocks, bonds, commodities, even safe Treasuries \u2014 posting negative or minuscule returns.Until recently, shares of health care companies had been something of an outlier against that backdrop. The S&P 500 health care sector had rallied after the November midterm elections as investors figured that threats to the Affordable Care Act would fade after the Democrats retook control of the House.Centene, an insurer based in St. Louis that has built a large business servicing government-funded Medicaid programs, fell 4.8 percent as trading volume surged. The hospital chain HCA also fell sharply, as any change to the law that resulted in lower levels of insurance would most likely result in higher costs for the hospitals. The S&P 500 health care sector fell 2.1 percent.Carlos Tejada contributed to this report.Advertisement"}

Now, they are speeding up.Faced with a volatile stock market and the prospect of an economic downturn next year, the ride-hailing services have moved more urgently toward an initial public offering, said four people with knowledge of the companies\u2019 plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly.\u201cCompanies that were talking about 2020 have been told that the window may not be open as long as previously thought,\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who advises on I.P.O.s. He said that he was telling companies that \u201cif an I.P.O. is in your plan, I would probably be getting ready now.\u201dThose attitudes have shifted as investors and tech employees have increased pressure on the companies to go public so that they can cash in their shares.\u201cThe forcing factor is, how do you deal with issues of employee retention?\u201d said Rick Heitzmann, a managing director at FirstMark Capital, which is an investor in unicorns such as Pinterest and Airbnb.But the seesawing stock market, a trade war with China and other countries and uncertainty over the direction of the economy are all now weighing on I.P.O. decision-making. Few executives want to take their companies public when investors\u2019 appetite for shares may be ebbing.\u201cCompanies that were waiting for everything to be perfect before going public might have been better off going when things were good enough,\u201d Mr. Heitzmann said.Sandy Miller, a venture capitalist at IVP, said several companies were meeting with potential investors far ahead of filing for an I.P.O., in what are known as pre-roadshow events. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way to really know what kind of receptivity you\u2019re going to have\u201d from the public markets, he said.Mr. Miller said that he expected a robust year for I.P.O.s next year, but that companies may not want to wait until too late in the year to file. \u201cThere are certainly some storm clouds on the horizon,\u201d he said.Inside Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, has raced to prepare the company to go public. Over the past year, the company has overhauled many of its internal processes, from items as small as creating more formal systems for expense reports to global safeguards that ensure legal compliance in every area where Uber operates.Going public sooner could give Uber a number of advantages. It would mean raising fresh outside capital, providing the company ammunition to pursue acquisitions and other opportunities. And it would enable Mr. Khosrowshahi to potentially reshape Uber\u2019s board because current members can be asked to leave when there is a liquidity event like an I.P.O., according to the company charter. Uber\u2019s board has grappled with a history of infighting.Any offering would be \u201csubject to market and other conditions,\u201d Lyft said.Advertisement"}

Such declines are typically described as \u201ccorrections,\u201d a designation that describes a market that\u2019s seriously slumping but not yet in bear-market territory of losses of more than 20 percent.Weak data on industrial output and retail sales in China kicked off the global market downturn Friday. The numbers further inflamed worries among investors that the trade war between the United States and China is beginning to slow global economic growth. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, had reported a slowdown in trade and economic growth in recent weeks. But the numbers on retail sales and industrial output suggested that the slowdown deepened in November.\u201cPeople are just worried,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist for the institutional brokerage firm JonesTrading in Greenwich, Conn. \u201cThe trade war is starting to hurt, and you haven\u2019t been rewarded for chasing the rallies and people are getting a little more defensive here.\u201dTech shares were big losers on Friday, with Apple and Microsoft dropping more than 3 percent and the sector falling 2.5 percent over all.

The S&P 500 health care sector fell 3.4 percent, making it the worst performing part of the market. Health shares were dragged down by a more than 10 percent loss for Johnson & Johnson, after Reuters reported that the company had kept the presence of carcinogenic asbestos in its baby powder from regulators and consumers.Friday\u2019s decline in the S&P 500 erased its gains for the week.

Developments on that front continued Friday, with China pledging to suspend additional tariffs on imports of American-made cars for three months starting in the new year.Automakers\u2019 shares rose on the news. But as the week came to a close, investors turned increasingly defensive, opting to dump stocks.Earlier Friday, markets across Asia dropped.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Has Wiped Out Its 2018 Gains. But if You Step Back, It\u2019s Still Riding High.", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementThe S&P 500-stock index has entered what the financial world calls a correction, technically defined by a decline of at least 10 percent from the market\u2019s peak. It\u2019s a relatively arbitrary threshold, but it\u2019s often seen as a symbol of souring investor sentiment.Lately, the markets have been rattled by the prospect that a protracted trade war with China could begin to take an economic toll at a time when global growth is slowing.Viewed over a longer period, however, corrections often begin to look less severe.Even after the current sell-off, for instance, the S&P 500 through Friday\u2019s close was up by nearly 15 percent since President Trump\u2019s inauguration and more than 21 percent since Election Day 2016.Over the long run, the markets have risen since the economy came out of recession a decade ago. During that time, there have been a half-dozen corrections, and the declines didn\u2019t presage more significant downturns in the market or the economy.In the last 20 years, there have been 10 corrections. Only two turned into a bear market, defined as a decline of 20 percent from its high, amid the recessions that began in 2001 and at the end of 2007.Of course, corrections can be early indicators of a severe downturn in the stock market.

{"Headline": "The Fed Just Raised Interest Rates. Here\u2019s What That Means for Your Wallet.", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe interest rate increase has consequences for savers and spenders alike. Whether you\u2019ve got a savings account or a credit card (or both), here\u2019s what you need to know.Here\u2019s a refresher on what it all means for your wallet.When the Fed raises rates, some banks may pay more interest on savings accounts, particularly when they want to lure consumers to park their money. But the big banks haven\u2019t been too generous lately, and you shouldn\u2019t expect much to change with the latest increase. Today, the average savings and money market deposit accounts pay a paltry 0.22 percent, according to BankRate.com. That\u2019s up from 0.10 percent in 2015, when the Fed starting raising rates. You also shouldn\u2019t rush to tie up your money in certificates of deposit, which tend to move in step with similarly dated Treasury securities. Two-year C.D.s are paying just more than 1 percent on average, but you can find some paying 3 percent if you take the time to comparison-shop, according to BankRate.com.Bond investors often get nervous when interest rates rise because bond prices tend to fall in response. Why? When rates increase, the price of existing (and lower-yielding) bonds drop because investors can buy new bonds that offer higher interest rates. But higher rates also mean that bonds will generate more interest income, which is good for investors over the long run.But fear not, that\u2019s not the full picture: A fund like that also pays investors interest, and will soon be adding new bonds paying a higher rate. That offsets some of the decline in value.Many people think mortgage rates are tied to the Fed\u2019s short-term rate, but there is no direct link. Most 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are priced off the 10-year Treasury bond, which is influenced by a variety of factors, including the outlook for inflation and long-term economic growth here and abroad.But some home loans are more directly connected to the Fed\u2019s action, including home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.s. A typical home-equity borrower has already seen rates rise to about 6.5 percent, according to BankRate.com, from roughly 4.5 percent three years ago. And now rates will probably move a quarter-point higher.The good news related to adjustable-rate mortgages \u2014 which typically have a fixed rate for a certain number of years, and then adjust each year thereafter \u2014 is that few people have them, Mr. Gumbinger said. But borrowers who are already out of their fixed-rate period and are set for an annual reset in December can expect to pay more. They will most likely see a rise to about 5.36 percent for 2019, up from a rate of 4.3 percent over the past year.For the sake of comparison, rates on 30-year fixed mortgages are now about 4.75 percent. That\u2019s still favorable from a historical standpoint, and those loans are usually the most practical for most buyers. Credit-card holders with variable rates \u2014 averaging around 17.6 percent, up from about 15.7 percent at the end of 2015, according to BankRate.com \u2014 can expect their rates to rise another quarter-point within one or two monthly cycles.While the rate hikes\u2019 cumulative effect is beginning to squeeze car buyers, the latest increase probably won\u2019t change your decision to finance a car. It would only your raise monthly payments by a few dollars a month on a $25,000 loan that will be repaid in five years.Those paying off federal student loans don\u2019t have to worry, because they carry a fixed rate. The next round of new loans will have their rate set in July, based on the 10-year Treasury bond. But private student loans generally base their fixed and variable rates on the Libor index, which tends to track the Fed funds rate pretty closely. So students in that market can expect to see a more immediate increase.Advertisement"}

Here are two examples:This year was the strongest for initial public offerings since 2014. (That was the year Alibaba skewed the numbers with its $25 billion I.P.O.) In all, companies raised $209 billion globally through I.P.O.s, up 6 percent from a year ago, according to Dealogic.The biggest I.P.O.s of the year happened on exchanges in Asia. SoftBank raised $21.3 billion floating shares of its mobile unit in Tokyo. China Tower raised $7.5 billion in Hong Kong, and Xiaomi also sold $5.4 billion worth of stock there.The stock markets were defined in 2018 by record highs followed by steep sell-offs. Investors piled into the biggest tech companies, pushing the market values of Amazon and Apple above $1 trillion. But soon investors were dumping tech shares, sending the Nasdaq into a bear market for the first time since the financial crisis. Companies handed back more than a $1 trillion to investors through buybacks and dividends. But markets were also whipsawed by fears of slowing global economic growth, rising interest rates and trade wars.Despite it all, Wall Street analysts predict that the S&P 500 will rise next year.But there are still reasons to be pessimistic. Here\u2019s what could spook investors next year:A lot went right for banks in 2018. They were big beneficiaries of the tax overhaul enacted at the end of 2017. The Trump administration started what may become a bonanza of deregulation for them. The economy grew. Interest rates increased, bolstering profit from lending. Over all, banks\u2019 earnings are expected to surge 34 percent in 2018. In June, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, talked about \u201ca golden age of banking.\u201d\u2022 If the Fed raises interest rates by more than expected and the economy slows, banks could be hit hard. Wall Street business would suffer, demand for loans would decline and more borrowers could default, causing losses for banks.\u2022 If the Fed manages to set rates at a level that keeps the economy growing at close to current rates, and inflation is dormant, bank earnings should hold up. But as 2018 has shown, that may not be enough for investors.The short answer: probably. The longer answer: It\u2019s complicated, and opinion is divided over when it might happen.In others words: Keep your wits about you in 2019.Thanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Maintaining Balance in Retirement Accounts", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere might be nothing wrong with it at the moment \u2014 you probably have some terrific investments. But a retirement account has to shift its balance as you age.When we\u2019re young, it\u2019s best to be aggressive. Stocks, stocks and more stocks will ensure that your portfolio grows. Even though stocks rise and fall, over time they are the best way to build a nest egg. But as you get closer to retirement, you need to shift your portfolio to reduce the amount devoted to those volatile stocks, since a plunge at a moment when you can least afford it could slash the savings that you need to live on.So at that stage in your life, experts suggest you load up on bonds, which tend to fluctuate less, and extremely stable investments like money market funds. Bonds don\u2019t earn as much as stocks do, generally, and they can certainly decline as investments when markets slump. But they won\u2019t plunge nearly as much as stocks \u2014 and sometimes they even go up when stocks go down.\u201cIf you are still working, then you can be very aggressive,\u201d said Tom Fredrickson, a certified financial planner in Brooklyn. When stocks go down, being invested in stock funds means you are buying them more cheaply. That kind of risk-taking should slow considerably within five years of ending your employment, he warned. \u201cAt the beginning of retirement, you shouldn\u2019t be 100 percent in stocks.\u201dHe explained the math: If you suffer a stock market fall that reduces the value of your stock holdings by 50 percent, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to make 100 percent to get back your 50 percent.\u201d And if you are pulling money out of the account to pay for day-to-day expenses by then, \u201cyou\u2019re going to go broke quickly.\u201dThere is an old rule of thumb for asset allocation: Subtract your age from 100, and the resulting number is the percentage of your investments you should have in stocks. Because people live longer than they used to, and because investments like Treasury bonds don\u2019t pay as much as they used to, rule-of-thumb watchers have revised the number to subtract from 110 or even 120.Depending on your stomach for risk, you might hold on to your stocks even longer.Staying in the stock market very late in the game is smart only if you\u2019re wealthy enough, or, say, have the stability of a pension or the expectation of an inheritance, and \u201cthe market is just a game for you,\u201d Mr. Fredrickson said.At the moment, he is helping two of his clients find a better balance for their portfolios. John D. Marry and Nancy Laughlin have been together for 44 years, and worked together at the accounting giant Deloitte. When they retired from the firm, however, they didn\u2019t stop working.\u201cWe\u2019re sort of hard-core, unreconstructed academics,\u201d he said, and they both teach at Fordham University now. He took his retirement in a lump sum and invested much of it in stocks. The move, while risky, was smart in retrospect; the market rose. \u201cWe actually have more money now than we did six years ago when we retired,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather be lucky than smart.\u201dHe had also taken out home equity loans on a couple of properties he owns, he said, and used the money to live on so that they could keep their savings in the market, which also \u201cturned out to be just one of those lucky things \u2014 a dumb gamble that worked out,\u201d he said.Shouldn\u2019t he be backing off stocks and rebalancing his portfolio at the age of 70? He acknowledges that it is sensible advice, he said. But \u201cI\u2019m inclined to ignore it,\u201d especially since they are still working. His wife, however, \u201ccalls my attention back to reality on a regular basis.\u201d And, as the second year of the Trump administration nears a close, however, he confessed to being wary of equities, because Mr. Marry said he had little faith in the person in the White House, and he knew that no bull market lasts forever.And so, he said, \u201cI\u2019m fixing to move more, much more into bonds,\u201d and to pay down the loans on those properties before the interest rates adjust upward. He added that his, \u201clong love affair with tech stocks is kind of coming to a close.\u201dSheryl Garrett, a consultant to financial planners who lives in Arkansas, recommends that her clients take a close look at \u201ctarget date funds\u201d that automatically adjust over time to balance risk and reward, becoming more conservative as the client nears the date of retirement. She said that she preferred low-cost funds like the Vanguard Life Strategy funds because of the low costs and low tax impact, but said she had seen similar offerings from many other companies, including Betterment and Charles Schwab.The most important thing about target funds, she said, is the set-it-and-forget it peace of mind that they can bring. \u201cI am a fan of rebalancing or thinking about rebalancing, on an annual basis,\u201d she said. But she also knows that her customers are busy and harried. And target funds relieve them of some of that burden.In her own life, Ms. Garrett said, investing has become much more conservative lately. Self-employed, she knows that business can slip, and that life is uncertain; her spouse, who runs a cabin rental business in northwest Arkansas, recently received a cancer diagnosis. Looking at all of that, she said, \u201cI felt I wanted a little more stability in my world.\u201dThat meant making more conservative investments for herself than she advises for some clients. So her retirement fund is at a low 20 percent equity, half what it had been for years. At the rule of thumb of 100 minus her age, her stocks should make up 45 percent of her portfolio.\u201cI need to stress less about what\u2019s going on in fiscal markets,\u201d she said. \u201cI decided I didn\u2019t have the capacity, the tolerance, for losing money \u2014 I was actually fine with seeing a minute return.\u201dAnd yes, she says, \u201ca lot of people would call me an idiot and crazy for that.\u201d But, she says, \u201cthat\u2019s why they call it personal financial planning. It\u2019s very personal.\u201dJohn Schwartz is a reporter for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christmastime in Naples: Jesus, Mary and Ronaldo", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "A pedestrian road in this Italian city is famous for its handmade nativity scenes, but its visitors are as likely to encounter well-known soccer figures as biblical ones.Supported byNAPLES, Italy \u2014 Up and down this cramped pedestrian street there are little clay statues of Cristiano Ronaldo, unmistakable in their form: legs spread shoulder-width apart, arms shooting at the ground, hair gelled into a luscious wave.There are also fat Ronaldos; weirdly skinny Ronaldos; Ronaldos with faces that resemble \u201cThe Scream,\u201d by Edvard Munch; and many, many other Ronaldos that, in general, look very little like the actual Ronaldo.Together, the diminutive Ronaldos represent an ever-growing segment of the colorful Christmastime panoply on Via San Gregorio Armeno, a historical street in the heart of Naples, Italy, that has been known since the 1800s as a spiritual home of artisans specializing in traditional nativity scenes, or presepi.Many consider the traditional figurines from these Neapolitan workshops \u2014 intricate models of biblical figures crafted from wood, clay, wire and fine cloth \u2014 to be refined works of art. Yet casual visitors to the street these days might be more likely to encounter the clay statuettes of celebrities and pop culture figures that now dominate the famous street\u2019s storefronts and curbside tables.And in a soccer-crazy city like Naples, it is natural that soccer players, and the clay representations of them, have begun to receive top billing.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain, but it\u2019s like a visceral faith,\u201d Marco Ferrigno, a fourth-generation artisan who owns one of the most famous workshops on the street, said of the city\u2019s soccer obsession. \u201cSo players can become idols \u2014 to the extreme, sometimes.\u201dAlongside all the baby Jesuses and the different Ronaldos, then, holiday shoppers can find handcrafted figurines of Francesco Totti taking a selfie, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 with his arms folded across his chest, Lionel Messi pointing two hands to the sky and almost every current member of Napoli, the beloved local team.The statues can reference recent games, major accomplishments, trademark gestures or humorous incidents. The transfer market and league standings can dictate stores\u2019 inventory. Artisans can glorify players or antagonize them.The sidewalk stalls feature enough soccer players to populate a statuette World Cup, and the street, in turn, has developed a divided identity: part sacred museum, part tourist trap, part art gallery, part miniature Madame Tussauds.\u201cThe market demanded it,\u201d Isabella Esposito, 54, whose family has owned a store on the street since 1950, said of the dense display of soccer player sculptures in front of her store.It was not always this way. Nativity scenes became prominent in Naples in the late 1700s as an art form besides painting that the city\u2019s nobility could patronize. Over the next century, the city\u2019s presepi took on a distinct style: dense, ornate and full of life, situating religious figures like the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus on Neapolitan streetscapes alongside other generically pastoral characters, like pizza makers.According to Marino Niola, an anthropologist at the Suor Orsola Benincasa University of Naples who wrote a book in 2005 called \u201cIl Presepe,\u201d the nativity scene tradition experienced a dip in popularity after World War II. Niola said it was no coincidence then that the nativity scene \u2014 which he called \u201ca ritualistic toy to play a metaphysical game\u201d \u2014 started making a comeback in the mid-1990s, once artisans on Via San Gregorio Armeno began introducing pop culture figures to their inventory of statuettes.In the beginning, of course, there was Diego Maradona.Even today, Maradona is nobly featured in nearly every presepe shop on the street, always with flowing hair, always with short shorts.\u201cHe was an idol, and becoming a figure in the nativity scene was a form of sanctification,\u201d Niola said of Maradona.Not everyone has enjoyed the developments in the industry. Vincenzo Nicolella, artistic director of the Neapolitan Association of the Presepe, said he was concerned that the universe of acceptable nativity scene characters was expanding too rapidly.Since the 1990s, traditional shops have prominently featured figurines of politicians, actors, singers and even, more recently, Instagram influencers alongside the soccer stars. Traditional nativity scene figures, meanwhile, are often relegated indoors and out of plain sight. Nicolella grew particularly agitated last year when he noticed \u201cStar Wars\u201d characters sold in the shops.\u201cAn intervention is necessary to say, \u2018Hold on, please keep your hands off the presepe,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot forget that we are speaking of a high quality artistic tradition.\u201dMany artisans and merchants, though, have accepted that they have to straddle the two worlds, sacred and secular. They say the soccer players and celebrities invite younger generations to learn about a craft that can otherwise feel old-fashioned.Sitting at a squat wooden desk passed down to him from his grandfather, Genny Di Virgilio proudly showed off the delicate handmade pieces inside his family workshop, which his great-grandfather opened in 1930. Like many of the other shops, the Di Virgilio workshop stocks little red horn amulets, which look a bit like chili peppers and are meant to ward off bad luck (\u201cWe have a saying in Naples: \u2018It\u2019s not true, but I believe it\u2019\u201d) and figurines that cleverly piggyback on international politics. (\u201cWe sold a lot of statues of Trump last year,\u201d he said. \u201cMamma mia.\u201d)Di Virgilio said that the traditional religious figurines, some of which can cost thousands of euros apiece, represented most of his business, but that the soccer figurines, which are around 20 euros apiece, garnered the most attention from passers-by.There is a clay statue of Zinedine Zidane head-butting Marco Materazzi at the 2006 World Cup and, nearby, a photograph of Materazzi holding it, a big smile on his face. In fact, the entire store (like Ferrigno\u2019s) is covered with photographs of soccer players holding their own likenesses in nativity scene statuette form. Di Virgilio coolly rattled off the names of players he has met \u2014 Edinson Cavani, Marek Hamsik, Lorenzo Insigne, Dries Mertens, Mauro Icardi, Mario Balotelli \u2014 before trailing off.\u201cThey become children again when they see the sculptures,\u201d Di Virgilio said.Di Virgilio said Ronaldo became his top seller this year after joining Juventus from Real Madrid, and he has been happy to feature the striker prominently in the store.\u201cI\u2019m a Napoli fan, and an anti-Juventus fan, but in business we have to make amends,\u201d he said.Such generosity is not extended to all players, apparently. Di Virgilio currently sells a statue of Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, a former Napoli player, with devil horns and a sign that reads, \u201cungrateful heart,\u201d in Neapolitan slang. Higua\u00edn was seen to have betrayed the city when he decamped for Juventus two years ago.At another store up the street, Higua\u00edn is depicted holding a platter with three bab\u00e0s \u2014 a vaguely mushroom-shaped, traditional Neapolitan pastry \u2014 symbolizing the three goals Napoli scored against his current team, A.C. Milan, earlier this season.Di Virgilio cringed at the idea that people might place one of his soccer player figurines inside a traditional nativity scene. But many do. Anyway, he said, customers in the last couple of years have been coming into his store and requesting a new sort of product: clay figurines of themselves.Could a celebrity-obsessed generation give way to a cohort of narcissists?\u201cI have 30 of them to make before Dec. 24,\u201d he said last week, shrugging.Brando de Leonardis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bank Stocks Were Bruised the Worst in the Sell-Off. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinancial stocks have just had their worst day since the February sell-off.Behind the slide was the fall in the yields on Treasury securities as bond prices have risen. Investors have been buying Treasuries in recent days as they increasingly wager that the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of rate increases in the new year.Banks borrow at lower short-term rates and lend at higher longer-term rates, and the bigger the difference between the two rates, the more profitable the banks are. Longer-term interest rates being set in the market have declined recently, which could signal that banks will earn less interest on their loans in the future.The fate of financial stocks has largely been tied to the direction of interest rates in recent years.At least for a time, bank stocks can do well in a rising-rate environment. After years of the Fed holding rates down, shares of banks took off at the end of 2015 as the central bank began to lift rates. From then through the end of 2017, financial stocks were the best performing sector in the S&P 500, rising 44 percent and beating the broader index\u2019s 24 percent increase.Those gains were expected to continue into this year. The tax cut signed into law late last year raised the bottom lines of banks and the Trump administration was moving forward with cutting regulations on the industry.But bank stocks have lagged the broader market since this spring. Investors have grown increasingly concerned about trade and economic growth, and that anxiety has increased the allure of safe, long-term bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 a bellwether for long-term rates \u2014 has spent much of that period stuck below 3 percent.Advertisement"}

The benchmark Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indexes hit their lows for the year on Oct. 18 after China\u2019s government reported that the country\u2019s economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly a decade during the third quarter. Since then, the two indexes are up 6 percent and 10 percent. By comparison, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 4 percent over that period.It\u2019s not that investors in China are sanguine about a trade war. It\u2019s that they just began selling much earlier.Chinese stocks tumbled more than 25 percent from mid-March through Oct. 18. That pushed valuations on Chinese stocks, by some measures, to their lowest levels in four years.The steep declines were partly because China\u2019s economy is more susceptible to a trade war than America\u2019s. China sells a lot more to the United States than it purchases. The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive approach to trade also came at a delicate time for China. The country was trying to tackle its considerable debt problem without slowing its economy further.A similar shift in sentiment was experienced across emerging-market stocks. Pressured by trade, rising interest rates in the United States and a stronger American dollar, the MSCI Emerging Market Index fell about 20 percent this year to its low in October. That left those stocks looking cheap too.Some of the pressures on emerging markets have eased since then. China and the United States agreed to a 90-day trade truce, the dollar has weakened and investors increasingly believe the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of rate increases. Over the last six weeks, emerging-market stocks have gained 5 percent.China is hardly past many of the concerns that have pulled down share prices this year. The country is still wrestling with how to ease its onerous debt burden without hurting economic growth, and trade negotiations could fall apart or end without any resolution.Could the recent performance of China\u2019s stock market indicate that the effect of the trade war on share prices is nearing a bottom? After all, sometimes the markets that get beat up the most, are also the first to show that the worst is nearing an end.We will have to wait to see if that is the case with trade.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meet the People Trying to Put a Friendlier Face on Annuities", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyThere is a boomlet in kinder, gentler annuity providers, and they want you to devote some of your savings to guaranteeing more retirement income for yourself.Saving for retirement requires a strange sort of oddsmaking.On one hand, we\u2019re somehow supposed to know what returns to expect from investments in our retirement accounts over the next 25 or 50 years.And on the other, we must apply our prediction skills to related questions about how long we\u2019ll want to work, how long we\u2019ll be able to work, how long anyone will be willing to pay us to work and how long we\u2019ll live.It\u2019s absurd to think that you can do this with any degree of accuracy.And so we return to annuities, which at their simplest (as they should be) are a way to exchange some of your hard-earned money for regular checks that will keep coming until you die. It\u2019s a guarantee, in other words, that at least some of your money will not be subject to an extended stock market rout, and that you can count on predictable income on top of whatever you receive from Social Security.When Ramsey Smith was a managing director at Goldman Sachs, he assisted annuity providers who wanted to hedge their risks. \u201cI was a merchant of complexity,\u201d he said.Helping insurance companies keep their promises to policyholders was fine work. But the more he learned about the industry, the more he wondered about the endless add-ons the products often contained. \u201cYou can compensate for inferior user experience with shinier and shinier objects, or you can say \u2018What is the version of this that would be most accessible to the most people,\u2019\u201d he said.This is a simple annuity, by the way. There are no sub-accounts tracking securities as with a variable annuity, and no caps or participation rates or other things to decipher like with an indexed annuity. Will Blueprint offer either of those? No, Mr. Carey said.\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018never say never,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018never ever.\u2019\u201dIf you earn between $50,000 and $100,000 per year, Dan Solin is worried about you.Their solution involves some savings in a workplace retirement plan, a little-known type of life insurance that amasses cash value. If you retire at 65, it can help tide you over until you can maximize the size of your Social Security earnings at 70. You also begin paying into a simple annuity midway through your career, but it does not kick out regular payments until you turn 70. By waiting that long to start collecting from the annuity, you get rewarded with fatter checks, which will come in handy if your workplace retirement plan savings have run out.Mr. Edelman is wary of even the most basic annuities, since he worries that some scientific breakthrough could extend the average human life span by so many years that it would blow up the models that insurance company actuaries use. Indeed, much of my reader mail in the past week revolved around whether we should trust the stability of insurance companies that so frequently sell annuities.In the event that many companies imploded simultaneously, the state funds would probably run out of money. My guess is that states and the federal government would then step in with bailouts to keep people out of the soup lines, but we can\u2019t be certain of it.Those are a lot of ifs. Sure, insurance-company risk is not zero, but there is also no certainty that putting the majority of your money in stocks and bonds over 50 years will deliver returns anything like those of the previous half-century. Perhaps they\u2019ll be better, in which case you\u2019d feel like a rube for putting too much money in a stodgy annuity. But if returns are much worse, it could leave you with a deeply compromised retirement or force you to work into your 80s.So with annuities, as with investments and life itself, we all just have to figure out how much risk we\u2019re comfortable with \u2014 and just how much we ought to spread that risk around.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Bounce Back From Edge of Bear Market", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThroughout Wall Street\u2019s December meltdown, analysts have been saying that markets were plunging despite plenty of evidence that the United States economy remains strong and corporate profit growth is healthy.A substantial rise in crude oil prices added to the lighter mood, as did efforts from the White House to ease up on criticism of the Federal Reserve.The rally continued in Asia, led by Japan, where stocks on Thursday opened 3.7 percent higher.The rebound in the United States offered investors a much-needed reprieve from a decline that had picked up speed in December. Stocks had fallen for four consecutive days through Monday, and the drop had pushed the S&P 500 to within just a few points of a bear market \u2014 defined as a 20 percent retreat from its high.Still, the S&P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis a decade ago and is only back to where it stood on Dec. 20. Plus, the move in prices Wednesday was most likely heightened by lighter-than-average trading volume during a holiday week.But to some traders, the move upward finally made sense.\u201cFundamentally you\u2019ve got good growth here in the States, you have reasonable growth overseas, you\u2019re going to have record earnings in 2019 and possibly in 2020 as well, you\u2019ve got low inflation,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Before Wednesday\u2019s steep rise, the market had fallen too far, Mr. Wren said, and it was ready to climb thanks to the underlying strength of the American economy.The rally was broad-based. Only one stock in the S&P 500, Newmont Mining, fell.Oil prices, too, were on the move after Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, told a Russian newspaper that the country would benefit from continuing to cooperate with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on regulating production. American crude, the benchmark for oil prices, rose almost 9 percent to over $46 a barrel, and shares of large energy producers also climbed.After leading Wall Street\u2019s recent slide, technology stocks rebounded as well. Tech investors have had plenty of causes for concern. A slowing global economy could hurt sales, tensions are rising with China on manufacturing of devices, and privacy concerns are bringing the potential for regulation. Apple shares rose 7 percent, while stock in the semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices gained 7.5 percent and Facebook added more than 8 percent.Bank stocks, which have taken the brunt of recent selling as worries grew that the United States economy was weakening, rose significantly.The rally doesn\u2019t mean that this year\u2019s precipitous decline in stock prices is over. Signs of economic health that encouraged the buying are doing little to address one of stock investors\u2019 primary concerns. They\u2019re worried that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to continue raising interest rates, even if at a slightly slower pace, will hurt the economy and corporate profits. Higher interest rates on bonds or even savings accounts make stock investments less appealing as an alternative.The Fed announced an interest-rate increase last week and said it would continue to withdraw the support it had offered the economy in the wake of the financial crisis.\u201cThe Fed is making a monumental mistake,\u201d said Barry Bannister, the head of institutional equity strategy at the broker Stifel. \u201cThey do not realize how long and by how much they\u2019ve tightened already, and until they back off the market\u2019s going to have a very weak floor under it.\u201dAdding to volatility has been the possibility that President Trump would consider firing the central bank\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, because he disagreed with Fed policy. Mr. Trump, who previously sought to hitch his political success to a rising stock market, has blamed interest-rate increases for the downturn on Wall Street.White House officials insisted again that the president had no plans to fire Mr. Powell, news that reassured investors.Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Wednesday morning that Mr. Powell\u2019s job was \u201c100 percent\u201d safe. He echoed remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, both of whom spent the weekend trying to persuade investors that the president did not plan to fire Mr. Powell. Those efforts had mostly backfired, in part because Mr. Trump continued to criticize his handpicked Fed chairman.It also helped matters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump refrained from offering new criticism of the Fed, a marked difference from the days leading up to the Christmas holiday, when he railed against the central bank on Twitter and vowed to keep the government shut down for an extended period. In fact, for the first trading session in many days, Mr. Trump posted just one tweet: It was about his trip to Iraq.Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Raises Interest Rates, Showing Confidence in Health of Economy", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and signaled that it expects additional rate increases next year in a display of measured confidence in the economy that came despite financial market worries and political pressure to suspend rate increases.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, emphasized the continued strength of economic growth at a news conference after the announcement. He acknowledged new strains in recent months, including weaker growth in Europe and China and a downturn in stock prices, and he said the Fed expects slightly slower domestic growth and fewer rate increases next year.But he strongly defended the Fed\u2019s decision to increase rates.\u201cWe think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell\u2019s remarks were described by one analyst as a dose of \u201ctough love\u201d for financial markets.Mr. Powell insisted on the wisdom of the Fed\u2019s plans to raise borrowing costs while investors dumped their holdings. Stock prices fell when the Fed released its policy statement at 2 p.m., and dropped again as Mr. Powell spoke. The S&P 500 was down 1.5 percent on the day and is now down 6 percent on the year.Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s advice, Mr. Powell said it \u201cplayed no role\u201d in the Fed\u2019s decision.\u201cNothing will deter us from doing exactly what we think is the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\u201cPolicy at this point does not need to be accommodative,\u201d Mr. Powell said of that milestone.The Fed\u2019s announcement offered a few crumbs for critics. In previous statements, the Fed had said it planned \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d in its benchmark rate, conveying to investors that additional increases were expected. Wednesday\u2019s statement sought to recalibrate those expectations by adding the word \u201csome\u201d to the beginning of the phrase, suggesting that rates may not rise much higher.A majority of Fed officials predicted on Wednesday that the central bank would raise rates no more than twice next year. In September, most Fed officials had predicted at least three rate increases.Mr. Powell tried to emphasize that the Fed would continue to keep a close eye on economic conditions and said that the ultimate pace of rate increases was \u201cnot predetermined.\u201d He has said the Fed\u2019s goal is to strike a balance between extending the expansion and maintaining control of inflation.But the overall tone of the statement suggested the Fed continues to regard the strength of economic growth as more impressive than any storm clouds on the horizon, including a trade war with China and geopolitical strains overseas. Companies continue to add jobs, the unemployment rate sits at 3.7 percent and wages are rising more quickly.\u201cOver the past year, the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows and inflation has been low and stable,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cAll of those things remain true today.\u201dStill, Mr. Powell noted that the robust expansion of 2018 would most likely moderate next year, and critics continued to raise questions about the Fed\u2019s steady march toward higher rates. It now appears likely that inflation will fall short of the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target for the seventh consecutive year. And Fed officials predicted on Wednesday that the central bank will miss the 2 percent target next year, too.Low inflation is a sign of economic weakness and can be a problem in its own right, for instance by restricting the Fed\u2019s ability to reduce borrowing costs should the economy begin to falter.\u201cI think they will look back on this as a mistake,\u201d Josh Bivens, the director of research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said of the rate increase. \u201cThis threatens to snuff out the very beginning of wage gains that we\u2019ve started to see recently in the data. The Fed should allow the expansion\u2019s gains to reach more broadly into the work force and get off the steady escalator of ever-higher interest rates.\u201dInvestors and some economists are increasingly concerned about the economic outlook, particularly as the sugar high from Mr. Trump\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases wears off and as the president continues to press trade fights with most of the nation\u2019s major trading partners.FedEx, a bellwether for the global economy, on Wednesday sharply reduced its profit outlook for 2019 and announced plans to cut jobs, citing a deterioration in demand for its shipping services.Fred Smith, the company\u2019s chief executive, blamed the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies.\u201cMost of the issues that we\u2019re dealing with today are induced by bad political choices,\u201d Mr. Smith said, specifically citing Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions to impose tariffs on a wide range of foreign goods.There are also signs that the Fed\u2019s march toward higher rates is weighing on sales of homes and autos.\u201cThe era of low auto loan rates is clearly behind us,\u201d said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, which gathers data on the auto industry. Mr. Smoke said the average monthly payment on a new car in November was $567, a 5 percent increase over November 2017. \u201cIf rates are indeed even higher in 2019, the buyer pool for new vehicles could further decline,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s a mood of concern, a mood of angst about growth going forward,\u201d Mr. Powell said.But he said the impact on the economy so far appeared to be small.\u201cIn our view, these developments have not fundamentally altered the outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said.He added that the United States economy \u201chas continued to perform well\u201d and that \u2014 while overall financial conditions have tightened \u2014 the Fed has only \u201cmodestly\u201d lowered its projections as a result.The bottom line, he said, is that the Fed intends to let circumstances dictate its decisions.If the economy weakens, the Fed will raise rates more slowly, or stand still. If the economy continues to chug along, the Fed is likely to raise rates at least a few more times.The Fed\u2019s forecasts are guesses, not promises. \u201cThere\u2019s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the ultimate destination of any further increases,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Rise After U.S. and China Agree to Halt Escalation of Trade War", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks rose on Wall Street Monday after President Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary truce in the trade war between the United States and China.The S&P 500-stock index climbed 1.1 percent, notching its fifth gain in the last six trading sessions. Major Asian and European equity markets also posted solid increases.Exporting giants like Boeing, Caterpillar and Deere pulled the export-reliant S&P 500 industrial sector higher. Semiconductor makers, which have been hurt by the trade war\u2019s potential to disrupt their widespread production networks in Asia, also rose, as did tech giants such as Apple, which climbed more than 3 percent.Still, market gains were tempered by doubts that the fragile cease-fire \u2014 essentially a 90-day postponement of additional American tariffs on Chinese imports \u2014 would put the dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies to rest permanently.\u201cJust because they have a truce for three months doesn\u2019t mean this thing is going away,\u201d said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at the asset manager Fidelity Investments in Boston.The d\u00e9tente, forged by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi over a dinner, merely postpones a larger reckoning over trade. Under the deal, the United States will postpone an increase in tariffs that was set to be imposed Jan. 1, and it sets a March 1 deadline for the countries to reach a more extensive pact.The deal leaves in place American tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods and the retaliatory measures enacted by Beijing. It is unclear whether the countries can resolve such thorny questions as the Chinese government\u2019s support for sensitive industries and protections for American-created intellectual property.Still, the relatively good outcome of the meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump adds to the sense of relief for investors. A range of worries \u2014 about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to continue raising interest rates, the impact of the midterm elections in the United States, the trade war and signs of slowing global growth \u2014 weighed on stocks in October and November. After it peaked on Sept. 20, the stock market\u2019s gains for the year melted away as the S&P 500 slumped more than 10 percent through Nov. 23.In recent weeks, several developments had also helped allay those concerns. Last week, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, sparked a market rally when he said interest rates were \u201cjust below\u201d a range of estimates for the neutral level, meaning the Fed was nearing the point where it would not be tapping on the brakes or pressing on the gas on the economy. His statements raised investor hopes that the Fed might not lift interest rates as high as previously thought.Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season has shown corporate profits remained strong.The midterm elections on Nov. 6 went largely as expected, with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retaining control of the Senate.\u201cWhat were the worry points? Earnings and sales, the election, China, interest rates,\u201d said Richard Nackenson, a portfolio manager at the asset management firm Neuberger Berman. \u201cWow, guess what? It\u2019s all been mitigated.\u201dMr. Nackenson stressed, however, that the market\u2019s worries had not been resolved. Investors remain aware that the conflict between China and the United States is far from resolved, and stock market enthusiasm may be fleeting.\u201cWe see it obviously as a positive that there is a pause in the trade war talk,\u201d said Richard Weiss, chief investment officer for multi-asset strategies at American Century Investments. \u201cBut it could reignite at any moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jerome Powell Tries a Nuanced Fed Policy. Markets Don\u2019t Like It.", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalking a narrow line between signaling interest rate intentions and vowing to be nimble in response to changing conditions, he helps prompt a stock sell-off.The news conference Jerome Powell gave on Wednesday, his fourth as chairman of the Federal Reserve, was his most consequential to date, coming amid market turbulence and signs of an economic slowdown in the year ahead.But his message \u2014 or at least the part of it that matters most for the direction of the economy and markets \u2014 wasn\u2019t a simple one. It boils down to this:That being the case, there was no reason not to follow through with the interest rate increase that had already been telegraphed.But the choppy global economy and sell-off in stock and certain corporate debt markets has gotten Fed officials\u2019 attention, and they\u2019re open to the possibility that their optimism is misplaced. The officials are now thinking they should raise rates only twice next year, not three times as envisioned in September, and they\u2019re prepared to throttle back further if events justify it.Oh, but the effort to reduce the Fed\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar portfolio of bonds, acquired during its post-crisis era of monetary interventionism, will continue on autopilot, no matter how much President Trump tweets his complaints about it (as he did Tuesday).It\u2019s a bit of a messy combination, which helps explain why stocks sold off as the news conference progressed.Mr. Powell has emphasized that, with the economy relatively healthy, the Fed needs to make its policy moves responsive to incoming information, an approach of \u201cdata dependence.\u201d This contrasts with his immediate predecessors, who stressed \u201cforward guidance\u201d \u2014 using explicit signals about future plans as a tool of policy.\u201cThere\u2019s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the destination of any further increases,\u201d Mr. Powell said in the news conference.But the actual content of Wednesday\u2019s announcement shows how hard it will be to abandon forward guidance in practice.After all, Mr. Powell used a form of forward guidance \u2014 the signal about two 2019 rate increases instead of three \u2014 to indicate that the Fed is taking geopolitical concerns and strains in financial markets seriously. Had he not, the sell-off on Wall Street would have been even worse.And the Fed\u2019s strategy on unwinding its bond holdings in a steady, consistent manner is a form of forward guidance too \u2014 and one that Mr. Powell affirmed.He faced an admittedly tricky task in this meeting. If he had held off on raising interest rates, it would have fueled the idea that there is a \u201cPowell Put\u201d\u2014 that the Fed under his leadership will act like an option contract to prevent stocks from falling too much. It would also have looked as if President Trump\u2019s attacks on the Fed were changing its behavior.At the same time, Mr. Powell and the Fed are plenty attuned to the possibility that market swings, especially in the price of bonds, can reveal important information about what the economic future holds.So the use of this forward guidance was, in effect, a way for Mr. Powell to have it both ways: to keep on the path of tighter money while signaling that the Fed will back off if market turbulence starts to really pinch the economy.Indeed, the market drops over the last couple of months have, to some degree at least, aligned with the Fed\u2019s goals. Some of the markets for corporate debt that had looked a little bubbly two months ago appear less so now.Mr. Powell presumably didn\u2019t want to undo those positive effects, and in discussing economic risks spoke more extensively about international economic challenges than about the strains in interest-sensitive sectors of American industry.It may not have been enough for Wall Street on Wednesday, but there actually was some good news in the materials the Fed published for those who think the rate increase campaign should come to an end sooner rather than later.The consensus view of Fed officials on where their interest rate target ought to end up in the longer term was lowered, to 2.8 percent from 3 percent. That implies that officials have increased comfort with finishing their rate-raising campaign before much longer.But in figuring out whether, and when, to suspend rate increases, Mr. Powell and his colleagues face an inherent contradiction.It\u2019s well and good to make your policy by responding to incoming events, rather than following a preset course. But often a central bank\u2019s most powerful tool for guiding the economy isn\u2019t \u201copen market operations,\u201d the term for buying and selling securities to influence interest rates. It\u2019s \u201copen mouth operations,\u201d or telling the markets what you intend to do.It\u2019s mighty hard to have it both ways, as Mr. Powell found on Wednesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time for G.O.P. to Threaten to Fire Trump", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican leaders need to mount an intervention.Opinion ColumnistUp to now I have not favored removing President Trump from office. I felt strongly that it would be best for the country that he leave the way he came in, through the ballot box. But last week was a watershed moment for me, and I think for many Americans, including some Republicans.It was the moment when you had to ask whether we really can survive two more years of Trump as president, whether this man and his demented behavior \u2014 which will get only worse as the Mueller investigation concludes \u2014 are going to destabilize our country, our markets, our key institutions and, by extension, the world. And therefore his removal from office now has to be on the table.I believe that the only responsible choice for the Republican Party today is an intervention with the president that makes clear that if there is not a radical change in how he conducts himself \u2014 and I think that is unlikely \u2014 the party\u2019s leadership will have no choice but to press for his resignation or join calls for his impeachment.It has to start with Republicans, given both the numbers needed in the Senate and political reality. Removing this president has to be an act of national unity as much as possible \u2014 otherwise it will tear the country apart even more. I know that such an action is very difficult for today\u2019s G.O.P., but the time is long past for it to rise to confront this crisis of American leadership.Trump\u2019s behavior has become so erratic, his lying so persistent, his willingness to fulfill the basic functions of the presidency \u2014 like reading briefing books, consulting government experts before making major changes and appointing a competent staff \u2014 so absent, his readiness to accommodate Russia and spurn allies so disturbing and his obsession with himself and his ego over all other considerations so consistent, two more years of him in office could pose a real threat to our nation. Vice President Mike Pence could not possibly be worse.The damage an out-of-control Trump can do goes well beyond our borders. America is the keystone of global stability. Our world is the way it is today \u2014 a place that, despite all its problems, still enjoys more peace and prosperity than at any time in history \u2014 because America is the way it is (or at least was). And that is a nation that at its best has always stood up for the universal values of freedom and human rights, has always paid extra to stabilize the global system from which we were the biggest beneficiary and has always nurtured and protected alliances with like-minded nations.Donald Trump has proved time and again that he knows nothing of the history or importance of this America. That was made starkly clear in Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\u2019s resignation letter.Trump is in the grip of a mad notion that the entire web of global institutions and alliances built after World War II \u2014 which, with all their imperfections, have provided the connective tissues that have created this unprecedented era of peace and prosperity \u2014 threatens American sovereignty and prosperity and that we are better off without them.So Trump gloats at the troubles facing the European Union, urges Britain to exit and leaks that he\u2019d consider quitting NATO. These are institutions that all need to be improved, but not scrapped. If America becomes a predator on all the treaties, multilateral institutions and alliances holding the world together; if America goes from being the world\u2019s anchor of stability to an engine of instability; if America goes from a democracy built on the twin pillars of truth and trust to a country where it is acceptable for the president to attack truth and trust on a daily basis, watch out: Your kids won\u2019t just grow up in a different America. They will grow up in a different world.The last time America disengaged from the world remotely in this manner was in the 1930s, and you remember what followed: World War II.You have no idea how quickly institutions like NATO and the E.U. and the World Trade Organization and just basic global norms \u2014 like thou shalt not kill and dismember a journalist in your own consulate \u2014 can unravel when America goes AWOL or haywire under a shameless isolated president.But this is not just about the world, it\u2019s about the minimum decorum and stability we expect from our president. If the C.E.O. of any public company in America behaved like Trump has over the past two years \u2014 constantly lying, tossing out aides like they were Kleenex, tweeting endlessly like a teenager, ignoring the advice of experts \u2014 he or she would have been fired by the board of directors long ago. Should we expect less for our president?That\u2019s what the financial markets are now asking. For the first two years of the Trump presidency the markets treated his dishonesty and craziness as background noise to all the soaring corporate profits and stocks. But that is no longer the case. Trump has markets worried.The instability Trump is generating \u2014 including his attacks on the chairman of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is causing investors to wonder where the economic and geopolitical management will come from as the economy slows down. What if we\u2019re plunged into an economic crisis and we have a president whose first instinct is always to blame others and who\u2019s already purged from his side the most sober adults willing to tell him that his vaunted \u201cgut instincts\u201d have no grounding in economics or in law or in common sense. Mattis was the last one.We are now left with the B team \u2014 all the people who were ready to take the jobs that Trump\u2019s first team either resigned from \u2014 because they could not countenance his lying, chaos and ignorance \u2014 or were fired from for the same reasons.But too often Trump has given us disruption without any plan for what comes next. He has worked to destroy Obamacare with no plan for the morning after. He announced a pullout from Syria and Afghanistan without even consulting the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the State Department\u2019s top expert, let alone our allies.And while, yes, we need disruption in some areas, we also desperately need innovation in others. How do we manage these giant social networks? How do we integrate artificial intelligence into every aspect of our society, as China is doing? How do we make lifelong learning available to every American? At a time when we need to be building bridges to the 21st century, all Trump can talk about is building a wall with Mexico \u2014 a political stunt to energize his base rather than the comprehensive immigration reform that we really need.Indeed, Trump\u2019s biggest disruption has been to undermine the norms and values we associate with a U.S. president and U.S. leadership. And now that Trump has freed himself of all restraints from within his White House staff, his cabinet and his party \u2014 so that \u201cTrump can be Trump,\u201d we are told \u2014 he is freer than ever to remake America in his image.We cannot afford to find out.An earlier version of this article misstated the frequency of false or misleading claims told by President Trump.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.6 percent, pushing it 19.5 percent below its late-August peak.

Apple, Amazon and Microsoft were all down more than 2 percent.Elsewhere, President Trump again raised the specter of a federal government shutdown if he didn\u2019t receive funding for his promised border wall.And crude oil extended its slump, sending energy stocks sharply lower. The S&P energy sector led the declines in the S&P 500, with the energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron dropping 3.1 percent and 2.7 percent.American benchmark crude oil prices tumbled 4 percent more, pushing the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude to nearly $46 a barrel.Initially, the sharp slump in crude oil prices \u2014 they\u2019re down more than 23 percent this year \u2014 was seen as a result of a global supply glut that was expected to be transitory.

{"Headline": "Trump Renews Attack on Fed as Mnuchin Tries to Calm Markets", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 48-hour effort by the Trump administration to soothe jittery financial markets did little to reverse the free fall in stocks on Monday, as the president\u2019s renewed attack on the Federal Reserve and the specter of a prolonged government shutdown further rattled investors already worried about a global economic slowdown.With a single tweet on Monday, President Trump undercut his top economic advisers\u2019 efforts to reassure the markets that he did not intend to fire Jerome H. Powell as Fed chairman. But Mr. Trump, who blames the Fed\u2019s recent interest rate increases for the market gyrations, said \u201cthe only problem our economy has is the Fed,\u201d an assertion that exacerbated the worst sell-off on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis.Stocks continued marching toward their largest December declines since the 1930s, with the S&P 500 closing down 2.7 percent on Monday after a shortened trading session ahead of the Christmas holiday.The markets are trying to digest the confusing signals from Washington. On Saturday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, posted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump acknowledging that, while he did not agree with the Fed\u2019s recent interest rate increases, he did not have any plans to fire Mr. Powell. And Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Mr. Trump now realized he lacked authority to fire Mr. Powell, his handpicked chairman.For the markets, the Fed is a complicated player at the moment. Investors have been disappointed by rising interest rates, concerned that they could sap growth. But the speculation about firing Mr. Powell, a move that could turn the independent central bank into a political tool, has undermined confidence in a pivotal institution essential to economic policy.Markets have already been on edge in recent weeks because of uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations between the United States and China, signs of slowing global growth, and the prospect of a prolonged government shutdown in the United States. Mr. Mnuchin added to the economic jitters by announcing on Sunday that he had called bank executives to ensure the markets were functioning properly, the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis.\u201cIt signaled a sense of panic and anxiety that didn\u2019t need to be there,\u201d said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \u201cMy first reaction when I heard it was, what has happened over the last couple of days that the market does not understand or realize? Is there something that Treasury knows that the rest of us don\u2019t?\u201dAnd while Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney tried to reassure markets on the Fed\u2019s leadership, there is still an effort within the White House to discern whether any legal rationale exists for removing Mr. Powell from the chairman spot, according to two people familiar with the discussions.Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, has been openly critical of the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates and blamed the central bank for the market volatility. Mr. Mnuchin, meanwhile, has said the recent stock swings are the result of high-speed electronic trading and post-crisis financial rules that he says make it harder for banks to play their traditional market-stabilization role.Mr. Trump on Monday made clear he is still not happy with Mr. Powell, likening the Fed to a \u201cpowerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch - he can\u2019t putt!\u201dThose attacks have drawn criticism from former Fed officials as well as lawmakers from both parties, who say that any attempt to turn the Fed into a political organ would undermine its credibility. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.On Monday, Senator Jeff Flake, the retiring Arizona Republican, posted a photograph on Twitter of a 5-billion-dollar bank note from Zimbabwe and urged the president to back off.\u201cI\u2019ve lived in countries where the Head of State has used the central bank for political purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease respect the Fed\u2019s independence, Mr. President.\u201dAnd Wall Street is bracing for more intervention from a president who views the stock market as a report card of his presidency. Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at the investment advisory firm Veda Partners, spent her weekend studying the 1935 Banking Act to determine whether Mr. Trump could unseat Mr. Powell as chairman but keep him on the Fed board without violating the law. She has yet to determine whether that could pass legal muster.Treasury officials tried to brush away criticism of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s public statement and his calls to bank executives, saying he was trying to ensure that banks had ample liquidity for lending. But the conversations were described by several on the receiving end as more routine than the striking statement suggested.The Treasury secretary asked for updates on how markets were functioning and inquired about any stresses in the system, according to one bank chief executive. Another bank C.E.O. was so unconcerned about the recent fall in stocks that he used his time with Mr. Mnuchin to discuss new capital requirements and how they could affect the bank\u2019s balance sheet in the long term as the Fed continues selling government securities it amassed during the financial crisis, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion.Policymakers who participated in the President\u2019s Working Group call on Monday also described it as a routine meeting, with no market problems reported and nothing to warrant an official statement after the discussion. The call was described by a person familiar with the conversation as a \u201ccheck-in\u201d scheduled at the Treasury\u2019s request for officials so they could plan for a prolonged government shutdown.Negotiations to end the partial government shutdown have remained at an impasse since midnight Friday when funding lapsed for a number of federal agencies and nine departments, including the Treasury. Neither chamber is expected to reconvene until Thursday, with House lawmakers looking to the Senate Democrats and Mr. Trump to reach a compromise over border security funding.The decision to convene the working group, which became known as the Plunge Protection Team during the 2008 financial crisis, struck some former officials as curious given that its duties have mostly been taken over by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. That body, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, held a public meeting last week when it also published its annual report, which had little mention of market concerns.\u201cNow that the administration has chosen this extremely rare policy approach of verbal intervention in the stock market its credibility is at risk should markets settle lower,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.Former Treasury officials said Mr. Mnuchin had probably amplified concerns about the markets by publicizing his efforts to calm them.\u201cI never heard anyone in any venue in the last two months voice any concerns about liquidity,\u201d said Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, noting that Mr. Mnuchin had injected more uncertainty into the calculations of investors.Mr. O\u2019Neill also suggested that Mr. Mnuchin was in a difficult position in trying to assuage a mercurial boss and could be overcompensating to please him.\u201cThe president apparently is blaming Mnuchin for the markets going south, which is a fairly strange thing,\u201d he said.Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy secretary of the Treasury under President Barack Obama and a former Fed governor, said Mr. Mnuchin would be better served keeping conversations about financial stability private.\u201cWhen you do something like that you\u2019ve got to be really careful and quiet about it,\u201d Ms. Raskin said. \u201cYou run the risk of planting the seeds of doubt in people\u2019s minds.\u201dBut, Ms. Raskin suggested, Mr. Mnuchin could have been trying to show the president, who canceled his own Florida vacation, that he was working hard despite traveling with his children to a resort in Mexico.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just worried because he\u2019s in Cabo, the markets are going down and the Treasury secretary is in another country and they don\u2019t like the optics of that,\u201d she said.Emily Flitter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Expect a Much Less Aggressive Fed in 2019", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhether the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate Wednesday or not may be less important to investors than what it says about the path of rates next year.In the futures market that investors use to bet on the Fed\u2019s decisions, traders are indicating the central bank will raise rates by a quarter point to between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent when the Fed wraps up its two-day meeting on Wednesday.But after that, investors expect to wait awhile for the next increase \u2014 and that\u2019s a view that has changed fast.The odds that there will be just one rate increase in the next year now stand at nearly 60 percent, up from 9 percent just over a month ago. And the chances that it raises rates twice or less by the end of 2019 have risen to 89 percent, up from 41 percent in early November.And odds of three or more rises next year? Those have fallen to just over 2 percent.The data highlights the shifting outlook for interest rates in the markets over the past months and stands in contrast to the forecasts of most Fed officials at the central bank\u2019s September meeting. Projections from that meeting showed a majority of Fed officials expected the central bank to raise rates three or more times in 2019.But much has changed since that meeting. Stocks across Wall Street have tumbled more than 10 percent; oil prices have sunk more than 30 percent; inflation has become more muted; and some of the world\u2019s largest economies, including China, Germany and Japan, have shown signs of weakness.Fed officials also have appeared to soften their tone on the future of rate rises.The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, helped set off the early October sell-off when he said the Fed\u2019s main policy rate was \u201ca long way\u201d from neutral, or the rate at which the Fed would no longer be tapping the brakes or pressing the gas. The comment worried investors, who took it to mean that the Fed still had longer to go on its tightening path than expected.Traders do not just expect fewer rate rises next year. They also forecast the pace the Fed takes rates higher will slow. A month ago, odds that the central bank would raise rates twice by the end of its June meeting were nearly 60 percent. Currently, they are 31 percent.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Let\u2019s take a moment to pity the Internal Revenue Service. Yes, to many Americans, it\u2019s a money-grabbing ogre siphoning hard-earned cash to the faceless federal bureaucracy.Loopholes are beyond the means of most Americans who earn salaries or are paid hourly wages, and are exploited by those who derive significant income from investments or business revenue. Although we\u2019d all like to pay less, relative to most developed nations our tax burden is a pretty good deal.These uncollected billions could pay for any number of things: better care of wounded veterans, infrastructure improvements such as a desperately needed new tunnel between New York and New Jersey. You could even build an expensive wall.The Trump/G.O.P. tax policy is now operating at peak failure. The tax cuts have failed to increase gross domestic product beyond the \u201csugar high\u201d stimulus they gave to an economy already heading toward record low unemployment. The economy seems to be slowing, making a mockery of the promise of strong growth that was used to peddle the tax cuts. To pay for the millionaire tax cuts, sacrifices had to be made. So Congress limited deductions for state and local taxes to $10,000 annually. While that generally applies to well-to-do people who can itemize their tax returns, it was also a clear shot against blue states such as California and New York that have relatively high state and local taxes. But reducing these deductions, along with higher interest rates, punished the housing market, which is stagnant nationally and in a free fall in the Northeast.Our ability to keep the $1 trillion deficit created by the Trump tax cuts from deepening depends in part on collecting taxes to which the government is legally entitled. Think of it this way: To protect our nation, we have the most powerful army in the world. To protect our tax base, we have an army on the order of Liechtenstein\u2019s.

{"Headline": "Stocks Rise as Wall St.\u2019s Roller Coaster Stages Late-Day Rally", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street\u2019s roller-coaster ride extended into Thursday with stocks staging a late-day recovery as investors turned their attention to fresh data about the United States economy.Investors have struggled to find their bearings this month as the S&P 500 hurtled toward bear-market territory, defined as a 20 percent drop from a recent high point. They are trying to assess the prospects for economic growth and corporate profits as interest rates rise and a trade war with China persists, while \u2014 most recently \u2014 also factoring in internal White House turmoil and President Trump\u2019s antipathy toward Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman. A government shutdown that could deprive investors of economic data from the Commerce Department is only adding to the uncertainty.It\u2019s all coming together in a volatile mix, with financial markets lurching this way and that. After a drop of as much as 2.8 percent, the S&P 500 rallied in the final minutes of trading to end up 0.9 percent. The gains added to a surge Wednesday that was the benchmark\u2019s best day since 2009.The swings are an indication that the recent declines have gone too far, even if there are reasons to be concerned, said David Donabedian, the chief investment officer for CIBC Private Wealth Management in Atlanta.\u201cIn the absence of more bad news, a snapback was necessary,\u201d he said.The exuberance was not shared in Asia, where monthly production data from Japan offered investors a reminder that the region\u2019s growth is slowing. Stocks in Japan opened 0.8 percent lower, while shares in China and Hong Kong opened only modestly higher.In the United States, investors had only a few new clues about the economy\u2019s health to consider on Thursday, and the signals were mixed. Weekly jobless claims were lower, a positive sign. Expectations for job growth, as measured by the monthly consumer confidence index, hit a five-month low, however. In China, officials said industrial profits had declined in November for the first time in three years, a reminder that the growth of the world\u2019s second-largest economy continues to slow.Because of the partial shutdown of the federal government, a report on new home sales in the United States was delayed.Trading volume during holiday weeks is usually lower than the rest of the year, and that means each trade can have an outsize effect on stock prices. But huge swings were taking place well before the holiday slowdown.Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices who tracks and catalogs market performance, said stocks\u2019 swings had been larger and more frequent this year than at any other time since 2011. On 15 days in 2018, the value of the S&P 500 changed more than 3 percent. Such a large change did not occur on a single day in 2017, and happened on only five days in 2016. In 2011, when ratings agencies downgraded United States government debt, roiling the stock market, the days on which the S&P lost or gained 3 percent numbered 24.\u201cIt\u2019s higher today than it has been for the last several years, and you can feel it,\u201d Mr. Silverblatt said of the market\u2019s volatility.Adding to the recent jitters are concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s response to the drop in stock prices. Last week, Mr. Trump used Twitter to vent his frustration over the Fed\u2019s decision to keep raising interest rates and sought guidance from aides about whether he could fire Mr. Powell. Despite the president\u2019s frustrations, a number of White House officials have tried to reassure investors that Mr. Powell\u2019s job is safe.This suggested to investors that the Fed might not be willing to change its plans to further raise rates and drain money from the financial system, even if market turmoil persisted. Other Fed officials quickly moved to assuage those worries after the Dec. 19 announcement, but Mr. Donabedian said he expected anxiety about the Fed\u2019s flexibility to persist until at least the end of the next meeting of the Fed board on Jan. 30.Ultimately, he said, deep worries about the future, rather than more superficial factors like low trading volume, were behind the market tumult lately.\u201cThere are a lot of people searching for something else, some technical factor,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think this is driven by rising uncertainty about the fundamentals: earnings, the economy and interest rates.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson and Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Japan\u2019s closely watched Nikkei 225 stock index fell 5 percent on Tuesday and entered bear market territory, meaning it has fallen 20 percent from its high. Shares in China fell by a much smaller amount in thin trading around the region, thanks to holiday-related market closures around the world.\u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on with the administration and all those data points in conjunction with a market that\u2019s already so negative, it\u2019s just pushing everything down,\u201d said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis.The idea that the Treasury secretary was calling banks to ensure the financial system was functioning properly, Mr. Gibbs said, \u201cjust added to the negative feeling and gave investors another excuse to sell.Stock trading ended earlier than usual on Monday, at 1 p.m., and markets were set to be closed Tuesday for the Christmas holiday.On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq entered bear-market territory. It is now down almost 25 percent from its August high after falling 2.2 percent more on Monday.Energy stocks were among the day\u2019s worst performers, with crude oil futures in the United States falling below $45 a barrel.The meltdown in the markets could hurt the broader economy if it begins to limit spending by companies and consumers or lending by banks.Borrowing in the corporate bond markets has already slowed as nervous investors demand higher interest rates on risky debt. The plunge in stocks could discourage investments, acquisitions or other types of corporate spending by executives unwilling to gamble on uncertainty.But there has been no evidence so far that the financial system is not functioning properly, corporate profits continue to grow at a rapid clip and the economy has remained robust.\u201cWhile stocks, in my opinion, have gone in the past couple of months from very richly valued to merely the high end of fair value, they\u2019re not cheap by any measure \u2014 much less insanely cheap like they were a decade ago,\u201d Whitney Tilson, founder of the investment fund Kase Capital Management, said in a note to investors.Markets ended lower in Europe following a mixed day in Asia.Alexandra Stevenson and Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He maintained that the two presidents made concrete agreements, though he did not detail what those entailed.The United States and China have announced only vague commitments and started a 90-day clock to try and reach a trade deal, but Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited specific agreements from China that Beijing has yet to confirm.That includes more purchases of American farm products, which Mr. Trump \u2014 seemingly trying to remind Mr. Xi \u2014 has said will begin \u201cimmediately.\u201d\u201cPresident Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a post on Twitter. \u201cBut if not remember, I am a Tariff Man.\u201dThe White House has already faced criticism this week for a lack of detail and mixed messages about what the leaders agreed to at their dinner. The Trump administration and Beijing have essentially reached an agreement to pause the trade war for 90 days while the two sides try and reach a formal trade deal. But any such pact is not a guarantee, given deep divisions that remain between the countries, including the administration\u2019s insistence that China end its practice of pressuring American companies to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets.On Monday, the White House said that Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative who is a longtime China skeptic, would lead the talks with Beijing. The choice of Mr. Lighthizer, who has a reputation as a tough negotiator, conveyed a tough road ahead.The days since the agreement have also been marked by confusion over the timetable to reach a deal. The White House said on Monday that the two sides had until March 1 to reach an agreement but Mr. Trump suggested in one of his tweets that the deadline could be extended.The lack of clarity has not pleased investors, who were briefly relieved after initial reports of a trade truce. Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, including those in the industrial sector, which is widely exposed to risks related to the trade fight between Washington and Beijing. Shares in Boeing and Caterpillar, companies with significant sales in China, tumbled.Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team continued to temper optimism about a deal on Tuesday.Mr. Mnuchin said that China had agreed to buy $1.2 trillion of American products, but he could not offer specifics on what would be bought and when.\u201cThey have said that these are targets and that that is their expectation,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told the Fox Business Network. \u201cAnd that in the short term there would be some very specific commitments.\u201dMr. Kudlow was careful to downplay suggestions that the Trump administration was really seeking a full overhaul of America\u2019s trade relationship with China through the talks.That includes China\u2019s requirement that American companies hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there.\u201cChina needs to change their joint venture system. That\u2019s nearly the root of all evil,\u201d he said.China has a reputation for making big promises on trade and not fulfilling them. Some trade experts have suggested that China could be using the new 90-day window to stall additional tariffs as officials work to stimulate their slowing economy.Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary, said on CNBC that it was too soon to say that a deal was done.\u201cWe shall see how serious the Chinese actually are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell how serious they are.\u201dChina has so far offered little about the meeting beyond its official statement outlining what would be discussed in the coming months. That list differed from the official statement released by the White House, with the Trump administration saying China had agreed to negotiate on issues like intellectual property and the Chinese statement mum on that topic.\u201cThey claim they\u2019ve never done any of these things,\u201d he said \u201cThey can hardly agree to negotiations about them.\u201dAt a press briefing on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, Geng Shuan, did not address questions about what American officials have said was agreed to by both sides.\u201cThe two sides reached consensus and agreed to stop levying additional tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe working teams from the two countries will follow the consensus reached by the two heads of state to step up consultations in the direction of lifting all additional tariffs, strive to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and endeavor to bring the China-U.S. economic and trade relations back to the normal track as soon as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What\u2019s going on in Washington?Senators and White House officials were scrambling to cut a deal to avert a partial government shutdown as a midnight deadline approached.Last week, President Trump proudly took ownership of a shutdown, saying that any spending bill must include $5 billion for a wall on the southern border._____2. Fallout continues after a national security shake-up.President Trump is dealing with the aftermath of the resignation of Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, who delivered a stinging rebuke of Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview in his resignation letter.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both of which also include the biggest tech companies, are not far behind.Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy.

But lower courts blocked the initiative, ruling that federal law plainly allowed applications from people who had entered the country unlawfully.The president lashed out at the first ruling and the judge who made it, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. The administration then urged the Supreme Court to stay the ruling. But Chief Justice Roberts joined the four-member liberal wing of the court in turning down the administration\u2019s request._____President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, above, has championed a new law to cut the highest government salaries and raise the lowest ones.

{"Headline": "Why the Ivy League Clings to a Strategy of Diminishing Returns", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWith $136 billion in assets and enviable access to exclusive investment opportunities, Ivy League universities have long boasted that their endowments earn higher returns than other investors.Not anymore.The simulated portfolio is conservative, made up of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, and it achieved an annualized return of 8.1 percent. Not one Ivy League school beat that performance, although Princeton came the closest at 8.03 percent, edging out Columbia (7.98 percent). Far behind were Cornell, with an annualized return of just 4.8 percent, and Harvard, in last place at 4.5 percent.A slightly more aggressive mix of 70 percent stocks and 30 percent bonds surpassed the Ivies\u2019 results by an even greater margin.That the Ivy League universities, with access to some of the best minds and investors with the best track records, would fall short of a simple, low-cost approach over a decade is startling. For individuals considering following their approach, the message should be clear: Don\u2019t.\u201cAnyone trying to emulate the Ivies should be very cautious and skeptical,\u201d said Jeff Schwartz, Markov\u2019s president.You\u2019d think the lackluster returns would lead the Ivy League schools \u2014 as well as other large institutional investors \u2014 to question this approach. On the contrary, though, investors, mostly large institutions, in 2017 poured a record $754 billion into the kind of high-cost assets that form the core of the Ivy endowments, according to the research firm Preqin.All of the Ivies (as well as other schools with huge endowments) have wholeheartedly embraced what has become known as the Yale model, which calls for heavy allocations to these so-called alternative investments. That class includes private equity, venture capital and hedge funds, as well as real estate and natural resources.Andrew Golden manages Princeton\u2019s $24 billion endowment. He trained alongside David Swensen, the inventor of the Yale model, and remains a firm believer, at least for big-endowment schools like Princeton. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend it for my mother,\u201d he said in a recent interview.If anyone has bragging rights, it would be Mr. Golden: At 14.2 percent, Princeton had the highest returns in the Ivy League in the most recent fiscal year. Princeton led the pack in the last decade and placed second, at 11.4 percent annual returns, over the last 20 years.\u201cWe had a good year, but that\u2019s no reason to beat my chest,\u201d he said. The strong returns represent decisions made over the course of many years, and \u201cit\u2019s just a year \u2014 the dice could have come up differently.\u201d\u201cFocusing on the calendar just leads to short-termism,\u201d Mr. Golden said.Princeton aims for a 10 percent annualized return, which is close to the long-term return for the S&P 500, not adjusted for inflation. To get that result, Princeton\u2019s endowment is heavily weighted toward equities, albeit in the context of alternative strategies. It has just 5 percent in fixed income and cash. Such an equity-heavy allocation means assuming higher risk, Mr. Golden acknowledged, which he believes is appropriate for Princeton\u2019s overall strong fiscal position.No one will accuse Mr. Golden of short-termism. Even the 10-year period is too short to measure meaningful results, he said, at least for an institution with an infinite time horizon. By that standard, a decade is a blip.Indeed, Princeton and the Ivy League as a whole remain far ahead of the performance of the 60/40 mix over the last 15- and 20-year periods. Mr. Golden noted that Princeton\u2019s endowment fared badly in 1998-99, toward the end of a bull market, only to weather the bursting of the tech bubble. The fund finished the 20-year span far ahead of a 60/40 blend.Even 20 years \u201cis just a round number,\u201d Mr. Golden said. He maintains that the only meaningful comparison comes over a full market cycle, which can either be market peak to market peak, or trough to trough, something that can take decades to become apparent. (It still isn\u2019t clear whether the bull market that began in 2009 has peaked.)That helps explain why so many institutions have been reluctant to pare back their expensive investments in hedge funds and venture capital \u2014 high returns that beat the 60/40 mix could be just over the horizon.Of course, extremely long measurement periods are convenient for underperforming asset managers, who can always argue that it\u2019s too soon to brand them a failure.All the Ivy League endowment managers \u201cwill say that, since their institutions are perpetual, they believe in this strategy for the very long term,\u201d said Christopher Philips, head of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services and a champion of Vanguard\u2019s low-fee index fund approach. \u201cI think some of them are actually hoping for a bear market to shake out the excess\u201d and lift their performances relative to boring, low-cost funds.Mr. Philips concedes that the Ivy League schools and other \u201cmega-endowments\u201d do have advantages, including access to an elite group of managers.But for nearly everyone else, following their approach is \u201ccompletely irrational, and because it\u2019s irrational there\u2019s no real impetus to stop until one of the big boys stops,\u201d he said. \u201cIf peers are doing it, they\u2019ll keep doing it, because it\u2019s better to fail with peers than to run the risk of failing in isolation. This is human behavior 101.\u201dWhen will a reckoning come? Check back in another decade. By then, many of the current managers of university endowments will have settled into very comfortable retirements.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Have Nowhere to Hide as Stocks, Bonds and Commodities All Tumble", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks? Messy. Bonds? Meh. Commodities? Not pretty.Most years, financial markets are a mixed bag. A bad year for risky investments, like stocks, might be a great one for safe bets like government bonds. Or, if worries about inflation are hurting bond investments, commodities like gold tend to do well.Not this year.If this persists, or grows worse, it could create a damaging feedback loop, with doubts about the economy hurting the markets, and trouble in the markets undermining growth.Pessimism emanating from the stock market could leave consumers and businesses scared to spend. The rout in junk bonds makes it more expensive for financially fragile businesses to borrow. The collapse in crude oil prices discourages new investment and hiring in the oil patch, which has been a source of job growth.In that sense, the markets are both a gauge of what investors expect to happen in the economy, and a potential catalyst for their decisions. The mood in the financial markets ultimately feeds into spending by companies and consumers, and if they pull back, based on panicky ups and downs, growth could suffer.\u201cPeople look to the financial markets as a source of information, as a signal, about what\u2019s going to happen and what\u2019s going to come,\u201d said Itay Goldstein, finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd when they see markets going down, they start thinking pessimistically about the outlook for the real economy.\u201dThere\u2019s scant evidence that the worst-case scenario will play out. The American economy remains strong: Unemployment is near 50-year lows, and growth is steady. And it wasn\u2019t that long ago that financial markets were feeling good about the global economy, shrugging off troublesome issues like the trade war, Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and the debt levels of developing nations.On Sept. 20, stock investors in the United States were sitting on a nearly 10 percent gain for the year. Benchmark American crude oil prices were up more than 20 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 15 percent.But those profits are gone.Since October, an index of commodities that includes oil and copper has swung from gains of 20 percent to losses for the year. A similar move took place in risky corporate bonds. So far this year, after another steep drop on Friday, the S&P 500-stock index is down about 2.8 percent.\u201cIn a typical year there\u2019s going to be some winners and losers,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at the equity market research firm Ned Davis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you get nothing working.\u201dHis firm recently looked at eight types of investments going back to 1972. In every year, at least one of these categories generated a return of 5 percent or more. A separate study by JPMorgan Chase analysts found that \u201c2018 has delivered losses on almost every asset class and investing style.\u201dThe widespread market jitters have accompanied a tectonic shift in the investing world, as central banks have begun to withdraw the extraordinary support provided to the global economy in response to the financial crisis a decade ago.For nearly seven years, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero and bought trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of government bonds, which pushed interest rates \u2014 that move in the opposite direction of prices \u2014 sharply lower. Money in the bank earned next to nothing, so investors eagerly bought anything they expected to generate some kind of return: risky debt, real estate, stocks, technology start-ups.The Fed\u2019s support, bolstered by similar efforts from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, proved to be a huge tailwind for global financial markets. Everything seemingly moved up in tandem.\u201cWhat was once a tailwind is now a headwind for markets,\u201d said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pimco, a bond investment firm with $1.7 trillion under management, in Newport Beach, Calif.At least on the margins, the turmoil in the financial markets is already reverberating in the real economy.For instance, as Treasury bond prices have declined this year, interest rates \u2014 which move in the opposite direction \u2014 have risen.In recent weeks, the broad investment declines have worsened while anxiety grows over the trade war between the United States and China. This fight, between the world\u2019s two largest economies, may already be dragging on global growth.The experience of 2015 could be a useful road map for investors. That year was uncomfortable as the Federal Reserve planned to raise interest rates against a backdrop of soft global growth. Stocks, corporate bonds and commodities all fell, while Treasury bonds eked out a minuscule gain.In the midst of the market turmoil, the Federal Reserve slowed down the pace of its interest rate increases. And the pause from the central bank reinvigorated risk-taking among investors, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5 percent the next year, and the economy continuing to grow.That\u2019s all to say, investors can be quick to jump to conclusions. But they can also be wrong.\u201cThey\u2019re like people reading a book,\u201d said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at the asset manager Fidelity Investments in Boston. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to skip five chapters to see how the book ends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhood, Moola, McConnell and Trumpism", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe motivations behind policy, from tariffs to the wall.Opinion ColumnistSo what\u2019s it about? Nancy Pelosi, almost sure to be the next speaker of the House, reportedly told colleagues that for Trump, the wall is a \u201cmanhood thing.\u201d That sounds right. But that got me thinking. What other policies are driven by Trump\u2019s insecurity? What\u2019s driving this administration\u2019s policy in general?By McConnell I mean the standard G.O.P. agenda, which basically serves the interests of big donors, both wealthy individuals and corporations. This agenda consists, above all, of tax cuts for the donor class, with cuts in social programs to make up for some of the lost revenue. It also includes deregulation, especially for polluters but also for financial institutions and dubious players like for-profit colleges.Trump\u2019s foreign policy has, however, made a break, not just with previous Republican practice, but with everything America used to stand for. Previous presidents may have made realpolitik accommodations with unsavory regimes, but we\u2019ve never seen anything like Trump\u2019s obvious preference for brutal despots over democratic allies, his willingness to make excuses for whatever people like Vladimir Putin or Mohammed bin Salman do, up to and including murder.Some of this may reflect personal values: Putin, bin Salman and other strongmen are just Trump\u2019s kind of people. But it\u2019s hard to escape the suspicion that Moola \u2014 financial payoffs to Trump personally via the Trump Organization \u2014 plays an important role. After all, unlike leaders of democracies, dictators and absolute monarchs can direct lots of cash to Trump properties and offer the Trump family investment opportunities without having to explain their actions to pesky elected representatives.But I\u2019d argue that Trump\u2019s desire to assert his manhood is playing a big role in other areas, too, most notably trade policy.So major affairs of state are being decided not by the national interest, nor even by the interests of major groups within the nation, but by the financial interests and/or ego of the man in the White House. Is America amazing, or what?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Wants the Fed to \u2018Feel the Market.\u2019 That\u2019s Pretty Good Advice, Actually.", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the ability to feel it accurately, in a time of mixed signals like the current moment, is not so simple.Usually, older businessmen who are unhappy about what the Federal Reserve is doing grumble to their golfing buddies, or maybe appear as guests on CNBC. The president prefers Twitter.But in his latest complaints about monetary policy, President Trump actually made a somewhat profound observation about one of the eternal dilemmas of central banking.Fed policymakers are meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, and are likely to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point \u2014 the fourth such rate rise this year and the eighth since the central bank began raising rates three years ago. At the same time, the Fed is shrinking the portfolio of bonds it acquired through its quantitative easing programs that concluded in 2014, to the tune of $50 billion a month. This measure, sometimes called quantitative tightening, reduces the supply of money in the economy.I hope the people over at the Fed will read today\u2019s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, don\u2019t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B\u2019s. Feel the market, don\u2019t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!It really is the case that the turbulence in financial markets in the last couple of months is driven by fears that the Fed has moved too far, too fast to tighten the money supply.That is evident in the sectors that are taking it on the chin \u2014 especially heavily indebted industrial companies, and the interest-rate-sensitive housing and automobile sectors.And it has been evident in the flattening of the yield curve. When longer-term bonds are yielding only slightly more than shorter-term bonds, as now, it implies that markets expect the Fed will need to curtail rate increases sooner than Fed officials themselves have been signaling.But the most memorable part of the president\u2019s tweet \u2014 and one that actually is a pretty good guideline for all central bankers \u2014 was, \u201cFeel the market, don\u2019t just go by meaningless numbers.\u201dIt is the ability to do this effectively that separates the successful central bankers from the failures. The great challenge is to separate signal from noise, to successfully differentiate when markets are sending useful information about the economic future and when they just represent erratic, random movement.Back in the summer and fall of 2007, for example, global credit markets were becoming strained, bond yields fell and stock prices began gyrating wildly. What would eventually be known as the Great Recession began in December of that year.In both those cases, the Fed was wise to adjust its policy in response to what markets were doing (and with hindsight did so too slowly and reluctantly). But the flip side is that sometimes markets move for reasons that don\u2019t really tell us anything about the economy.There\u2019s an old joke that the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. In the last decade, that has been more like nine of the last zero recessions.Remember the great sell-off of late January and early February 2018? It resulted in a drop of about 9 percent in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index \u2014 yet 2018 has turned out to be the strongest year of economic growth in a long time, even as the Fed maintained a steady course of gradual rate increases.When the Fed has too itchy a trigger finger in trying to protect the economy against market gyrations, it can have negative consequences. In 1998, the Fed cut interest rates amid crises in emerging market nations. The economy roared ahead in 1999, fueling a dot-com bubble that would subsequently pop with damaging consequences.As the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, and his colleagues gather around the big table to make their decision, it really does boil down to whether this is just a market disruption that needs to be allowed to run its course, or the early stages of something that will damage the ability of ordinary Americans to earn a good living.What makes the decision tricky is that the recent bout of market volatility has offered conflicting signals.The drop in stocks since early October has, at least in its recent phases, been accompanied by falling bond yields, which tend to be more closely tied to economic ups and downs than the stock market is.Also accompanying falling stocks are a drop in the prices for oil and other commodities. This can both reflect soft global growth and cause further economic weakness in energy- and agriculture-focused parts of the nation\u2019s economy, as happened in 2015-2016.In the Fed\u2019s decision Wednesday \u2014 both on whether to raise interest rates as expected and what to signal about 2019 plans \u2014 Mr. Powell will essentially be forced to judge which of these sets of signals to believe.In other words, he needs to feel the market, and not just go by meaningless numbers. The problem is that some numbers are very meaningful indeed, and making the right decision depends on knowing which is which.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government to Shut Down: House and Senate Adjourn With No Spending Deal", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 The Senate and House have adjourned without reaching a deal. The government will partly shut down after funding expires at midnight.\u2022 Hours before a midnight deadline, White House officials and senators unsuccessfully scrambled to cut a deal to avert a partial government shutdown.\u2022 President Trump, unwilling to drop his demands for funding for a border wall, sought to blame Democrats for a crisis that he had previously said he would proudly own.The Senate adjourned around 8:10 p.m. without a spending deal, ensuring that for the third time this year, parts of the government would shut down.Just over an hour before, the House announced it had adjourned. Both chambers are expected to reconvene on Saturday at noon.Vice President Mike Pence and Jared Kushner, the President\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, were among those who had been huddling in negotiations across the Capitol.Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that before bringing a bill to the floor, there would need to be assurances that the president would support it.\u201cWe\u2019ve made some serious overtures,\u201d Mr. Shelby said, emerging from a meeting that included Mr. Pence and Mr. Kushner. \u201cWe\u2019re not done.\u201d\u2022 Nine departments will close: The Treasury as well as the departments of Agriculture, Homeland Security, Interior, State, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Commerce and Justice.\u2022 More than 420,000 people will work without pay, including nearly 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents and 42,000 Coast Guard employees. As travelers flood the nation\u2019s airports and train stations, 53,000 T.S.A. agents will keep working, as will air traffic controllers and aviation and railroad safety inspectors.\u2022 Another 380,000 workers will be furloughed.\u2022 The status of National Parks will be up in the air. Park staff would be furloughed, although the parks themselves would remain accessible. However, some parks, including the Grand Canyon, are planning to stay open.\u2022 Visa and passport services will continue \u201cas long as there are sufficient fees to support operations,\u201d a department spokesman said, but passport agencies located in government buildings affected by a lapse in appropriations may become \u201cunavailable to the public.\u201d\u2014 Catie Edmondson\u201cNow it\u2019s up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight,\u201d Mr. Trump said Friday morning at the White House, moments after meeting with Senate Republicans who have repeatedly told him that there were not enough votes to sustain his position.\u201cI hope we don\u2019t, but we are totally prepared for a very long shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our only chance that we will ever have, in our opinion.\u201dIt was a striking reversal from his televised declaration during a combative meeting with congressional Democrats a week ago that he relished the prospect of shuttering the government to force them to accept a wall, and would not blame them for the outcome.\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld DavisMr. Trump privately groused about having to cancel departure plans for his 16-day trip to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. On Friday, Melania Trump, the first lady had already made plans to leave town with the couple\u2019s son Barron, according to her spokeswoman.Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, both senior advisers who had also planned to leave for Mar-a-Lago, were preparing to stay with Mr. Trump in Washington, an administration official said.\u2014 Katie RogersA procedural vote to advance a House-approved stopgap spending bill started around 12:30 p.m. Friday. After hours of keeping the vote open \u2014 some senators had to travel back to Washington and some Republicans initially voted against it \u2014 the Senate approved the move.Mr. Pence cast the tiebreaking vote.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said that the ongoing spending talks \u201cwere a good sign.\u201d\u201cI see progress in that all sides are now talking, and that is what necessary to get a compromise that will either prevent this ill-conceived shutdown or make it as brief and less harmful as possible,\u201d she said.\u2014 Emily CochraneIn a burst of late-afternoon activity after a day of confusion and inertia in the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence rushed to the Capitol to meet with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, searching for a plan to break an impasse that Mr. Trump has shown little interest in defusing.\u201cI\u2019m feeling better now than I did an hour ago because that meeting is occurring,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, adding that he was \u201cso happy\u201d about the session, which also included Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director and incoming chief of staff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. \u201cThe fact that that\u2019s happening represents progress.\u201dStill, the Senate floor was a picture of dysfunction and paralysis as leaders struggled for hours without success to win agreement to begin debating stopgap spending legislation passed Thursday night by the House that would keep the government running through Feb. 8 and provide $5.7 billion to begin construction of the border wall, Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise.\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld DavisThough investors learned to deal with past government shutdowns \u2014 in January stocks rose the week before the government shutdown \u2014 and they\u2019ve disregarded upheaval in the White House for most of the Trump administration, the markets are in a fragile state right now.There was already a lot weighing on the market on Thursday \u2014 trade, economic growth, interest rates \u2014 but stocks took a notable turn later on when it became clear Mr. Trump would not agree to sign a spending bill without funding for a border wall.Those losses continued on Friday as Mr. Trump promised a shutdown that will last a \u201cvery long time.\u201d Put it together with disappointment over the Federal Reserves plans to keep raising interest rates, and the market had one of its worst weeks in many years with the S & P 500 down more than 7 percent.\u2014 Mohammed HadiMcALLEN, Tex. \u2014 Border Patrol agents are prepared to work without getting paid if the government shuts down Friday night, and agents are committed to conducting business as usual no matter what happens, but morale is sinking across the agency.\u201cIt\u2019s nerve-racking,\u201d said Art Del Cueto, Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council, the estimated 18,000-member labor union for the Border Patrol. \u201cIt sucks, to be honest.\u201dMr. Del Cueto is an agent in the Border Patrol\u2019s so-called Tucson Sector in Arizona. He said the shutdown has dominated conversations among agents.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely on our minds because you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve spent money on Christmas,\u2019 and now you\u2019re saying, \u2018I bought this already, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Del Cueto said. \u201cIt\u2019s the fear of the unknown.\u201dAlso, previously approved time off will no longer be valid if and when the shutdown is in effect, he said.While Mr. Del Cueto said agents are deeply concerned about the shutdown, he and some others do want money to build a border wall.\u201cI want that budget for the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about how I want to beat Nancy and Chuck or I want President Trump to get his way. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with securing our borders.\u201dMr. Del Cueto continued: \u201cI have skin in the game. I\u2019m not getting paid and I\u2019m defending our borders.\u201d\u2014 Mitchell FermanAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Leader Says Party Must Control \u2018All Tasks,\u2019 and Asian Markets Slump", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Facing deepening tensions abroad and anxieties at home, China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, delivered an unabashed defense of his policies on Tuesday, using a key anniversary to argue that his recipe of guided growth under strong Communist Party control must not waver.Mr. Xi made his case to some 3,000 officials and guests gathered in the imposing Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commemorate 40 years since China embarked on far-reaching economic changes after decades of upheaval and malaise under Mao Zedong.\u201cIt was precisely because we\u2019ve adhered to the centralized and united leadership of the party that we were able to achieve this great historic transition,\u201d Mr. Xi said.Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, lasting nearly one and half hours, came at a pivotal, potentially fraught moment in the country, when all the contradictions in its governance appeared in stark relief. Mr. Xi\u2019s political power is as great as that of any leader in decades, yet his party\u2019s tightening of controls over the economy and ever more aspects of society suggest a deep-seated insecurity at the highest levels.Mr. Xi said that a country of China\u2019s size and influence was right to hold \u201clofty aspirations.\u201d\u201cChina will never develop itself by sacrificing the interests of other countries,\u201d Mr. Xi said, but he added that China also would not \u201cabandon its own legitimate rights and interests.\u201dThroughout his speech, Mr. Xi performed similar rhetorical swerves, promising both greater openness and assertiveness, both strong state companies and prospering private businesses.Mr. Xi\u2019s speech risked leaving Chinese officials no clearer about his policy agenda at a time when relations with the United States in particular have deteriorated badly.\u201cWhen everything is a priority, nothing is a priority,\u201d Yuen Yuen Ang, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, who studies China, said by email after watching the speech. \u201cToday, many policy goals in China are in tension with one another. Which ones take precedence? This is what officials will need to know to carry out their work on a practical level.\u201dBut Mr. Xi\u2019s speech on Tuesday was likely to dampen hopes of a breakthrough, said Ryan L. Hass, a former director for China at the National Security Council who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Hass said his Chinese contacts had \u201cdescribed the speech as the place where Xi would send a signal to Trump on his own terms about the market openings and other reforms on the horizon.\u201d\u201cIf those messages were embedded in the speech,\u201d he added, \u201cthey appear to have been well concealed.\u201dMr. Xi warned that the future contained \u201call kinds of risks and challenges,\u201d but he said repeatedly that the party had expertly guided the country thus far and must continue to do so. He emphasized twice that the party had been \u201ccompletely correct\u201d in its embrace of economic overhauls, a remark that brushed over the many internal debates, as well as ups and downs, that accompanied those changes.Mr. Xi called for revitalizing Marxist-Leninist doctrine, a reflection of the party\u2019s fears that it could lose its grip over a younger, increasingly wired and well-traveled generation. \u201cLet contemporary Chinese Marxism shine even more brilliant rays of truth,\u201d he said.According to Julian B. Gewirtz, a scholar at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard, who watched the speech while visiting Beijing, \u201cThis was a speech about the party more than anything else.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether Mr. Xi\u2019s remarks will reassure Chinese private companies, as he has tried in recent weeks to do. Business leaders and economists have complained about meddlesome officials, heavy and capricious tax burdens, restrictions on investment and banks that prefer to channel loans to big state companies that enjoy the patronage of party leaders. They have welcomed Mr. Xi\u2019s promises, but also warned that the economy remains troubled by risks.\u201cOf all the anniversaries related to the reforms \u2014 20 years, 25 years, 35 years \u2014 this 40th anniversary is perhaps the least optimistic I have seen,\u201d said Ding Xueliang, a professor emeritus at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who has long studied China\u2019s reforms.\u201cPeople in very senior positions also have no clear idea of the direction,\u201d he added. \u201cNot a single person in the past half year who I talked with in China, not a single person, said he or she is clear about the next stage.\u201dAdding to the anxiety were signs that the government was tightening the release of local economic data amid a sharp slowdown. Last month, the southern province of Guangdong stopped releasing the results of a monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2014 a survey that takes the temperature of China\u2019s important factory sector \u2014 citing a notice from the National Bureau of Statistics. The bureau said on Tuesday that the province had violated regulations on statistics gathering.In his speech, Mr. Xi repeatedly touted the huge advances China has made since \u201creform and opening\u201d began in 1978, rattling off detailed statistics on personal incomes, education and life expectancy. Gone are the days when food and clothing were rationed, he said.\u201cHunger, food shortages and poverty, which plagued the Chinese people for thousands of years, have been generally left behind,\u201d he said.Mr. Xi has repeatedly promised to ensure that China offers businesses and foreign investors an open, fair market, but many have become skeptical that he will follow through. Instead, many say, Mr. Xi\u2019s drive to extend party control, stifle public debate and defend the state sector have stymied economic liberalization.The occasion of the speech on Tuesday was the anniversary of a party meeting in 1978, when Deng and other veteran leaders who had fallen during Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution began to reassert their power and lay out ideas for restoring the economy after decades of strife.The meeting now features in the party\u2019s heavily mythologized history of that time as a watershed, although it was only years afterward that \u201creform and opening up\u201d became an official party formula.Before Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, Chinese economists who favor market reforms had openly voiced frustration with what they said was the slow, muddled pace of change. They appear likely to be disappointed, and even worried.\u201cWe\u2019re sincerely hoping that this big meeting will be able to sound a clarion call for deepening reform,\u201d Xiang Songzuo, a senior economist at Renmin University in Beijing, said at a forum in Shanghai over the weekend.He cited an estimate from researchers at an unidentified official institute who concluded that China\u2019s real rate of economic growth this year could be just 1.67 percent, or even lower. That projection is at the very low end of economists\u2019 estimates, but Chinese growth is widely believed to be lower than official estimates, which forecast an expansion of 6.5 percent this year.If there was no strongly reformist call from leaders, Professor Xiang said, \u201cMy final conclusion will be that China\u2019s economy is headed for a plight that will last for a considerable time and be very, very difficult.\u201d He did not respond to emails or messages after Mr. Xi\u2019s speech.Albee Zhang contributed research from Beijing, and Ailin Tang from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Which Will Win Out in 2019?", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoves like Mnuchin\u2019s phone calls to bank C.E.O.s could create a broader crisis of confidence.Sometime in the last couple of months, predictions of a major economic downturn or recession in 2019 went from being a crank view to the conventional wisdom.The real risk is not that insurmountable challenges knock the economy off course. It is that poor leadership converts moderate economic shocks into a crisis.It was the kind of disclosure that risked causing more damage than it was intended to prevent. If a top health official announced that he had convened conversations with top pharmaceutical C.E.O.s and was pleased to learn there were no drug shortages, your first response would not be relief but to ask, \u201cWait, we need to worry about drug shortages?\u201dIt all raises the possibility that if things do get worse, the United States government will be an agent of chaos rather than the source of steadiness and calm it is normally known for during crises.It is a lack of confidence in global leadership that explains this paradox: an economy that is doing this well and yet widespread conviction that things are about to turn bad.The most concrete warning signal is coming from financial markets. But the bond market is generally more closely tethered to economic ups and downs than the stock market, and while it is suggesting slower growth ahead, it is not at recessionary levels.At this point in December 2007, which we now know was the beginning of the Great Recession, the Fed\u2019s target interest rate was 4.25 percent. But the bond market was already pricing in more cuts in the years ahead, with the two-year yield ending the year at 3.12 percent.Most economic and financial indicators are not pointing toward some economic collapse in 2019, but rather to a return to the kind of moderate economic growth that was completely normal from 2010 to 2017.In this story, 2018 has been the aberration \u2014 fueled by a commodity boom and the temporary effects of tax cuts. To the degree there is a market correction and adjustment in business sentiment, it is about realizing that we\u2019re returning to the old new normal.There are some rumblings of things that could go wrong in the financial system. Companies that loaded up during the era of ultralow interest rates are facing high debt burdens. Some may find themselves in bankruptcy. Oil prices have fallen enough that it seems it will be a tough 2019 in energy-producing areas. But the biggest worry for 2019 is not so much that any of these disruptions proves so large as to cause a recession. The real fear is that shaky policy allows small shocks to create a broader crisis of confidence.Beyond the attacks on the Fed and odd communication from the Treasury, there are other risks from Washington. Further escalation of the trade war \u2014 including into the economically consequential automobile industry \u2014 remains a distinct possibility. Divided government could lead to paralysis.It is quite a contrast with the 2008 crisis, when the United States government was stocked with highly experienced economic policymakers and a president who trusted their judgment, when no one had heard of Brexit, and when a trade war seemed unfathomable.It was a key moment in ending the 2008 crisis. Given geopolitical developments since, it is hard to imagine that harmony happening today. It\u2019s easier to imagine conflicting signals and an every-nation-for-itself breakdown of communication.But we\u2019re not there yet. And throughout the expansion of the last nine-plus years, the United States economy has proved stubbornly resilient to challenges, whether the chaos of the eurozone crisis in 2010 or a commodity collapse in 2015.The question is which will prove more important, the economic fundamentals or leadership. And to be an economic optimist means counting on the fundamentals to prevail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ghost of Trump Chaos Future", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySorry, investors, but there is no sanity clause.Opinion ColumnistTwo years ago, after the shock of Donald Trump\u2019s election, financial markets briefly freaked out, then quickly recovered. In effect, they decided that while Trump was manifestly unqualified for the job, temperamentally and intellectually, it wouldn\u2019t matter. He might talk the populist talk, but he\u2019d walk the plutocratic walk. He might be erratic and uninformed, but wiser heads would keep him from doing anything too stupid.In other words, investors convinced themselves that they had a deal: Trump might sound off, but he wouldn\u2019t really get to make policy. And, hey, taxes on corporations and the wealthy would go down.But now, just in time for Christmas, people are realizing that there was no such deal \u2014 or at any rate, that there wasn\u2019t a sanity clause. (Sorry, couldn\u2019t help myself.) Put an unstable, ignorant, belligerent man in the Oval Office, and he will eventually do crazy things.But market behavior has, until recently, been a different story.But let\u2019s play devil\u2019s advocate here: Does all this Trump chaos matter for the economy, or for the stock market (which isn\u2019t at all the same thing)? At first sight, it\u2019s not all that obvious.And even trade war might not do that much harm, as long as it\u2019s focused mainly on China, which is only one piece of U.S. trade. The really big economic risk was that Trump might break up Nafta, the North American trade agreement: U.S. manufacturing is so deeply integrated with production in Canada and Mexico that this would have been highly disruptive. But he settled for changing the agreement\u2019s name while leaving its structure basically intact, and the remaining risks don\u2019t seem that large.The truth is that most of the time, presidential actions don\u2019t matter much for the economy; short-term economic management is mainly up to the Fed. But when bad things happen, we do need the White House to step up. In 2008 and 2009, it mattered a lot that officials of both the outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration responded competently and intelligently to the financial crisis.Unfortunately, there\u2019s no reason to expect a comparable degree of competence if something goes wrong again.Now imagine how this administration team might cope with a real economic setback, whatever its source. Would Trump look for solutions or refuse to accept responsibility and focus mainly on blaming other people? Would his Treasury secretary and chief economic advisers coolly analyze the problem and formulate a course of action, or would they respond with a combination of sycophancy to the boss and denials that anything was wrong? What do you think?Advertisement"}

The rout in junk bonds makes it more expensive for financially fragile businesses to borrow. The collapse in crude oil prices discourages new investment and hiring in the oil patch, which has been a source of job growth.In that sense, the markets are both a gauge of what investors expect to happen in the economy, and a potential catalyst for their decisions. The mood in the financial markets ultimately feeds into spending by companies and consumers, and if they pull back, based on panicky ups and downs, growth could suffer.Amazon may be rushing to set up huge offices in New York, but Google seems to think that slow and steady is the best approach.\u2022 \u201cAccusations of hidden pay and lavish spending on the company dime were intertwined with a deep sense of discontent over Mr. Ghosn\u2019s long reign over the automaker.\u201d\u2022 \u201cNissan employees had groused that Nissan profits were propping up Renault, and many feared Mr. Ghosn was preparing a Renault takeover of its bigger Japanese partner.\u201d\u2022 \u201cFor months, a group of Nissan executives secretly gathered information on Mr. Ghosn, laying the groundwork for a Nov. 19 strike against the executive and a top aide, Greg Kelly.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe maneuvering allowed Japanese prosecutors to swiftly arrest both men, then raid company offices and his Tokyo apartment in the space of hours, say people familiar with the events.\u201dCentral banks already do stress tests of big financial institutions, to measure the lenders\u2019 ability to withstand major financial crises.

{"Headline": "Stocks Tumble After Fed Signals More Rate Rises in 2019", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt wasn\u2019t what stock market bulls were hoping for.Stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, citing the strength of the economy, signaled that it planned to keep raising interest rates and shrinking the extraordinary amount of support it has provided to financial markets in the decade since the financial crisis.The S&P 500 stock index finished 1.5 percent lower, bringing its losses for the month so far to 9.2 percent. The benchmark had been higher ahead of the Fed\u2019s 2 p.m. announcement about interest rates and a news conference that followed.The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate another quarter percentage point.That increase had been widely predicted. But in the financial markets, hopes had been high that the Fed would simultaneously signal its growing concern about the outlook for economic growth.Such an outlook is known as \u201cdovish\u201d in financial market jargon. And there had been broad consensus among stock market analysts that the Fed would announce a \u201cdovish hike\u201d \u2014 that is, an increase paired with language that indicated it would slow the pace of tightening substantially \u2014 on Wednesday.They were disappointed.\u201cThere was no give,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cYou were looking for a dovish hike. And it turned out to be just a hike.\u201dThe Fed did acknowledge growing expectations that the world economy could be slowing. Chairman Jerome H. Powell emphasized that the bank would tailor its policy in response to economic data.But generally, the central bank highlighted the ongoing strength of the American economy, a reason not to ease off interest rate increases too fast. Unemployment is near 50-year lows, growth in 2018 has been the fastest in years, and even as stock markets have sold off sharply, incoming numbers show little indication that the economy is turning sour.\u201cThe Fed message to the markets is, take a breath,\u201d said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. \u201cThe Fed did its job today.\u201dThe market did not make a decisive move lower until Mr. Powell\u2019s post-decision news conference. Close observers of the stock market noted that losses in the S&P 500 accelerated after Mr. Powell answered a reporter\u2019s question about the whether Fed had discussed changing its efforts to shrink the large stockpile of safe government bonds it is holding on its balance sheet.\u201cI think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cI don\u2019t see us changing that.\u201dIn the years after the financial crisis, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet ballooned as the central bank engaged in multiple rounds of so-called quantitative easing. The policy, in which the Fed effectively created new money and used it to purchase Treasury bonds in an effort to push longer-term interest rates lower, was also credited with helping to push a broad range of other asset prices \u2014 including stocks, corporate bonds and commodities \u2014 up sharply as well.Now, the Fed is shrinking its holdings of bonds on the balance sheet by around $50 billion a month, in a process that some call quantitative tightening. And those efforts have been getting more attention lately, since they were highlighted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed from a former Fed official, Kevin Warsh, and the financier Stanley Druckenmiller earlier this week. President Trump appeared to be referring to the balance sheet reduction when, in a Twitter message earlier this week, he urged the Fed to \u201cStop with the 50 B\u2019s.\u201dIncreasingly, some see the phenomenon as playing a role in the unusually broad headwinds financial markets have faced this year. For the first time in decades, almost every broad asset class has declined or posted minuscule gains this year. And after the sell-off on Wednesday, the S&P 500 is now down 6.2 percent for the year.\u201cIf interest rates are going to be normalized higher, that means stock prices need to be normalized lower,\u201d said Matt Maley, equity strategist with institutional brokerage firm Miller Tabak in Boston. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s been going on.\u201dOf course, this year\u2019s losses have to be put in perspective. Since the market bottomed in March 2009, the S&P is up 270 percent.\u201cThe plan for the Fed has been, as the economy heals and approaches something that looks more like a healthy state, they should gradually back away from their support of financial markets and kind of let them fend for themselves,\u201d said Julia Coronado, a former Federal Reserve economist and president of the economic consulting firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cThey have to sort of stand on their own now.\u201dStanley Reed and Kevin Granville contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Sometimes Musk would terminate people; other times he would simply intimidate them. One manager had a name for these outbursts \u2014 Elon\u2019s rage firings \u2014 and had forbidden subordinates from walking too close to Musk\u2019s desk at the Gigafactory out of concern that a chance encounter, an unexpected question answered incorrectly, might endanger a career.When sexual comments by the star of the prime-time CBS drama \u201cBull,\u201d Michael Weatherly, made the actress Eliza Dushku uncomfortable, she confronted him.

{"Headline": "Obamacare Ruling Hits Health Care Stocks", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShares of Molina Healthcare, which specializes in providing care to low-income people under Medicaid and is a mainstay of the individual insurance markets created by the law, fell almost 9 percent on Monday. The stock of Centene, which had expanded aggressively into the state marketplaces, dropped nearly 5 percent.Other health insurers \u2014 Anthem, UnitedHealth and Cigna \u2014 were down at least 2.6 percent.An end to the health law, commonly called Obamacare, could also ding the bottom lines of hospitals, which could treat fewer patients and face more unpaid bills. Shares of HCA, the nation\u2019s largest profit-making hospital chain, were down nearly 3 percent. Two hospital operators were particularly hard-hit. Community Health Systems shares slid almost 14 percent, and stock in Tenet Healthcare was down nearly 7 percent.The judge who ruled on the legality of the Affordable Care Act did not issue an injunction to stop federal officials from enforcing the law, so it was not immediately nullified and existing coverage has not been affected. Democrats promised to appeal the decision, which seems destined for the Supreme Court.Still, the ruling added uncertainty to the health care sector, parts of which have done very well under the law. Since the law\u2019s passage in 2010, shares of health insurers had soared, easily outperforming the broader market. Anthem, UnitedHealth, Cigna, Centene and Molina were all up between 300 percent and 750 percent in that time. By comparison, the S&P 500 has gained about 100 percent over that period.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Warns China That He\u2019s \u2018Tariff Man,\u2019 Spooking Stock Investors", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe trade war is back on \u2014 at least as far as investors are concerned.The fear is that a lasting trade war will undermine the global growth at a time when some of the world\u2019s largest economies are already slowing down, and the United States, a standout performer, is also expected to slow. The global and domestic worries are undercutting the prospects for manufacturers, technology companies, regional banks and airlines, intensifying the sell-off in stocks. The S&P 500 lost more than 3 percent on Tuesday, after rallying the day before on the hope of a deal with China.\u201cThey actually want to see a positive resolution where this problem is solved so they don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist at the brokerage firm William O\u2019Neil & Company.The losses looked more measured in Asia in morning trading on Wednesday, as shares in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai fell, but by half as much or less.Since the Trump administration started to impose tariffs on imports from China, the United States economy has been largely insulated from the trade war. The economy is on pace for its best year since 2005, unemployment is near 50-year lows, and corporate profits are surging.But investors are now grappling with the potential for a protracted conflict, as the president signaled the negotiations could be more contentious than expected. Deep divisions remain between the two countries, including the administration\u2019s insistence that China end its practice of pressuring American companies to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets.Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed on Saturday not to impose any additional tariffs for 90 days while the two sides work toward a formal agreement. Raising optimism about the deal, Mr. Trump repeatedly cited specific agreements from China, including more purchases of American farm products.The deal faced almost immediate doubt. Beijing never confirmed those details, while the White House sent mixed messages about what agreements the leaders had made. Then on Monday, the White House said that Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative and a longtime China skeptic, would lead the talks with Beijing. The choice of Mr. Lighthizer, who has a reputation as a tough negotiator, signaled a tough road ahead.By Tuesday, the optimism had completely faded as Mr. Trump once again called out China for its trade practices. In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, he pushed the Chinese to buy American agricultural products \u201cimmediately,\u201d and questioned whether a \u201creal deal\u201d with Beijing is actually possible. \u201cWhen people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so,\u201d he wrote.The mood of the market worsened throughout the day, with companies most exposed to the costs of the trade fight bearing the brunt of the pain. Shares of Boeing and Caterpillar \u2014 large exporters with significant sales in China \u2014 fell sharply, 4.9 percent for Boeing and 6.9 percent for Caterpillar.Chip companies, which depend on extensive networks of factories and subcontractors in Asia, also slumped. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped nearly 5 percent. Advanced Micro Devices shares plummeted nearly 11 percent, making it the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index.Despite the threat of an escalation in the trade war, China expressed confidence in the trade talks on Wednesday. Both sides would continue to put their trade commitments into effect, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a brief statement on its website. But trade wasn\u2019t the only issue on Tuesday. The Russell 2000 index of small companies \u2014 which typically depend far less on foreign sales \u2014 fell 4.4 percent, while regional banks, automakers, airlines and home-building shares all dropped.The bond market also flashed warning signs. The gap between the interest rates on short- and long-term United States government bonds fell sharply on Tuesday, and by some measures hit its lowest point since before the financial crisis. Many analysts say long-term rates could soon fall below short-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inversion of the yield curve.\u201cThe inversion has always preceded the recession so you can\u2019t just pooh-pooh it,\u201d said Vinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Office.Automobile makers, already buffeted by rising steel costs because of the trade war, now face plateauing sales at home. General Motors last week said it would idle five factories in North America and cut roughly 14,000 jobs in a bid to trim costs. On Tuesday, the low-cost retailer Dollar General said that the next phase of tariffs in the trade war between the United States and China \u201ccould have a more significant impact on our business and on our customer\u2019s budgets.\u201d Its shares fell 6.8 percent.The home builder Toll Brothers, facing sluggish sales in the face of rising mortgage rates, reported that orders for new homes fell for the first time since 2014, helping to set off a decline in home-building stocks. \u201cInvestors are worried about the economy,\u201d Mr. Watts said. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly what this is showing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is when those in control of the stock can dump their shares and leave those gullible enough to invest in the hope of getting in on the ground floor of the next big thing with losses.Cryptocurrencies are subject to many of the same issues as penny stocks. Most of the trading takes place on unregulated platforms overseas. While many call themselves \u201cexchanges,\u201d they provide virtually none of the protections afforded to investors in stocks and bonds. With no clear records of who is trading, manipulating the price may not be very difficult for sophisticated participants looking to pump up the price.By the end of the month, the S.E.C. had also settled charges with the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and the music producer Khaled Khaled, known as DJ Khaled, for their promotion of digital tokens issued by a start-up called Centra Tech. The men did not disclose that they received payments for making online postings that hyped the digital coin, the regulators said. Mr. Mayweather agreed to give back the $300,000 he received, pay an additional $300,000 penalty and adhere to a three-year ban on promoting other investments. Mr. Khaled will pay back the $50,000 he got, as well as a $100,000 penalty.For the naysayers of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, this is the anticipated end of a speculative bubble, much like the tulip mania in 17th-century Holland or the dot.com implosion. That does not necessarily mean that this type of investment will disappear, but greater government scrutiny will raise the costs for trading platforms and could effectively eliminate initial coin offerings if they must be registered with the S.E.C.Just like penny stocks, digital tokens have seen their fair share of scam artists and questionable uses. As the government puts more resources into policing the trading of digital assets, the decline in cryptocurrency prices may well accelerate as those who fear being a target of fraudulent conduct wait for a time when there are greater protections for investors. The question is: Will cryptocurriences survive for long enough for us to ever see that day?Advertisement"}

The comment was apparently a reference to remarks of Beijing being \u201cconfident\u201d a comprehensive deal can be reached before a tariff freeze expires in 90 days.\u2022 \u201cMr. Trump and his advisers have been touting the trade truce reached in Buenos Aires as a victory, saying that China had agreed to buy $1.2 trillion worth of American products.\u201d\u2022 \u201cBut trade experts and industry insiders remain perplexed, anxiously awaiting information about the timing and composition of the $1.2 trillion, a number that dwarfs the $130 billion in goods that the United States exported to China last year.\u201d\u2022 \u201cIf China doubled the amount of goods it bought from the United States starting next year, it would take nearly a decade to reach the $1.2 trillion goal.\u201dThere\u2019s a huge business opportunity in climate change. Exploiting it is the hard part.\u201cWorries don\u2019t translate into solutions unless businesses devise products that emit dramatically less planet-warming greenhouse gases. The innovation is the easy part; getting people to buy it is the hard part. That requires incentives, which depend heavily on governments. Without their intervention, solar and wind power, and electric and hybrid cars would have no foothold against their fossil fuel competitors.\u201dBut he also notes that many government interventions aren\u2019t sufficiently informed by long-term thinking. Tom Linebarger, the chief executive of the engine maker Cummins, tells Mr. Ip that there\u2019s an obvious path forward. \u201cIf we want rules that are more effective, decide the end result we want and let technology compete for the best solution,\u201d he said. \u201cCarbon taxes are much better than all the other choices.\u201dThe U.S. markets were closed yesterday in honor of former President George Bush.

But unemployment has dropped in many of the largest economies too, including the U.S., Britain, Germany and Japan.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!
