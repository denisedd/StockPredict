{"Headline": "Is Screen Time Bad for Kids\u2019 Brains?", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA study featured on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is sure to alarm parents. Here\u2019s what scientists know, and don\u2019t know, about the link between screens, behavior, and development.A generation ago, parents worried about the effects of TV; before that, it was radio. Now, the concern is \u201cscreen time,\u201d a catchall term for the amount of time that children, especially preteens and teenagers, spend interacting with TVs, computers, smartphones, digital pads, and video games. This age group draws particular attention because screen immersion rises sharply during adolescence, and because brain development accelerates then, too, as neural networks are pruned and consolidated in the transition to adulthood.Yes, but so does every other activity that children engage in: sleep, homework, playing soccer, arguing, growing up in poverty, reading, vaping behind the school. The adolescent brain continually changes, or \u201crewires\u201d itself, in response to daily experience, and that adaptation continues into the early to mid 20s.What scientists want to learn is whether screen time, at some threshold, causes any measurable differences in adolescent brain structure or function, and whether those differences are meaningful. Do they cause attention deficits, mood problems, or delays in reading or problem-solving ability?Even if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.Individual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings. To address such obstacles, scientists need huge numbers of research subjects and a far better understanding of the brain.Yes. The ongoing A.B.C.D. study expects to follow 11,800 children through adolescence, with annual magnetic resonance imaging, to see if changes in the brain are linked to behavior or health. The study began in 2013, recruiting 21 academic research centers, and initially focused on the effects of drug and alcohol use on the adolescent brain. Since then, the project has expanded, and now includes other targets such as the effects of brain injury, screen time, genetics, and an array of \u201cother environmental factors.\u201dBut the accuracy of self-reported screen time estimates is hard to ascertain. And the association between small differences in brain structure and how people actually behave is even more vague. As a result, researchers effectively are multiplying one uncertain relationship by another, and need to make statistical adjustments. Clear conclusions are extremely hard to come by, and complicated by the fact that a brain scan is no more than a snapshot in time: a year from now, some of the observed relationships could be reversed. The authors acknowledge as much. \u201cThis diversity of findings provides an important public health message, that screen media activity is not simply bad for the brain or bad for brain- related functioning,\u201d they concluded. It\u2019s probably both bad and good for the brain, depending on the individual and his or her viewing habits. Many people who are socially isolated, as a result of abuse, personal quirks or developmental differences such as Asperger\u2019s syndrome, establish social networks through their screens that would be impossible to find in person.Most parents are probably already aware of the biggest downside of screen time: the extent to which it can displace other childhood experiences, including sleep, climbing over fences, designing elaborate practical jokes and getting into trouble. Indeed, many parents \u2014 maybe most \u2014 watched hours of TV a day themselves as youngsters. Their experiences may be more similar to their children\u2019s than they know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With No Votes Scheduled, a Government Shutdown Will Greet the Democratic House", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican leaders gave up hope on Thursday of reopening the government before the new year, leaving the border wall impasse to House Democrats as they assume the majority next week \u2014 and presenting Representative Nancy Pelosi with her first major challenge as speaker.House Democrats, who take control on Wednesday, are weighing three approaches to getting funds flowing, none of which would include additional money for President Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the southwestern border. Whichever path they choose, party leaders said they would vote promptly on Jan. 3, hoping to project the image of Democrats as a steadying hand in Washington even as Republicans try to blame Ms. Pelosi and her party for the shutdown and lax border control.\u201cWe will vote swiftly to reopen government and show that Democrats will govern responsibly in stark contrast to this chaotic White House,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in a statement.Ms. Pelosi is determined to prevent the shutdown brinkmanship from interfering with the Democrats\u2019 assumption of power and her ceremony-soaked return to the speakership. But it appeared almost certain that the careful rollout of Democrats\u2019 legislative agenda \u2014 including a sweeping anticorruption and voting rights bill \u2014 would be at least partly eclipsed by the funding crisis.The shutdown has affected about a quarter of the government, left 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay, and on Thursday entered its sixth day.Mr. Trump and his allies showed no signs of letting up. Though the president said on national television that he would proudly shut down the government to secure wall funding, Republicans are no longer embracing the mounting crisis.\u201cThe only rational conclusion is that the Democrat Party is openly choosing to keep our government closed to protect illegal immigrants rather than the American people,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, wrote in a statement Thursday afternoon. \u201cThe president does not want the government to remain shut down, but he will not sign a proposal that does not first prioritize our county\u2019s safety and security.\u201dThe planning for next week\u2019s Democratic takeover was almost all that went on in a desolate Capitol on Thursday. The Senate reconvened for the first time since before Christmas, but with negotiations between the White House and Senate Democrats going nowhere, the session lasted four minutes.\u201cWe just have to get through this,\u201d said Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, who presided over the session. He added, \u201cIn Dodge City, Kansas, they say a horse divided against itself cannot stand. That\u2019s about where we are.\u201dThe House met just as briefly, and Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority whip, told lawmakers not to expect votes for the rest of the year. When Democrats sent Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts to the floor to try to force consideration of a stopgap funding bill that the Senate had already passed, Republicans would not recognize him.Back from a brief trip to visit troops overseas, Mr. Trump appeared to dig in on his demand that Congress approve $5 billion in additional funds as a down payment on the border wall. In a torrent of tweets and in the formal statement from the White House, he accused Democrats of favoring permissive immigration laws and border security, at one point suggesting that his wall may have prevented the killing of a police officer in California.Democrats have repeatedly said that they are more than willing to approve substantial funding increases for security at the southern border with Mexico. Many voted to do so in 2013 as part of a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration overhaul. But they view a wall like the one Mr. Trump advocates as an ineffective and inefficient response atop an immigration system in disrepair.House Democratic leaders plan to pass a stopgap measure to fund the government into February, another stopgap measure that would fund it through September, or the bipartisan, yearlong spending bills for everything but the Department of Homeland Security. That department, which handles the border, would be funded by a separate stopgap measure that maintains current financing levels and policies.A vote on any of the bills would probably take place next Thursday, after Ms. Pelosi is expected to be elected speaker and make her first speech to the House. Democrats still plan to make a wide-ranging anticorruption and voting rights bill their opening legislative priority. They will introduce the first bill of the Democratic House \u2014 which includes changes to campaign finance law, outlaws gerrymandering, and restores enforcement authority to the Voting Rights Act \u2014 on Wednesday, followed with a marquee unveiling ceremony on Friday on the steps of the Capitol.\u201cThe American people voted for divided government and made the decision that they no longer want a House of Representative that functions as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump administration,\u201d Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the soon-to-be No. 5 House Democrat, said in an interview. \u201cOn Jan. 3, House Democrats will get the opportunity to show the American people that we can be the adults in the room.\u201dBut Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and a close ally of Mr. Trump in the border fight, said Democrats would not be able to put the issue to rest quickly.\u201cThe president\u2019s made it very clear he will veto anything that doesn\u2019t have border security funding attached to it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it may be a good messaging bill, but it won\u2019t make for good legislation.\u201dCaught in the middle will be Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Mr. McConnell has all but removed himself from the conflict to this point. After the president torpedoed the Senate\u2019s temporary spending deal to avert the shutdown, Mr. McConnell said a solution would be up to the White House and Democrats to negotiate. He adjourned the Senate last Saturday and said it would return for votes only if there was a deal that could win 60 votes and a presidential signature.But Mr. McConnell could also choose to bring whatever House Democrats pass up for a vote, allowing it to publicly fail as a way to force Mr. Trump and Democrats to the negotiating table.The stakes of the government closing, which have thus far been muted by the holidays, will grow in the days to come.The Office of Personnel Management encouraged affected federal employees on Thursday to ask their landlords and other creditors if they would be able to pay just part of their bills for the duration of the shutdown. The office also advised employees to consult their \u201cpersonal attorney\u201d if they had further problems.The Smithsonian, which has been operating on reserve funds, announced it would have to close all museums, research centers and the National Zoo in Washington, beginning on Jan. 2 until the stalemate is resolved.(Because the funding for the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is not dependent on Congress\u2019s action, the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 has ground on.)An earlier version of this article misquoted Senator Pat Roberts discussing the partial government shutdown. Mr. Roberts\u2019s full quote was, \u201cIn Dodge City, Kansas, they say a horse divided against itself cannot stand,\u201d putting a Kansas twist on an aphorism made iconic by a former Senate candidate from Illinois.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mapping the Brain\u2019s Genetic Landscape", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past two decades, scientists have been exploring the genetics of schizophrenia, autism and other brain disorders, looking for a path toward causation. If the biological roots of such ailments could be identified, treatments might follow, or at least tests that could reveal a person\u2019s risk level. Now, using more advanced tools, brain scientists have begun to fill out the picture. In a series of 11 papers, published in Science and related journals, a consortium of researchers has produced the most richly detailed model of the brain\u2019s genetic landscape to date, one that incorporates not only genes but also gene regulators, cellular data and developmental information across the human life span.The work is a testament to how far brain biology has come, and how much further it has to go, toward producing anything of practical value to doctors or patients, experts said.\u201cThe effort that has gone into the collection and analysis of these data is truly impressive,\u201d said Kevin Mitchell, an associate professor of genetics and neurology at Trinity College, Dublin, who was not involved in the project. The data, he added, \u201crepresent a hugely valuable resource.\u201d Whether that resource will help scientists determine any biological cause, Dr. Mitchell cautioned, remains an open question. The new model was based in part on analyses of nearly 2,000 human brains, from people with and without diagnoses, collected over decades. In one of the papers, a research team led by Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University School of Medicine, began by combining all those genes, as a group, and calculating the combined added risk they impart into a single coefficient. That calculation on its own barely beats a random guess in assessing added risk.In another report, investigators delivered a clearer picture of brain development over the human lifetime. The brain is continually adapting, or \u201crewiring,\u201d itself through life, particularly in utero and through adolescence, generating an ever-transforming genetic, cellular and genetic landscape that had defied the tools of modern science.\u201cHaving this insight will help us establish some potential causes and what they mean for neuropsychiatric disorders, and create new, testable hypotheses,\u201d Dr. Sestan said.The result from all this work is a computer model for brain genomics that scientists can search \u2014 a database akin to Google Earth that charts specific genetic addresses in the brain and reveals which genetic and biological processes are active there, and at what point during maturation.Dr. Matthew State, chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author on two of the papers, said: \u201cEssentially what these papers do is lay out cellular and molecular landscape at a resolution that\u2019s never existed before. I see it as foundational work, and an investment that will pay off in giving us a far richer context to develop new hypotheses and study these disorders.\u201dFor the time being, those hypotheses are unformed. And, for all the coordination and dazzling science on display, there is a long way to go before any practical payoff arrives, some experts said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people whose cells were analyzed in a study. It was dozens of people of all ages, not exactly 1,866 people. Additionally it misstated the source of single cells examined for patters of gene expression. The people the cells came from did not have a particular disorder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cities Prepare to Face New Disasters", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "You can\u2019t fight nature in terms of the calamities that have hit their cities, but you can learn to accommodate it \u2014 or, at least, \u201cStay out of nature\u2019s way.\u201dSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 We rarely do much to protect our cities until disaster strikes. We fool ourselves into thinking we are safe, until a catastrophic event shows us how wrong we are.New York discovered that grim fact in Superstorm Sandy. Houston in Harvey. San Juan in Maria. And, of course, New Orleans after Katrina.Cities that have been through a disaster learn one important lesson: \u201cNature wins.\u201dThat succinct message was delivered by Edward M. Emmett, the county judge for Harris County, Tex., which includes Houston, at the Cities for Tomorrow conference hosted last week by The New York Times.The conference took place in New Orleans, which has experienced a remarkable recovery in the 13 years since Katrina. Despite 50 years of building hurricane protection around the city, its flawed flood walls and levees collapsed after the hurricane struck in 2005.Other cities are still learning the lessons of New Orleans, and climate change is making the need to learn more urgent \u2014 climate change stands out as one of the greatest challenges for cities around the world. The United Nations\u2019 most recent report on global climate laid out grim scenarios if the world\u2019s average temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), or even 1.5 degrees, above preindustrial levels.Urban \u201cheat island\u201d effects could amplify the problems and increase the likelihood of disease, bringing migrations of climate refugees and further straining infrastructure.At the conference in New Orleans, Judge Emmett took part in a panel with Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and LaToya Cantrell, the mayor of New Orleans. The leaders agree that you can\u2019t fight nature in terms of the disasters that have hit their homes, but you can learn to accommodate it \u2014 or, at least \u201cStay out of nature\u2019s way,\u201d as Judge Emmett says, and prevent building in areas that tend to flood.Ms. Cantrell stressed the importance of understanding the complexity of the problem. \u201cYou have to look at storm water management as a system,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pump your way out of it; it\u2019s not just pumps and power.\u201d Instead, preparing for disasters and recovering from weather challenges require many different strategies, including \u201cholding that rainwater, keeping the flow from going into the drains faster, raising your homes above the flood line.\u201dOf course, Ms. Cruz says, understanding the challenge doesn\u2019t make it easy to address. \u201cYou have to sort of fly the plane and fix it at the same time.\u201dWith heavy downpours increasing because of climate change, the authors write, expect things to get worse. And while some of the fixes involve big-ticket infrastructure projects, many are simple matters like clearing existing drains, said Gerald E. Galloway, an author of the report. \u201cIt turns out you can do a lot of good things without having to bankrupt the community.\u201dIn New York City after Sandy, things are moving forward on several levels, said Jainey K. Bavishi, director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Recovery and Resiliency. The city\u2019s $20 billion plan includes upgrading buildings, hardening critical infrastructure and strengthening flood resistance along the 520 miles of coastline.\u201cWe\u2019re focusing both on what we can do in the short term and investing in projects that can protect the city in the long term,\u201d she says. Those plans may include, eventually, an immense, and expensive, surge barrier for New York Harbor to protect the city from future storms like Sandy.That kind of protection does not come from the federal government alone; it is part of a partnership among local, regional and federal officials, local organizations, businesses and every citizen, says Don Riley, a retired major general and Corps of Engineers official now at the consulting firm Dawson & Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s a shared responsibility to reduce risk,\u201d he said. And part of that shared responsibility is admitting that infrastructure can do only so much.He recalled that, as the work proceeded to rebuild the fortifications around New Orleans, President George W. Bush once asked him, \u201cWill the people in New Orleans be safe?\u201dHis answer, as he recalled it, was \u201cThey should be a lot safer,\u201d but added that there is no such thing as complete safety, which is why the corps changed the language of the city\u2019s hurricane defense from Hurricane Protection System to the unwieldy but more honest Hurricane & Storm Damage Risk Reduction System.Planning for more resilient cities means planning for the needs of everyone. But those living in poverty, they note, often get left out of the process. The National Climate Assessment states, \u201cPeople who are already vulnerable, including lower-income and other marginalized communities, have lower capacity to prepare for and cope with extreme weather and climate-related events and are expected to experience greater impacts.\u201dAtyia Martin, a former chief resilience officer for Boston, said that these issues of equity, usually brought together under the rubric of climate justice, were often treated as an afterthought instead of an essential element of resilience planning. In a disaster, pain is widespread, Dr. Martin said, but \u201cthe people who are suffering the most in day-to-day life are also the people who are suffering most when there\u2019s a disaster.\u201dMembers of the panel in New Orleans said they had seen the problem close up. Ms. Cantrell, who has spent years in community activism, says the rules regarding recovery can work against those of limited means, because recovery money is often tied to the value of a damaged home before a storm.\u201cRegardless of where you live, Sheetrock costs the same,\u201d she says, and so the income disparities grow worse even in the process of rebuilding. She recommends \u201cgap financing\u201d to address the issues and to keep gentrification from driving people out of their neighborhoods.Ms. Cruz said disaster recovery meant engaging in a battle over gentrification, as well. People living in poverty can be displaced in a recovery as speculators buy inexpensive land hoping to make a score.The most important message of rebuilding, Ms. Cruz said, is \u201cmaking sure people understand that they can come back, that this is their home.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of coastline in New York City. It is 520 miles, not 120. Also, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified animals that were being herded through floodwaters west of Houston after Hurricane Harvey. They were cattle, not horses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s New President Isn\u2019t Even in Office Yet and He\u2019s Already Damaged Our Health Care", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur public health system is a jewel. Can it survive four years of recklessness?Ms. Barbara is an author and a contributing opinion writer based in Brazil.Through his remarks, Mr. Bolsonaro, who has not yet taken office, has managed to damage a program that has been praised by two independent bodies and by the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation for having \u201ccontributed to a lower infant mortality rate and a decrease in hospitalizations as a result of the availability of primary health care.\u201d He has no plan to patch things up. Indeed, this may be the first official demonstration of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s style of government: strong opinions, but no actual solutions. And when it comes to our health care system in particular, this style of governance is dangerous.In Brazil, health care has been a right for every citizen and a duty of the government since the adoption of the 1988 Constitution. Our Unified Health System, better known as S.U.S., or Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade, provides full medical care, free, for everyone. Universality and equity are the system\u2019s two basic principles.S.U.S. is impressive, though, of course, it\u2019s far from perfect: Hospitals and health centers are usually crowded, and ill-equipped to respond to the ever-increasing demands. There are often long waiting lines for exams, surgeries and appointments; patients have died in hospital corridors or while waiting to see a doctor. That\u2019s why 24 percent of Brazilians pay for private medical insurance, according to Brazil\u2019s regulatory agency for private health insurance. Others rely on low-cost clinics or pay extra for appointments and treatments.But it does matter that health care is considered a right, rather than a privilege. People persistently demand higher standards of care, because that\u2019s their constitutional prerogative. And though the quality of the services provided may be uneven, there have been many examples of great benefits obtained through public expenditure. Thirty years into the creation of S.U.S., we already have some excellent projects to showcase.Every month I walk half a mile to vaccinate my baby daughter; we are always promptly assisted by a nurse. The service is efficient, reliable and friendly. I myself have a duly filled, lifelong vaccination record to boast about.A friend of mine has familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a rare disease in which the liver produces abnormal proteins that accumulate throughout the body. It leads to serious sensory, motor and autonomic nervous system impairments, and can become fatal 10 years after the onset of symptoms. She lost her mother, grandmother and one uncle to the disease. But now it\u2019s different: When she started to feel ill five years ago, she joined the waiting list for a liver transplant. Months later, she underwent surgery in a state-of-the-art hospital and received a new organ. Everything was financed by S.U.S., including post-surgical treatment with immunosuppressants and follow-up appointments.Brazil\u2019s S.U.S. is also internationally renowned for starting a pioneering H.I.V. program that has provided free universal access to antiretroviral therapy for all patients since 1996. The project has drastically reduced AIDS-related mortality and morbidity, including mother-to-child transmission of the virus.What does Mr. Bolsonaro say to all this? He\u2019s been dismissive, not only of the efficiency but the quality of our health care system. His proposals for reforms have been contradictory. He claims there will be no increase in the public health budget, but then proposes costly innovations like implementing a national clinical data registry and creating a federally funded career path for doctors. He has also suggested that clinicians in the private sector could be incorporated into the public health service, a change that would require the use of subsidized reimbursements. This is not necessarily bad, but it would be costly \u2014 and most important, Mr. Bolsonaro doesn\u2019t seem to have a clue on how to accomplish any of it. But as his remarks about Cuban doctors show, that would hardly stop him from stumbling in and ripping apart what\u2019s currently working.It is clearly worth working to preserve S.U.S. We cannot lose what we have accomplished so far. If our president-elect is fine with losing the services of thousands of Cuban doctors, he needs to find a new way to deploy good medical professionals to the most underserved areas of our country. And if he doesn\u2019t have all the solutions for improving health care, at least he should make the commitment to maintain public spending while seeking to improve efficiency \u2014 in other words, to not make things worse.The foundations for great public health care in Brazil are already in place. It only takes political will to maintain and expand this remarkable system. Let\u2019s hope it can survive the next four years.Vanessa Barbara, a contributing opinion writer, is the editor of the literary website A Hortali\u00e7a and the author of two novels and two nonfiction books in Portuguese.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Inaugural Fund and Super PAC Said to Be Scrutinized for Illegal Foreign Donations", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors are examining whether foreigners illegally funneled donations to President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and a pro-Trump super PAC in hopes of buying influence over American policy, according to people familiar with the inquiry.The inquiry focuses on whether people from Middle Eastern nations \u2014 including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds. Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns, political action committees and inaugural funds.The line of questioning underscores the growing scope of criminal inquiries that pose a threat to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is focusing on whether anyone in the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to tip the 2016 presidential election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, while prosecutors in New York are pursuing evidence he secretly authorized illegal payments of hush money to silence accusations of extramarital affairs that threatened his campaign.The inquiry into potential foreign donations to the inaugural fund and the super PAC is yet another front being pursued by multiple teams of prosecutors. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a billionaire financier and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest friends, raised money for both funds.The super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, was formed in the summer of 2016 when Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was short of cash and out of favor with many major Republican donors. While Mr. Trump insisted that he could finance his own campaign, he refused to dig too deeply into his own pockets.According to several of the people familiar with the investigation, Paul Manafort, who then headed the campaign, suggested that Mr. Barrack step into the void by creating and raising funds for the political action committee, which could collect unlimited amounts of money as long as it avoided coordinating closely with the candidate.In an interview with investigators a year ago, Mr. Barrack said that Mr. Manafort seemed to view the political committee as an arm of the campaign, despite laws meant to prevent such coordination, according to a person familiar with the interview.Federal election law requires a cooling-off period of at least 120 days before campaign staff members join a political committee backing the same candidate, but Mr. Manafort dispatched two friends from the campaign, Laurance Gay and Ken McKay, to run the operation. A press officer said at the time that the committee violated no rules because the campaign never paid the two men. Neither man returned repeated phone calls seeking comment.According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the committee raised $23 million, making it one of the most important sources of funds for advertisements, polls and other political expenditures on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. Most money came from several big donors, including from Linda McMahon, a professional wrestling executive who donated $6 million and was later appointed by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration.Roger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.Prosecutors from New York and from Mr. Mueller\u2019s team have asked witnesses whether anyone from Qatar or other Middle Eastern countries also contributed money, perhaps using American intermediaries. Among other issues, they asked about a Mediterranean cruise that Mr. Barrack and Mr. Manafort took after Mr. Manafort was fired in August 2016 from the Trump campaign because of a scandal over his previous work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort was in serious financial trouble at the time, and Mr. Barrack, who has an extensive business network in the Persian Gulf, may have been attempting to help him find clients.On the cruise, the pair met one of the world\u2019s richest men, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar. Until 2013, Mr. Al Thani presided over the country\u2019s $230 billion sovereign wealth fund. He remains a highly influential member of the nation\u2019s governing royal family.Investigators also sought information from a businessman, Rashid Al Malik, an associate of Mr. Barrack\u2019s who heads a private investment firm in the United Arab Emirates, according to a person familiar with the inquiry. Mr. Malik, whose lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has been described as close to a key figure in the U.A.E.\u2019s government.After Mr. Trump was elected, any troubles he had finding donors appeared to have vanished. His inaugural fund raised $107 million \u2014 four times as much as the pro-Trump political action committee and twice as much as the amount raised for President Barack Obama\u2019s first inauguration. Mr. Barrack was its chairman, and Rick Gates, a longtime business associate of Mr. Manafort\u2019s who served as deputy campaign chairman, ran it.The inquiry into the inaugural fund appears to involve prosecutors from United States attorney\u2019s offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn, people familiar with the investigation said. The fund has long been a source of infighting among White House advisers and personal friends of Mr. Trump\u2019s, who blamed each other for news reports about questionable expenditures.The inaugural committee complied with all laws and \u201chas not been contacted by any prosecutors,\u201d said Mr. Blicksilver, who is also a spokesman for the fund. Its finances \u201cwere fully audited internally and independently,\u201d and donors were fully vetted and disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, as required, he said.In fact, though, the fund has already run into trouble related to both donations and expenditures. Mr. Gates, who is awaiting sentencing for crimes related to a financial fraud scheme he executed with Mr. Manafort, has testified that he may have submitted personal expenses for reimbursement from the fund. A later review of the inaugural expenses found no issue with his reimbursements, a person close to Mr. Gates said.Investigators have asked witnesses whether other foreigners also contributed illegally to the inaugural committee. Once Mr. Trump was elected, foreign governments were frantically trying to build connections to the incoming administration, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Although it hosts and heavily subsidizes an American military base, Qatar is constantly striving to counter the influence of its powerful neighbors, also allies of the United States.Reporting was contributed by Ben Protess and William K.

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Vanishing Mayor", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "Mayor Bill de Blasio spends far less time at City Hall than he once did, leading some city officials to ask: Has the mayor lost focus?Supported byThat, it turned out, was no easy ask: In two and a half years, the commissioner, Joseph Esposito, had not sat down for a one-on-one meeting with Mr. de Blasio, according to the mayor\u2019s public schedules. On Monday, the two finally met at Gracie Mansion to discuss Mr. Esposito\u2019s fate.The dispute over Mr. Esposito\u2019s status is another recent example of how Mr. de Blasio has maintained a diminished presence at City Hall, allowing his attention to stray more and more. And with a diminished focus at the top, there are signs, as with the Esposito episode where he delegated the task of firing the commissioner to a deputy mayor, that the practical mechanics of government are running less smoothly.Mr. de Blasio, in fact, rarely meets with many of his commissioners, according to the schedules, at times making it difficult for department heads to advance new ideas at City Hall, or to inform the mayor about problems at their agencies.The mayor\u2019s arm\u2019s-length relationship with agency chiefs is in keeping with a broader pattern: He has been making fewer and fewer appearances at the office.In 2014, Mr. de Blasio spent an average of 19 days a month at City Hall, a busy first year in office that included the creation of universal prekindergarten, the mayor\u2019s signature accomplishment.But each year, the mayor has shown up less and less. In 2015, he averaged 17 days a month at City Hall; in 2016 it fell to 14; last year, it dropped to nine. This year, through September, Mr. de Blasio averaged 10 days, according to his official schedules.In July, he was at City Hall for just five days. Above all, the mayor seems to like his getaway days; Mr. de Blasio was at City Hall just four of the first 39 Fridays this year, according to the schedules.In a telephone interview, Mr. de Blasio strongly defended his management style and focus, saying he had set ambitious goals early in his first term and has continued to deliver results on programs such as early childhood education, affordable housing and improving police-community relations.\u201cAnyone who watches what I\u2019m doing understands that every hour, every day, including weekends, I\u2019m focused on this work, which is why we\u2019re getting done what we are getting done,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.With just over three years left in his term, the mayor said he has a \u201chuge, ambitious agenda\u201d that he believed had his administration \u201cat a great level of intensity working to get it done. I certainly am.\u201dHe rebuffed criticism that he lacked a clear vision for his second term. \u201cThere is an animating vision, which is to be the fairest big city in America,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that people in the administration understand as a mandate.\u201dIn July, he created a political action committee, Fairness PAC, to support national Democratic candidates, and to pay for out-of-state political travel for himself and his wife, Chirlane McCray, such as their weekend trip to Vermont where the mayor appeared at an event sponsored by Bernie Sanders.While the mayor was away, Mr. Esposito\u2019s status remained uncertain. Finally, on Monday night, after the situation had been well publicized, the mayor\u2019s office released a statement saying that Mr. Esposito would stay on the job while the city searched for his replacement.\u201cPeople feel distracted by his interest in focusing on the other stuff, the political stuff,\u201d said one city official who spoke, like several others, on condition of anonymity in order to protect relationships in government. \u201cIt\u2019s distracting to those trying to get the work of government done.\u201dTo be sure, the mayor is busy. The schedules show about the same number of total entries each year \u2014 more than 2,000 scheduled activities annually, including meetings, phone calls, speeches, parades, policy announcements, news conferences and out-of-town travel. He often holds public events around the city. For a week in July, the month he barely set foot in City Hall, he traveled each day to Staten Island for a series of events called \u201cCity Hall in Your Borough.\u201dBut more often, the schedules show the mayor staying away from City Hall, where his senior aides work and where commissioners and department heads are frequently present.In the past 12 months, the mayor has not met with the commissioners of the departments of buildings, parks, city planning, youth and community development and the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, according to the schedules.He does meet regularly with the schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, and the police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, according to the schedules, which have been made publicly available through August. But even some agency heads with urgent portfolios have not met the mayor.Eric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, said that several of the agency heads who do not appear on the schedules, including Mr. Esposito, had attended briefings or other sessions with the mayor, but he did not provide details or explain why the meetings were not logged in the schedules.Mr. de Blasio has shifted many of his meetings to Gracie Mansion, which often requires a dozen or more high-level officials whose offices are in City Hall or elsewhere in Lower Manhattan to travel uptown. Aside from the unproductive use of their time to travel back and forth, the officials are also often kept waiting for the mayor, who regularly runs late.Such scheduling keeps Mr. de Blasio and his visitors behind the wrought-iron gate of Gracie Mansion, out of view from both the press and the public.\u201cI have found it\u2019s a very productive place to get work done,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in the interview. \u201cThere are fewer interruptions. There\u2019s more ability to focus on strategy and get the solutions. City Hall is a wonderful place, I\u2019ve spent a lot of my life there and I\u2019m there on a regular basis, but it is a place filled with a lot of interruptions and distractions.\u201dBut more than a dozen current and former city officials and civic leaders said in interviews that they were concerned about the mayor losing focus, and they noted that few new ideas or initiatives had been proposed in his second term \u2014 certainly nothing on the scale of universal prekindergarten.Last month, voters approved three ballot proposals backed by Mr. de Blasio to enact some of these reforms; the mayor said these results showed that the public understood and embraced his vision.Other administration officials also disputed that the pace had slowed at City Hall, pointing to the many programs that have continued from his first term, including one to build and preserve 300,000 units of affordable housing, the Vision Zero initiative to prevent traffic deaths and the creation, albeit delayed, of new homeless shelters.Officials said that the mayor had made a decision with this year\u2019s budget to continue spending on signature programs that he started in his first term, in particular early childhood education, rather than commit future spending to new, big-ticket items.His proposal, known as 3-K, to expand free schooling for 3-year-olds will require a large amount of financing as the number of children covered increases; the mayor did not want to put in place new programs that might take money away from that, especially given uncertainties about the economy and federal and state financing of the city budget.Still, the lack of big new ideas has been widely remarked upon by politicians and local leaders, and some, including the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, have filled the void.\u201cIn the era of term limits, you have to work at continuing to be relevant on the issues facing the city,\u201d said Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, noting that Mr. de Blasio cannot run for a third term. \u201cAs time goes on, people begin to look past your administration.\u201dMr. Stringer, who, like Mr. de Blasio, is a Democrat, said that the mayor has little time to articulate a vision if he wants to carry it out before he leaves office. By early next year, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to need to hear what the last leg of the journey is going to be about. He has to have a laser-beam focus and an agenda for us to get behind.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Michael Flynn Business Associates Indicted in Turkey Lobbying Case", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 Two former business associates of Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, have been indicted as part of a federal investigation into Turkey\u2019s secret 2016 lobbying campaign to pressure the United States to expel a rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Charges against the two former associates, Bijan Kian and Ekim Alptekin, were unsealed on Monday in an Alexandria, Va., courtroom. The two men were indicted last week as part of a conspiracy to violate federal lobbying rules, and Mr. Alptekin was also charged with making false statements to F.B.I. investigators.The indictment is further evidence of a broad crackdown on unregistered foreign lobbying growing from the inquiry by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who has investigated foreign flows of money from Ukraine, Turkey and other countries devised to manipulate decision-making in Washington. Mr. Mueller referred the Turkey case back to prosecutors in Northern Virginia.The indictment said that the two men sought to conceal that Turkey was directing the work, and that high-level Turkish officials approved the budget for the project and were given regular updates by Mr. Alptekin about the campaign\u2019s progress. Mr. Flynn\u2019s firm \u2014 Flynn Intel Group \u2014 received a total of $530,000 for its work.\u201cThe defendants sought to discredit and delegitimize the Turkish citizen in the eyes of politicians and the public,\u201d the indictment said.Mr. Flynn is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday in federal court in Washington on charges of lying to investigators about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the transition after the 2016 election.This month, Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors issued a sentencing memorandum saying that Mr. Flynn had provided \u201csubstantial help\u201d in several unspecified but continuing investigations. It is believed that the Turkey inquiry is one of these investigations because he had direct knowledge of different aspects of the case.Mr. Kian, dressed in a blue suit, stood silently in court on Monday as the charges were announced. He was released after the hearing, and his lawyer declined to comment. Prosecutors said that he faces up to 15 years in prison and Mr. Alptekin up to 35 years.Mr. Alptekin\u2019s current location is unknown. Through a spokeswoman, he denied the charges, claiming that he never lied to the F.B.I., and that Turkey did not participate in the project.The article called Mr. Gulen a \u201cradical Islamist\u201d and a \u201cshady Islamic mullah.\u201d The Justice Department began examining whether Mr. Flynn and his company were working as paid lobbyists for Turkey. Mr. Kian helped engineer the lobbying project, which involved trying to persuade members of Congress that Mr. Gulen ought to be extradited.Roger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kian also commissioned a lengthy dossier titled, \u201cFethullah Gulen: A Primer for Investigators,\u201d which was written by Thomas Neer, a former F.B.I. agent.Mr. Alptekin is a Turkish businessman close to Mr. Erdogan and helped finance the project. The indictment said that as part of the scheme, Mr. Alptekin used his company \u2014 a Dutch firm called Inovo BV \u2014 to conceal that Turkey\u2019s government was behind the payments.According to the indictment, Turkey\u2019s government asked the United States in July 2016 to arrest and extradite Mr. Gulen, whom Turkish officials have accused of trying to overthrow Mr. Erdogan in the military coup that month.The Justice Department rejected Turkey\u2019s request, the indictment said, because it had not met \u201cthe legal standards for extradition.\u201dThe secret lobbying effort appears to have begun shortly afterward. Prosecutors said that on July 29, 2016, Mr. Alptekin sent an email to Mr. Kian saying that he had met with a Turkish government minister who was interested in exploring a lobbying campaign against Mr. Gulen.They called the effort the \u201cTruth Campaign\u201d and later \u201cOperation Confidence.\u201dIn another email to Mr. Kian and Mr. Flynn, Mr. Alptekin said he had several meetings with a pair of Turkish ministers in Ankara. \u201cI have a green light to discuss confidentiality, budget, and the scope of the contract,\u201d the email said, according to the indictment.One month later, the three men met in New York with a pair of Turkish ministers to discuss the campaign against Mr. Gulen, the indictment said.Days before the 2016 election, Mr. Alptekin complained to Mr. Kian that the project had not \u201cpublicized enough negative information\u201d about Mr. Gulen. Six days later, Mr. Flynn published his op-ed article.In 2017, after the lobbying effort was exposed, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kian filed additional disclosures acknowledging that the Gulen project \u201ccould be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\u201d They detailed payments to other people and firms associated with the Gulen project.The F.B.I. accused Mr. Alptekin of lying to agents repeatedly during an interview on May 24, 2017. Prosecutors said Mr. Alptekin falsely said that Turkey had abandoned the project and that he had decided to retain Mr. Flynn\u2019s company himself.There has been a surge of criminal investigations into foreign lobbying, some of them initiated by Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators. The special counsel secured guilty pleas from Paul Manafort and Rick Gates \u2014 two former Trump campaign advisers \u2014 both on financial crimes and their lobbying activities on behalf of Ukraine. Sam Patten, another lobbyist, pleaded guilty this year to steering Ukranian funds to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has also referred three other Ukraine lobbying investigations to New York prosecutors.The cases involve Gregory B. Craig, who served as the White House counsel under President Barack Obama before leaving to work for the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Tony Podesta, an influential Washington lobbyist whose brother, John D. Podesta, was the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign; and former Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota, who joined the lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs after leaving Congress. None have been charged with any crimes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Growth Cools, Leaving Scars of \u201908 Unhealed", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo much for all that.Yet in declaring that \u201cthe global expansion has peaked,\u201d the brains at the O.E.C.D. effectively concluded that the current situation is as good as it gets before the next pause or downturn. If this is indeed the high-water mark of global prosperity, that is likely to come as a shock to the tens of millions of people who have yet to recover from the devastation of the Great Recession.Though the slowdown appears mild, it also holds the potential to intensify the widespread sense of grievance roiling many societies, contributing to the embrace of populists with autocratic impulses. In an age of lamentation over economic injustice, and with political movements on the march decrying immigrants as threats, weaker growth is likely to spur more conflict. Slower growth is not going to make anyone feel more secure about the prospect of robots replacing human hands, or jobs shifting to lower-wage lands.\u201cIt\u2019s just going to exacerbate the tensions that have led to the socioeconomic and political problems we have seen in the United States and parts of Europe,\u201d said Thomas A. Bernes, an economist at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian research institution. \u201cInequality is going to become even more pronounced.\u201dIn Greece, Spain and Italy, the youth unemployment rate is stuck above 30 percent. In Britain, the typical worker has not seen a pay raise in more than a decade, after accounting for inflation. South Africa\u2019s economy is smaller today than it was in 2010, and now the country is ensnared in recession.In the United States, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7 percent, its lowest level since 1969. Yet so many people have given up looking for work that less than two-thirds of the working age population was employed as of October, according to the Labor Department. That was a lower share than before the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cWe see a lost generation,\u201d said Swati Dhingra, an economist at the London School of Economics. \u201cThere was already wage stagnation and productivity stagnation. The trade war has exacerbated all of that.\u201dThe biggest risk to global growth appears to be that the trade war is, at least in part, working as designed.But it has thrown sand in the gears of China\u2019s industrial juggernaut. As of September, China\u2019s rail freight usage, bank lending and electrical consumption had increased about 9 percent compared with the previous year, down from a pace of more than 11 percent in January.China\u2019s growth was already slowing as its leaders seek to transition from an economy powered by prodigious exports, in enterprises that have spewed pollution, toward a cleaner future propelled by domestic consumption. But the American tariffs have prompted multinational companies to shift orders from Chinese factories to plants in other lands, from Vietnam to Mexico. Uncertainty over the future has postponed some business.\u201cThere\u2019s now potential for bad news on the trade front to trigger shifts in equity markets and a pullback on investment,\u201d said Steven J. Davis, an international business expert at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Given that China is the world\u2019s second largest economy, the consequences of its slowing ripple out widely, helping explain a pronounced drop in factory orders in Germany. American farmers have suffered lost sales as China has responded to tariffs by slapping duties on imports from the United States, not least on soybeans. Stock markets and oil prices have plunged in part on fears that China will buy fewer goods.In lifting interest rates, the American central bank has been acting under the accepted wisdom that too much easy money sloshing around for too long tends to produce trouble, from higher prices to financial mischief. Yet the effect of raising rates is to limit American economic growth, hence Mr. Trump\u2019s unhappiness.The European Central Bank has also been withdrawing the cheap money it unleashed to attack the crisis, phasing out purchases of bonds. This has made credit more expensive across the continent, depriving businesses of capital needed to finance expansions. And that has muted once-hopeful talk that Europe had finally transcended the torpor of the last decade.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like watching a heavily overweight bird try to take off,\u201d said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. \u201cIt staggers to the end of the runway and starts to take off but never really soars.\u201dThe same can be said for the global economy. It is clearly far removed from the terrifying days of the financial crisis. Yet it never really got its groove back enough to generate impressive numbers of jobs, or put meaningful pay increases in the pockets of ordinary people.And now, despite all that, leaner times are unfolding.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron\u2019s Proposal to Mollify Yellow Vest Protesters Fails to Impress", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The fine print of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s financial proposal, intended to end protests by France\u2019s middle class and working poor, was still sinking in Tuesday, but many of the protesters were expressing disappointment and calling for new demonstrations this weekend.The proposals showed that the president was prepared to move \u201cquickly and forcefully\u201d to respond to the anger of working people who cannot make ends meet, said \u00c9douard Philippe, the prime minister.But the intended beneficiaries of the changes said they were doubtful about how helpful they would be, and local elected officials said their constituents had mixed views of the president\u2019s plan and his tone.For the mayor of Plaisir, a town on the far outskirts of Paris, the proposal was a \u201cfirst step that resembles an immediate band aid, to try to stop this uncontrolled wave,\u201d said Jos\u00e9phine Kollmannsberger. She watched the speech Monday with 50 local shopkeepers.\u201cThere is real suffering in France, in the provinces there are deep difficulties,\u201d the mayor added, with citizens suffering from low incomes and villages and towns struggling to afford the services they offer.Although Mr. Macron\u2019s proposals were not insignificant \u2014 they will cost the French government about 10 billion euros, or about $11.3 billion, said Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister \u2014 they will not touch many of those who have been demonstrating, those who earn more than the minimum wage and so will not benefit from the increase.And among the lowest earners, many viewed Mr. Macron as deceptive in his description of how much he would help people taking home the minimum wage.\u201cHe made it sound like he was increasing the SMIC,\u201d said Joelle Santos, who works as a janitor in Paris, referring to the minimum wage by its French acronym.\u201cBut he\u2019s not really helping. He\u2019s a banker, he knows what he\u2019s doing. It is not part of the salary, it won\u2019t help when we retire,\u201d she said.Her disappointment comes from the fine print on the changes Mr. Macron announced in the minimum wage.Instead of raising the base wage, which would have raised costs for businesses, he accelerated already-planned increases in a government subsidy that low-wage earners can claim.But the subsidy does not count toward a worker\u2019s monthly salary figure and so is not part of the calculation for unemployment or retirement benefits. Nor are all low-wage earners automatically eligible for the subsidy.While the proposals may have failed to impress many, the news for the government was not all bad.\u201cThe support for the protesters was already going down because some people were upset by the economic consequences and frightened by the violence,\u201d said Brice Teinturier, the deputy director general of the Ipsos Institute, a polling firm.In polls taken before the president\u2019s announcement, the support for the Yellow Vests movement had dropped from between 70 and 80 percent to 60 percent, he said.Another poll, taken just after the president\u2019s announcement of the financial measures, suggested people were still sorting out their views. While more than half of those polled said they wanted the protests to stop, the same percentage of respondents said they also sympathized with the protesters.Mr. Teinturier said the amount of money Mr. Macron was going to dole out to low earners was enough to make a difference, but it did not address the demands for a more fair distribution of incomes between rich and poor.\u201cThe dimension of fiscal justice, which is one of the motors of the movement, the feeling that the efforts are not equally shared, to that he did not respond,\u201d Mr. Teinturier said.A Yellow Vest protester from eastern France, Axelle Cavalheiro, who has traveled to Paris twice to protest, said she had been hopeful before the president\u2019s speech, but was disappointed by his plan.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help me,\u201d said Ms. Cavalheiro, of the president\u2019s announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t know any one in my group of Yellow Vests whom it will help. Most of us earn more than the minimum wage, but not enough to pay for things we need.\u201dStill, Ms. Cavalheiro said she might not be able to come this weekend to protest, suggesting an exhaustion factor for some of the Yellow Vests, even as dissatisfaction with the president\u2019s policies remains high.\u201cWith Macron, the rich just get richer and the poor get poorer,\u201d she said.Aurelien Breeden and Liz Alderman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Strategy for Dealing With Trump: Warn Him About China", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s new government has a strategy for dealing with President Trump.Don\u2019t anger him. Don\u2019t cave in to him. Try to get him to help fund an ambitious investment plan to stem migration by creating jobs in Central America.And if Mr. Trump cannot be persuaded, Mexican officials said in interviews that they would remind him that there is another player in the region willing to step into the vacuum: China.That, in a nut shell, is the approach the Mexican government is betting can defuse the standoff over the thousands of migrants amassed at its border with the United States, hoping to make it across.Mexico\u2019s plan to try to raise money to develop Central America and southern Mexico was announced last week, when Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the country\u2019s new president, introduced what he called a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d to address the root causes of Central American migration: a $30 billion initiative to invest in the region and welcome migrants into Mexico with visas, health care and employment.Mexican officials have compared the proposal to the plan to rebuild postwar Europe. This approach would represent a break with Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s predecessor, who considered giving in to Mr. Trump\u2019s demands and allowing people seeking asylum in the United States to remain in Mexico while they wait.And Mexico\u2019s new plan is, in many respects, the opposite of Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to crack down on migration, which includes building a wall, deploying the military and cutting aid to Central America.In speaking about the contours of their new policy, Mexican officials told The New York Times that they would not force a confrontation with Mr. Trump by demanding that he accept the migrants onto American soil; that would only anger the American president, and he would not do it anyway, they said.But at the same time, they said they were not going to strike a deal with the United States to keep asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border. That would allow Mr. Trump to claim a victory Mexican officials are not willing to give him. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to aggravate already strained relationships with the Trump administration.Instead, they want to change the focus of the conversation to expanding the economy of Central America and the south of their country by marshaling public and private investment to build infrastructure, develop the energy sector and create jobs in the region so people do not have to stream north in the first place.They acknowledge that it may be difficult to convince the Trump administration to invest large sums in the region, a proposal they have only recently broached with American officials.The Mexican strategy to rely on the United States\u2019 concerns about China\u2019s expanding influence in the region reflects a growing sense in Mexico that it can no longer take cooperation with the United States for granted.Both the White House and State Department declined to comment on the Mexican proposal.\u201cFor a long time there has been this competition within Latin America for influence, where China is willing to invest billions in infrastructure and energy that the United States simply isn\u2019t,\u201d said Duncan Wood, the director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center.The proposal is also a reflection of the distinct personalities of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and Mr. Trump: Both are mavericks \u2014 albeit on opposite sides of the political spectrum \u2014 and both are willing to break with long-established conventions.\u201cPartly because of Trump and partly because of Andr\u00e9s Manuel, there is an opening there,\u201d Mr. Wood said.Unlike his predecessor, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is willing to chart an independent course in his response to the Trump administration \u2014 partly because of Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on migration and partly out of a conviction that the only way to tackle the matter is to go after its root causes.And to do that, Mexico will look for help wherever it can find it, including China, which has already expressed an interest in Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s plan to lay hundreds of miles of track for a tourist train in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula \u2014 a project widely opposed by environmental advocates.Of course, that does not mean Mexico will make a sharp turn to China, given its longstanding relationship with the United States. Nor does floating the idea that China may participate make Mexico\u2019s costly proposal any more plausible.\u201cThe money is just not there,\u201d said Mark Feierstein, the former senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. He noted that the United States was spending more than $650 million a year in Central America\u2019s Northern Triangle, which is composed of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.But that may be beside the point.\u201cIf nothing else, it is a good bargaining chip,\u201d said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, of the idea that China could increase its investment in the region. \u201cBoth sides are laying down their frameworks and their points of view as to how they should proceed.\u201dThe idea that China could increase its influence in Mexico emerged even before Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador came into office.\u201cI heard from senior Mexican officials during the transition that if the United States is not going to treat Mexico with respect, don\u2019t be surprised if you see a Chinese submarine in a Mexican port,\u201d said Juan Gonzalez, who was an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Central America.\u201cI think it was hyperbolic,\u201d he said of the outgoing officials\u2019 warning, before adding, \u201cI think Mexico sees increased political risk coming from the political process in the United States and they are diversifying their interests.\u201dSince taking office on Dec. 1, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has done nothing if not shake up the establishment.He has announced the cancellation of the construction of a new airport, a multibillion-dollar project that was well underway, and temporarily suspended new auctions for oil exploration in Mexico. He has also cut salaries for government employees and proposed a measure to dismantle a much-vaunted education overhaul.As he did on the campaign trail, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has focused on domestic issues \u2014 an inward-looking vision that differs from recent Mexican presidents who saw the global stage as the nation\u2019s future.But the migrant crisis forced its way to the top of the agenda, proving a frustrating first test for Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.The arrival of thousands of migrants traveling in caravans from Honduras and other Central American countries raised the profile of an existing problem, increasing the stakes and forcing Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador to decide how to manage it just days after taking office.For decades, Mexico kept its head down as hundreds of thousands of migrants \u2014 many of them Mexican \u2014 made their way into the United States. But in recent years, the nation\u2019s status as a transit country has changed.Mexico is becoming a destination, not just a portal to the United States. Every year, more people apply for asylum in Mexico, and many more choose to stay and seek work. A bottleneck in the United States has meant that thousands of migrants are stuck waiting months at the border for their initial asylum interview with the American authorities.In 2014, at the urging of the Obama administration, Mexico adopted a tough policing strategy along its southern border with Guatemala that essentially amounted to detention and deportation. But that also failed to curtail the flow of migrants.Today, with about 10,000 migrants having entered Mexico in caravans that focused global media attention on their plight, mass roundups and deportations are not an option, officials say. Nor is striking a deal with the Trump administration to host the migrants indefinitely.So Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government is trying to fold them into Mexican society \u2014 and raise money to invest in projects that would boost employment and prosperity in the region.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to point out that the causes of migration have to be dealt with,\u201d said Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico\u2019s foreign secretary, adding that Mexico wants to counter the idea \u201cthat the best way to confront migration is through exclusion and control.\u201dThis is, in part, a recognition that Mexico forms a part of a busy migration corridor and that, with or without help from the United States, it has to deal with the issue.\u201cFinally, the issue of the Northern Triangle and migration is seen as a regional issue,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, the director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego, and a former Mexican presidential adviser. \u201cThere is a window of opportunity. The knowledge and awareness have never been as clear as they are now.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is also signaling an interest in playing a broader leadership role in the region, as Mexico did during the 1970s and 1980s.\u201cMexico wants to take back leadership in the region,\u201d said Rodolfo Cruz Pi\u00f1eiro, director of the department for population studies at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana. \u201cMexico is telling the U.S.: \u2018I can control this region for you, but I need your economic help.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat will the U.S. ask?\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the great unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemala Cautious on Young Migrants\u2019 Deaths, Wary of Angering U.S.", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The deaths of two Guatemalan children in Border Patrol custody raised a furor in the United States, but drew a far more muted response in their own country, where a government focused on its survival is afraid that antagonizing the Trump administration could end American support.The children, Felipe G\u00f3mez Alonso, 8, and Jakelin Caal Maqu\u00edn, 7, fell ill and died this month after they crossed the southwestern border into the United States with their fathers, in separate events, and were detained by the Border Patrol.Their deaths prompted outrage in the United States over the conditions that migrants, especially children, endure in Border Patrol custody, putting the Trump administration on the defensive as the president insists that Congress approve $5 billion toward building a wall he says will thwart illegal immigration.But the Guatemalan government\u2019s response has been cautious. Aside from sending diplomatic notes to the State Department requesting an investigation into each child\u2019s death and offering to pay for the bodies\u2019 return home, the government has sidestepped the issue. There has been no formal protest against the American crackdown on migrants or condemnation of the hardships that even children are facing in detention centers.President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala has made no public statement, leaving it to Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel to issue updates on her ministry\u2019s efforts to learn why the children died and bring their bodies home.\u201cThe government of Guatemala regrets that a citizen has lost her life in this journey and points out that the places where migrants cross now are more dangerous and the distances they travel are longer,\u201d the foreign ministry said in announcing Jakelin\u2019s death.The reason for the government\u2019s reticence, analysts suggest, is a combination of Guatemala\u2019s centuries-old discrimination against its indigenous Mayan communities, into which both children were born, and a careful political calculation ahead of next July\u2019s presidential election.Mr. Morales has cultivated relations with the Trump administration and its allies to assure their support in his fight against an international panel on corruption that has accused him of campaign finance violations and filed charges against a wide array of political and economic power brokers in Guatemala.His efforts have been largely successful, and the United States has fallen silent as Mr. Morales has defied rulings from Guatemala\u2019s highest court and barred members of the panel, including its head, from the country.But the Trump administration has remained supportive of Mr. Morales even as his actions to shut down Cicig have taken Guatemala to the brink of a constitutional crisis. Now, with migration becoming a growing irritant in that relationship, Mr. Morales is anxious to smooth over the tensions.When a caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants crossed through Guatemala on its way to Mexico in October, the exodus angered President Trump, who fired off messages on Twitter blaming Guatemala and Honduras for allowing them to move north, said Fernando Carrera, a former foreign minister in Guatemala.Despite the deaths of the two children, \u201cthe government of Guatemala doesn\u2019t want to give more ammunition to that argument,\u201d Mr. Carrera said. \u201cThey stay quiet and they don\u2019t react.\u201dAid may be less of a worry for Mr. Morales, though, than continued United States support for his effort to oust the Cicig panel. For more than a year, Mr. Morales and his government have been carefully developing allies in Washington, nurturing ties with evangelical groups and conservative legislators and moving Guatemala\u2019s embassy to Jerusalem, soon after the Trump administration did.The Morales government is keen to protect its relationship with the Trump administration, said Quique Godoy, who resigned last year as a senior planning official in the Morales government in protest of the attacks on Cicig.\u201cThey are more worried about Cicig than trying to denounce the United States government of mismanaging\u201d its treatment of migrants, Mr. Godoy said.Mr. Carrera, the former foreign minister, said the Guatemalan government and its allies saw Cicig \u2014 which has insisted on controls in campaign finance \u2014 as a threat before the election next summer.The results of the July vote will determine what happens to the panel. It will also affect Mr. Morales\u2019s future. He is not eligible to run for re-election and will lose his immunity from prosecution after stepping down, leaving him open to the Cicig-backed investigation into illicit campaign financing. The president\u2019s son and brother have also been targeted by the panel.What has guided the Guatemalan government\u2019s response to the migrant children\u2019s deaths is a consular protection program that the foreign ministry has had in place for many years to provide support for migrants, including legal help and, when deaths occur, the return of bodies, Mr. Carrera said.Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, said that Ms. Jovel, the minister, had spoken frequently with the secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, in recent months to emphasize the importance of protecting migrant children.The children\u2019s deaths have also underscored the deep failures of successive Guatemalan governments to improve conditions for the country\u2019s poorest people, particularly the indigenous Maya who make up at least 40 percent of the population.Jakelin, who died in an El Paso hospital a few days past her seventh birthday, was buried on Christmas Day in her small village, a cluster of thatched-roof houses where Q\u2019eqchi\u2019-speaking families struggle to survive by growing corn and beans.Felipe, who died on Christmas Eve in a New Mexico hospital, had left his isolated Chuj-speaking village with his father. The village is near the Mexican border in the province of Huehuetenango, which sends more migrants to the United States than any other in Guatemala. Four out of five people in his rural municipality live in poverty, official statistics show.\u201cWe have a de facto apartheid society,\u201d said Anita Isaacs, a Guatemala scholar at Haverford College. \u201cThis country continues to be almost as racist as it has been historically.\u201dThe result is that the death of an indigenous child barely registers, she said: \u201cThese lives are worth less, and these people are fundamentally invisible.\u201dAlongside that indifference, Ms. Isaacs said, is an interest in developing the regions where indigenous people live. Palm oil plantations have begun to encroach on the Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 lands north of the village where Jakelin\u2019s family lives.Historically, these communities have been evicted to make way for cash crops like sugar or coffee, Ms. Isaacs said.\u201cWhat better form of eviction than them leaving the country completely?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a major reason why the Guatemalan government doesn\u2019t care.\u201dThe contribution is likely to rise as the number of Guatemalans seeking to reach the United States surges \u2014 the result, Ms. Isaacs said, of \u201ca perfect storm\u201d of poverty, violence and environmental crises.In a region with little investment in infrastructure, education or health care, like the remote areas on the border of Guatemala and Mexico where these two children were from, a temporary hardship \u2014 like this year\u2019s sharp drop in coffee and sugar prices \u2014 can provide the final push to people who are thinking of migrating, said Mr. Godoy, who is now the director of Propuesta Urbana, an organization that works on urban development and migration.\u201cThe main reason why people keep migrating is because we are not generating the right conditions locally for people not to migrate,\u201d Mr. Godoy said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Leading Intellectuals Analyze What Ails America", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAmong President Trump\u2019s major accomplishments is the booming industry in books about him, his administration, the state of democracy in America, the rise of autocracy in America and abroad, the reasons for his rise, the bases of his support, the state of the Republican Party, the state of his mental health or lack thereof, the chaos in his White House and so on. Not all are strictly about Trump \u2014 the fact is the conditions and dynamics that brought us Trump long preceded him, and the changes in the fabric of our Republic are paralleled by changes in other longstanding democracies around the globe.Wolfe describes and examines a host of postwar political thinkers, many of whom, like Hannah Arendt and Joseph Schumpeter, had come from the horrors of Europe, but he focuses even more on a core group of American-born intellectuals like Richard Hofstadter, Daniel Bell, Lionel Trilling, Nathan Glazer, Irving Kristol, Seymour Martin Lipset and Reinhold Niebuhr, those he calls \u201cmature liberals.\u201d They set out the values and behaviors that embody what Wolfe views as political maturity, taking on both the world-government left and the populist, demagogic right.Wolfe is at his best when he is discussing these writers, first-class thinkers who responded powerfully to their era\u2019s challenges. He contrasts their response to what he sees as the lamer reaction of the contemporary intellectual community to Trump \u2014 and suggests we no longer have a core of all-star intellectuals but instead a shallower group of \u201cthought leaders.\u201d And he tries to draw lessons from the writing of the old school of mature liberals to apply to the present day, a time, he says, when our political immaturity has led to the politics of petulance.Wolfe notes, of course, that McCarthyism lost, which he attributes in large part to the eloquent and sustained pushback from these public intellectuals (although he stresses that it had taken the horrors of a depression and a huge war to remind liberals of their calling and responsibility). He lays out the conditions that led to our current crisis, but implies that these days we have neither the impetus from horrific conditions nor the intellectual heft to transcend Trump and Trumpism and to move beyond our current \u201cimmature democracy.\u201dCertainly, there are reasons this era is different, but blaming a lack of intellectual heft both overemphasizes the importance of intellectuals and largely dismisses a pretty impressive collection of present-day thinkers, including many of the Never-Trumpers calling for a reassertion of conservative values from the right, and scholars of political thought, race and authoritarianism showing courage and fortitude from the center and left. He also does not give enough emphasis to other conditions: the rise of partisanship extending even to the courts, the importance of tribal media in a new communications age, the obliteration of campaign finance rules that had put some limits on the power of the oligarchic class.Focused as he is on ideas, Wolfe does not end with a series of reforms to reverse our decline. Instead, he offers advice to his readers: Don\u2019t be petulant, appreciate the nobility of politics, trust experts, avoid conspiracy theorizing, don\u2019t believe candidates who promise only good news, pay attention to political debates, be sensitive to norms and not just laws. All good ideas, but Wolfe has no road map or magic wand to get most Americans to buy into them.\u201cAmerica, Compromised\u201d is about the country in the Trump era, but not about Trump. Indeed, Lessig would have written much the same book if Hillary Clinton were president and if Democrats had control of both houses of Congress. His focus is not on bad people doing bad things, but on how incentives across a range of institutions have created corruption, with deleterious consequences for the nation.For Congress, Lessig notes that the framers were deeply concerned about corruption, but rarely focused on the evils of individual quid pro quos. They worried about institutions, the danger of politicians becoming dependent on forces beyond the voters who elected them \u2014 or, as Madison wrote, \u201cthe people alone.\u201d Congress, Lessig believes, is corrupt even though the overwhelming majority of congresspeople are not.The institutional corruption here comes from political money. It corrupts the agenda, the issues that get the focus and attention, and moves Congress away from the needs and concerns of the voters. While our political institutions were not all or mainly linked to voters, at least not directly, the House of Representatives is and was meant to be a channel for the voices of the people. It has become something else entirely. Similarly, Lessig\u2019s chapter on the media, in which he examines technology meeting market forces, reinforces the sense of dysfunction that flows from distorted incentives. One need only look at Facebook for a current example.With regard to finance, Lessig examines in different ways the 2008 collapse, from banks to ratings agencies that gave AAA ratings to entities that were absurdly dangerous. These agencies were created in the 19th century, and have had impeccable reputations because of their perceived independence and objectivity. But, Lessig says, the big three ratings agencies, designated as official by the Securities and Exchange Commission, compete to get the lucrative business of analyzing securities. Good ratings mean more business. Bad ratings, not so much. With financial institutions playing one agency off against the others, the results were predictable. Lessig quotes Roger Lowenstein, the author of a book on Wall Street: \u201cImagine the big rating agencies as three competitive saloons standing side by side, with each free to set its own drinking age. Before long, 9-year-olds would be downing bourbon.\u201d The ratings failures were key contributors to the financial collapse. Individuals in the agencies did not take bribes \u2014 it was the perverse incentives that corrupted the institutions.In his essay on the academy, Lessig first writes scathingly of the psychiatric profession. In the era of miracle medications promising relief or cures, psychiatry has become captive to the pharmaceutical industry, altering the ways diseases have been classified and drugs prescribed.Some of Lessig\u2019s toughest words are for his own profession, the law. Lawyers used to prosecute white-collar crime, without partisanship or other biases. But somehow, in the aftermath of the catastrophic financial crisis in 2008, not a single individual miscreant was brought to the bar of justice. Why? Start with the fact that the gap between the incomes of prosecutors and lawyers in firms has ballooned; a prosecutor now struggles for a good life relative to his or her law school colleagues in the private sector. That has led to a revolving door between prosecutors\u2019 offices and white-collar defense firms. Being \u201chirable\u201d means public officials can\u2019t be too hard on firms they might eventually join. It is not a matter of greed, but of distorted incentives leading to unsettling behavior.What to do? Lessig examines a range of ways to de-corrupt institutions. As with so many efforts, it is hard to find remedies that are realistic and practical. Still, some of Lessig\u2019s ideas are not just pie in the sky. He recommends public financing for campaigns; delinking rating agencies and experts offering testimony from those paying for it; and using in-depth polls to gauge public opinion on key issues as a kind of shadow government.That two impressive public intellectuals like Alan Wolfe and Lawrence Lessig are weighing in on the challenges of our times, joining so many others, is reassuring. \u201cThe Politics of Petulance\u201d and \u201cAmerica, Compromised\u201d join an impressive array of books and essays that may, someday, have a future intellectual historian using them as examples to lament the fact that his or her contemporaries are not as eloquent or important as the group that arose in the Trump era to combat the threats to our way of life.Norman J. Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a co-author of \u201cOne Nation After Trump: A Guide for the Perplexed, the Disillusioned, the Desperate and the Not-Yet-Deported.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigel Farage, on Brexit Sidelines, Prepares for \u2018Another Great Battle\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 While the British Parliament debated withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, last week, the man who sees himself as the architect of that effort, Nigel Farage, was keeping a low profile in a scruffy office a couple of blocks away.And, from this detached position, Mr. Farage says he has developed a surprising degree of admiration for Michel Barnier, the European Union\u2019s chief negotiator on the matter.Mr. Farage, one of the most famous faces of Brexit, thinks Mr. Barnier outnegotiated the British government, and says so using the kind of analogy that made him known for an ability to connect with a broad range of voters.\u201cIn a football game, you support England \u2014 obviously,\u201d Mr. Farage said, chuckling slightly, \u201cbut you have to sometimes recognize that Germany are better.\u201dActually, Mr. Barnier is French, and Mr. Farage\u2019s praise for the slightly austere European official should not be taken wholly at face value.But he has had little or no impact on the debate in Parliament.And although he is still a member of the European Parliament, he will lose that position next year when Britain leaves the European Union, thanks to the Brexit he has championed for more than two decades.If there is a living, breathing example in politics of the saying \u201cSometimes when you win, you really lose,\u201d it is arguably Mr. Farage. So how does it feel to be in his shoes at the moment?Usually his replies come in rapid fire, but this time he pauses.\u201cFrustrating at one particular level,\u201d he eventually answers. \u201cThere are some people who think this dog\u2019s dinner of a deal is my fault, because I pushed for Brexit. To which I robustly respond by saying this is not the Brexit, or anything like the one I would have gone for.\u201d\u201cConstitutionally, and in terms of sovereignty, it\u2019s ever so slightly worse than where we are \u2014 which is quite an achievement,\u201d he added, laughing. \u201cUltimately, we can\u2019t leave the prison unless the warder says so \u2014 and we\u2019ve gone in voluntarily. It\u2019s extraordinary.\u201dMr. Farage, dressed as is his custom in a suit and tie, was perched at an office of Rock Services, a company Mr. Banks owns.Mr. Banks is now the subject of an investigation by the National Crime Agency over the financing of the Leave campaign, for which Mr. Farage was the figurehead. (Mr. Banks has said that he would probably have voted Remain had he known what would happen with Brexit.)Mr. Farage says he has 20 minutes to speak, but everyone knows he likes to talk. When the time is up, the conversation continues in a taxi across the Thames, before an interview in the London studios of Fox News, and afterward, as he smokes a cigarette outside.One of Mrs. May\u2019s big problems is that most of the best-known supporters of Brexit in the 2016 referendum campaign say today that her deal does not deliver what they had promised, raising the question of why Britain should proceed with a withdrawal plan that fails to satisfy its best-known proponents.Unlike pro-Brexit Conservatives such as Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, or the former Brexit secretaries, David Davis and Dominic Raab \u2014 all of whom took cabinet positions but eventually resigned \u2014 Mr. Farage never had the chance to help write the script after the referendum victory.\u201cTrump won the election and he was in charge; we won the referendum and the very next day handed power back to the very people I had fought for 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the irony of the whole thing.\u201dGiven the subsequent mess, Mr. Farage might understandably feel relieved about being disengaged, but in fact he seems a little irritated. Though he blames the Civil Service for the outcome, he says that cabinet Brexiteers have been divided and disappointing, adding that he offered to help Mrs. May but was \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 rebuffed.\u201cI said, \u2018Look, you should use my fame and notoriety. I\u2019m very happy to travel all around Europe to places where they produce wine, make chocolate, BMWs, to really try to get a public, a business campaign going in Europe to explain to them: Put pressure on your leaders, put pressure on your parliaments.\u2019 \u201dAs for Mrs. May, who has won some plaudits for her durability and persistence, Mr. Farage acknowledges she has staying power.\u201cYou have to admire her limpet-like stickability, you have to admire that,\u201d he said, though it quickly emerges that he does not admire it. \u201cShe\u2019s not just the worst prime minister I have seen in my lifetime, she\u2019s the most duplicitous,\u201d he said.It is time for Mr. Farage\u2019s Fox TV interview. This is not his first of the day, as he was in a studio at 3:30 a.m., leaving him with just two hours sleep. Nowadays, much of his routine is dictated by broadcasting schedules, and he hosts a radio show five days a week.That, he said, might be the one thing that draws him back into the fray. \u201cIf Brexit is completely betrayed, or we face a second referendum or whatever, it may be I\u2019ll be out there fighting hard.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Farage sounds as though he would almost welcome another vote on Brexit, for which contingency planning is underway. \u201cIn the end, we\u2019re going to get there, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may have another great battle to fight, we may.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Season of Turmoil", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization.Hundreds of doctors packed an auditorium at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on Oct. 1, deeply angered by revelations that the hospital\u2019s top medical officer and other leaders had cultivated lucrative relationships with for-profit companies.One by one, they stood up to challenge the stewardship of their beloved institution, often to emotional applause. Some speakers accused their leaders of letting the quest to make more money undermine the hospital\u2019s mission. Others bemoaned a rigid, hierarchical management that had left them feeling they had no real voice in the hospital\u2019s direction.The day after the meeting, the hospital\u2019s chief executive, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, promised greater openness with rank-and-file doctors about decision-making. He also committed to doing the \u201croot-cause analysis\u201d requested by the doctors of how \u201cegregious conflicts of interest,\u201d as one physician put it, had been allowed to happen.Other hospitals around the country are confronting similar dilemmas. But at Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation\u2019s leading cancer research and treatment centers, they are especially acute. Internal emails, audio recordings of meetings and interviews with doctors show how this major New York institution has struggled to contain a crisis of confidence in its leadership.Closer ties between nonprofit research centers like Memorial Sloan Kettering and corporations are being fueled by a rush of potentially breakthrough cancer treatments. Venture capital firms and drug companies have looked to cash in on the scientific discoveries, said Brad Loncar, the founder of an investment fund that focuses on cancer. \u201cMoney follows success,\u201d he said, and Memorial Sloan Kettering has been a focus \u201cbecause they conduct terrific science there.\u201dIn recent years, the hospital, like its competitors, has struck increasingly sophisticated deals to commercialize its discoveries, in some cases receiving equity stakes in start-ups rather than simply collecting royalties.The predicament of Memorial Sloan Kettering also reflects a shift in its own culture. Its prior chief executive, Dr. Harold E. Varmus, a Nobel-prize winning scientist, personally kept companies at arm\u2019s length, while Dr. Thompson, also a respected cancer researcher, has more fully embraced such relationships. The new approach has been applauded by some for expanding access to the cancer center\u2019s discoveries, even as others have worried that the hospital may be losing sight of its mission.\u201cWe do have to sort of decide which side of this we\u2019re on, or at least notice that we are feeding at the very trough that is causing worse access here than in any other Western country,\u201d Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the hospital\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, said at the Oct. 1 meeting.Even as Memorial Sloan Kettering leaders have promised greater transparency, they have engaged a public affairs firm, SKDKnickerbocker, to manage their message and have aggressively pushed back against the idea that the hospital\u2019s leaders are too close to industry.\u201cI can see how someone might think that business relationships are problematic,\u201d said Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, who has stepped into Dr. Baselga\u2019s former position at Memorial Sloan Kettering on an acting basis. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, as someone who works with patients, and I\u2019ve worked with patients throughout my entire career here, that working with industry has helped me save lives.\u201dThe Times and ProPublica asked to speak to Dr. Tabar and Dr. Brown about the critical remarks they made about the hospital\u2019s direction at the Oct. 1 meeting. Mike Morey, managing director of the communications firm engaged by the hospital, arranged for them to speak to reporters on the phone while he listened. The doctors said they were not specifically referring to Memorial Sloan Kettering during the meeting that was recorded by one of those in attendance, but to broader changes in the medical world.It now operates more than 120 research laboratories, employs more than 1,000 doctors, admits some 23,500 patients a year, operates one of the world\u2019s largest clinical trial programs and had revenues of nearly $4.5 billion in 2017. It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York\u2019s social calendar.As a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies. While it did business with industry during the tenure of Dr. Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, he and a top deputy, Dr. Robert E. Wittes, did not consult for companies, own their stock or serve on their boards, according to several people who worked for Dr. Varmus while he was at the hospital from 2000 to 2010. Dr. Varmus and Dr. Wittes declined to comment.But some on the hospital\u2019s board wanted its chief executive to do more to encourage company-financed clinical trials and to bring discoveries to market. In an interview, John R. Gunn, the cancer center\u2019s chief operating officer from 1987 to 2015, said board members felt gems of research were \u201clying fallow and nobody was kind of pushing it, to commercialize it.\u201dBy the time Dr. Varmus left to direct the National Cancer Institute in 2010, Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s board was looking for a leader who was as comfortable in a corporate board room as in the lab, according to several longtime current and former cancer center employees.Dr. Thompson met those criteria. He headed the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, was the co-founder of a biotech start-up, Agios, and served on the board of Merck.His early tenure was marred by controversy. In 2011 and 2012, he was sued by his former employers, the Abramson center and the University of Pennsylvania, which accused him of walking off with valuable research and using it to start Agios. At the time, Dr. Thompson denied wrongdoing and the suits were later settled for an undisclosed sum.But several doctors who worked under Dr. Baselga said in interviews that he had an abrasive style and created a culture where ties to industry were not kept in check. Dr. Baselga has not responded to requests for comment.Dr. Baselga\u2019s conflicts were not overseen by Dr. Hudis\u2019s committee, but by the audit committee of the hospital\u2019s board of directors. \u201cI was told this was pretty standard for the highest level executives,\u201d said Dr. Hudis. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why any clinician would have separate rules from any other.\u201dMr. Morey said the hospital is evaluating its process for reviewing conflicts of interest, but that executives like Dr. Baselga had their financial relationships overseen by the board \u201cto protect faculty from being put in a position of having to review their supervisor\u2019s potential conflicts.\u201dEthicists and health experts say having leaders and researchers at nonprofit hospitals sit on corporate boards is especially problematic. When they serve on the board of a publicly traded company, they have a legal duty to the corporation and its shareholders, which can clash with their duty to their patients and primary employers. Those who sit on boards are often paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can serve two masters,\u201d said Dr. Bernard Lo, who led an influential Institute of Medicine panel in 2009 that investigated financial conflicts in medicine. \u201cThe whole reason for being in the cancer care business is that you\u2019re trying to help people in need, and that\u2019s not at all the company\u2019s main purpose. It\u2019s to generate profits on their products.\u201dThough he takes no salary from AngioGenex, Dr. Benezra owns nearly nine percent of the company he helped found through stock or options, setting him up for a lucrative payday if the company is acquired or its drugs come to market.Dr. Benezra said in a statement issued through the hospital, \u201cWhile I do not work directly with patients, I hope that this important science can one day make an impact in the lives of cancer sufferers.\u201dMr. Morey said Dr. Benezra spends just 30 hours a year on business related to the publicly traded company. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about 45 minutes a week, which is less than what most people spend on Netflix in a night,\u201d Mr. Morey said.Dr. DeAngelis, the acting physician-in-chief, said the high number of Memorial Sloan Kettering leaders who serve on corporate boards is reflective of their stature. \u201cMaybe we should turn this around and say, we have more people on corporate boards because people value the opinions from our faculty,\u201d she said in an interview.Referring to Dr. Thompson and Douglas A. Warner III, the outgoing chairman of the hospital\u2019s board of managers and overseers, who is known as Sandy, he said, \u201cAs far as I can tell neither Sandy nor Craig understand this very basic point. And if you don\u2019t recognize that a problem exists there is no chance you will solve it.\u201dHe also said, \u201cMaking billions is not our mission. M.S.K. is a nonprofit with a fundamentally social mission.\u201dDr. Begg declined to comment.Mr. Warner also addressed the doctors, informing them that the board was assessing whether Dr. Thompson should remain on Merck\u2019s board.\u201cShould Craig continue to sit on the Merck board? We have no policy on that,\u201d Mr. Warner said, according to the transcript, noting that Dr. Thompson\u2019s role on the board was initially seen as a \u201cgood thing\u201d when he joined the hospital. \u201cWe need to step back from that now and ask ourselves whether that continues to be appropriate, whether it\u2019s appropriate in the future.\u201dThe next day, Oct. 2, Dr. Thompson announced that he was resigning from both the boards on which he served.Requests to interview Dr. Thompson and Mr. Warner were declined. Instead the hospital arranged for reporters to speak to Dr. DeAngelis, who said she saw nothing wrong with the corporate ties that Dr. Thompson had earlier said were under review.She downplayed the concerns voiced by Dr. Begg about the culture of the hospital. \u201cHe is a biostatistician. He does not work with patients. He works with data,\u201d she said, adding that he does not have \u201cas full an understanding\u201d about policies to prevent doctors with corporate ties from having an undue influence on clinical trials.\u201cWe expect the piece to question the ethics of some of our most accomplished researchers and clinicians. We want you to know that we reject these insinuations and we stand behind our faculty 100 percent.\u201dCharles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Will Replace Angela Merkel as German Conservatives\u2019 Leader?", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past month, the three main candidates have crisscrossed Germany, presenting themselves and their visions for the party to eight lively regional conferences so crowded that they often had to be moved to larger venues. Some 14,000 members attended, while the events were streamed live to an additional 200,000 people.It was an unusually transparent and democratic process for a party that has historically chosen its leaders in back-room deals, with the delegates\u2019 vote rendered little more than a formality by one-candidate ballots. And it comes at a time when the Christian Democrats are struggling to retain their status as Germany\u2019s main big-tent party.Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, who is frequently referred to by her initials, A.K.K., sought to move from the shadow of Ms. Merkel, to whom she is often compared, by taking a harder line toward migration and emphasizing the conservatives\u2019 Christian roots.She also played up her more than three decades of service in the party, which included a stint as interior minister and more than six years governing the tiny state of Saarland \u2014 proof, she said, that she can win elections. She stressed cohesiveness as crucial to the party\u2019s success. \u201cWe will only reach that strength if we hold together,\u201d she said.Recent polls have shown that Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer is favored by the German public and several leading conservative party members. But it was Mr. Merz who brought crowds to their feet in the important states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia.But his suggestions to change German laws on refugees, which are anchored in the Constitution, and to use the stock market to shore up pension funds raised questions about the 63-year-old, who is backed by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, former finance minister and godfather of the conservative party.The third candidate, Jens Spahn, the health minister in Ms. Merkel\u2019s government, failed to inspire party members with his appeal to allow the younger generation to take over. At just 38, he said he was told by many that he was \u201cvery young\u201d and would have a chance in the future.Mr. Merkel has said that, regardless of who wins the party leadership, she intends to serve as chancellor until 2021, when her current term expires. Both Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer and Mr. Merz expressed support for that idea on the campaign trail.But that scenario seems far more likely if Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, whom the chancellor lifted from regional politics into a key party position last year, takes the helm of the party. She is widely seen as Ms. Merkel\u2019s chosen successor, and the two women have shown they are able to work together during Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s brief tenure as the party\u2019s general secretary.Under the leadership of Mr. Merz, there are various options for how Ms. Merkel\u2019s political career could end. The lobbyist and businessman has held a long-simmering animosity toward the chancellor since she ousted him as floor leader in 2002. Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing partners, the Social Democrats, already suffering for their decision to enter into a third coalition with the conservatives, widely view Mr. Merz as too market-oriented and conservative. There are fears they could quit the government, triggering new elections.The conservatives consider themselves Germany\u2019s \u201cchancellor party,\u201d having governed for all but 20 of the past 69 years. They would like to keep it that way. Whichever candidate is chosen will be expected to help restore the party\u2019s broad appeal to voters from all walks of society.Regardless of who wins, the new leader will bring a shift of cultural attitudes, given that all three are Roman Catholics from western Germany \u2014 the opposite of Ms. Merkel, who is a Lutheran from eastern Germany, said Paul Nolte, a professor of history at the Free University in Berlin. \u201cThe pendulum is swinging back,\u201d he said.The 1,001 delegates voting by secret ballot represent a cross-section of the party, from governors and members of Parliament to municipal representatives. If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round, the two top contenders advance to a runoff.Friday\u2019s vote is for the party leader, but the delegates will have an eye on who could win support from the broader public in the next general election. So although German voters don\u2019t have a direct say, public opinion matters, said Guntram Wolff, director of Bruegel, a research institute based in Brussels.\u201cThe next chair of Christian Democrats is not necessarily the next German chancellor,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in China. If he or she wants to be chancellor, they will need to be nominated as a chancellor candidate and then would have to be elected.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how long the conservatives have governed in Germany during the past 69 years. The party has held the post of chancellor for 49 of those years, not 20.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Buy Someone a Phone for the Holidays?", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe answer is yes, if you can make sure you get them something they like, and you\u2019re not saddling your loved one with a monthly bill. Here\u2019s how to do it right.Every store and phone carrier offers holiday deals on their smartphones. It\u2019s a good time to buy yourself a phone, but should you buy one for someone else? Like buying someone a puppy, that\u2019s a complicated question.Smartphones, however, are a different story. Stores love to advertise phones as a great gift idea, and offer buy-one-get-one-free deals or discounts when you sign up a new line. However, our phones are deeply personal devices. Someone might dislike a particular phone because it doesn\u2019t fit in their pocket, because it doesn\u2019t work on the right carrier, or even because it\u2019s not the right color. Buying the right phone for someone else can become complicated very fast. Here are some of the big stumbling blocks to watch out for when phone shopping for a loved one, if you want to do it at all.\u201cDepending on what carrier the recipient is on, you\u2019ll need to make sure that the phone is compatible with that particular network,\u201d he explained in an email. \u201cThis is most true for Verizon and Sprint, which tend to be more strict with bring-your-own-device policies. While most phones these days are quad-band\u201d \u2014 meaning they should work on all major carriers \u2014 \u201cthere are definitely still some outliers that don\u2019t offer the compatible bands for all networks. This is most true for new iPhones, which should be purchased for the specific network they will be used on.\u201dHowever, if you buy an iPhone from AT&T or T-Mobile, it will only include the radio that those carriers support, which means you won\u2019t be able to take it to Verizon or Sprint. See the problem?It\u2019s also worth checking with your gift recipient about their upgrade status. Most carriers have switched to a phone financing model, where you add a monthly fee to your plan until you\u2019ve paid off your phone. However, some customers may still have the old two-year contract model, where you get a discount on a new phone in exchange for committing to another two-year contract. It might ruin the surprise a little, but if your recipient has an upgrade available and doesn\u2019t plan to change carriers, paying for an upgrade to a phone of their choosing might be cheaper (and better for them) than buying a new phone outright.Picking a phone for someone else is like buying them clothes. If you know what they like and have a good feel for their tastes, you can find a great present. If you\u2019re taking a wild guess without much information, you\u2019ll probably get something they\u2019ll want to exchange for something better.When in doubt, Mr. Summerson recommends making as few changes to what they have now as possible. \u201cPay attention to what they currently have and any complaints they have about that specific handset,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you specifically know that the person wants to change platforms, it\u2019s usually easiest (and best) to stick with what\u2019s familiar \u2014 so, a new iPhone for an iPhone user, and a new Android phone for an Android user.\u201dEven then, you can run into too many options, Mr. Summerson said. \u201cThere are a lot of choices in the Android space, however, so that can be a bit more challenging,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, a bit of tact and dropping phone talk into general conversation may be necessary to get a better feel for what they like and don\u2019t like about their current handset.\u201dAn exception to this rule is if you know that your gift recipient has a complaint about their phone. Are they complaining that their phone is too big? That\u2019s a good time to look for a smaller phone. Does their camera suck? Picking a phone that takes fantastic pictures can be a big improvement in their life. This might require you to talk to your loved one before buying, but it\u2019s safer than buying blind.Gift-givers often have an understandable reticence to just ask what their recipients want. Buying the right gift blindly shows you really understand your recipient. However, this is one area where you might want to ask anyway.\u201cSome people love a good surprise, while others are incredibly picky about something as personal as their smartphone,\u201d Mr. Summerson said. Unless you know for sure that the person you\u2019re buying for wants a new phone, likes the phone you\u2019ve picked out, and likes surprises, it\u2019s a safe idea to talk it out with them.If you decide to take the chance on buying a phone without asking the recipient first, be sure to check with the carrier or retailer that you\u2019re buying about their return policy. \u201cMany places offer extended return policies over the holidays too, which is a nice fail-safe if you end up in a situation that may require a quick handset swap,\u201d Mr. Summerson noted. If you buy a phone that your recipient doesn\u2019t like, a generous return window can be a lifesaver.The only surefire way to make sure that your loved one likes the phone you\u2019re buying, though, is to ask them. You can even turn it into a shared experience. Tell them that you\u2019ll go phone shopping with them and buy the phone they like most. That way you don\u2019t just buy a present for them, but you get to spend some quality time together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Got Wise. Will America?", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis sad journey is an extreme version of the country\u2019s. Opinion ColumnistMichael Cohen put his chips on, and faith in, someone who didn\u2019t deserve it. He was dazzled. He was entertained. He wanted a patron. He needed a guide. So he disregarded all the warning signs, ignored all the bad stuff. It was so much easier to believe.At one point or another, haven\u2019t many of us done that?Didn\u2019t Americans do that when they turned to Donald Trump in the presidential campaign of 2016?Cohen\u2019s answer: \u201cWhat were you thinking? You knew better. You know better.\u201d But over recent days, I began to see Cohen, who spent more than a decade as Trump\u2019s lawyer, fixer and mess cleaner, differently. He\u2019s a lesson for us all. A cautionary tale.Cohen told the judge that he had lost his moral compass. The many Republicans who continue to stand by Trump have lost their moral compasses, too. There should be parameters for tribalism and a limit to loyalty, as Cohen says he now understands. Trump is on the far side of that limit.Only a small minority of people would do quite what he did and break laws for the boss or benefactor to whom they\u2019d hitched themselves. Cohen\u2019s compass was unusually faulty from the get-go, and the short cut that he sought to the glamorous life \u2014 or at least what the glamorous life looks like to someone with a style and sensibility like Trump\u2019s \u2014 wasn\u2019t one that most people would travel.But what Trump represented to the country was what he offered Cohen: a comet ride, with all the blinding light and burning heat that goes along with that.In front of the judge on Wednesday, Cohen said, \u201cI was weak for not having the strength to question and to refuse his demands.\u201d He wondered aloud what had happened to his \u201cown inner voice,\u201d which, he said, \u201cshould have warned me.\u201dOne of his comments to Stephanopoulos perhaps explains that. \u201cThere was a lot of fun going on at the Trump Organization,\u201d he said. Sleek skyscrapers. Ornate casinos. Private jets. The Miss Universe pageant. How it glittered, distracted and lulled, so that a henchman could forget the terms and price of it.For every leader there are at least 10 followers ready to trade the burden and bedlam of independent thought for a playbook that tells them exactly what to do. Some of them find it in religion, others in business, still others in politics.\u201cTrump, by becoming president, turned a great many federal employees into the functional equivalent of Michael Cohen,\u201d Beinart wrote, explaining that they were hostage to Trump\u2019s \u201creckless, selfish, sordid, irresponsible\u201d actions and on the hook for minimizing the damage.\u201cSometimes,\u201d he added, \u201cTrump\u2019s messes are so large that vast numbers of federal employees are drafted into the Cohen role.\u201d He meant the workers in the Department of Agriculture after Trump went tariff-mad and the workers in the Department of Health and Human Services after the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that separated undocumented immigrant children from their parents.I\u2019d go further. Americans well beyond those unfortunate enough to work in the Trump administration are also being drafted. Every one of us wades through his wreckage of norms, is unsteadied by his assault on truth, braces for whatever happens next and knows that it may have much greater and longer consequence for us than it does for Trump. And the drafting began before he became president. It was years in the making.Americans erred in laying ourselves open to Trump, and I\u2019m not talking about conservative versus liberal policies, about tax cuts, about regulations \u2014 though all of those matter.

Apple used it to bring back $252 billion that it had stashed abroad.Mr. Trump, who had chided Apple over various issues in the past, reacted to the January announcement by praising the company while crediting his own policies for getting it to make the investments.In September, though, Mr. Trump took aim at Apple again over jobs after the company told trade officials in a letter that the administration\u2019s tariffs would affect a wide range of products.\u201cMake your products in the United States instead of China,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cStart building new plants now.\u201dNone of the new positions announced by Apple on Thursday appeared to involve manufacturing.Unlike Amazon, whose competition for a new headquarters was highly publicized, Apple has been relatively quiet about its expansion plans. The company opened its own new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., last year.The new 133-acre campus in Austin will initially employ 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support. It will ultimately have the capacity for up to 15,000 workers. Apple said it expected that its expanded presence in Austin, where it already employs 6,000 people, would make it the area\u2019s largest private employer.Apple said it had applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County. Those rebates would be in the tens of millions of dollars over 15 years, said a person familiar with the application, who declined to be named because the negotiations are private.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas hailed Apple\u2019s decision on Thursday as \u201ca testament to the high-quality work force and unmatched economic environment that Texas offers.\u201dCities and states are competing to lure high-paying tech jobs that can improve their economies and generate tax revenue.But tech companies, which rank among the world\u2019s largest by market value, carry downsides like gentrification and higher living costs that can push out longtime residents. Austin, like Seattle and the Bay Area, has experienced those effects in recent years as Apple and other technology companies expand.Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said the concentration of tech jobs in a few metropolitan areas was widening a gap between big cities and the rest of the country. He said the dynamic was contributing to the nation\u2019s political divide.\u201cThe digitalization of the economy is exaggerating the urban-rural divide,\u201d said Mr. Sundararajan, who studies the technology industry\u2019s role in the economy. \u201cThe part of the digital revolution that I have been waiting for, that I haven\u2019t seen kick in in the United States, is the large platforms enabling opportunities for individuals who may not have high-tech skills.\u201dJack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

A week ago, he urged the public to \u201cfight with me\u201d on the issue in an interview on French radio, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for these companies to pay the taxes that they owe.\u201dThe tax, Mr. Le Maire said, would most likely cover not only the companies\u2019 direct sales in France, but also revenue from online marketplaces and the resale of private data. He declined to discuss other details, including the means for introducing the tax or the rate of taxation.France\u2019s decision to go its own way for now did not appear to derail the European Commission\u2019s proposal.A commission spokesman noted in a statement that \u201cabout a dozen E.U. countries already have or are considering a form of taxation of digital activities.\u201dThose countries include Britain, where officials recently unveiled a proposal to impose a 2 percent tax on revenue that social media platforms, search engines and online marketplaces earn there. Spain is introducing its own 3 percent tax on online advertising services, brokering services and the resale of personal data.But, the commission spokesman noted, \u201cthe announcement by France does make it even more urgent for the E.U. to agree on a common digital services tax.\u201dMr. Le Maire said he still hoped that a union-wide agreement could be reached by March.Amazon, Apple and Twitter declined to comment. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment, although the director general of Google France told reporters this month, \u201cGoogle will pay if a tax on revenue is put in place\u201d in France or in the European Union.Large technology companies have long avoided paying taxes comparable to other businesses in the European countries where they operate.Facebook, for instance, paid corporate taxes of \u20ac1.9 million in 2017 in France on stated revenue of \u20ac55.9 million. The company has more than 34 million users in the country, and much of its revenue was logged in Ireland. Apple paid around \u20ac19 million in 2017 taxes in France.Amazon, too, does business across the union, but has benefited by having its regional headquarters in the low-tax haven of Luxembourg. The European Commission estimates that the online retailer and other companies pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the roughly 23 percent paid by traditional businesses.The big companies are not alone in opposing the commission\u2019s digital tax proposal. European start-ups have said it would handicap an expanding tech sector in the region that has struggled to match the scale of markets in the United States and China.France and Germany responded to such concerns by narrowing the proposal to include only larger technology companies, particularly advertising-focused companies like Facebook and Google. Those changes have not mollified everyone.France\u2019s imposition of a digital tax is one front in a wider campaign in Europe to target American technology companies amid growing concerns about their power and influence in society as well as their business practices.Germany has enacted a law requiring Facebook and Twitter to remove flagged hate speech within 24 hours or face fines. France has passed rules allowing judges to order the removal of misinformation around elections.Regulators at the European Commission have also targeted Google, Apple and Amazon for antitrust violations, imposing billions of euros in fines and orders to return unpaid taxes.The French government sued Google this year for \u20ac1.12 billion in taxes it claims the company avoided paying on advertising revenue earned. A Paris court ruled that the government could not collect because Google had declared that the revenue belonged to an Irish subsidiary. The government is appealing.Amazon reached a settlement in May over a long-running dispute with French tax authorities, who had been seeking nearly \u20ac200 million euros in back taxes, interest and penalties for the 2006 to 2010 fiscal years in relation to \u201cthe allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions.\u201d The government did not disclose the size of the settlement.And last year, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Adam Satariano contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Governor\u2019s Handling of Sexual Assault Claims", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRENTON \u2014 A top official in the administration of Gov. Philip D. Murphy described in wrenching testimony on Tuesday the lack of urgency among aides to the governor after she accused a member of Mr. Murphy\u2019s campaign of sexual assault.The emotional narrative marked the first day of legislative hearings into how Mr. Murphy\u2019s administration has handled a case that threatens to thwart his ambitious agenda and cast a stain over his progressive image.The official, Katie Brennan, spoke slowly and sternly as she detailed her allegations against Albert J. Alvarez, whom she accused of sexually assaulting her after a campaign event last year, and described how the administration ignored her repeated pleas and continued to employ Mr. Alvarez as a top administration official.\u201cI had access to people in the highest positions of power in the state of New Jersey, and at each turn, my pleas for help went unanswered,\u201d Ms. Brennan said in her opening statement.\u201cSomehow, it wasn\u2019t a priority to address my sexual assault,\u2019\u2019 she continued, \u201cuntil it impacted them.\u201dIt was Ms. Brennan\u2019s first public comments since her allegations were revealed in October, rattling the state and jeopardizing Mr. Murphy\u2019s ambitious goals for his first year in office, which include legalizing recreational marijuana and raising the minimum wage.Ms. Brennan\u2019s painful testimony and the seeming inaction by some of Mr. Murphy\u2019s closest aides could also wound the governor\u2019s reputation as a champion for women and undermine his emergence as a national Democratic leader.Mr. Alvarez, who did not speak at the hearing in Trenton, has denied the allegation. After the governor\u2019s election, Mr. Alvarez went on to hold a top position in Mr. Murphy\u2019s administration before resigning in October.After Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Murphy said little about Ms. Brennan\u2019s testimony, including how his administration had responded to her accusations. Instead, in a statement, he praised her for the \u201cleadership she showed in telling her story\u201d and cited new state guidelines regarding sexual harassment and assault.\u201cShe is right: no one should have to go through an ordeal to have their voices heard,\u201d he said.Ms. Brennan described on Tuesday how she repeatedly brought her account to top members of Mr. Murphy\u2019s inner circle.Ms. Brennan said that within days of being assaulted by Mr. Alvarez in her Jersey City apartment she met with Justin Braz, a friend who worked in state government and ended up working for Mr. Murphy\u2019s campaign, and told him what had happened, though she did not ask him to inform others until Mr. Murphy\u2019s transition.She also went to the Jersey City police to report the assault, underwent a rape examination at a hospital and went to the Hudson County prosecutors office to press charges.Despite seeing Mr. Alvarez continue to work for the Murphy campaign and later on the transition team, she decided to take a job in the Murphy administration because she was determined not to let the assault impact her career.\u201cAs a victim of sex assault, I should not be the one to give up my career goals in favor of the career goals of my rapist,\u201d said Ms. Brennan, who is chief of staff to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.She recalled every instance that she crossed paths with Mr. Alvarez \u2014 at meetings, at a campaign rally with Mr. Murphy and President Obama, at a debate, at the governor\u2019s inaugural ball.The Hudson County prosecutor\u2019s office eventually decided not to press charges against Mr. Alvarez.Ms. Brennan cited news reports that top members of Mr. Murphy\u2019s administration, including Pete Cammarano, who went on to become the governor\u2019s chief of staff, knew that one of their top aides had been accused of sexual assault, even though they did not know who the victim was.\u201cJust the knowledge that there was an accusation of sexual assault by one transition team member against one of the transition team\u2019s senior staffers should have been enough to trigger action,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cYet still, nothing.\u201dIn March, Ms. Brennan reached out to Matt Platkin, Mr. Murphy\u2019s chief counsel, to tell him about the assault. She said he was \u201chorrified\u201d and \u201cdisgusted\u201d and said that he would refer the matter to the attorney general.A month after her meeting with Mr. Platkin, Ms. Brennan was contacted by Heather Taylor, the chief ethics officer for the state, who said that no action could be taken because, at the time of the episode, neither Ms. Brennan nor Mr. Alvarez were state employees.So Ms. Brennan said she reached out directly to Mr. Murphy.\u201cI thought that if any administration could make progressive reforms, it would be this one,\u201d she said. \u201cSo on the evening of Friday, June 1, I emailed the governor and first lady, Tammy Murphy.\u201dIn her email, she said she wanted to discuss a \u201csensitive matter,\u201d but did not provide any specifics. But Mr. Murphy responded within the hour, writing, \u201cWe know you well,\u201d and \u201cHang in. We\u2019re on it.\u201dMs. Brennan never heard from the governor again regarding her email. Instead, Jonathan S. Berkon, a lawyer in private practice who had served as campaign counsel, reached out to Ms. Brennan.In her brief conversation with Mr. Berkon, Ms. Brennan never mentioned her allegations or Mr. Alvarez\u2019s name. But the campaign counsel told her that Mr. Alvarez would be leaving the administration and state employment.Yet two months later, in September, Ms. Brennan realized that Mr. Alvarez was still working for the state. That is when she took her allegations to The Wall Street Journal. Only then did she see any action from the administration, she said.\u201cWe can believe survivors,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cWe can stop \u2018he said, she said\u2019 from always becoming \u2018he said.\u2019 We can improve the justice system.\u201dMs. Brennan was the only witness on Tuesday. Loretta Weinberg, the state senator who is co-chairwoman of the select committee holding the hearings, said she still had questions about the timeline of events, the apparent communication breakdowns in the governor\u2019s office and the role of the Hudson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office in the case.\u201cI would like to know why the case was declined,\u201d Ms. Weinberg said, adding that the hearing would resume on Dec. 18.Ms. Weinberg\u2019s committee has subpoena power to compel witnesses. She said she would meet with other lawmakers before deciding the next witnesses but would not rule out calling Mr. Murphy or members of his administration.Near the end of the more than five hours of testimony, Michael Critchley, a lawyer serving as counsel to the select committee, asked Ms. Brennan who else the committee should call to testify.\u201cEverybody that I\u2019ve mentioned today,\u201d Ms. Brennan replied.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe soils are hospitable, the climate is ripe, the vineyards are expanding and the wines keep getting better. English sparklers are a novelty no more. His ambition was to make wine, which in the 1990s meant leaving England. By age 17, he was apprenticing in France, and soon was working two harvests a year, in France and in Australia.He eventually married, bought a vineyard in C\u00f4tes de Castillon (a lesser Bordeaux region) and set about growing merlot and cabernet franc, and trying to sell the wine.In early 2010, they found a parcel with chalk-and-gravel soil on a south-facing slope in Marlow, a London bedroom community in the Thames Valley, near where Mr. Laithwaite had grown up.They snapped it up, and by May 2010, the Laithwaites had planted the first piece of what is now 16 acres of chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier \u2014 the trio of grapes used for almost all Champagnes and English sparkling wines. In 2016, the Laithwaites released their first wine, a lovely 2013 sparkling ros\u00e9.The notion of English sparkling wine surprises many Americans, who still hold the notion of Britain as a culinary wasteland, with lukewarm ale the only beverage.Yet London for a generation has been one of the world\u2019s most exciting restaurant cities. And England, now in its third decade as a sparkling wine producer, is demonstrating that its bubbly output can be superb.What marks these sparkling wines as distinctively English is both a spirited, glowing acidity and an orchard-fruit freshness. When all is kept in balance, the wines can be delightful. If the acidity dominates, the wines can be astringent and rustic in an unpleasant way.Nyetimber planted the first major vineyard in Sussex specifically for sparkling wine in 1988. Long-established producers here have had an opportunity to see which grapes work best where, and to fine-tune both their viticulture and their winemaking.The 2009 was silky, creamy and fine, with great depth, length and restraint, while the 2010 Ros\u00e9, with aromas and flavors of red fruit and herbs, was long, deep and harmonious. I thought they were the best English sparkling wines I had ever tasted, but they were soon joined by others.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how good English sparkling wine can be,\u201d said Josh Donaghay-Spire, Chapel Down\u2019s head winemaker. \u201cIf we\u2019re not pushing, then what\u2019s the point? This is the birth of a viticultural region, right now. The pace of change is so rapid because everything is new.\u201dChapel Down, which makes crowd-pleasing nonvintage sparklers, has also demonstrated how expressive and beautiful its top wines can be. A 2013 Kit\u2019s Coty Vineyard blanc de blancs, from chalk soils in the North Downs of Kent, was elegant and linear, with creamy mineral flavors.The 2013 Coeur de Cuv\u00e9e is a tiny selection from the Kit\u2019s Coty Vineyard that, unlike the blanc de blancs, was entirely barrel-fermented with indigenous yeast. It was complex, pure, savory and superb.\u201cThe influx of capital and professional expertise has been a step up from untrained eccentrics,\u201d said Simon Robinson, the proprietor of Hattingley Valley, who saw winemaking as a way of diversifying his family\u2019s agricultural business.The growth in English sparkling wine is apparent all over the south of England. From Kent in the east through East and West Sussex, Hampshire, Dorset and as far west as Cornwall, new vineyards for sparkling wine are being planted at a dizzying rate. Winemakers who once imagined they were bound for France or Australia are instead staying home in England to make sparkling wine.Since 2010, the vineyard area for the three main sparkling wine grapes has more than tripled, rising to about 4,490 acres in 2017 from about 1,360 in 2010, according to Wines of Great Britain, a trade group.Most of the new vineyards are far bigger than the Laithwaites\u2019s and much better financed. Mark Driver was an investment manager and his wife, Sarah, a solicitor, when they caught the wine bug in the early 21st century. After tasting some English sparkling wines in 2009, they bought almost 600 acres in the South Downs of Sussex near Polegate, just three miles from the English Channel.Nyetimber had about 250 acres of vineyard in 2011. By 2018, it had about 420 acres, and another 210 will become productive in 2020.Nobody would mistake an English vineyard for one in Champagne. Walking through Gusbourne\u2019s Boot Hill Vineyard with the winemaker Charlie Holland on a blustery, misty fall day, I noted that the rows of vines were far wider than one would find in Champagne, and the vines trained higher on their trellises.In order to achieve ripeness in the colder English climate, the vines need to be planted less densely than in France, Mr. Holland said, to minimize the competition. And the vines need to have a denser canopy of leaves to promote photosynthesis, so the rows have to be wider apart so the leaves in one row won\u2019t shade the fruit in another.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same parameters as in Champagne, and not the same ripeness levels,\u201d Mr. Holland said.Indeed, the Champagne region was once considered a marginal climate, on the blurry edge of the line at which grapes could reliably ripen. Thirty years ago, it was a struggle. Now, with climate change, the issue is whether Champagne is getting too warm.The edge has now moved up to the south of England, where everybody agrees that the 2018 vintage was the biggest and best ever for sparkling wine.Yet 2016 and \u201917 were both lean harvests. Late spring frosts after early bud breaks kept yields low. Still, the years were not as bad as 2012, when the weather was so wretched virtually no wine was made at all.Even so, the best English producers seem to have a ready market for their wine, whether it\u2019s people looking for alternatives to Champagne or Prosecco, which is hugely popular in England, or those simply driven by curiosity.For the Laithwaites of Harrow & Hope, whose do-it-yourself, small-production setup is as different from the big English names as Champagne\u2019s grower-producers are from the big houses, selling their English wine has not been nearly as challenging as it was to sell Bordeaux.English sparkling wines are not yet widely distributed in the United States, but each year more are available and in greater numbers. Here are 10 to seek out, in alphabetical order.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wisconsin Republicans Defiantly Move to Limit the Power of Incoming Democrats", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADISON, Wis. \u2014 When Wisconsin Republicans pushed through a sweeping set of bills Wednesday to limit the power of the state\u2019s newly elected Democrats, it was another hardball maneuver by a man who has played a key role in driving the state sharply to the right.In the days after the Republican governor\u2019s stunning loss last month \u2014 the end of eight years of one-party control of the state\u2019s government \u2014 Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the Assembly, was defiant.This week, during an extraordinary special legislative session, Republicans managed to do it. After hours of mysterious closed-door meetings that went past midnight, the Wisconsin Senate convened at 4:30 on Wednesday morning and passed by one vote a package of bills devised to curb the powers of the incoming Democratic leaders. The State Assembly followed suit by a much larger margin later in the morning.The legislation was aimed at undermining Democrats. There would be a new limit on early voting, which tends to benefit Democratic candidates, after an election that saw record-breaking turnout. Lawmakers, not the governor, would control the majority of appointments on an economic development board. The legislation would also prevent Mr. Evers from banning guns in the Wisconsin Capitol without permission from legislators.The bills would also require Mr. Evers to get permission from lawmakers to seek adjustments on programs run jointly by federal and state governments, such as public benefit programs. The legislation would block Mr. Evers\u2019s ability to withdraw the state from a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, a major campaign promise.But the legislative package was so sprawling and rushed that many Democrats were still trying to assess the damage.\u201cWisconsin has never seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. Evers said in a statement. \u201cWisconsin values of decency, kindness, and finding common ground were pushed aside so a handful of people could desperately usurp and cling to power while hidden away from the very people they represent.\u201dFor eight years, Mr. Vos has been an important ally to Mr. Walker as Wisconsin Republicans have carried out a series of uncompromising moves that stunned Democrats, sent protesters flooding into the Capitol and left lawmakers dazed in marathon hearings.\u201cThis all started a long time ago and it\u2019s more of the same,\u201d said Martha Laning, the chairwoman of the state\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cThis is what their leadership has been, but this time it\u2019s more than just Democrats who are appalled by the level of this. This is as brazen as it gets, to do this after an election you don\u2019t like.\u201dIn recent days, Mr. Vos, 50, became the most visible, most fervent spokesman for the package of measures that would limit Mr. Evers\u2019s power and strengthen that of lawmakers. Many of the bills introduced last week were proposed by a committee chaired by Mr. Vos, who is in his seventh term in the Assembly and became speaker in 2013 after serving as chairman of a powerful joint finance committee.Mr. Vos, a former Racine County supervisor who has owned a popcorn packaging company, has a reputation in Madison as being a bulldog legislator who is effective at keeping party members in line.The package of bills passed Wednesday take aim at the powers of not just the governor, but those of the newly elected Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul. Under the legislation, the attorney general would need lawmakers\u2019 approval to settle certain suits, and legislative leaders would be permitted to intervene and hire their own lawyers \u2014 in addition to the attorney general \u2014 if the constitutionality of a law was being challenged. The attorney general could no longer appoint a solicitor general to represent the state in major lawsuits, and would be restricted in how he spent settlement money, which lawmakers would now oversee.Senators also confirmed 82 last-minute appointees of Mr. Walker\u2019s despite the protestations of legislative Democrats, who said the candidates had not been thoroughly vetted, and of Mr. Evers, who asked that the posts remain vacant until he takes office in January. The posts ranged from the obscure, like the pharmacy examining board, to the high-profile and vital, such as the university board of regents.During news conferences and on the floor of the Assembly this week, Mr. Vos defended the legislation as a necessary check on executive power and brushed aside claims of an undemocratic power grab. \u201cWhat it does is make sure we have an equal amount of power at the table,\u201d Mr. Vos said.His tone was brusque at times, accusing the Democrats of fanning hysteria and overstating the effects of the bills.\u201cYou are so grossly exaggerating the words of this bill it makes me sick,\u201d Mr. Vos said.Other times, Mr. Vos sounded more conciliatory. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think that what Governor Evers ran on is evil. I think that he loves Wisconsin,\u201d Mr. Vos said shortly before the final vote Wednesday. \u201cNo one here doesn\u2019t respect the state. We have different paths to get to the same destination.\u201dBut Gordon Hintz, the Democratic leader in the Assembly, said the legislation undermined the power of democratically elected officials.\u201cWe\u2019re here because you don\u2019t trust Tony Evers and you don\u2019t want to give up power,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re sore losers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You May Need to Withdraw Money From a Retirement Account", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserYou may be thinking about holiday gifts and New Year\u2019s resolutions. But if you\u2019re old enough and you\u2019ve been saving for retirement, it\u2019s also time to confirm that you\u2019ve withdrawn money from certain accounts, as required by the Internal Revenue Service.That\u2019s right: After encouraging you to stash money away for years, the government mandates that people start taking out cash at age 70\u00bd \u2014 gradually. (The requirement allows the government to finally tax the money, which had been growing tax deferred to encourage saving for retirement.)In general, the rule applies to traditional individual retirement accounts and most other I.R.A.s, as well as employer-based retirement accounts like 401(k)\u2019s \u2014 although, as with anything I.R.S.-related, there are lots of asterisks. Roth I.R.A.s, for example, aren\u2019t subject to R.M.D.s (unless you inherit one), because contributions are made with after-tax money.The I.R.S. allows extra time for savers to take their first distribution. So people turning 70\u00bd in 2018 can wait until April 1, 2019. But they must still take a second distribution, by Dec. 31 of next year, for 2019 \u2014 and take R.M.D.s annually after that, said Molly Stanifer, a financial adviser at Old Peak Finance in Chapel Hill, N.C.It can sound confusing, but it pays to get it right, said Kacie Swartz, senior financial adviser at Stone Asset Management in Austin, Tex. Investors who fail to take an R.M.D. may face a steep penalty, equal to half the amount they didn\u2019t withdraw. So if you were required to take out $10,000 but withdrew nothing, you could owe a penalty of $5,000.Fidelity Investments said that as of late October, about half the company\u2019s R.M.D.-eligible I.R.A. customers had not taken out any money toward their 2018 distribution.That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean, however, that they are forgetting to do so, said Joe Gaynor, director of retirement and income solutions at Fidelity. I.R.S. rules allow people with multiple I.R.A.s to calculate their minimum withdrawal on their total balance across the accounts, but then take a distribution from just one account (or split it across several). So it could be that people are taking money out of accounts held elsewhere, he said.Here are some questions and answers about R.M.D.s:Do I have to take an R.M.D. if I am still working?Under I.R.S. rules, you must take distributions from I.R.A.s (except Roths) after you turn 70\u00bd, even if you\u2019re still working.You may not have to take a distribution from a 401(k) held at your current employer, however, until after you retire. (If you have a separate 401(k) from a previous employer, you will have to take a distribution from that account.) It\u2019s best to check with your employer or tax adviser on the details, advisers say, since rules can vary by company.Is there a way to avoid a penalty if I forget to take an R.M.D.?You may avoid paying a penalty by taking the required distribution and filing a form with the I.R.S. explaining what happened, Warren Ward, a financial planner in Columbus, Ind., said. The I.R.S. generally seeks a \u201creasonable\u201d cause for the delay, he said \u2014 perhaps the stress of an illness or the discovery of a forgotten account after a death in the family.Still, he said, it\u2019s best to avoid the situation in the first place by taking the distribution on time. Most I.R.A. custodians will calculate the required amount for you, and you can often choose to have the money automatically deducted on a specific date so you don\u2019t have to worry about missing the deadline.What if I don\u2019t need the R.M.D. for living expenses?If you\u2019re fortunate enough to not need the money right away, you can simply save it, or reinvest it in a taxable brokerage account.\u201cYou\u2019re required to take it out,\u201d Ms. Stanifer said. \u201cYou\u2019re not required to spend it.\u201d(If taxpayers wanted to make a so-called \u201cqualified charitable distribution\u201d from an employer-based plan, like a 401(k), they would need to first roll over the account to an I.R.A., tax experts say.)An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the tax benefits of qualified charitable distributions. The distributions are excluded from taxable income, but taxpayers cannot also take a deduction for the same gift on their tax return.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Presidency or Prison", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat happens if re-election is Trump's best hope of avoiding an indictment?Opinion ColumnistDonald Trump \u2014 or, as he\u2019s known to federal prosecutors, Individual-1 \u2014 might well be a criminal. That\u2019s no longer just my opinion, or that of Democratic activists. It is the finding of Trump\u2019s own Justice Department.Trump\u2019s potential criminality in this case, which raises questions about his legitimacy as president, creates a dilemma for Democrats. Assuming prosecutors are right about Trump\u2019s conduct, it certainly seems impeachable; a situation in which a candidate cheats his way into the presidency is one the founders foresaw when they were designing the impeachment process. As George Mason argued at the Constitutional Convention, \u201cShall the man who has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his guilt?\u201dBut in our current moment, removing the president through impeachment is essentially impossible, given that at least 20 Senate Republicans would have to join Democrats. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who will soon lead the House Judiciary Committee, told me he wouldn\u2019t consider impeachment proceedings without at least some Republican support. There is certainly no appetite among congressional Democrats to pursue impeachment over a campaign finance case, particularly while the special counsel investigation into Russian collusion chugs on.This leaves us in a dangerous situation. Under Justice Department guidelines, sitting presidents can\u2019t be indicted. Ex-presidents, however, can. Experts on both the left and the right believe that if Trump is voted out of office in 2020, before the five-year statute of limitations on campaign finance violations runs out, he could find himself in serious legal jeopardy. The 2020 presidential election was always going to be extraordinarily ugly, but one can only imagine what Trump will do if the alternative to the White House is the big house. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Swalwell, who worries that Trump could become even more erratic, making decisions to save himself that involve \u201cour troops or internal domestic security.\u201dOrdinarily, you know that a democracy is failing when electoral losers are threatened with prison. But Trump\u2019s lawlessness is so blatant that impunity \u2014 say, a pardon, or a politically motivated decision not to prosecute \u2014 would also be deeply corrosive, unless it was offered in return for his resignation.There are ways to lower the stakes somewhat. Nadler told me he plans to introduce legislation that would freeze the statute of limitations for crimes committed by presidents, so they could be charged when their terms end. Such a law would at least mean that Trump couldn\u2019t evade justice forever just by winning re-election.That would mitigate the peril to our democracy, but it wouldn\u2019t come close to eliminating it. Our best hope may lie in the emergence of irrefutable evidence of further presidential crimes, enough to finally test the tolerance of at least some fraction of Republicans. \u201cThe story\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and former constitutional law professor, told me. \u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning of it. After two years of hearing people say we were all trigger-happy on impeachment, now I\u2019m hearing we\u2019re all constitutional fraidy-cats. Give us a chance to do the fact investigation and figure out what happened.\u201d Fair enough. But if the president has committed felonies, we also have to figure out how Republicans might be induced to care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netanyahu\u2019s Obsession With Image Could Be His Downfall", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews analysisJERUSALEM \u2014 In a fiery Hanukkah speech to his fellow Likud party stalwarts a year ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the Israeli left for the corruption investigations engulfing him, saying that because his opponents couldn\u2019t defeat him at the ballot box, \u201cthey tried to beat us with slander.\u201dHe is still playing the victim. But if his legal troubles spell the end of his storied career \u2014 and no one is writing him off yet \u2014 the evidence uncovered by the police suggests that Mr. Netanyahu will have only himself to blame.For a decade now, Mr. Netanyahu has led Israel like no other leader since the nation\u2019s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, personifying and championing the country on the world stage, dominating Israelis\u2019 self-perception, eclipsing and marginalizing opponents and right-wing rivals alike, and steadily remaking its politics in his image.Yet throughout his political life, his detractors have discerned in Mr. Netanyahu an unseemly obsession with his public image, even for a politician. And his present troubles arose out of what amounted to his most audacious attempt to gain control over that image: a long-term offensive on the news media itself.\u201cHe\u2019s so obsessed with his reputation that it\u2019s actually threatening his rule,\u201d Mr. Shadur said.The drama began in 2007 with the launch of Israel Hayom, a free daily newspaper financed by the American casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a devoted supporter of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s. It was mocked as \u201cBibiton,\u201d a portmanteau of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s nickname, Bibi, and the Hebrew word for newspaper. But its wide readership and cheap advertising rates quickly weakened rival papers.It was so slavish a promoter of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s interests that by 2014, a majority of Israeli lawmakers \u2014 including key members of his governing coalition \u2014 backed legislation that would have forced Israel Hayom to charge its readers at least half the price of its cheapest competitor.Mr. Netanyahu broke up his government rather than let that bill become law, he later asserted. But in forming a new, more staunchly right-wing, coalition after his 2015 re-election, he insisted that he be given direct control over the Communications Ministry, Israel\u2019s version of the Federal Communications Commission.He immediately fired the ministry\u2019s director-general and installed a trusted aide, Shlomo Filber, to do his bidding. And he sought to expand the number of television networks in Israel, ostensibly to promote competition and the marketplace of ideas. But in a country of only nine million people, critics observed, that would also have the effect of slicing up an already tiny advertising pie, weakening the television newsrooms that routinely gave him fits.That deal was never consummated, but another one was, the police say: Not long after taking control of the Communications Ministry, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Filber rammed through, over lower-level officials\u2019 objections, approval for a merger of the country\u2019s biggest telecom and a satellite television network called Yes. The merger was enormously lucrative to the companies\u2019 controlling shareholder, Shaul Elovitch.In return, according to the police and the website\u2019s journalists, Mr. Netanyahu would receive fawning coverage on Mr. Elovitch\u2019s news site, Walla. From that point on, Walla killed embarrassing news articles and splashed flattering photographs of his wife across articles about her that held little news value.Mr. Filber is now a prosecution witness, as is Nir Hefetz, the public-relations adviser who is said to have relayed Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s demands to Walla\u2019s editors. Ari Harow, the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff, recorded Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s phone calls with the publisher of Yediot Ahronot, which later ended up in investigators\u2019 hands.But Mr. Netanyahu, a consummate political survivor, is not going anywhere just yet. It is up to his attorney general, whom he appointed, to decide whether to indict him on any of the three cases brought by the police. That decision could take months.And despite the scandals, he remains in a strong spot politically.For one thing, his would-be successors mostly look small by comparison. The left and centrist parties keep trying to recruit former generals \u2014 the latest is Benny Gantz, a former military chief of staff \u2014 to help them look tough enough on national security to match Netanyahu\u2019s standing on his trademark issue.For another, Mr. Netanyahu remains enormously popular with his political base, a powerful obstacle, if not a deterrent, to prosecutors in a country where a sitting prime minister has never been indicted, said Nahum Barnea, the veteran columnist for Yediot Ahronot. Mr. Barnea recalled that when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was the target of a criminal investigation, \u201che was so unpopular, it was almost a remedy for the people that they found evidence against him.\u201cHere, you have a strong prime minister,\u201d Mr. Barnea said. \u201cHe\u2019s either supported by or accepted as a fact of life for so many people, they\u2019re not enthusiastic to see him fall.\u201dMr. Netanyahu also possesses unmatched political agility.\u201cHe looks now like the only person whose head fits the crown,\u201d Mr. Barnea said.So unless he is indicted and convicted, his coalition falters or he chooses to step down, he will remain in office at least until an election sometime next year, and even then defeating him would be a tall order.That said, one of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s greatest gifts, and most successful political strategies, may be portraying himself as a victim. He used it to win leadership of Likud in 1993, when he went public with a bizarre and never proven claim that he was being blackmailed with a supposed sex tape from an extramarital affair.He used it to defend himself when the left accused him of having incited the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. \u201cIt was perceived as the whole right wing was being attacked,\u201d said Mr. Shadur, the filmmaker.Israelis love a good victim, and his base, in particular, nursed ethnic and class resentments that Mr. Netanyahu has stirred adroitly and consistently over the years. Long before working-class whites fell in behind President Trump, anti-elitist voters outside Israel\u2019s big cities were cheering Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s hard line against the Oslo peace process and his visceral campaign slogans like \u201cBibi is good for the Jews.\u201dIt worked again in 2015, when Mr. Netanyahu came from behind to win re-election by warning conservative Jewish voters that Arabs are coming to the polls in droves.The question now is whether it will work again if Mr. Netanyahu is charged with bribery and the accusers are his own former right-hand men, the prosecution is led by an attorney general he appointed, and the evidence against him is the work of a right-wing former police chief whom Mr. Netanyahu also named to the job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s Fixer, Confessed to It All", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf all of President Trump\u2019s former associates who have come under scrutiny in the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation, his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has undertaken perhaps the most surprising and risky legal strategy.Mr. Cohen has twice pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to a litany of crimes, and he has volunteered information to the special counsel and other agencies investigating Mr. Trump and his inner circle. He did all this without first obtaining a traditional, ironclad deal under which the government would commit to seeking leniency on Mr. Cohen\u2019s behalf when he is sentenced on Dec. 12.Mr. Cohen has concluded that his life has been utterly destroyed by his relationship with Mr. Trump and his own actions, and to begin anew he needed to speed up the legal process by quickly confessing his crimes and serving any sentence he receives, according to his friends and associates, and analysis of documents in the case.He has told friends that he is mystified that he is taking the fall for actions he carried out on behalf of Mr. Trump, who remains unscathed. Still, he is resigned to accepting responsibility.\u201cHe realizes that he needs to move on with his life, and that he\u2019d like to begin that process as soon as possible,\u201d said Andrew W. Albstein, a lawyer and friend who wrote a letter of support on Mr. Cohen\u2019s behalf to the judge.He has not explained his legal approach since he first pleaded guilty in August. But his lawyers, in a sentencing memorandum filed late Friday night, offered the fullest explanation yet for Mr. Cohen\u2019s motivation in switching sides and joining the government team, as prosecutors like to say.Though he has talked extensively with prosecutors, it remains unclear if Mr. Cohen possesses any information that could harm the president legally.Mr. Cohen\u2019s approach drew a stinging reaction from Mr. Trump, who tweeted angrily on Monday that Mr. Cohen had \u201clied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.\u201dMr. Cohen served as Mr. Trump\u2019s loyal ally and go-to lawyer for more than a decade, handling everything from real estate negotiations to hush money payments. He has been trapped at the center of a confusing legal web, involving two separate federal investigations, headed by different prosecutors, delving into different matters.Investigators have dug into virtually everything, including the way Mr. Cohen ran his taxi business, how he bought the silence of two women claiming affairs with Mr. Trump and whether he had information about possible contact between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian operatives during the 2016 election.\u201cTo be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son and this country \u2014 this country \u2014 have my first loyalty,\u201d Mr. Stephanopoulos quoted Mr. Cohen saying.Just over a month later, on Aug. 21, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in Manhattan to eight felonies \u2014 including campaign finance violations, tax evasion and making false statements to a bank \u2014 before Judge William H. Pauley III. The federal sentencing guidelines call for about four to five years on those charges, which were brought by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, known as the Southern District.Surprisingly, Mr. Cohen entered his plea without a traditional cooperation deal in which the Southern District would write to the judge and seek leniency when he was finally sentenced.Cooperating witnesses are often not sentenced until investigations are completed, months or even years later. Mr. Cohen was concerned that signing a deal would delay his sentencing, his lawyers explained in their filing on Friday.\u201cHe respectfully declined to pursue conventional cooperation so that his sentencing proceeding would go forward as scheduled,\u201d wrote the lawyers, Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester, both former Southern District prosecutors.They said that he expected to continue to cooperate. Ever since the F.B.I.\u2019s highly publicized raids in April, the lawyers wrote, \u201cnearly every professional and commercial relationship that he enjoyed, and a number of longstanding friendships, have vanished.\u201d\u201cThus, the necessity, at age 52, to begin his life virtually anew, including developing new means to support his family, convinced Michael to seek an early sentence date, fully understanding that this court will determine the timing under which his efforts to rebuild will commence,\u201d the memorandum said.As one of Mr. Trump\u2019s confidants, Mr. Cohen was also a target in the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential ties to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers said that their client began meeting with Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors as early as Aug. 7, even before his first guilty plea in New York. He ultimately met with the special counsel\u2019s office seven times through November.Mr. Cohen has also met twice with the Southern District prosecutors in Manhattan, as well as New York\u2019s attorney general and state tax agency officials.For lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen faces a potential sentence of up to six months under the federal guidelines. And although there was no traditional cooperation deal, Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors agreed to bring Mr. Cohen\u2019s assistance to the attention of the sentencing judge.Mr. Mueller agreed to file the false-statements charges in New York, where Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty before a randomly assigned judge, Andrew L. Carter Jr. But Mr. Petrillo then asked that the case be transferred to Judge Pauley \u201cfor purposes of sentencing,\u201d and the government had no objection.Now, as Judge Pauley considers how severe a sentence to impose on Mr. Cohen in both cases, he will be able to weigh Mr. Cohen\u2019s cooperation with the Russia investigation. The Southern District is expected to join with Mr. Mueller in making that presentation, the plea agreement states.Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, called Mr. Cohen\u2019s maneuver \u201can unusual and creative way to get what he wants out of a situation that\u2019s unorthodox.\u201dAnother legal expert, William J. Harrington, a former Southern District corruption prosecutor who is now in private practice, said, \u201cTying it up in a bow gives Cohen the best chance at getting significant credit for his cooperation \u2014 and a good sentence.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe and U.S. Agree on Chinese Threat, but Are Too Busy Feuding to Fight It", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 They are creating defenses to limit Chinese investment, accusing China of seizing technology from foreign companies and warning of Chinese efforts to undermine their political system.It may all sound like a game plan hatched by officials in Washington, but the agenda is straight out of Brussels. While President Trump battles China over the issue of trade, Europe is in the midst of a conflict with Beijing that, in its own way, is just as intense.European leaders have become increasingly alarmed by what they consider China\u2019s aggressive incursions into the continent\u2019s economy, including paying $23 million to expand port facilities in Bulgaria, providing $3.8 billion in financing for a high-speed railroad connecting Hungary and Serbia and acquiring a German robotics company that employs 14,000 people worldwide.\u201cWe want to have a better overview when certain critical infrastructure is targeted by them,\u201d Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told an audience in Brussels last month.European politicians are also frustrated that although they have many of the same concerns as their American counterparts about China, there has been little cooperation or coordination in their strategies. Rather than joining forces to contain China\u2019s economic expansionism, the Trump administration has treated Europe with disdain.\u201cWe had some serious differences in the past,\u201d Marietje Schaake, the vice chairman of the European Parliament\u2019s delegation for relations with the United States, said in an interview. \u201cBut it has become much more confrontational, at the worst possible moment. We need to stand together as defenders of the liberal order.\u201dRepresentatives of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen described plans to expand manufacturing in the United States, which could tamp down Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints that Europe exports far more cars to America than the other way around. His threat to impose tariffs on imported cars receded for the moment, representatives of Volkswagen and Daimler said.Some White House officials, including Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, have consistently argued that friction with Europe is a distraction from the more urgent task of reining in China. And behind the scenes, Ms. Malmstrom said, American, European and Japanese officials are having \u201cquite constructive discussions\u201d about trade with China.But conversations with officials in Brussels make it clear that the relationship between the European Union and the United States has deteriorated significantly since Mr. Trump took office, and they are unsure how or if it can be salvaged.In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that Europe treats American products unfairly, representatives of the European Commission and the United States government have tried to dismantle barriers to trade in industries like pharmaceuticals, medical devices and even shellfish. But several participants in the talks said European and American officials have been completely out of sync, making it difficult to achieve progress.Each side accuses the other of obstructionism. The Americans have expressed frustration with the Europeans\u2019 insistence on assembling a consensus among its 28 member countries before agreeing to anything. White House officials have told the Europeans directly that they believe they are stalling, in hopes of waiting out the Trump administration.Mr. Sondland spoke of missed opportunities for the United States and Europe to join forces against what he described as \u201cChina\u2019s persistent and unfair trade practices,\u201d but there have been examples of cooperation.But the Europeans have accused the White House of repeatedly poisoning the atmosphere with its raw, transactional approach to relations. They were floored when, at the end of May, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Europe, while threatening to impose levies on foreign-made cars and car parts.\u201cThat was a shocking experience, that the U.S. administration is ready to impose tariffs against Europe,\u201d said Jeppe Kofod, a Danish member of the European Parliament who has met several times during the past year with Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, and other American officials.Mr. Kofod said he first realized the depth of the Trump administration\u2019s antagonism toward Europe during a lunch in Washington late last year with Mr. Ross and a delegation from the European Parliament. The meal, in a room at the Library of Congress with a view of the Capitol, began on a cordial note, Mr. Kofod recalled. But then Mr. Ross began attacking what he said were Europe\u2019s unfair trade practices.\u201cWe appealed to him that we should take on China together,\u201d Mr. Kofod said. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, you are as bad as China.\u2019\u201dMr. Ross said he remembered the conversation differently. \u201cWhat I said was that both Europe and China espouse free trade rhetoric but are in reality much more protectionist than the United States,\u201d Mr. Ross said in a statement on Friday.The prospect of auto tariffs brought Europe to the negotiating table, he said. \u201cEurope showed little interest in trade negotiations before that.\u201dIn some ways, China is even more of a threat to Europe than it is to the United States. In America, cheap products from China are blamed for hollowing out the industrial heartland. Europe has been though the same thing. In the tumultuous last decade of financial and debt crises, China\u2019s efforts to expand its economic portfolio and pursue manufacturing around the world left Europe with fewer well-paying, middle-class jobs at home.The European Commission, the union\u2019s administrative arm, has fought a long-running battle to protect its steel industry from subsidized Chinese competitors. Low-price solar cells made in China devastated Germany\u2019s attempts to cultivate a solar-cell industry in the last decade.The financing from China has often been welcome. Chinese investors were willing to put money into distressed companies shunned by others. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group has revived Volvo Cars since buying it from Ford in 2010, and has helped to rejuvenate the region around Gothenburg, Sweden, the port city where Volvo has its headquarters.But European sentiment toward China shifted in 2016 after Midea, a Chinese appliance manufacturer, bought Kuka, a German maker of industrial robots for 4 billion euros, or $4.6 billion.Kuka robots are ubiquitous in car factories around the world, and the company was an example of German technological leadership in a growing industry. Midea\u2019s acquisition of the company caused a political furor because Germans feared the Chinese would gain control of Kuka\u2019s expertise as factories were becoming increasingly automated. But German political leaders had few legal tools to intervene.The decision in Brussels last month to give the European Union more power to block such acquisitions was, in large part, inspired by the Kuka deal and the inability of political leaders to protect sensitive technology.But 16+1 is also seen as an attempt to exploit tensions between wealthier Western European countries and formerly Communist countries like Hungary. Unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the Chinese do not nag Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, about policies that are seen as a threat to democracy. A bank controlled by the Chinese government is financing improvements to the rail line between Belgrade and Budapest.So even if the United States and Europe share many of the same objections to Chinese economic policy, they are far apart on what to do about it. Mr. Trump has used tariffs and threats of tariffs to put pressure on China, and has been unconventional in his approach. Mr. Trump sees international trade as a deal, by him and with him, to be made personally with President Xi Jinping of China.The proposals found an unlikely ally. China was among 11 other countries that backed the reforms. The United States did not. A spokeswoman for the United States mission in Geneva, where the trade organization is based, declined to comment.\u201cThat\u2019s what we try to tell our American friends,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told a small group of reporters at a briefing in Brussels last month, two weeks after returning from talks in Washington. \u201cLet\u2019s work together. When we work together we have a lot of impact.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nomadic New Yorkers Alight on the Upper East Side", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntIn search of less crowded schools and a quicker commute, a family trades Forest Hills for Lenox Hill, and begins their \u2018gutsiest renovation\u2019 yet. In their dozen years together, Kat Tatochenko and Dan Macauley have lived at 14 addresses. Along the way, they acquired a dog and two sons.When it came time to consider schools for Max, now nearly 5, they moved to Forest Hills, Queens, where Ms. Tatochenko had briefly lived as a teenager. She is originally from Moscow, and Mr. Macauley is from England.\u201cWe bought an old house that we brought back to life,\u201d Ms. Tatochenko said of their Queens home. The cost was $1.64 million, and it was their fourth renovation, during which Connor, now almost 2, was born.Often the couple thought, \u201cPerfect, we are not going to need to move,\u201d Mr. Macauley said. But as life changed, so did their housing needs. Historically, \u201cour hold period was two years,\u201d he said.For one thing, they weren\u2019t prepared for the nightmare of the kindergarten application process. At their neighborhood school, the waiting list was 68 children long. \u201cThe other schools in the district told us not to even bother,\u201d Ms. Tatochenko said. By last spring, she added, \u201cI was in a daze. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dBut they were intrepid movers as well as intrepid renovators, and the Upper East Side beckoned. The neighborhood had two key advantages. One was an easy trip to their Manhattan offices. (Both work in finance, and they met at work.) With two children, they were eager to diminish their reliance on finicky subways. So last spring, they listed the Forest Hills house \u2014 all 2,700 square feet, with a basement, garage and yard \u2014 for $2.1 million. It quickly sold for $2.37 million.\u201cThere was something so incredibly comforting in his voice,\u201d Ms. Tatochenko said. \u201cYou can imagine how stressed I was.\u201dThe couple was hoping to find three bedrooms \u2014 for them, the boys and the nanny \u2014 for less than $2 million. They wanted natural light, ample storage and space for \u201ca table to do homework and chill out as a family,\u201d Ms. Tatochenko said. And they needed a dog-friendly building for Lili, whom they adopted while living in Japan.But \u201ca three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side for under $2 million is like a needle in a haystack,\u201d Mr. Salem said. Many apartments they saw were combinations of what had been one-bedrooms and studios in white-brick buildings dating to the early 1960s.In new buildings, prices were high and square footage low. \u201cThey think 1,200 is a good square footage for a three-bedroom, and it drives me nuts,\u201d Ms. Tatochenko said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fit into that with a proper family. I cannot stand clutter, and kids come with clutter, they do naturally.\u201d Size was a problem at the Rio, an amenity-rich condominium, circa 1987, in Lenox Hill, where a three-bedroom came with 1,550 square feet. The couple loved the pool and were indifferent to the wraparound balcony. The price was $1.83 million, with monthly charges of nearly $3,800 \u2014 uncomfortably high for them. It later sold for $1.685 million.In Yorkville, one compelling apartment was in a 1930 co-op building, with a T-shaped layout resulting from a combination of two studios and a one-bedroom. The price was almost $1.6 million. But the maintenance, at more than $4,300 a month, was out of reach. That apartment remains on the market.Seven blocks south, a combined two-bedroom and studio in a 1930 Lenox Hill co-op building had a lot going for it, even if it was on a low floor. This one was $1.995 million, with maintenance of around $2,900. Ms. Tatochenko declared it move-in ready, but Mr. Macauley wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cIt was all kind of the wrong color, dark hues and tones,\u201d he said. The view from two of the bedrooms was the concrete wall of a courtyard. He couldn\u2019t envision the family there. But his wife could. The light wasn\u2019t fantastic, but it was sufficient, and the dark floors could be lightened.While they checked out a few rentals, just in case, Ms. Tatochenko visited the apartment at various times of day to assess the noise, which she worried could wake the boys. She brought the contractor who had done their many renovations over the years.The apartment had been sitting on the market for more than six months. The couple negotiated a lower price, $1.725 million.\u201cThis is not how it normally works with co-ops, but we had their contractor and their architect do drawings and plans, and submitted that before the co-op even approved them,\u201d Mr. Salem said. So construction was ready to start as soon as they closed in early summer.When all was said and done, among other things, they had updated the kitchen, created a closet big enough for a stroller and rerouted the electricity to allow for ceiling fixtures rather than wall sconces. Beneath the new, lighter floors, they added soundproof subflooring, mindful of the habits of their two small children. \u201cThis was the gutsiest renovation that we\u2019ve done,\u201d Ms. Tatochenko said. \u201cBut we are also getting better at it. You build up confidence the more you do it.\u201dThey were glad to sell the Forest Hills house fully furnished, giving them a clean slate in Manhattan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need the five couches we had in the house,\u201d Mr. Macauley said.After a brief stay in temporary quarters while the work was completed, the family moved in two weeks after the school year started. Their 1,700-square-foot home suits their minimalist tendencies. They even have a few things they hadn\u2019t thought of: great water pressure and an engaging building staff. A parent at Max\u2019s new school told them, \u201cYou\u2019re in that building that has really nice doormen.\u201d\u201cWe have buddies, we have play dates, we have birthday parties,\u201d Ms. Tatochenko said. \u201cWe did the right thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As commissioner for irrigation there in the 1840s, Cotton brought water to Andhra\u2019s parched lands, turning them into India\u2019s rice bowl.An engineer in the East India Company\u2019s army, he did this by restoring and expanding an ancient network of dams and canals along India\u2019s great southern rivers: the Kaveri, the Krishna and the Godavari. Motivated by a belief that science would pave the way for rural capitalism, he envisaged a landscape transformed.And so it was.India is not alone in its ambitions. Hungry for energy and threatened by an acute shortage of fresh water, other Asian nations are competing to harness the power of the Himalayan rivers, on which more than half a billion people depend directly for sustenance.Dam building was a global obsession. In the 1950s, the World Bank began financing multipurpose water projects in the developing world that combined irrigation, power generation and flood control; by the end of the 20th century, the bank had lent billions of dollars to dam projects.American engineers roved the world selling their hydraulic expertise. So did their Soviet counterparts, who advised the enormous program of dam construction in Mao\u2019s China. In that era, India and China sought to learn from each other. In 1954, two of India\u2019s leading engineers embarked on a two-month tour of China\u2019s water projects and found that the Chinese were working at a pace, and on a scale, that dwarfed India\u2019s ambitions.Estimates for the number of people displaced by dams in India since 1947 vary from 16 million to 40 million. If these projects were inspired by dreams of equality, India\u2019s large dams have instead entrenched some of the most intractable forms of inequality. Those most likely to be uprooted, and least likely to be compensated for their loss of land and livelihood and the rupture of their bonds of community, are marginalized indigenous communities.The first is geopolitical. Taken together, the Himalayan rivers flow through at least 16 countries. In the absence of coordinated planning, dam building becomes a zero-sum game in which downstream users lose out. India fears the construction of a large dam on the Chinese side of the border would affect the flow of the Brahmaputra; Bangladesh, in turn, would bear the consequences of Indian dams on the same river. The potential for conflict looms.Major river systems originating in the Himalayas, where many countries are racing to build dams.MongoliaUzbekistanExtent of each river system\u2019s watershedKyrgyzstanAmu DaryaTarimTurkmenistanTajikistanYellow RiverChinaAfghan.Bhakra Nangal dam IranTIBETShanghaiYangtseIndusNepalPakistanBramhaputraGangesIrrawaddyDhakaMyanmarIndiaBangladeshMekongSalweenRajahmundry ThailandMongoliaExtent of each river system\u2019s watershedUzbek.Kyrgyz.Amu DaryaTarimTurkmen.Tajik.ChinaYellow RiverAfghan.Bhakra Nangal dam ShanghaiIranTIBETYangtsePakistanNepalBramhaputraIndusGangesDhakaIrrawaddyMyanmarIndiaBangladeshMekongRajahmundry SalweenThailandExtent of each river system\u2019s watershedChinaTarimAmu DaryaYellow RiverYangtseIndusBramhaputraGangesIndiaIrrawaddyMekongSalweenBy The New York Times | Source: The Third PoleThe risks are likely to intensify with climate change as areas of the Himalayas warm faster than many other parts of the world. As the glaciers melt more quickly, the Himalayan rivers are projected initially to swell and then, by midcentury, to experience diminished flow. Ecologists and environmental campaigners charge that the new dam projects have not taken climate change adequately into account in their calculations of river flow, silt loads and energy potential. Dams also threaten to intensify flooding downstream during intense downpours when reservoirs overflow.At stake is not just the siting or approval of this or that dam \u2014 it is a whole worldview. Ramaswamy Iyer, India\u2019s water resources secretary in the 1980s, was once a big supporter of dams, but toward the end of his life he turned skeptical. The fundamental problem he identified was the persistence of a \u201ccolonial\u201d approach to water engineering, going back to the legacy of Arthur Cotton. It had bequeathed to India a Western tradition, to which Iyer had no objection, \u201cbut also the underlying Promethean attitude to nature,\u201d which he viewed with suspicion.There doesn\u2019t need to be a binary choice between local solutions and coordination on a larger scale, especially if that coordination reaches beyond national borders. A spirit of caution, wedded to environmental impact assessments with more teeth, better coordinated between the federal and state levels, would help to avert the most flagrant environmental risks. A more open and democratic discussion of resettlement and compensation is needed to reckon honestly with who bears the costs of these schemes. Even minimal attention to the repair and restoration of existing dams, canals, pipes and power lines will lessen the number of dams needed, because large amounts of generated power, as well as irrigation water, are lost to leakage. Better regulation of groundwater use and a concerted policy of recharging depleted aquifers will do more for water security than large reservoirs.Faced with the prospect of catastrophic climate change, we need to better understand the benefits and dangers of 20th-century ideas about harnessing great rivers before damming even more of them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Misguided Priorities of Our Educational System", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "OpinionWe spend too much money on college students and not enough on everyone else. Supported byMr. Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Consider two high school seniors \u2014 one who exhibits strong academic talent and one who does not. For one, December marks the homestretch of a yearslong effort, intensively supported by his school, to prepare the perfect college application. For the other, December is just another month on the path to, well, whatever might come after graduation. The former will likely proceed steadily toward a bachelor\u2019s degree; the latter is unlikely to finish college if he enrolls at all. To whom does our education system owe what?That second student, to be clear, has done nothing wrong. He probably clawed his way through his town\u2019s standard college-oriented curriculum, though it neither targeted his interests and abilities nor prepared him for work force success. Looking ahead, he faces a labor market in which he may need to work harder than his college-bound counterpart for lower pay, with fewer options and slower advancement. Yet we celebrate the first student and lavish taxpayer funds on his education. To the second student, we offer little beyond a sympathetic \u201cSorry.\u201d Our education system has become one of our nation\u2019s most regressive institutions.One explanation for this bizarre state of affairs, in which society invests heavily in those headed for economic success while ignoring those falling behind, is the widespread belief that everyone can be a college graduate. If that were true, the shove toward the college pipeline might make sense.A second explanation is the widespread belief that a college diploma is a necessary and sufficient \u201cticket to the middle class.\u201d If that were true, even a small chance at escaping the supposedly sad fate of inadequate education is better than ever admitting defeat.Pushing people from the former category to attend college and land in the latter category does them few favors. And remember, that assumes they graduate; people in their position typically will not. Remember also, those are the outcomes before we attempt to create an attractive non-college pathway that they might prefer and that might equip them for success.What might such a pathway look like? For the roughly $100,000 that the public spends to carry many students through high school and college today, we could offer instead two years of traditional high school, a third year that splits time between a sophisticated vocational program and a subsidized internship, two more years split between subsidized work and employer-sponsored training, and a savings account with $25,000, perhaps for future training. Any American could have, at age 20, three years of work experience, an industry credential and earnings in the bank.For student borrowers unlikely to graduate, the current subsidies succeed mainly in luring them toward a substantial investment of time and money that is both high-risk and low-return. If a good alternative existed, they would be well served to take it. Certainly, the choice should remain theirs. But to decide wisely whether college is worth the cost, they need to actually face the cost.People often applaud vocational education in theory, provided it is \u201cfor someone else\u2019s kids.\u201d Those kids are most kids, and a false promise of college success does more harm than good. We owe them our focus and the best pathway that we can construct \u2014 one that carries them as close as possible to the destination their college-bound peers will reach, and sometimes beyond.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Good Call by Albany\u2019s Pay Committee", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLimiting lawmakers\u2019 outside income while substantially raising their pay is a worthy compromise. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.When it comes to Albany, every labored step out of the ethical muck is something to celebrate.The pay committee, born out of a wily measure tucked into the state budget by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers earlier this year, was designed to grant the legislators a hefty raise with no questions asked.Instead, the committee, made up of four well-regarded current and former public servants \u2014 the New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer; the former city comptroller, William Thompson Jr.; the state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli; and the former state comptroller, H. Carl McCall \u2014 acted responsibly.Per the panel\u2019s unanimous decision on Thursday, state lawmakers, by 2021, will see their pay increase to $130,000, from $79,500 now. But since this essentially acknowledges that legislators are doing a full-time job, their income from other sources will be limited to 15 percent of that salary \u2014 $19,500. Stipends will be eliminated for all but the highest-level positions, preventing legislative leaders from handing them out or pulling them back as rewards and punishments. The final details of the committee\u2019s decision are expected to be released in a report on Monday.Mr. Stringer, one of the committee\u2019s members, said the new rules are based on those of Congress, which sets similar limits on outside income. In an ideal world, which is to say, not New York State politics, these changes would go further. The New York City Council set a better example in 2016 when its members took an open vote to raise their own pay and eliminate nearly all forms of outside income and committee stipends. Albany lawmakers wanted a fat pay increase with no strings attached. Some have said the committee has no legal right to attach strings. The members of the pay committee chose to set a higher standard for public service. If the legislators don\u2019t like it, they can reject the reforms, and the raise.An earlier version of this editorial misstated the legal status of form State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos and former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Both have been sentenced to prison on corruption charges, but neither has been imprisoned yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case Against Meritocracy", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn aristocracy that can\u2019t admit it.Opinion ColumnistThis week I briefly trended on Twitter \u2014 a bracing experience for any columnist, because it means that you\u2019ve done your job of provocation a little bit too well.This argument was read by certain readers (and a few social media non-readers) as a paean to white privilege, even a brief for white supremacy. In these misreadings, there was an assumption that to praise, in any way, the elite that predated the modern meritocracy is to reject racial diversity, minority and female advancement, in favor of permanent white rule.That\u2019s not my view. Rather I think ideals of diversity and meritocracy are two different ways of shaping an elite, which can advance together but which are just as often separable, or even in tension with each other.And I would separate them. I think it was a good and necessary thing that the American upper class diversified, and that more African-Americans and Jews and Catholics (like myself) and women now share privileges and powers once reserved for Protestant white men.But I think that same upper class was unwise to abandon an aristocratic self-conception in favor of a meritocratic one. On the evidence we have, the meritocratic ideal ends up being just as undemocratic as the old emphasis on inheritance and tradition, and it forges an elite that has an aristocracy\u2019s vices (privilege, insularity, arrogance) without the sense of duty, self-restraint and noblesse oblige that WASPs at their best displayed.Here it\u2019s important to stress that a WASP was not just any white Protestant or upper-crust American of the pre-1960s past. The term properly refers to a specific kind of American elite, mostly from the Northeast, mostly high-church Protestants, concentrated in a few cities (Boston, Philadelphia, New York, plus some Midwestern and Californian outposts), generally associated with the Republican Party (with occasional defectors like F.D.R.), who dominated a particular set of fields (academia, finance, foreign policy) and shared the code of service and piety and manners that defined the elder Bush\u2019s career.The WASPs were distinct from other white elites \u2014 including the planter class that ruled the South, the regional elites that emerged as the frontier moved westward, the immigrant tycoons who challenged WASP power in the East. Their importance rested, to borrow from a WASP acquaintance\u2019s email this week, on being \u201cprimus inter pares\u201d \u2014 first among equals, with a particular kind of power in a particular set of institutions, and an ability to set a tone for the American upper class that was adopted by other groups when they ascended.And ascend they often did, because the older American system was both hierarchical and permeable, with room for actual merit even without a meritocratic organizing theory.Those advancing groups included non-Anglo-Saxons, and eventually non-Protestants and non-whites. In the middle of the 20th century, you could find elite Catholics who imitated WASPishness \u2014 think of William F. Buckley Jr. or the Kennedys. You could even find WASPish African-Americans: The oldest summer colony for black Americans, and not coincidentally a place where the somewhat WASPy Barack Obama liked to hang out in the summer, sits on the shores of the WASP isle of Martha\u2019s Vineyard.These imitations existed in the shadow of racial apartheid and residual anti-Catholicism. But their example suggested that an aristocratic spirit was transferable to a more diverse elite, that there could be Catholic and African-American and Jewish aristocrats \u2014 like, say, the family that has long stewarded this newspaper \u2014 who could adopt the WASP establishment\u2019s upper-class virtues without the ethnic and religious chauvinism.But then the WASPs themselves decided to dissolve their own aristocracy, and transform their once-Protestant universities into a secular mass-opportunity system \u2014 a more democratic way of education, in which anyone with enough talent could climb the ladder, and personal achievement and technical expertise would be prized above all else.This was meritocracy, the system that we now take for granted. And for several reasons it didn\u2019t work as planned.First, meritocracy segregates talent rather than dispersing it. By plucking the highest achievers from all over the country and encouraging them to cluster together in the same few cities, it robs localities of their potential leaders \u2014 so that instead of an Eastern establishment negotiating with overlapping groups of regional elites (or with working-class or ethnic leaders), you have a mass upper class segregated from demoralized peripheries.Second, the meritocratic elite inevitably tends back toward aristocracy, because any definition of \u201cmerit\u201d you choose will be easier for the children of these self-segregated meritocrats to achieve.But even as it restratifies society, the meritocratic order also insists that everything its high-achievers have is justly earned. \u201cHe was born on third base and thought he hit a triple,\u201d Ann Richards famously quipped of George H.W. Bush; well, the typical meritocrat is born on third base, hustles home, and gets praised as if he just hit a grand slam.This spirit discourages inherited responsibility and cultural stewardship; it brushes away the disciplines of duty; it makes the past seem irrelevant, because everyone is supposed to come from the same nowhere and rule based on technique alone.As a consequence, meritocrats are often educated to be bad leaders, and bad people, in a very specific way \u2014 a way of arrogant intelligence unmoored from historical experience, ambition untempered by self-sacrifice. The way of the \u201cbest and the brightest\u201d at the dawn of the technocratic era and the \u201csmartest guys in the room\u201d decades later, the way of the arsonists of late-2000s Wall Street and the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d culture of Silicon Valley.Diversity, despite what many liberals want to think, does not provide a solution to this problem. A diverse elite may be good in its own right, as a matter of justice and representation. But nothing about being a woman or a minority makes you immune to meritocracy\u2019s ruthless solipsism. Just ask Elizabeth Holmes or the slipping-from-grace Sheryl Sandberg, exceptions to the Silicon Valley boys\u2019 club whose trajectories prove the meritocratic rule.Which is why it\u2019s worth looking backward and forward at the same time as we contemplate what\u2019s wrong with our elite. I don\u2019t want to bring back the WASPs; if I had the magic wand to conjure a different elite, it would be a multiracial, multilingual Catholic aristocracy ruling from Quebec to Chile. (Hey, you asked.)But I do want to raise the possibility that an aristocracy that knows itself to be one might be more clearsighted and effective than an aristocracy that doesn\u2019t, and that the WASPs had at least one clear advantage over their presently-floundering successors: They knew who and what they were.Advertisement"}

The United States regards them as valuable partners in helping rout Islamic State extremists from Syria \u2014 the original purpose of the American military deployment four years ago.Although the American troops in Syria number only about 2,000, they have been a deterrent to an assault on the Kurdish militias by the Turks. The American presence also discouraged Mr. Assad\u2019s forces from sweeping into the area even as they retook major areas elsewhere from anti-government fighters, often with the support of Russia and Iran.With the request for help on Friday, the Kurds invited Mr. Assad into at least some of those areas that he had coveted.Some American officials were taken aback by the Kurdish announcement, voicing frustration and anger to their Kurdish counterparts, according to a senior American official. There was no consultation or coordination, the official said.While the United States understands the Kurdish motivation to open discussions with the Assad government, the official said, the Kurdish position did not necessarily reflect views of Arab members of the Kurdish-Arab coalition fighting the Islamic State in eastern Syria, and said it amounted to a unilateral bargaining gambit.The Kurdish-led militias control about one-quarter of Syria\u2019s territory, including valuable agricultural land and oil reserves in the north and east of the country.Kurdish control is opposed not only by the Turks, but also by the government of Mr. Assad as well as its Russian and Iranian backers, who want the territory to fall back under the control of Damascus.Through their alliance with the United States, Syria\u2019s Kurds gained unprecedented military and political power during the war. As Islamic State fighters were pushed back, the Kurds often filled the political gap left behind, establishing councils to run local affairs.But aware that the United States could eventually withdraw, they also began talks with the Syrian government about reconciling.Abdulkarim Omar, a foreign relations official with the Kurdish-led administration in northeastern Syria, said by phone on Friday that the talks continued and that the only issue that had been agreed upon so far was the Syrian Army deployment near Manbij, after the Americans withdraw.As of mid-December, the Syrian government holds the central and southern parts of the country.TurkeyQamishliManbijHasakaKURDISHControlAleppoIdlibRaqqaRebelControlLatakiaGovernmentControlDeir al-ZourHamaISISControlISISControlHomsPalmyraAlbu KamalSyrialebanonDamascusIraqSweidaDara\u2018aJordanTurkeyManbijHasakaKURDISHControlAleppoIdlibRaqqaRebelControlGovernmentControlDeir al-ZourHamaISISControlISISControlHomsPalmyraAlbu KamallebanonSyriaDamascusIraqJordanTurkeyManbijHasakaKURDISHControlAleppoIdlibRaqqaRebelControlDeir al-ZourGovernmentControlISISControlHamaISISControlHomsPalmyraAlbu KamallebanonSyriaDamascusIraqJordanTurkeyKURDISHControlManbijAleppoRaqqaRebelControlISISControlISISControlGovernmentControllebanonSyriaIraqDamascusJordanBy Sarah Almukhtar | Source: Conflict Monitor by IHS MarkitWhen asked if that agreement had been coordinated with the United States, he said, \u201cYou can ask the Americans.\u201dBut much remains uncertain for the Syrians living in those areas, especially since the two parties to the agreement described it in different ways. The Kurds said that the Syrian Army would take over only border areas to protect against a Turkish attack, but not deploy inside Manbij itself.While none of the other powers fighting in Syria liked the situation, they mostly avoided attacking the area for fear of provoking the United States. Now, with that deterrent set to end, the future of the northeast is up in the air.Those most likely to gain, analysts say, are the Syrian government and its allies, who want to bring the northeast back under the control of Damascus, both for the good of Mr. Assad and for their own interests.Russia would like to see Mr. Assad regain control of Syria\u2019s oil reserves to help finance the country\u2019s reconstruction, while Iran wants to geographically connect forces it supports in Syria and Lebanon with those in Iraq.\u201cAn American withdrawal from Syria is the equivalent of handing Syria on a silver plate to Iran and its militias,\u201d said Muhannad al-Talaa, the commander of an Arab militia near the United States military base at al-Tanf, near the Iraqi border. \u201cIf the U.S. withdraws and we are forced to leave, Iran will have a steady supplies route through Iraq to its militias and Hezbollah in Syria.\u201dA swift American withdrawal could also benefit the remnants of the Islamic State. While the organization has lost nearly all of the territory it once held, experts estimate that it still has thousands of fighters who have returned to their insurgent roots and can still mount attacks.If the local forces fighting the jihadists lose their American battlefield commanders, they would be forced to rely on the small cadre of British and French forces still in Syria, which could cause confusion, experts say.Although President Trump initially lobbied to pull American troops out in 30 days, the Pentagon has pushed for a withdrawal that could take months, citing the danger to American forces if ordered to dismantle their outposts quickly.It is also possible that the Pentagon will allow Kurdish militia fighters to keep at least some of their American-supplied weapons, a United States defense official said, despite assurances to Turkey last year that the armaments would be repossessed when combat operations concluded.But it is unclear how American forces will continue to support their local allies on the ground, although the Pentagon has proposed a number of strategies that include keeping Special Operations troops in Iraq that can launch missions into Syria, something President Trump hinted at during his visit to Iraq Wednesday.That may be necessary, as many doubt the ability of the Syrian government and its allies to see the battle against the Islamic State through to the end.\u201cI don\u2019t think the regime and its militias can handle that issue very well given how much the United States has struggled with it,\u201d said Faysal Itani, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies Syria.The biggest losers in an American withdrawal will be the local forces who found themselves empowered by their partnership with the United States. They included Arab militias that oppose the Syrian government and did not want to live under its rule.\u201cThe Americans stabbed us in the back,\u201d said Mohammed Jabr, a member of the military council in Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria. \u201cThey played with us.\u201dBut topping the list of America\u2019s aggrieved allies in Syria are the Kurdish forces who served as the primary fighting partners against the Islamic State.The Kurds\u2019 alliance with the United States turned them from a marginalized minority into power brokers for a large part of the country. But without the United States, they will find themselves between the Syrian government, which wants them back under the control of Damascus, and Turkey, which wants them destroyed.\u201cI think they really have only one choice, which is to accept what Assad offers, and he is not going to be altruistic,\u201d said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. \u201cHe is going to try to get the Kurds to accept whatever maximalist demands he can offer.\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Karam Shoumali from Berlin and Eric Schmitt and Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Days Later, Mayor Apologizes to Woman Whose Child Was Torn From Her Arms", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio has, since it became well publicized last weekend, mostly kept silent about an episode last week in which law enforcement personnel at a Brooklyn government office ripped a 1-year-old boy from his mother\u2019s arms and arrested her.Other elected officials have vehemently condemned the way the woman, Jazmine Headley, was treated, but Mr. de Blasio made only two brief comments about it on Twitter.On Wednesday, the mayor broke his silence to apologize to Ms. Headley, to criticize the way she was treated and to defend his response to it.\u201cI want to apologize to her on behalf of all 8.6 million New Yorkers,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said during his weekly news conference on Wednesday, at a public housing complex in Bushwick, Brooklyn.He added, \u201cWhat happened to Jazmine Headley and her son Damone should never have happened, should never happen to anybody.\u201dHe said that he first learned of the episode on Sunday evening and then inquired about it to officials at the Police Department and the Human Resources Administration.\u201cI reached out to the commissioners involved for an update on what had happened and why,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThey both told me they were getting facts immediately. Until I got their side of what happened, I could not speak to the public. Once I had it I did.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhat I say has to be definitive.\u201dMs. Headley appeared in court in New Jersey on Wednesday. Brian Neary, her lawyer, said she was accepted into a pretrial intervention program that would require her to do 20 hours of community service and report periodically to the authorities in order to have the charges dismissed.Ms. Headley, 23, had gone to the benefits center to inquire about receiving child care vouchers. She had waited for hours and was sitting on the floor when she apparently got into a dispute with a security guard.Mr. de Blasio first addressed the matter Monday afternoon, when he posted a message on Twitter, calling it disturbing and saying that the Police Department and the Human Resources Administration would \u201cget to the bottom of what happened.\u201dOn Tuesday he posted another Twitter message praising the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office for its decision to drop the charges.But while the mayor stuck to Twitter, other elected officials spoke out publicly. On Tuesday, the City Council Speaker, Corey Johnson, appeared to refer indirectly to the mayor when he said during a rally in support of Ms. Headley on the City Hall steps that \u201cevery leader in this city\u201d had an obligation to speak out about the episode and to call for her release from Rikers Island.Mr. de Blasio, who has showed himself loath in the past to criticize the police, was quick to blame the peace officers, although he said that a review of the episode had not yet been completed and it was not clear what each of the officers had done.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to me that people who have the title \u2018peace officer\u2019 would do this to a woman and her baby,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that by the time the N.Y.P.D. arrived the situation was already out of hand and should not have been.\u201dTwo peace officers have been placed on modified duty.Mr. de Blasio has often refused to apologize for mistakes made by city agencies. But on Wednesday, he tried to empathize with Ms. Headley. He used words such as \u201coutraged\u201d and phrases like \u201cdisgusted as a parent\u201d to describe his feelings.\u201cI\u2019ve been in those benefit centers. I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people in need in this city,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWhatever was happening, there was no reason to get physical. She was not presenting a danger.\u201dThe news conference centered on the mayor\u2019s plan to shore up the city\u2019s crumbling public housing system, which is home to 400,000 low-income New Yorkers and faces a daunting $32 billion in unmet capital needs.The de Blasio administration also struck a deal with the New York City Housing Authority\u2019s biggest union, which would allow caretakers and supervisors to work longer hours and weekends in order to make apartment repairs when residents are typically home.The agency also expects to replace 297 of its lowest-performing boilers by 2026 and replace 405 elevators at 30 developments, where 58,000 residents live. Nycha will also take measures to cut the rat population at its developments by half by the end of 2020.Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hacked European Cables Reveal a World of Anxiety About Trump, Russia and Iran", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother cable, written after a July 16 meeting, relayed a detailed report and analysis of a discussion between European officials and President Xi Jinping of China, who was quoted comparing Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbullying\u201d of Beijing to a \u201cno-rules freestyle boxing match.\u201dThe techniques that the hackers deployed over a three-year period resembled those long used by an elite unit of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army. The cables were copied from the secure network and posted to an open internet site that the hackers set up in the course of their attack, according to Area 1, the firm that discovered the breach.Area 1 made more than 1,100 of the hacked European Union cables available to The New York Times. The White House National Security Council did not have an immediate comment on Tuesday.The compromised material provides insight into Europe\u2019s struggle to understand the political turmoil engulfing three continents. It includes memorandums of conversations with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Israel and other countries that were shared across the European Union.But it also revealed the huge appetite by hackers to sweep up even the most obscure details of international negotiations.The cyberintruders also infiltrated the networks of the United Nations, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and ministries of foreign affairs and finance worldwide. The hack of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. focused on issues surrounding the negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that excluded Beijing.The United Nations \u201chas no information about \u201ca possible cyber breach at the U.N. allegedly carried out by Chinese hackers,\u201d said a spokesman, Stephane Dujarric de la Riviere. He said cyberattacks are \u201conly reported internally, and for most incidents the United Nations does not have sufficient information to conclusively attribute such attacks.\u201dSome of the more than 100 organizations and institutions were targeted years ago. But many were not aware of the breach until a few days ago, when some were alerted by Area 1, a firm founded by three former officials of the National Security Agency.The cables include extensive reports by European diplomats of Russia\u2019s moves to undermine Ukraine, including a warning on Feb. 8 that Crimea, which Moscow annexed four years ago, had been turned into a \u201chot zone where nuclear warheads might have already been deployed.\u201d American officials say they have not seen evidence of nuclear warheads in Crimea.The European diplomats\u2019 account of their private meeting in July with Mr. Xi quoted the Chinese president vowing that his country \u201cwould not submit to bullying\u201d from the United States, \u201ceven if a trade war hurt everybody.\u201d\u201cChina was not a backward country anymore,\u201d the European note taker described Mr. Xi as saying.A March 7 cable summarized the difficulties in relations between the United States and the European Union that had developed during the Trump administration. In it, a senior European official in Washington spoke of \u201cmessaging efforts\u201d to deal \u201cwith the negative attitude to the E.U. in the beginning, which had created a lot of insecurity.\u201dThe official, Caroline Vicini, deputy head of the European Union mission in Washington, recommended that diplomats from the 28 member nations describe the United States as \u201cour most important partner\u201d even as it stood up to Mr. Trump \u201cin areas where we disagreed with the U.S. (e.g., on climate, trade, Iran nuclear deal).\u201dThe cable also recommended working around Mr. Trump by dealing directly with Congress, and urged European diplomats in Washington to emphasize member state interest when pushing on a host of issues, including trade, renewable energy and Brexit.In a statement on Tuesday night, the European Union\u2019s secretariat said it \u201cis aware of allegations regarding a potential leak of sensitive information and is actively investigating the issue.\u201dBut it seemed to avoid the issues raised by the disclosure, saying it \u201cdoes not comment on allegations nor on matters relating to operational security.\u201dThe trove of European cables is reminiscent of the WikiLeaks publication of 250,000 State Department cables in 2010. But they are not as extensive and consist of low-level classified documents that were labeled limited and restricted.Unlike WikiLeaks in 2010 or the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party leaders in 2016, the cyberattack on the European Union made no effort to publish the stolen material. Instead, it was a matter of pure espionage, said one former senior intelligence official familiar with the issue who spoke on the condition of anonymity.It also displayed the remarkably poor protection of routine exchanges among European Union officials after years of embarrassing government leaks around the world.In this case, the cables were exposed after a run-of-the-mill phishing campaign aimed at diplomats in Cyprus pierced the island nation\u2019s systems, said Oren Falkowitz, the chief executive of Area 1.\u201cPeople talk about sophisticated hackers, but there was nothing really sophisticated about this,\u201d Mr. Falkowitz said. After getting into the Cyprus system, the hackers had access to passwords that were needed to connect to the European Union\u2019s entire database of exchanges.Area 1\u2019s investigators said they believed the hackers worked for the Strategic Support Force of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, part of an organization that emerged from the Chinese signals intelligence agency that was once called 3PLA.\u201cAfter over a decade of experience countering Chinese cyberoperations and extensive technical analysis, there is no doubt this campaign is connected to the Chinese government,\u201d said Blake Darche, one of the Area 1\u2019s experts.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return calls for comment on Tuesday.After burrowing into the European network, called COREU (or Courtesy), the hackers had the run of communications linking the European Union\u2019s 28 countries, on topics ranging from trade and tariffs to terrorism to summaries of summit meetings, from the vital to the insignificant.Many of the reports were the ordinary business of diplomacy \u2014 weekly reports from missions from places like Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, Russia, China, Ukraine and Washington, and included descriptions of conversations with leaders and other diplomats or visits to non-European countries.Among the cables were requests for authorization to finance exports to Iran, as well as details of efforts throughout 2018 to continue economic arrangements that might entice Tehran to comply with the terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement\u2019s terms, even after Mr. Trump abandoned it.There was also an inquiry about whether to allow Dmitry O. Rogozin, a former Russian deputy foreign minister who had called for the annexation of Crimea, to travel to Austria for an international meeting on \u201cthe peaceful uses of outer space.\u201d At the time, Mr. Rogozin was under European financial sanctions.There was much analysis in the cables of foreign policy and of Europe\u2019s strategies on issues of trade, counterterrorism, migration and enlargement that could be picked apart by China and other countries looking for an advantage.Asked about the hack, the National Security Agency said on Wednesday it would decline to comment. But the former senior intelligence official said that the European Union had been warned, repeatedly, that its aging communications system was highly vulnerable to hacking by China, Russia, Iran and other states.The official said the warnings were usually received with a shrug.European officials said they are now trying to overhaul their outdated and vulnerable networks \u2014 an expensive process in which technological improvements usually cannot protect against flawed human judgment. They insisted that confidential, secret and \u201ctres secret\u201d material is handled differently than the cables seized by the hackers and noted that a new system, known as EC3IS, is being developed to handle the more sensitive documents that are shared among the diplomats.For communications in capitals like Moscow and Beijing, yet another network, known as Zeus, is being installed for delegations of member states.The Europeans appear, belatedly, to be waking up to the threat. Its senior staff members increasingly use encrypted telephones, and isolated \u201cspeech rooms\u201d of Lucite are being installed in key posts. One such room is already used for a daily 8:30 a.m. meeting of senior staff members, and another is in use in the European Council building in Brussels for intelligence briefings.\u201cOf course no security system is foolproof, and they must constantly be upgraded,\u201d one senior E.U. official said.David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denmark Plans to Isolate Unwanted Migrants on a Small Island", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 Denmark plans to house the country\u2019s most unwelcome foreigners in a most unwelcoming place: a tiny, hard-to-reach island that now holds the laboratories, stables and crematory of a center for researching contagious animal diseases.As if to make the message clearer, one of the two ferries that serve the island is called the Virus.\u201cThey are unwanted in Denmark, and they will feel that,\u201d the immigration minister, Inger Stojberg, wrote on Facebook.On Friday, the center-right government and the right-wing Danish People\u2019s Party announced an agreement to house as many as 100 people on Lindholm Island \u2014 foreigners who have been convicted of crimes but who cannot be returned to their home countries. Many would be rejected asylum seekers.The 17-acre island, in an inlet of the Baltic Sea, lies about two miles from the nearest shore, and ferry service is infrequent. Foreigners will be required to report at the island center daily, and face imprisonment if they do not.The deal allocates about $115 million over four years for immigrant facilities on the island, which are scheduled to open in 2021.The finance minister, Kristian Jensen, who led the negotiations, said the island was not a prison, but added that anyone placed there would have to sleep there.Louise Holck, deputy executive director of The Danish Institute for Human Rights, said her organization would watch the situation \u201cvery closely\u201d for possible violations of Denmark\u2019s international obligations.The agreement was reached as part of the annual budget negotiations. Each year, the Danish People\u2019s Party demands restrictions on immigrants or refugees in return for its votes on a budget.In Denmark, as in much of Europe, the surge in migration from the Middle East and Africa in 2015 and 2016 prompted a populist, nativist backlash.The government has vowed to push immigration law to the limits of international conventions on human rights.Legal experts said it was too early to tell whether the Lindholm Island project would cross those boundaries, constituting illegal confinement. They said it resembled an Italian government project that was struck down in 1980 by the European Court of Human Rights.The Lindholm Island plan furthers the government\u2019s policy of motivating failed asylum seekers to leave the country by making their lives intolerable.Asylum seekers with criminal records are not allowed to work in Denmark. Rejected asylum seekers who cannot be deported are given accommodations \u2014 where they cannot prepare their own meals \u2014 food and an allowance of about $1.20 per day, which is withheld if they fail to cooperate with the authorities.A former immigration minister, Birthe Ronn Hornbech, called the island project \u201ca joke\u201d and a blunder comparable to a soccer player scoring a goal for the opposing team.Many foreigners who have been denied asylum cannot be deported to their home countries for fear of abuse or persecution, or simply because those countries refuse to take them back.Hundreds lingering in two deportation centers refuse to leave \u2014 a challenge for a government that has promised to get rid of those who have no legal right to remain in Denmark.Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said last month that the government\u2019s aim in receiving refugees would no longer be to integrate them, but to host them until they can return to their countries of origin.This summer, a ban on face coverings was introduced and quickly nicknamed \u201cthe burqa ban\u201d as it followed a debate on the Islamic garment seen by some as \u201cun-Danish.\u201d This month, Parliament is expected to pass legislation requiring immigrants who want to obtain citizenship to shake hands with officials as part of the naturalization ceremony \u2014 though some Muslims insist that they cannot shake hands with someone of the opposite sex.Advertisement"}

Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s new deputy has been serving as a \u201ccounselor\u201d to the secretary with a focus on domestic finance since joining the department, where he helped draft the $1.5 trillion tax cut that Republicans passed last year.\u201cIt is an honor to be confirmed by the United States senate,\u201d Mr. Muzinich said. \u201cI look forward to working with Secretary Mnuchin and our team at Treasury to advance the president\u2019s economic policies.\u201dTwo of Mr. Trump\u2019s previous picks for the job, James Donovan, a longtime executive at Goldman Sachs, and Brian Brooks, an executive at Fannie Mae, withdrew from consideration.The elevation of Mr. Muzinich comes as Mr. Mnuchin has been engrossed in trade negotiations with China and working to enforce new sanctions on Iran. The role of the deputy secretary is to run the day-to-day operations of the Treasury Department. With several senior Treasury positions still unfilled, however, Mr. Muzinich is likely to continue focusing heavily on the enforcement of the tax legislation, financial regulation and legislative affairs.Mr. Muzinich\u2019s role could become even more critical given that Mr. Trump has considered Mr. Mnuchin as a possible candidate to be his next chief of staff. Mr. Mnuchin, however, has indicated that he prefers his current position at Treasury.In an administration that is ideologically split between so-called Wall Street globalists and economic nationalists, Mr. Muzinich, who holds a business degree from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, fits comfortably in the camp of the New York bankers. He previously worked at Morgan Stanley and was the president of Muzinich & Company, an international investment firm founded by his father.Before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich was policy director for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign and helped write Mr. Bush\u2019s tax plan.Most Democrats opposed Mr. Muzinich\u2019s confirmation, citing his role in shepherding the tax overhaul passed last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Scientists Push the Technology Boundaries to Aid the World", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareFrom quantum physics to hybrid rice, Chinese scientists are helping to shape the future. Tu Youyou\u2019s resume may pale in comparison with those of other Nobel laureates, because she holds only a bachelor\u2019s degree, has no overseas research experience and is not a fellow of any Chinese scientific academy.However, her discovery of artemisinin, the active compound that serves as the backbone for the most effective antimalarial treatment to date, has helped avert more than 6.2 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2015, according to the World Health Organization. By the end of 2016, artemisinin and its partner drugs were being used in 80 countries and regions.In 2015, Tu won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, becoming the first Chinese to win the award. In January last year, she became one of two recipients of the 2016 (Chinese) State Preeminent Science and Technology Award, China\u2019s highest scientific honor.The 87-year-old from Ningbo, Zhejiang province, is now working on understanding and overcoming resistant to artemisinin in plasmodium (mosquito parasites that cause malaria). Her team is also investigating the use of the drug to cure illnesses such as cancer, lupus (an autoimmune disease) and leukemia.\u201cMy greatest wish is that as our country reforms and opens up, our institutes will allow more capable young scientists to stand out and contribute to its development,\u201d she said in a 2015 speech.In 1967, malaria was ravaging the population of southern China, so the government formed Mission 523, a project to discover a cure for the illness.As an expert in traditional Chinese medicine, Tu was appointed head of the mission in 1969, but her quest was daunting because more than 240,000 compounds had already been tested unsuccessfully across the world.Tu decided to start from scratch by scouring medical literature from ancient China along with folk treatments, and consulting TCM practitioners.After a few months she discovered that sweet wormwood had been used as malaria treatment in China since 400 A.D. However, crude extracts of the plant could not reliably inhibit plasmodium growth, which meant the active ingredient had to be identified.Over the next two years, Tu and her colleagues made 190 consecutive, but fruitless, attempts to raise the inhibition rate to 100 percent. By the time the right active ingredient, artemisinin, had been found and extracted, Tu was seriously ill with toxic hepatitis due to long exposure to poisonous solvents.The drug showed promise during tests on mice and monkeys, but some researchers were concerned about its toxicity in humans. In response, Tu volunteered to be the first human recipient, saying, \u201cI am the head of the research team \u2013 it is my responsibility.\u201dIn 1978, the appraisal committee for Mission 523 approved the use of artemisinin-based drugs to treat malaria. From the early 2000s, the World Health Organization gradually adopted the use of artemisinin-based combination drug therapies as first-line treatment for tackling malaria worldwide.Zhao Zhongxian, winner of the 2016 (Chinese) State Preeminent Science and Technology Award, has often said his true passion \u2013 the subject that has captivated him for more than 50 years \u2013 is pushing the limits of superconducting materials in physics.Since the discovery of superconductivity in 1911, scientists around the world have competed to discover new superconductors \u2013 materials with no electric resistance if cooled to extremely low temperatures, typically a few dozen degrees above -273 C, known as absolute zero.Superconductors can carry a far greater electrical current than typical conductive materials, and can also repulse external magnetic fields around their surface, leading to the creation of powerful electromagnets.Notable applications of superconductors include Maglev trains, magnetic resonance imaging and the Large Hadron Collider, the world\u2019s largest and most powerful particle accelerator.However, superconductors were impractical and uneconomical before the 1980s because expensive liquid helium was required to bring the temperature close to absolute zero.In 1987, Zhao discovered a new copper-oxide-based superconductive material that could operate at around -180 C, significantly raising the practicality of superconductors because liquid nitrogen \u2013 cheaper and more freely available than liquid helium \u2013 can easily provide the critical temperature.\u201cWhen we made the early discoveries, our lab was dirt poor,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cDuring the day, we did research with pots and stoves we made ourselves, and at night, we fought rats in our bed sheets.\u201cIt\u2019s no joke to say that our research conditions have improved hundreds of times since the 1960s,\u201d he said, adding that 40 years of reform and opening up have made China more stable and richer, making it easier to conduct research.\u201cYoung scientists today have solid knowledge, abundant budgets and advanced equipment, but there are also more distractions in the world.\u201dHe added that the secret behind his lifelong dedication is \u201cmaking a living doing what you truly love.\u201d\u201cThe greatest joy of being a scientist is that we are constantly overcoming obstacles and working towards a breakthrough every day. And when you finally make that breakthrough, you can see a new world like no other.\u201dMembers of the agricultural science community often humorously comment, \u201cTwo Pings fed the Chinese people,\u201d according to People\u2019s Daily.The first \u201cPing\u201d is Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China\u2019s reform and opening-up policy which greatly improved people\u2019s livelihoods, while the second is Yuan Longping, who created the world\u2019s first hybrid rice in 1974.Yuan, who was born in Beijing but has lived mostly in Hunan province, has devoted his life to breaking yield records and safeguarding food security for the people of China and the world.Hybrid rice is created by crossbreeding two genetically distinct rice \u201cparents,\u201d whose \u201coffspring\u201d occasionally embody stronger characteristics \u2013 such as better resistance to disease and insects, and higher yields \u2013 than either parent, according to the International Rice Research Institute.This makes hybrid rice fundamentally different from genetically engineered rice (also known as transgenic rice) because no foreign genes are introduced using genetic engineering. However, it is extremely difficult and time-consuming to produce hybrid rice with the right characteristics, the institute said.\u201cAmong high-tech scientific research, hybrid rice is one of the fields in which China has consistently led the world for decades,\u201d Yuan told Xinhua News Agency this year. On his 88th birthday in September, he said he still has three dreams to fulfill before he retires.\u201cThe first is to create rice straws so big and yielding so many grains that people can take shade under the stems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second is seeing hybrid rice planted across the globe to eliminate world hunger.\u201dHis third dream is to turn China\u2019s 247 million acres of saline wasteland into a breadbasket. Yuan estimated that if 10 percent of China\u2019s saline soil were to yield rice at around 1.8 metric tons per acre, at least an extra 80 million people could be fed.Despite the monumental task, Yuan\u2019s dreams are slowly becoming realities.On Oct. 29, Xiangliangyou 900, a super-hybrid rice strain developed by Yuan and his team, yielded about 7.3 tons per acre, surpassing Yuan\u2019s world record of 7 tons per acre set last year, according to Xinhua.Yuan also made headlines this year by growing rice in the most unconventional places \u2013 China\u2019s saline soils and the deserts of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.In May, the fields in Dubai, which were irrigated with sea water, yielded more than 3 tons per acre, making China the only country capable of growing rice in a tropical desert.Next year, researchers and entrepreneurs from China and the UAE will launch a 247-acre standard farm planted with desert rice, and help to accelerate the process of building a green, ecological Dubai in 2020, Xinhua said.On Oct. 10, Yuan\u2019s saline hybrid rice reached a yield of around 1.6 tons per acre in his test fields in Qingdao, Shandong province, proving the hybrid\u2019s feasibility and potential.Mass planting of hybrid rice was approved in 1996. In 2015, the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that approximately 50 percent of China\u2019s rice-growing land had been sown with the strains developed by Yuan.Hybrid rice has also increased yields in key rice-producing countries including Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, Brazil, the United States and the Philippines, the ministry added.Imagine a future where the internet is hack-proof, where computers can calculate quicker than today\u2019s supercomputers, and secrets are kept safe using strange physical phenomena that even Albert Einstein didn\u2019t understand.That is the future that quantum physicist Pan Jianwei, known in China as the \u201cFather of Quantum\u201d, hopes to achieve through his work in quantum physics and the study of subatomic particles, nature\u2019s smallest building blocks.Known for his optimism, enthusiasm and vision, the 48-year-old physicist from Dongyang, Zhejiang province, is spearheading China\u2019s march toward a quantum future.In 1996, when Pan was pursuing a doctorate in physics at the University of Vienna, Austria, under renowned quantum scientist Anton Zeilinger, his mentor asked him why he wanted to study quantum physics. Pan replied, \u201cI want to build a world-class quantum physics lab like the one you have, but in China.\u201dThe term \u201cquantum internet\u201d refers to a network of satellites and ground-based equipment capable of sharing quantum information across the globe. This method of communication is inherently secure because attempts to eavesdrop affect the quantum state and trigger alarms, making it useful in government, defense, finance and other fields where security is paramount.In 2001, Pan returned to China and built his career under China\u2019s pursuit of quantum technologies. In the pre-smartphone age, he began building the world\u2019s first quantum communications satellite, Micius.In 2016, the launch of Micius cemented China\u2019s reputation as a world leader in the application of quantum technology.The satellite pushed the boundaries even further last year by establishing a quantum link between particles more than 740 miles apart, smashing the previous world record of 89.5 miles. It also teleported a photon, the fundamental particle of light, from Earth to space instantaneously for the first time.\u201cChina is at least five years ahead of the rest of the world in terms of quantum communications,\u201d Pan said. \u201cIt has also made world-class achievements in quantum computing. I hope within my lifetime, I will see the birth of the quantum internet.\u201dZhang Zhihao and Zhang YangfeiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

Billionaires. Legal activists.China has a long history of arresting or holding foreigners for mysterious reasons, often in a tit-for-tat play to put pressure on overseas rivals. In recent years the number of such detentions has increased, a disturbing trend for foreigners visiting or conducting business in the country.Here are some recent cases of foreigners caught in the cross hairs of China\u2019s opaque legal system.Ms. Garratt was released on bail and allowed to leave China. Mr. Garratt spent two years in prison before his eventual release. Both have denied the accusations.Legal experts say that the Chinese government might have arrested the Garratts in hopes of pressuring Canada into releasing Su Bin, a Chinese aviation entrepreneur who was being held in Vancouver, after the United States accused him of stealing military data and sought extradition. Chinese officials have denied that the Garratts\u2019 arrest was related to Mr. Su\u2019s case.Mr. Xiao, a Chinese-born Canadian citizen, is now believed to be in custody in the mainland, helping the authorities with investigations into the finance industry, though the government has not specified the reasons for his abduction.Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator, and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, a Chinese-born American citizen, ran a small consulting firm in Shanghai that specialized in \u201cdiscreet investigations\u201d for multinational companies, focusing on issues like counterfeiting and embezzlement.Peter Dahlin, a Swedish citizen, was the co-founder of a nongovernmental organization in Beijing that provided legal aid to Chinese citizens. His work soon caught the attention of the authorities, who were cracking down on foreign nongovernmental organizations and human rights lawyers.Liu Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank in China, is among China\u2019s most-wanted fugitives. He is accused of playing a central role in a $1.4 billion fraud case. He fled the country in 2007.Mr. Liu\u2019s wife, Sandra Han, and their children, Victor and Cynthia, arrived in China in June to visit an ailing relative. Ms. Han was detained, and the children have been held for months under a practice known as an exit ban.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Markets Are Wild, but Bond Markets Can Be Dangerous", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sell-off in stocks isn\u2019t the only ominous economic sign emanating from financial markets. The bond markets, much more closely linked to the actual economy, are also flashing a warning.Ask someone how \u201cthe Dow\u201d is doing and, even if they don\u2019t know the answer, they\u2019ll know what you\u2019re talking about. Ask them about the bond market and you\u2019ll most likely get a blank stare.When it comes to the economy, however, bonds are far more important than stocks. Bond markets dictate the cost of borrowing money, and that can determine actual economic activity. The decision by a C.E.O. to build a plant or take the plunge on a new product is often decided by how much it will cost to borrow the money to pay for it. When that payment climbs too high, corporate activity slows, and so does the economy. Lately, borrowing costs have been rising quickly. Investors worried about corporate debt loads and the impact of a potential slowdown on profits are demanding companies pay them higher interest rates. And, in a recent troubling sign for the economy, fewer companies have been turning to the bond market to finance their businesses.As with the swooning stock market, weakness in the bond market doesn\u2019t mean the economy is destined for an immediate downturn. But signals being sent by bond investors will almost certainly arise in discussions among policymakers at this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on monetary policy, which will culminate on Wednesday with a decision on interest rates. Here\u2019s what you need to know.Like any borrower, a company raising capital in the bond markets pays interest. What they pay depends on how likely it is that a lender will get repaid. Consumers have credit scores. Companies have debt ratings. The greater the risk that a borrower won\u2019t be able to pay up \u2014 known as credit risk \u2014 the higher the interest rates. American Treasury bonds almost always have the lowest interest rates. That\u2019s because lending to the United States government \u2014 which has a virtually unblemished record of repaying creditors \u2014 is considered pretty much the safest investment on earth.Everyone else, even the most powerful, cash-rich corporations, must pay more. For example, Home Depot went to the bond market late last month, raising $1 billion by selling 10-year bonds. At the time, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 the federal government\u2019s cost to borrow for 10 years \u2014 was about 3.06 percent. Home Depot, considered a safe or \u201cinvestment grade\u201d borrower \u2014 paid an interest rate of almost 4 percent to borrow for 10 years. The difference between the low interest rate that the government pays and the higher rate of another borrower is called the credit spread. Riskier borrowers typically have larger spreads. Bankers who arrange bond issues for companies set the interest rate by looking at where the company\u2019s other bonds are trading and assessing the demand for the new bond.A higher credit spread can also reflect investors\u2019 concerns about things like the broader economy and the future ability of any company to pay money back. In recessions, for example, they rise for even the healthiest companies.\u201cAs the credit spread goes up, lenders are saying, \u2018We\u2019re really worried about making loans, riskier than lending to the government,\u2019\u201d said Philip Bond, a professor of finance at the University of Washington.Since early October, credit spreads have increased fast.Borrowers with investment-grade debt ratings (essentially higher credit scores) are paying more than 1.4 percentage points above Treasurys to borrow, up from less than 1 percentage point at the start of the year. Spreads on junk bonds, issued by companies that are considered significantly less creditworthy, have risen even more, from around 3.2 percentage points at the start of the year to more than 4.5 percentage points now, according to FactSet.The sudden increase \u2014\u00a0\u201cwidening\u201d in the bond market\u2019s lingo \u2014\u00a0is telling us that investors are suddenly more nervous about handing over their cash to corporations. The same change in sentiment is playing out in the stock market and the reasons are largely the same. A trade war that has no end, signs of a slowing world economy and a widely expected deceleration in growth the United States have all pushed investors to take less risk. At the same time, the Fed is slowly removing the helping hand it has extended to markets and the economy for the last decade, by raising rates and shrinking the stockpile of bonds it owns. Recent drops in oil prices are also making investors less willing to place their money with the smaller energy companies that tend to borrow in junk-bond markets.While the stock market sell-off may eventually affect sentiment among consumers and corporate executives, bond market moves can have an immediate impact on the economy by discouraging borrowing and investment. It is true that borrowing costs are still very low by historical standards, because the Fed only just began to step back from its post-crisis programs to keep them that way. But one concern among investors is that this effort to hold down costs encouraged borrowing to a point that could be problematic in a downturn. Netflix has gone from having very little debt in 2010 to having more than $10 billion now. Verizon now has $113 billion of debt, more than double the amount it had six years ago. By one measure, the ratio of corporate debt to G.D.P., the total level of borrowing is at all-time highs.In general, higher debt levels could make it tougher for companies to repay the lenders if there\u2019s a slump in the economy, or a hiccup in sales, or a decline in the value of assets.That turmoil didn\u2019t lead to a full-blown recession. But it did coincide with what some economists, including those at JPMorgan Chase, now call a \u201cmini recession\u201d between 2015 and 2016, in which industrial spending by companies in the manufacturing sector slowed sharply and dragged on growth.And with the American economy already expected to slow in 2019, the climbing costs of corporate borrowing could determine whether any slowdown turns into something much worse.Advertisement"}

If a wallet is not returned to the bag, the device sends a cellphone alert. If the cellphone is missing, the device beeps.The school\u2019s graduates and researchers have parlayed their ideas, skills and ambition into more than 50 start-up companies that have raised a total of $60 million from investors and created about 200 jobs.

Many work in what Ms. Samuels calls an expanding \u201cecosystem\u201d of more than 7,000 small start-up companies. New York\u2019s ascendance as a technology hub was reaffirmed by Google\u2019s announcement on Monday that it would create a $1 billion campus in the West Village that would allow the company to double the size of its 7,000 employee work force in the city.Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, won $100 million and a spot on Roosevelt Island.\u201cThey\u2019re a very prestigious institution that is free-riding off the backs of a working population to function in an environment that they really are not adequately paying for,\u201d said Joyce Short, a writer and longtime resident.All the money and attention showered on Cornell Tech has, at times, overshadowed other schools. New York University, which also took part in the 2010 competition, is creating a $380-million tech hub for emerging media, technology and the arts in the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority. Across the street, its Tandon School of Engineering runs several incubators for start-ups.Josh Hartmann, a former chief technology officer for Travelocity and Amplify who now teaches at Cornell Tech, said technology-focused schools are an integral part of what he called a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d that drives the city\u2019s tech industry. The schools attract faculty members and support research, both of which draw more students. The students increase and diversify the talent pool, which in turn brings more companies.On a recent evening, students were huddled together in \u201cthe collaboratory\u201d \u2014 Cornell Tech\u2019s version of a library with tables and smart boards.

{"Headline": "A Familiar Rebellion Spreads to International Swimming", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As a teenager, Michael Andrew came within a second of fulfilling a dream and making the United States swim team for the 2016 Olympics. Now he risks missing out on the 2020 Games in Tokyo for altogether different reasons.Andrew, a world champion, is at the forefront of a battle being waged by some of elite swimming\u2019s biggest names against the sport\u2019s governing body in a fight that threatens to have repercussions beyond the pool. The dispute highlights rising tensions between athletes determined to maximize their earning potential and organizations intent on protecting guiding principles forged in the amateur era.Organizers scrapped plans for a lucrative independent meet in Turin, Italy, this year after FINA, the international swimming federation, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland, threatened competitors with bans from the sport\u2019s biggest events, including the Olympics, which remains unsurpassed in terms of profile and prestige in elite swimming. The resentment has only grown since.Andrew joined about 30 swimmers \u2014 a group that included several world and Olympic champions \u2014 in London this week for two days of meetings to discuss ways to take on swimming\u2019s power brokers. He left saying that they should be willing to be barred if it meant athletes had greater control over their destinies rather than being limited to competitions controlled by the governing body.\u201cIf it takes them banning us for things to change, then go ahead,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a risk. And yes, growing up, the dream is always to have Olympic gold. But if I never get an Olympic gold medal, I\u2019m fine with that. I want to be able to look back and know that I stood up for something I believe in and created a lasting change.\u201dAndrew, who turned professional at age 14, in 2013, said his aim was to break records in the four strokes that make up the medley, his favored event. It is a feat that has never been accomplished, and now the question is whether he will undertake it at sanctioned events. Currently, elite swimmers can participate only in events approved by FINA.FINA appeared to cool on its threat to bar athletes from competing in unsanctioned events, releasing a statement on Thursday saying only that it would not recognize times at meets outside its purview. But court battles over the issue of the federation\u2019s control are moving forward.Two weeks ago, Andrew joined another American swimmer, Tom Shields, and a Hungarian one, Katinka Hosszu, in filing an antitrust suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California challenging FINA\u2019s control over organizing of competitions.Neil A. Goteiner, who is representing the swimmers, said FINA had made it clear that any swimmer who participated in the Turin competition could be barred.The suit comes on the heels of litigation last year in which speedskaters from the Netherlands won a ruling from the European Commission against the International Skating Union. The skating federation had threatened to bar the speedskaters if they participated in an unsanctioned event. In soccer, FIFA, seeking gain leverage over the elite clubs that had started discussions about the possibility of a new breakaway competition, recently warned players that they could be barred from the World Cup.Athletes in track and field and tennis won similar battles with their international federations in the 1970s and 1980s, but not without some pain. In 1973, 81 of the world\u2019s top tennis players walked out of Wimbledon after the tournament honored the International Tennis Federation\u2019s suspension of Niki Pilic, of the former Yugoslavia, who had opted to play a commercial tournament earlier in the year instead of representing his country in the I.T.F.-controlled Davis Cup. After the walkout, the I.T.F. never again challenged the players\u2019 rights to set their own schedules.The swimmers\u2019 suit is being funded by Konstantin Grigorishin, a Russian billionaire from Ukraine who is a leading shareholder in the Energy Standard Group, an engineering and utility conglomerate. He is also the founder of the International Swimming League, a series that he says will revolutionize the sport, which has long existed under the radar between Olympics.The league will offer higher prize money to athletes who, outside of an elite few, rarely earn enough to sustain a career. The league aims to attract broad interest in swimming every year. The company filed its own suit in California against FINA, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior.\u201cThe world is changing, and I think it\u2019s unavoidable for sports governing bodies to accept this,\u201d Grigorishin said.Discussions for a league featuring 12 teams, split between Europe and North America, and culminating in a final meet at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas will continue in January, he said.FINA has been scrambling in the face of the challenge. It announced its own Champions Swim Series, a new team event with almost $4 million in prize money.FINA has said it will mount \u201ca robust\u201d defense against the legal challenges. The governing body will make it clear that competitions outside its auspices create what it has called integrity issues. The federation argues that its presence is required to ensure proper drug testing and certified timing standards, for example.The crisis has shined a spotlight on FINA\u2019s governance. Julio Maglione, an International Olympic Committee member from Uruguay, is in his 80s and has run the organization for a decade. His most senior vice president is Husain al-Musallam, a Kuwaiti official who was identified last year as an unindicted co-conspirator in a United States Department of Justice sports corruption case. He has denied any wrongdoing.In July, the organization moved into plush new headquarters in Lausanne. Adam Peaty, an Olympic gold medalist who holds two breaststroke world records, accused swimming\u2019s leaders of being more preoccupied with their privileged lifestyles than with developing the sport. He joined Andrew in saying he was prepared to be barred to compete in commercial events. He said many top swimmers were forced to do other work to finance their careers.\u201cWhy do FINA spend millions on a headquarters and an athlete has to have a second job?\u201d he said.Peaty, who rose to stardom in Britain thanks to gold medal success at the Rio Olympics, added that his six-figure income was well below what athletes of a similar standard in other sports could earn. \u201cI\u2019ve got bills to pay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a family to sustain in the future.\u201dThe International Swimming League has pledged to split its take from its prospective competition with the athletes, promising appearance fees and prize money to participants. There have yet to be meaningful contacts with broadcast or sponsorship partners.Grigorishin, like many others who have profited from the collapse of the former Soviet Union, has a colorful business history and a career littered with legal battles. He was arrested in early 2002 by the Ukrainian authorities for possession of drugs and a firearm but later cleared his name. He said the charges had been fabricated by \u201csome dirty businessmen trying to get some part of my business.\u201dAfter years of planning, he said, he was willing to spend $7 million on legal fees to begin the swimming league.While organizing the league remains a work in progress, he has pledged as much as $19 million for events next year. That has won over several stars of the sport. Ryan Murphy, an American who has won three Olympic golds, and Federica Pellegrini, an Italian who has won one, also attended Wednesday\u2019s meetings in London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2020 Candidates Are Lining Up. Which Democrat Matches the Moment?", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s formation of an exploratory committee for president on Monday represents a sort of political ball drop, the beginning of a new year and new campaign that will feature an unusually large number of Democrats seeking the presidency.Or will it?As the 2020 Democratic primary gets underway, the defining characteristic of this first stage of the race is the sheer uncertainty about who is even running. More than 30 Democrats are mulling presidential bids, but hardly any of them qualify as an instant front-runner or a gifted, tested campaigner, and some of the biggest names could pass in the end.Even beyond the field of specific candidates, this will be one of the most fluid nominating contests Democrats have had in recent decades. A leaderless party, they are in a moment of transition from center-left politics to a more ideologically pure brand of liberalism.Democrats are grappling with what they stand for, what their voters expect, and what demographic groups will be most critical in winning an Electoral College majority in 2020. But most of all, they are unified by a once-unimaginable objective that only illustrates how unpredictable American politics has become: ensuring Donald J. Trump is just a one-term president.It is hard to recall a recent presidential primary where, at the outset of the race, there was this much genuine mystery \u2014 not only about who would eventually emerge as the nominee, but who planned to run at all.But the number of would-be candidates who may ultimately stay out of the race is larger than the list of contenders who are certain to run.It is unclear if any of these men will enter the race \u2014 particularly Mr. Biden, who, associates say, is ambivalent about running after over three decades of presidential fits and starts.There is also great uncertainty about lesser-known potential contenders who could be formidable \u2014 and if the Trump phenomenon proves anything, it is that making any assumptions about candidates is folly.Presidential politics recalls the adage that 80 percent of life is showing up.That question, more than anything, is what looms over Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy: Would she be the president today if she had run in 2016, as some liberal activists and admirers urged her to? Mr. Sanders ended up filling the void on the populist left and ran a surprisingly strong campaign against Hillary Clinton.Ms. Warren was hardly the first White House hopeful to risk waiting. Bill Clinton, for example, opted out of the 1988 campaign and still became president four years later.But the more recent history of presidential calculations suggests that candidates are wiser to run when the moment presents itself. That is what Mr. Obama did in 2008 after just four years in the Senate, the same period Ms. Warren would have served by 2016. Some Democrats think 2020 is Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s moment: He has been in the House for just six years, but many liberals see his energy and freshness as inspiring.One reason Ms. Warren announced on Monday and declared so early, her allies suggested, was to erase any uncertainty about her intentions among supporters whom she kept waiting \u2014 and ultimately disappointed \u2014 in 2016.Timing is also crucial in presidential races because the issues can change so quickly. Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric and policies around race and immigration have shifted the political conversation away from matters of economic inequality, which has been the life\u2019s work of Ms. Warren and which defined much of the 2016 Democratic primary.Still, her party has plainly moved to the left on economics and social justice. So as much as anything, Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy will test whether 2020 primary voters will demand that their candidates take unwavering positions on issues like universal health care and Wall Street regulations, much as they have historically expected them to do so on supporting abortion rights.Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 candidacy demonstrated that there is hunger among Democrats to confront Wall Street excesses and income inequality. But what\u2019s less clear is how much of a premium the voters will put on purity on these issues \u2014 and if they will overlook a softer line from a candidate who inspires them and who they think can defeat Mr. Trump.Ms. Warren is one of several potential candidates who have crusaded against the influence of wealthy donors and corporations, even to the point of calling out fellow Democrats for taking a more pliant approach to big-dollar fund-raising and business regulation. And she is unlikely to be any less confrontational with rivals in the primary who are heavily backed by billionaire donors, or who are billionaires themselves.\u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money that they\u2019re spending,\u201d she told reporters on Monday. \u201cDemocrats are the party of the people.\u201dThat poses a threat to possible Democratic candidates like Michael R. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, who are aligned with liberals on important issues like climate change and immigration but embody the kind of capitalist wealth that many despise. She may also cause trouble for non-billionaires like Mr. Booker and Mr. McAuliffe, who have collected enormous sums of money over the years from banks, hedge funds and pharmaceutical corporations. Mr. Booker recently became the first candidate to have a super PAC formed in support of his anticipated campaign.There is reason to expect Democratic primary voters and activists will be wary of candidates they see as too cozy with big money.In the 2018 midterms, Democratic candidates who disavowed corporate money fared exceedingly well in primary elections, and the incoming House majority is expected to make ethics and campaign-finance legislation one of its first priorities. Revulsion from a money-soaked political system is one of a few concerns that links Democrats on the activist left, such as Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with less ideological party favorites like Mr. O\u2019Rourke.It is not difficult to imagine Ms. Warren emerging as a kind of good-government buzz saw on debate stages dotted with billionaires and super PAC beneficiaries. Whether or not voters thrill to her persona or policies, there may be no candidate better equipped than she is to help set the rules of engagement around political money and the 2020 field \u2014 and to call out those who flout them.Crises in government could routinely overshadow the Democratic primary campaign. Democrats\u2019 internal debates about ideology and their party\u2019s identity could be obscured by louder, more venomous clashes between the two parties. And challengers hoping to beat Mr. Trump on the campaign trail may have difficulty competing for attention when he is in the White House \u2014 or on Twitter.At times, there could also be moments of friction between the Democrats running for president and the Democrats helming the party in Congress. In the case of the shutdown, there is relatively little daylight, at least so far: Neither legislative leaders like Nancy Pelosi nor candidates like Ms. Warren want to build a border wall. But in other fights \u2014 from cabinet nominations to possible impeachment proceedings \u2014 there may be a wider gap between would-be presidents striving to win primary votes and legislative tacticians aiming to outmaneuver Republicans or cut deals with them.Candidates like Ms. Warren, and other sitting senators like Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker, will each have to strike their own balance between joining the fights of the day in Washington \u2014 often in reaction to Mr. Trump \u2014 and introducing themselves to voters around the country, outlining their agendas and drawing contrasts with their rivals for the nomination.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Misconceptions About Health Costs When You\u2019re Older", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareEnd-of-life spending may seem wasteful, but it turns out it\u2019s hard to predict when someone will die.But health care is one area in which costs are almost certain to rise. After all, one of the original justifications for Medicare \u2014 which kicks in at age 65 \u2014 is that older people have much higher health care needs and expenses. Don\u2019t expect Medicare to provide complete protection from these expenses.Traditional Medicare has substantial gaps, leaving Americans on the hook for a lot more than they might expect. It has no cap on how much you can pay out of pocket, for example. Such coverage gaps can be filled \u2014 at least in part \u2014 by other types of insurance. But some alternatives, such as Medicare Advantage, aren\u2019t accepted by as many doctors or hospitals as accept traditional Medicare.On average, retirees directly pay for about one-fifth of their total health care spending. Some spend much more.One huge expense no Medicare plans cover is long-term care in a nursing home.A widely held view is that much spending is wasted on \u201cheroic\u201d measures taken at the end of life. Are all the resources devoted to Medicare and Medicaid really necessary?The study used all the data available from Medicare records to make predictions: For each beneficiary, it assigned a probability of death within a year. Of those with the very highest probability of dying \u2014 the top 1 percent \u2014 fewer than half actually died.\u201cThis shows that it\u2019s just very hard to know in advance who will die soon with much certainty,\u201d said Amy Finkelstein, an M.I.T. economist and an author of the study. \u201cThat makes it infeasible to make a big dent in health care spending by cutting spending on patients who are almost certain to die soon.\u201d \u201cPeople at high risk of dying certainly require more health care,\u201d said Jonathan Skinner, an author of the study and a professor of economics at Dartmouth. \u201cBut why should some regions be hospitalizing otherwise similar high-risk patients at much higher rates than other regions?\u201d In 2014, for example, chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries in Manhattan spent 73 percent more days in the hospital in their last two years of life than comparable beneficiaries in Rochester.\u201cThere absolutely is waste in the system,\u201d said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. But, he argues, waste is present throughout the life span, not just at the end of life: \u201cWe have confused that spending as end-of-life spending is somehow wasteful. But that\u2019s not right because we are terrible at predicting who is going to die.\u201dOf course, beyond any statistical analysis, there are actual people involved, and wrenching individual decisions that need to be made. \u201cWe should do all we can to push waste out of the system,\u201d Dr. Jha said. \u201cBut spending more money on people who are suffering from an illness is appropriate, even if they die.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Adds 155,000 Jobs in November as Hiring Slows Modestly", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u25a0 155,000 jobs were added last month. Economists had expected a gain of about 190,000. The monthly average for September, October and November was 170,000.\u25a0 The unemployment rate remained 3.7 percent.\u25a0 Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent after growing by 0.2 percent in October. The year-over-year gain remained 3.1 percent.After a week when the stock market suffered from motion sickness and presidential tweets caused trade tensions to flare, a weaker-than-expected jobs report may have disappointed some quarters. But faulty forecasts do not mean that the labor market has suddenly stalled. For the 98th month in a row, employers increased payrolls, and monthly job gains are still averaging above 200,000 this year.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an economy that is well in expansion mode but that is coming off the boil after a strong second and third quarter,\u201d said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management. \u201cSo the state of the job market is good. It\u2019s just that the pace of job creation is slowing a little bit.\u201dYearly wage growth remained at 3.1 percent for the second month in a row, a level not seen since the recession. \u201cIf you have solid wage growth while productivity is improving, that is the best of both worlds,\u201d Mr. Donabedian said.Friday\u2019s report is unlikely to discourage policymakers at the Federal Reserve from raising benchmark interest rates when they meet on Dec. 18 and 19.Nonetheless, the report is being seen as a warning flag on some fronts. The recent volatility in the stock market and an increase in the monthly average number of people applying for unemployment benefits has worried people, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.Still, Mr. Rupkey labeled the report \u201cpretty darn good,\u201d and said it should help calm the markets.Uncertainty about trade policy is the primary source of anxiety. \u201cThe ball is in the president\u2019s court to make sure the China deal is still on,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the biggest impediment now.\u201dIn the meantime, the labor market is mostly delivering. The unemployment rate and new claims for jobless benefits are at or near record lows. And the average monthly increase in payrolls this year is more than enough to keep the jobless rate below 4 percent.\u201cPeople who are working in finance are looking at the stock market,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, research director at the job-search site Indeed. \u201cThe typical worker just wants to find a good job with hours and rising wages.\u201dThat search has been getting easier and easier.Ms. Gimbel said sectors that have had a particularly hard time hiring \u2014 like nursing and retailing \u2014 are now posting more full-time than part-time jobs, a sign that employers are struggling to find workers.\u201cEven now,\u201d she added, \u201cat this point in the recovery, one of the fastest-growing jobs search terms on Indeed is people looking for \u2018full-time work.\u2019\u201dThe labor shortage has also finally started benefiting workers who were hit hardest during the recession: minimum-wage earners, African-Americans, Latinos and Americans with fewer skills and less education.Gartner, a research and consulting firm that conducts a quarterly survey of 20,000 employees at companies valued at $100 million or more, found that most workers were extremely optimistic about their ability to find new jobs.At the same time, years of sluggish wage growth and fewer opportunities for advancement have made some workers dissatisfied with their current employers.\u201cEmployees who say they are willing to go above and beyond at work has declined,\u201d said Brian Kropp, vice president for human resources at Gartner. One out of four employees used to say they were giving their work an extra oomph \u2014 something Gartner calls \u201cdiscretionary effort.\u201d Now, it\u2019s closer to one in six.The reason, Mr. Kropp said, is simple: Workers are not being rewarded for their efforts. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s harder for employees to get promoted nowadays,\u201d he said. In 2006, for example, it took an average of about two and a half years to get a promotion, compared with four and a half years today.Fears about changing jobs have also eased, he said. Workers are more willing to take the risk of hopping to another employer in search of better compensation.Some of the strongest gains to payrolls this year have been in manufacturing \u2014 long a buttress of middle-class employment. In November, manufacturers added 27,000 jobs. That comes on top of the nearly 300,000 positions created in the previous 12 months.The scarcity of people with the training and skills to work in some factories has been a challenge, though.\u201cIf someone is here a year, they never leave,\u201d said Mark Willey, president of Western, an employee-owned millwork. \u201cOur problem today is just finding people who want to work, to show up on time and are willing to apply themselves.\u201dThe company has 217 people on staff and expects to raise the total to 230 next year.The average worker earns $16.95 an hour, Mr. Willey said, and gets a generous benefits package. Because the business is 100 percent employee-owned, workers build up equity in the company after a year.Western has used temporary agencies after failing to get enough applicants on its own, and employed inmates at a nearby correctional facility as part of a work-release program. \u201cWhen they get released, we hire them,\u201d he said. \u201cSome we even hire while they\u2019re still in.\u201dThis has been a good year and the company is scouting locations to build a new factory, but Mr. Willey expects business to cool over the next couple of years. The shortage of competent workers, not only at factories like Western\u2019s but also in construction, is slowing single-family home building at the same time that tariffs have bumped up the cost of materials, he said.He pointed to the aluminum sills that ran along the bottom of doors, and the steel hinges bolted onto the sides.The Commerce Department recently reported that construction of single-family homes fell for the second month in a row in October.Manufacturing and related sectors tend to be more susceptible to economic cycles and are particularly vulnerable to tariffs.Mr. Rupkey of MUFG said that manufacturing had been one of the economy\u2019s strongest segments in recent years. \u201cYou wonder how long that\u2019s going to continue,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies.Most analysts expect the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rates by a quarter-point, to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. It would be the fourth rate increase this year.But they cautioned that it did increase the likelihood that the Fed would take a more cautious approach next year, following through on its announcements to be more \u201cdata dependent\u201d and look at the numbers as they come as opposed to following a preset course.Snowstorms in the Midwest and raging wildfires in California may have distorted employment data in November. Last month\u2019s figures will be revised twice.Advertisement"}

The not-yet titled piece, destined to measure 5.6 feet by 8.2 feet, was the first in a series of eight woven tapestries he was preparing for a solo show in Stockholm.Mr. Miero had downloaded the drawing into a software program, open on his screen, where he translated each color into a combination of threads.\u201cMy ready-made plan will probably change some,\u201d said Mr. Saksi, whose clients have included Bergdorf Goodman and Marimekko. \u201cI\u2019ll get inspired by a material or binding or whatever Stef has in his mind. It\u2019s like an action painting. We can throw different yarns into the machine and make changes as we go along.\u201dIn a traditional textile plant, where time is money, machinery doesn\u2019t pause and work is conducted behind closed doors, a designer experimenting with color and texture during weaving would be rare. But at TextielLab, internationally recognized as a highly specialized work space focused on innovations in woven and knit fabrics, experimentation takes center stage.While the museum still salutes the past, it now focuses on the future by curating contemporary exhibitions, commissioning artists to create inventive work and producing a series of stylish household textiles for sale, with the production work done in the lab. The shop is especially known for kitchen towels, created mostly by young designers, and sells about 13,000 a year.The lab was rebooted five years ago, with an eye toward innovation, said Hebe Verstappen, the lab\u2019s director, who came from the textile industry and manages a staff of 20. \u201cWe started to think again about what the lab is for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only for visitors or production, but for pushing the boundaries of techniques, discovering new processes and teaching the next generation.\u201dSome designers are invited to the lab to work on commissions from the museum or the lab itself, financed through national arts funds. Others, including students, can pay a daily rate to use the lab for research or to create prototypes or finished products. The roster of industry heavyweights who have designed work here includes Viktor & Rolf, Studio Formafantasma, Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec, Studio Job and Scholten & Baijings. (In a newly opened sample studio, visitors can see, and even touch, preliminary models that those designers and dozens of others have made.)\u201cYou come with your design and you have all these master craftsmen that know how to get to the right result,\u201d Ms. Baijings said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for 14 years with Stef. For us, he\u2019s like a tovenaar,\u201d she added, using the Dutch word for wizard to refer to Mr. Miero.In the lab, Mr. Miero and Mr. Saksi discussed colors and textures while an intern took the yarns to a computerized Jacquard loom in the nearby production area, where a sliding-glass door muffled the constant hum from the machine.Mr. Saksi, who came to woven art in 2011 after finding success in graphic design and illustration, credits Mr. Miero with \u201creading my mind\u201d to translate his visions from paper to textile. \u201cMagic happens every time,\u201d the designer said.Another relative newcomer to the medium is Rafa\u00ebl Rozendaal, a Dutch-Brazilian artist based in New York who had been scheduled to work in the lab the same day as Mr. Saksi but was unable to travel. Known for making ultrabright art for online browsers, he first put his work into weaving in 2014 and has returned to the lab every year since to complete a tapestry project.His laboratory partner, Marjan van Oeffelt, a product developer, continued without him (they spoke daily), working with vivid color palettes he had created and experimenting with a two-tone waffle weave. \u201cArtists are more out of the box and I\u2019m more a technician,\u201d Ms. van Oeffelt said. \u201cI like that we learn from each other. Sometimes they bring you out of the border and sometimes you keep them in it.\u201dLater in the day, Mr. Saksi and Mr. Miero hunched over a loom, watching as woven strips were spit out. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the red to pop by adding a little of the fluorescent,\u201d Mr. Saksi said.As he spoke, a few visitors wandered by, craning their necks. The entire 11,840-square-foot production area is open to museum-goers, who can observe staff members and designers at work. The space contains three looms and four knitting machines, along with multiple machines for the lab\u2019s other specialties: embroidery; hand-tufting; passementerie, or decorative trim; and laser technology.One-off art projects were the focus of most of the laboratory work done on this particular day, but that isn\u2019t always the case.In fact, the laboratory was about to complete the largest project it ever undertook: more than 1.8 miles of fabric for Inside Outside, an interior and landscape design studio founded by the Dutch designer Petra Blaisse. The giant curtains, essentially walls of textile, were made for LocHal, a former railroad depot being renovated into a cultural center and library in Tilburg.\u201cIt\u2019s a hugely exciting project,\u201d Ms. Blaisse said. \u201cThe work is very experimental and you\u2019re confronting many situations, especially technical. The fantastic thing about being at the lab is that you can really work with them hands-on.\u201dBy midafternoon of Mr. Saksi\u2019s visit, the first of five work days he was to spend in the laboratory, he was back in the research and development room inspecting sample strips of tapestry.He pointed out that the red appeared brighter, and then he slightly curled up one end of the cloth.\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit stiff, so now we\u2019re working on that,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a good start.\u201dA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the location where work by Rafa\u00ebl Rozendaal, a Dutch-Brazilian artist based in New York, was on display.

The S&P 500 ends the week down by 4.6 percent.By The New York TimesWhen a trade war broke out between the world\u2019s two largest economies in June, investors barely blinked. After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates \u2014 often a reason for investors to sell stocks \u2014 the markets kept climbing. As some of the world\u2019s largest economies began to slow down, American markets largely shrugged it off.Not anymore.Last week, elements of all of those combined to drive the S&P 500-stock index down by 4.6 percent, its worst weekly drop since March and one marked by stomach-churning price swings. Stocks are now down 1.5 percent this year.More volatility could be in store, as investors assess the allegations by prosecutors that President Trump directed illegal payments to ward off a potential sex scandal, and the possibility that he sought to secretly do business in Russia during his 2016 campaign for the White House.\u201cEvery eye is going to be focused on every piece of commentary on this trade deal,\u201d said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, which manages over $6 trillion in assets. \u201cBecause the impact on growth is so significant.\u201dWhile the large market swings on trade-related news underscore some investors\u2019 view that a resolution to the impasse between the United States and China will be crucial to the survival of the economic expansion, there are other political and economic risks as well.

On Monday, stocks jumped 1.1 percent on word that President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed to a 90-day halt on any new tariffs to provide space to negotiate key trade issues.The selling continued on Friday, when stocks fell 2.3 percent.The trade war has already taken a toll on large chunks of the global economy. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, is growing at its slowest rate in nearly a decade. The export-driven economies of Japan and Germany \u2014 the third and fourth biggest economies in the world, respectively \u2014 both contracted in the third quarter.The United States has so far been an outlier. Thanks in part to a burst of deficit-fueled stimulus, a large chunk from the tax cut, the American economy this year is on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2005. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a near 50-year low. Corporate profits and wages are growing at their fastest pace in years.For much of 2018, results like that helped Wall Street stand out even as major stock benchmarks around the globe tumbled. Chinese stocks are down more than 20 percent this year, and shares in Germany are down 16.5 percent. In Japan, stocks are down about 5 percent, and in Britain they\u2019re down more than 10 percent.But even in the United States, there are emerging pockets of weakness, particularly in parts of the economy that are sensitive to rising borrowing costs. Pending home sales have declined for eight straight months, as interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have climbed. Monthly auto sales have plateaued, prompting job cuts at General Motors and Ford.Worries about global economic growth, trade and the strength of corporate America have been battering stocks. While that\u2019s cause for concern, it is important to put slides like this in context.The stock market has mirrored those concerns since the summer. Shares of carmakers and auto-parts manufacturers are down more than 25 percent this year. Shares of homebuilders have slumped nearly 30 percent.And investors are growing more concerned about the outlook for corporate profits next year, despite third-quarter results that showed that profits at S&P 500 companies rose at the fastest pace since 2010. Instead of the strong results, investors zeroed in on commentary from executives about whether next year might signal the beginning of the end for the second-longest business cycle expansion on record.\u201cWe\u2019re very mindful once again where we\u2019re at in the cycle,\u201d Gregory Carmichael, chief executive of the Cincinnati-based lender Fifth Third, said at a conference last week. \u201cWe\u2019re well positioned to deal with the downturn in the economy, and we\u2019ll be very cautious.\u201dThat very caution from corporate America could itself sway the economy, should lenders pull back financing, or large businesses slow their growth plans.There are other risks to the economy, too, and high on many investors\u2019 lists of these is the Federal Reserve. The central bank has been raising interest rates and winding down other financial crisis-era stimulus that helped drive a global investment boom over the past decade. These higher rates pinch stock investors by making government debt a more appealing alternative, particularly in uncertain times, and also mean companies that binged on low-cost loans will have to spend more to cover their obligations.The market tumult, coupled with the increasingly uncertain path for the global economy, is part of the reason Mr. Rieder, of BlackRock, said he believed that the Fed might decide not to lift interest rates at its next meeting on Dec. 18-19.\u201cThe Fed should slow down and now take a step back and look at what has happened,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Now, a GoFundMe campaign aims to finance one the most hotly debated issues in American politics: President Trump\u2019s long-promised border wall.\u201cAmericans are putting their money where their mouth is,\u201d the campaign\u2019s founder, Brian Kolfage, said in an interview Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to put money down to show politicians this is what they want.\u201dMr. Kolfage \u2014 a triple amputee who served in Iraq and who ran a right-wing website that was eventually removed by Facebook \u2014 is hoping to raise even greater sums to cover construction of a barrier between the United States and Mexico. He suggested on the GoFundMe page that if the 63 million people who voted for Mr. Trump were to each donate $80, they would raise more than $5 billion, the amount Mr. Trump is seeking for the wall.\u201cAs a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,\u201d Mr. Kolfage, 37, wrote in the fund-raiser description. \u201cToo many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.\u201dMr. Kolfage, a Purple Heart recipient who lives in Miramar Beach, Fla., wrote on the GoFundMe page that he began the drive out of frustration that Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise remained unfulfilled. \u201cIt\u2019s time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT!,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Kolfage said the public outpouring of donations only underscored the exasperation felt by those who supported the wall project. \u201cAmericans are frustrated with the way things are going and politicians holding us all hostage,\u201d he said.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Kolfage has focused his wrath on congressional Democrats, whom he blames for refusing to fund the project. \u201cThey\u2019d rather see President Trump fail, than see America succeed,\u201d he wrote on the fund-raiser page.Immigration advocacy groups condemned the GoFundMe campaign, calling it a misguided venture fueled by xenophobia.Mr. Kolfage dismissed the criticism, saying he simply opposes illegal immigration. \u201cJust go through the front door,\u201d he said. \u201cBring all these migrants in, verify them, vet them. I\u2019m all for it.\u201dMr. Kolfage assured donors that \u201c100% of your donations will go to the Trump Wall,\u201d and that his team had contacted the Trump administration about securing the funds. He also wrote that he was working with a law firm to draft a contract that would \u201cbind the government to using the funds for the border wall itself, nothing else.\u201dTo allay any doubts, Mr. Kolfage\u2019s campaign page cited the 2012 Washington Monument restoration project, which repaired earthquake damage to the 555-foot obelisk with $7.5 million allocated by the government and a matching donation made by a billionaire to the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit public-private partnership with the National Park Service. If the crowdfunding project fails to reach its goal, Mr. Kolfage promised to refund every donation. \u201cThis won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s our duty as citizens,\u201d he wrote.But it is not that simple. The Department of Homeland Security would not be able to accept the donations without congressional approval.\u201cCongress would still have to enact a statute permitting this,\u201d said David Bier, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cBut current law prohibits the administration from taking this money and spending it, and it also violates the law to accept donations that bind the hands of the administration.\u201dMr. Kolfage said in the interview that he had spoken to someone in the White House, but declined to identify the person. \u201cI think it\u2019s gone all the way up to President Trump,\u201d he said. He added that Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, had called him to say that the GoFundMe campaign had impacted Thursday\u2019s vote.The campaign\u2019s viral success may stem in part from Mr. Kolfage\u2019s national profile as a conservative political activist who ran a political website that was removed by Facebook in October, an action that drew the attention of Fox News.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The High Line Gets a Gemlike Neighbor", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 12-story office building known as the Solar Carve Tower tries its best not to throw shade.For architects of urban towers, the sun is a double-edged sword, producing cheap warmth and light in buildings, but also unneighborly shadows. The taller the building, the more likely it is to throw shade. This problem is of particular note when your neighbor is New York City\u2019s High Line. Studio Gang, the Chicago-based architecture firm led by Jeanne Gang, designed the 139,000-square-foot building using a strategy it describes as \u201csolar carving.\u201d The architects mapped the sun\u2019s annual course to determine which parts of the nearly finished 12-story tower to slice away and sheathed portions of those sections in tilted angular panes of glass.Multiple benefits will accrue from this gemlike surface to those inside and outside the building, said Weston Walker, the design principal of Studio Gang\u2019s New York office. Coupled with high-performance, low-reflectivity glass, the optimized geometry will minimize heat gain and reduce glare for drivers on the West Side Highway, which runs alongside the building. It will also discourage migratory birds from striking. The sculpting \u201ccreates visual noise that makes it easier for the birds to detect the building and fly around it,\u201d Mr. Walker said.Inside, the facets will frame dynamic views of the Hudson River and add interesting bumps to office or amenity spaces.The building, which is scheduled to open in April, has been designed with minimum ceiling heights of almost 16 feet and outdoor space on every floor but one. An 8,000-square-foot second-floor terrace will sit alongside the High Line, and there will be a 10,000-square-foot communal roof deck.\u201cWe call it the lighthouse,\u201d said Jared Epstein, the vice president of Aurora Capital Associates, which developed the building with William Gottlieb Real Estate. (The cost, he said, while declining to give specifics, was \u201cwell over\u201d $200 million.) Mr. Epstein said he hoped the tower would entice leaders in technology, finance, the media or advertising to the Meatpacking District. A Genesis automobile marketing center and restaurant will occupy the base, and office-floor tenants will be announced early next year. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How McKinsey Has Helped Raise the Stature of Authoritarian Governments", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year\u2019s McKinsey & Company retreat in China was one to remember.Hundreds of the company\u2019s consultants frolicked in the desert, riding camels over sand dunes and mingling in tents linked by red carpets. Meetings took place in a cavernous banquet hall that resembled a sultan\u2019s ornate court, with a sign overhead to capture the mood.\u201cI can\u2019t keep calm, I work at McKinsey & Company,\u201d it said.One week before the McKinsey event, a United Nations committee had denounced the mass detentions and urged China to stop.But the political backdrop did not appear to bother the McKinsey consultants, who posted pictures on Instagram chronicling their Disney-like adventures. In fact, McKinsey\u2019s involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke China\u2019s transition from an economic laggard to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. But as China\u2019s growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijing\u2019s signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.It turns out that McKinsey\u2019s role in China is just one example of its extensive \u2014 and sometimes contentious \u2014 work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments \u2014 companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian government\u2019s energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.In August, VEB Bank \u2014 which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions \u2014 hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s autocratic leadership.Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the world\u2019s most admired companies.In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies \u2014 the ones carrying out some of the government\u2019s most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with China\u2019s state-owned companies, McKinsey\u2019s role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asia\u2019s most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the company\u2019s values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations \u2014 that change is best achieved from the inside.\u201cSince 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u201cTens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,\u201d it added.\u201cLike many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,\u201d the company said, \u201cbut we do not support or engage in political activities.\u201dStill, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinsey\u2019s role in a different light.While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights \u2014 sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of America\u2019s biggest rivals.\u201cIt is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,\u201d said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.\u201dHis bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.McKinsey\u2019s role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics \u2014 before discarding much of it after becoming president.On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the world\u2019s most important corporations.That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.Mr. Manafort\u2019s job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different \u2014 an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was \u201ca strong McKinsey supporter,\u201d while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides \u201cto work directly with McKinsey experts.\u201dDiplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might \u201csing a song one moment and knife someone the next.\u201dThere were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for \u201cmobsters and oligarchs,\u201d noting that it might be trying to shed that image.Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey \u2014 and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy \u2014 one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinsey\u2019s work was well received.But the promise of a better future didn\u2019t last long.The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded \u2014 without achieving its goals \u2014 just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.\u201cWhen we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,\u201d McKinsey said in a statement.Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will \u201cto embrace the reform agenda.\u201dBut critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovych\u2019s image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych \u201cwas about power and robbery.\u201dMcKinsey\u2019s role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s downfall. \u201cWe build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraine\u2019s major companies, its economy and society,\u201d the company wrote on its website.In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.It is supposed to be a railway \u2014 part of China\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.\u201cThat is not good for us,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said in September. \u201cMalaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.\u201dBut for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China \u2014 \u201cbuild the nation-to-nation relationship\u201d \u2014 because of its importance in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a \u201cgame changer\u201d elsewhere in the region.It isn\u2019t hard to see where McKinsey\u2019s enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.Dominic Barton, McKinsey\u2019s managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.McKinsey\u2019s in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports \u2014 widely cited in the Chinese state news media \u2014 extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.Mr. Barton \u2014 who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand China\u2019s global influence.\u201cThe world is waiting for the \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,\u201d Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the company\u2019s Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinsey\u2019s enthusiasm to work on it.The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.In 2016, McKinsey\u2019s client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinsey\u2019s clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss China\u2019s sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.\u201cOur firm\u2019s rigorous internal policies and procedures\u201d ensure that \u201cwe bring an independent perspective\u201d to help each client \u201cpursue its own strategic goals,\u201d McKinsey said.But the political backdrop \u2014 a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks \u2014 should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.\u201cThey were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,\u201d Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the world\u2019s biggest insurers.McKinsey\u2019s success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it \u2014 unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends \u2014 into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the People\u2019s Republic of China.Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the country\u2019s vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became China\u2019s premier, putting him in charge of running the government.Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at China\u2019s banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he \u201cnever worked on any projects for the firm\u2019s Chinese clients,\u201d and that it would be \u201cmisleading\u201d to connect him with McKinsey\u2019s work for Ping An.McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.\u201cAny suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,\u201d the company said.And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firm\u2019s last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.McKinsey\u2019s name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the company\u2019s Chinese name.McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like \u201cSmart Cities,\u201d worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen China\u2019s surveillance state.The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.\u201cPolice patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,\u201d McKinsey wrote in a report in June.\u201cIt is about political control,\u201d said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that \u201cthrough the \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019 plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced industries.\u201dMcKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on \u201cMade in China 2025.\u201d But earlier this year, China\u2019s government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinsey\u2019s reports also stopped mentioning the policy.\u201cThey sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the People\u2019s Daily,\u201d George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. \u201cObviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way \u2014 sometimes not so subtle.\u201dAnd the bank is a McKinsey client.In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy \u2014 one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.Sberbank \u2014 a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump\u2019s Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 \u2014 is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.McKinsey\u2019s work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia \u2014 or anywhere in the world \u2014 only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.\u201cBut what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia \u2014 in all three of those instances \u2014 that belief has not proven to be true,\u201d he said.China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there \u201chave nothing to point to\u201d showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.In some cases, McKinsey\u2019s work may have made things worse.The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.\u201cThe world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,\u201d said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending \u201ctheir reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.\u201dFor 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls \u201cthe black box of authoritarian governance.\u201d\u201cEven if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,\u201d Ms. Jones wrote.Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.\u201cIn the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,\u201d she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.\u201cThey engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,\u201d she said. \u201cThey self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.\u201dOutside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as \u201cthe number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.\u201dThe expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs \u201clike bats leaving a cave.\u201dReporting was contributed by Mark Rachkevych from Kiev, Ukraine; Chris Buckley from Kashgar, China; Krishnamoorthy Muthaly from Bentong, Malaysia; Hannah Beech from Bangkok; Matt Apuzzo from Brussels; David Barboza from Boston; and Andrew Kramer from Moscow.

{"Headline": "The Misadventures of an Idealistic Restaurant in Cut-Throat New York", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Emily Elliott moved to New York from North Carolina almost 12 years ago, she handed out resumes in the East Village and slept on her sister\u2019s couch. Two weeks went by and no one hired her. Just as she was starting to feel desperate, Colors, a new restaurant cooperative in NoHo focusing on fair wages and equality, offered her a position as a line cook.Ms. Elliott found Colors, as she put it, \u201cmorally correct.\u201d She recalled a Muslim cook who excused himself to pray in the locker area each day, even during peak hours. The staff, many of whom came from Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the World Trade Center that was destroyed during the Sept. 11 terror attacks, came from more than 20 countries. At Colors, staffers collaborated on a menu that reflected their various ethnicities \u2014 pad Thai, risotto, a Japanese-style smoked tuna. \u201cIt was like the Queens of restaurants,\u201d Ms. Elliott said. \u201cI never worked anywhere that was nearly as diverse.\u201dSix weeks later, Ms. Elliott quit. She wasn\u2019t getting paid on time.Increasing wages for food service workers is certainly a noble cause, one that aligned with the ideals of Colors when it first opened, in 2006. But good intentions are one thing; running a restaurant in a city as competitive as New York is quite another.Colors was a fine-dining cooperative where employees had health benefits and made almost $10 over the tipped hourly rate. But there were other variables that hampered this lofty vision from working smoothly, like complex labor laws, fees from health department inspections and high overhead. Former employees described a restaurant strapped for cash and with no clear leadership. Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant, described Colors as an \u201cincredibly well-intentioned but logically doomed-to-fail situation.\u201dColors restaurant quietly closed in 2017.Others are concerned about a ripple effect. Restaurants will need to raise prices if the tip credit is eliminated, said Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance. \u201cCustomers are currently, constantly complaining that it\u2019s so hard to go out and have a meal because it\u2019s so expensive,\u201d he explained. If prices increase, people could start to tip less.Earlier this year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ordered the New York State Department of Labor to hold public hearings on the issue. The Manhattan hearing in June drew a fiery crowd of protesters on both sides of the debate. Behind the barricades, there were chants of \u201cBetter wages, better tips!\u201d One sign read: \u201cCuomo, we don\u2019t need saving.\u201d\u201cIt was the closest thing you can get to a riot on minimum wage,\u201d said Louis Pechman, a labor lawyer in New York.\u201cIt\u2019s become impossible to ignore that removing tips has created new challenges that we are unable to solve, chiefly that prices have hit a peak that the market cannot bear,\u201d Mr. Tarlow wrote in a statement.Laura Strauss, a waitress, said the pressure of pleasing customers exists even without working for tips, and the no-tip model she worked under for a while limited her income. Now working for tips, she makes about $200 a day, up from $120 before. If the tipped wage were eliminated, \u201cI would definitely not stay in the industry,\u201d she said.This was one of several conflicts that Colors hoped to solve. Saru Jayaraman, the president of Restaurant Opportunities, said that the no-tipping model is not what her organization is advocating for. It wants \u2014 and has successfully established in seven states so far \u2014 a continually increasing minimum wage for tipped workers. The tips of servers in California, where such a practice exists, have remained consistent since wages were increased, Ms. Jayaraman said.Barbara Sibley, the owner of La Palapa in the East Village, said she was torn when it came to raising wages. \u201cThe structural things Saru talks about \u2014 sexual harassment \u2014 are true, but I can\u2019t change the experience for my guests here,\u201d she said. \u201cRegulatory things have a real impact on the ground floor.\u201dOver the years, Ms. Jayaraman, now the president of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and the director of the Food Labor Research Center at U.C. Berkeley, became a voice for minorities, immigrants and women in the industry, helping win back more than $10 million in stolen tips and wages. She\u2019s known for her work ethic and ability to rally a room. Francesco Palmieri, a chef who worked at Colors when it first opened, called her a trailblazer.Starting around 2003, Restaurant Opportunities raised more than $2.8 million to open Colors. Fekkak Mamdouh, a former Windows on the World worker and a co-founder of Restaurant Opportunities, had the idea for Colors. \u201cWith Windows on the World, we were like a family, a real family,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping to have a restaurant where all of us could work together and stay together.\u201d A 6,000-square-foot space on Lafayette Street, next to the Public Theater, had been designated for the restaurant, and Restaurant Opportunities set up the corporate entity, 417 Lafayette LLC, to own and operate it. \u201cEveryone had great hopes for the place,\u201d said Raymond Mohan, the executive chef of Colors when it opened.From the beginning, workers believed in the mission of the restaurant to lift them up and treat them fairly. Some Restaurant Opportunities members were even offered a stake in Colors during the planning stages, when the concept of the restaurant being a worker-owned cooperative had been discussed.Among some Restaurant Opportunities members, there was conflict from the start, beginning with the logic of opening a cavernous space in a hot neighborhood like NoHo. \u201cA lot of the people in Colors are minorities,\u201d said Behzad Pasdar, a member of the committee helping to create Colors. \u201cSo why aren\u2019t we going into Queens and opening a cool little Mexican restaurant?\u201dJust a year later, Mr. Pasdar and seven other Restaurant Opportunities members sued Restaurant Opportunities and Ms. Jayaraman. The members had performed what Ms. Jayaraman called \u201csweat equity\u201d \u2014 fund-raising, picketing restaurants, catering, meeting politicians \u2014 in order to become worker-owners of Colors when it opened. When some voiced fears that the co-op model they were promised might not pan out, they were expelled, according to the complaint. Ms. Jayaraman said that Mr. Pasdar and the others involved in the suit left the organization on their own accord, before the restaurant had even opened.\u201cIt was a shame, because it was a great idea,\u201d said Arthur Schwartz, the lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cThat they were behind putting together a worker-owned co-op gave ROC panache in the political world, but it never happened the way they said it would.\u201dMs. Jayaraman said that Colors did indeed become a cooperative-owned restaurant for at least seven years.The suit was dismissed after the federal court ruled that the plaintiffs were not \u201cemployees\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act.Restaurant Opportunities is now urging people to sign a letter to Mr. Cuomo in support of One Fair Wage.When Colors first opened on Lafayette Street, it offered training and gave restaurant novices hands-on experience. Chris Sciarrotta, a waiter from Long Island, needed serving experience in Manhattan. David Cardenas, who had emigrated from Cuba, wanted to learn how to tend bar. Ashley Ogogor, a waitress from Texas, learned about silverware placement. Working at Colors provided a foot in the door for them. \u201cI was talking to the clients I was handling money. They trusted me,\u201d said Mr. Cardenas, who ended up working as a bartender at Colors.Many of the staffers also became politically involved. In October 2014, Mr. Sciarrotta and Ms. Ogogor, while working for the restaurant, were also campaigning on behalf of One Fair Wage. They spoke at events like a wage board hearing in Harlem. But they were also noticing that their paychecks from Colors were arriving late.For them, it was a convergence of idealism versus practicality.\u201cI was like, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m all about giving tipped workers who are sub-minimum wage higher pay and better working practices,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sciarrotta said. \u201c\u2018I totally advocate it. But your point of view isn\u2019t working right now, so I don\u2019t want to be on a sinking ship when I also have bills to pay.\u2019 I was all about helping them out, but when their ideologies weren\u2019t on par with what I needed, I was just done.\u201dWorkers at Colors were paid a fair wage, sometimes up to $13 an hour. But foot traffic in the restaurant was lacking, several servers said, so it was difficult to make decent tips.\u201cI\u2019m sure mistakes were made, things were challenging,\u201d said Ms. Jayaraman, who had moved to California by 2011. She said that she didn\u2019t know Mr. Sciarrotta or Ms. Ogogor, but that the delayed checks issue was \u201cunacceptable.\u201dIn 2014, it even switched to gluten-free fare, the trend of the moment, but it made little difference. Wages fluctuated, Mr. Sciarrotta said, and paychecks were increasingly late. The bar couldn\u2019t afford mint for cocktails and downgraded to a cheaper chardonnay. The kitchen was regularly running out of staples like fish and steak, servers said.In 2017, the landlord of Colors died, and the restaurant\u2019s rent skyrocketed. Colors relocated to the Lower East Side.At its new location on Stanton Street, the restaurant lasted only a few months, as it waited on a liquor license and then the air-conditioner broke during a very hot summer. But Colors has continued as a training institute and sometimes holds special events. Ms. Jayaraman said that early into the Colors experiment, she realized that its true purpose was to teach restaurant skills and empower workers, which it what it has focused on since 2007. Training facilities, called CHOW (Colors Hospitality Opportunities for Workers), have expanded into nine states, she said.And come next March, Colors 2.0 will open on Stanton Street. Workers will be paid fair wages, said Ms. Jayaraman, thanks to a new business partner. \u201cWe decided we\u2019d focus on the training and work with experienced partners to run the restaurant,\u201d said Ms. Jayaraman.Others think Colors was simply ahead of its time. \u201cIn point of fact, it might work better now than it did then,\u201d said Mr. Wolf, the restaurant consultant. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the minimum wage thing and the #MeToo thing, and the tip-credit thing all be focused on semblance of fairness of people who work in restaurants.\u201d\u201cMore and more the notion of a restaurant as fancy people being served by their lessers is anachronistic,\u201d Mr. Wolf said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ll see some of the things evident of Colors come back again and again.\u201dWe\u2019re already seeing it: Colors New York is preparing to make its comeback as a full-service restaurant next year, while One Fair Wage is gaining steam, with campaigns underway across the country. In New York, backers and opponents of the tip credit are anxious to hear the Department of Labor\u2019s recommendation.Ms. Jayaraman says she thinks that the restaurant industry is resistant to change \u2014 in particular, to increased wages for all \u2014 but that it\u2019s doable, and the time is now. \u201cPortraying it as doom and gloom doesn\u2019t match with the data,\u201d she said, citing thriving restaurant scenes in California and Oregon, which have embraced One Fair Wage. \u201cI think the real concern is if New York moves to One Fair Wage, the National Restaurant Association knows what we already know: that other states will follow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "He\u2019s Built an Empire, With Detained Migrant Children as the Bricks", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "The founder of Southwest Key made millions from housing migrant children. His nonprofit has stockpiled taxpayer dollars and possibly engaged in self-dealing with top executives.Supported byJuan Sanchez grew up along the Mexican border in a two-bedroom house so crowded with children that he didn\u2019t have a bed. But he fought his way to another life. He earned three degrees, including a doctorate in education from Harvard, before starting a nonprofit in his Texas hometown.Mr. Sanchez has built an empire on the back of a crisis. His organization, Southwest Key Programs, now houses more migrant children than any other in the nation. Casting himself as a social-justice warrior, he calls himself El Presidente, a title inscribed outside his office and on the government contracts that helped make him rich.Southwest Key has collected $1.7 billion in federal grants in the past decade, including $626 million in the past year alone. But as it has grown, tripling its revenue in three years, the organization has left a record of sloppy management and possible financial improprieties, according to dozens of interviews and an examination of documents. It has stockpiled tens of millions of taxpayer dollars with little government oversight and possibly engaged in self-dealing with top executives.Showing the ambition that brought him from the barrio to the Ivy League, Mr. Sanchez seized the chance to expand his nonprofit when thousands more unaccompanied children began crossing the border during the Obama era. When the Trump administration needed to house migrant children it had separated from their parents, Mr. Sanchez took them in.Though Southwest Key is, on paper, a charity, no one has benefited more than Mr. Sanchez, now 71. Serving as chief executive, he was paid $1.5 million last year \u2014 more than twice what his counterpart at the far larger American Red Cross made.Shelter Capacity1,000 occupantsSouthwest Key\u2019s 24 shelters are spread across Arizona, California and Texas.500100San FranciscoCaliforniaArizonaPhoenixNew MexicoTexasSan DiegoEl PasoHoustonTucsonSan AntonioBrownsvilleFormer WalmartCapacity 1,410Shelter CapacitySouthwest Key's 24 shelters are spread across Arizona, California and Texas.1,000100San FranciscoCaliforniaArizonaPhoenixNew MexicoTexasSan DiegoEl PasoHoustonTucsonSan AntonioFormer WalmartCapacity 1,410BrownsvilleSouthwest Key's 24 shelters are spread across Arizona, California and Texas.El PasoTexasHoustonSan AntonioShelter Capacity1,000100BrownsvilleFormer WalmartCapacity 1,410ArizonaPhoenixTucsonSan FranciscoCaliforniaSan DiegoSource: Shelter capacity numbers from officials in Arizona, California and Texas | By The New York TimesSouthwest Key has created a web of for-profit companies \u2014 construction, maintenance, food services and even a florist \u2014 that has funneled money back to the charity through high management fees and helps it circumvent government limits on executive pay.The organization, sitting on $61 million in cash as of last fall, has lent millions of dollars to real estate developers, acting more like a bank than a traditional charity. It has opted to rent shelters rather than buy them, an unusual practice that has proved lucrative for shelter owners \u2014 who include Mr. Sanchez and the charity\u2019s chief financial officer.Marcus Owens, the former head of tax-exempt organizations for the Internal Revenue Service under both Republican and Democratic administrations, reviewed Southwest Key\u2019s tax returns for The New York Times. Regulators, he said, seemed to be \u201casleep at the switch.\u201d Describing the financial dealings of Mr. Sanchez and his colleagues, he said, \u201cI think the word is \u2018profiteering.\u2019\u201dMr. Sanchez defended his charity. It had to move fast at times, he said in an interview. But every act, he added, has been to help children.\u201cThere are all these kids, they\u2019re at the border, they\u2019re in detention,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said. \u201cHow do we get this thing done as quickly as we can so we can start serving those kids?\u201dJeff Eller, a spokesman for Southwest Key, said on Tuesday that the charity was closely examining its management practices after questioning from The Times, and that there was \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d that the charity had made mistakes.\u201cCould we have done things better? Yeah. And should have? Yeah,\u201d Mr. Eller said. \u201cBut there wasn\u2019t a desire to game the system.\u201dBecause of the substantial growth of migrant shelters, the federal government hired an accounting firm this year to review shelter grant recipients, said Mark Weber, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services. He added that the department\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees migrant shelters, had also created a new division to monitor shelters\u2019 spending.Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into another shelter provider, International Educational Services, for possible misuse of federal money, according to two people informed of the inquiry. The nonprofit\u2019s founder, Ruben Gallegos, said he had no comment on the investigation.Last year, Southwest Key paid eight people more than the federal salary cap of $187,000. In addition to Mr. Sanchez, they included his wife, Jennifer Sanchez, who earned $500,000 as a vice president, and Melody Chung, the chief financial officer, who was paid $1 million.Robert Carey, a director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Obama administration, said he found the salaries \u201cappalling.\u201d He acknowledged that his office was focused on providing adequate care for the children and had not examined Southwest Key\u2019s finances. \u201cWhen you think of how those funds could be used and should be used,\u201d he said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t sit well.\u201dMr. Eller said the charity had not done anything improper, adding that the federal government had prohibited the organization from discussing executive pay.In recent months, Southwest Key has come under scrutiny after a series of abuse allegations.\u201cHe likes to take chances,\u201d Paula Gomez, a friend of Mr. Sanchez\u2019s since childhood, said of him. \u201cJuan\u2019s that way \u2014 you can have a couple T\u2019s that aren\u2019t crossed and I\u2019s that aren\u2019t dotted.\u201dFor much of his life, Mr. Sanchez has seen himself as an advocate for the vulnerable, but he also is an ambitious networker who sought to fit in with the powerful.He met his first wife, Ellen, planning a protest against nonunion produce pickers; at the same time, he took up golf. His office features a portrait of Che Guevara, and his Harvard diploma. At his graduation ceremony, he wore a serape instead of a cap and gown.\u201cIt was just to make a statement that Latinos were here,\u201d he said.Mr. Sanchez was ultimately accepted into influential circles: He joined the board of the nation\u2019s largest Hispanic advocacy group, now known as UnidosUS. The Mexican government gave him its highest humanitarian award. He rounded up politicians to speak at Southwest Key celebrations and cultivated ties to government agencies.Growing up in Brownsville, Tex., Mr. Sanchez and his four younger brothers had slept on the living room floor. Their father, a baggage carrier for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, suffered a heart attack driving Juan to his part-time job when he was 14. Juan grabbed the wheel of the car. His father died almost immediately.Juan earned money for his family any way he could: selling newspapers, picking fruit alongside migrants from Mexico. He also became a fighter, a top flyweight \u2014 at 5-foot-6 and 110 pounds \u2014 in state boxing tournaments. He thought he might become a professional boxer; if not, a priest. His high school counselor thought he might make a good mechanic.Some of Juan\u2019s friends, who had dreamed of becoming football quarterbacks and scientists, started to get in trouble. They ended up in juvenile halls, in jail, or worse.But he became the first in his family to go past high school, attending seminary before deciding against the priesthood. He graduated from college in San Antonio, earned a master\u2019s degree at the University of Washington and his doctorate at Harvard.In 1981, Mr. Sanchez, then 33, returned to Brownsville to run the Esperanza Home for Boys, a charity that housed juvenile delinquents. Six years later, he started his own charity to help children stay out of prison. He said he wanted to help kids like those he had known growing up.\u201cSouthwest Key was, in essence, started to help my friends,\u201d Mr. Sanchez recalled.In its first year, the charity raised about $200,000 from a state grant to care for 21 juveniles on parole. Mr. Sanchez\u2019s salary was $35,000. Southwest Key took out loans of $6,700 to buy a Konica copier and an IBM computer.Early employees described a sense of mission and camaraderie. But it was clear who was in charge.\u201cJuan is very intense,\u201d recalled Angela Luck, the former deputy executive director. \u201cHe can have a temper. He does have a huge work ethic and expects everybody to have the same one. He can also be funny and kind and intelligent. But it was not an easy gig working for him.\u201dIn the late 1980s, a court settlement meant for the first time that migrant children were required to have their own shelters. The federal government asked if Mr. Sanchez could take in migrant children, he said. Instead, he helped his former gym teacher and an Esperanza board member, Mr. Gallegos, establish a nonprofit to house migrants in Brownsville \u2014 International Educational Services, the organization now under federal investigation.It was not until 1996 that Southwest Key entered the shelter business, opening facilities in Coolidge, Ariz., and El Paso, Tex. That year, it pulled in $12.2 million, about $2.5 million more than the year before.\u201cI was all for it,\u201d recalled Ofelia de los Santos, a former board member. \u201cThe money was so good, and there were so few programs like ours who knew how to run residential programs.\u201dMr. Sanchez made little distinction between his professional and personal life, rewarding people he liked. He stacked his board of directors with longtime friends and served on it himself, a potential conflict of interest.After his first marriage ended, he met his future wife, Jennifer Nelson, who was running a tiny nonprofit in Brooklyn. Southwest Key, by then based in Austin, took it over and hired her. Eventually, Mr. Sanchez\u2019s daughter and brother-in-law would join his charity empire.Mr. Sanchez also hired a childhood friend, Mera Champion, previously Southwest Key\u2019s banker. Even after she was convicted of embezzling $5,300 from her bank, he kept her on.\u201cHe founded Southwest Key, and in his mind, he owns it,\u201d said Arjelia Gomez, the charity\u2019s former chief operating officer. \u201cI always had a problem with that.\u201dConroe CHS (for Chung, Hsu and Sanchez) paid almost $950,000 for former boarding school dormitories and neighboring land in Conroe, Tex., near Houston, leasing the site to Southwest Key as its eighth shelter. Since then, the charity has paid the partners almost $3 million in rent, including about $275,000 last year.Charities are not supposed to make deals that excessively benefit leaders, and shelter grant recipients are prohibited from pursuing their \u201cprivate financial gain,\u201d and even the appearance of it, according to government rules. Mr. Sanchez said the government knew of his ownership of the Conroe shelter and was \u201cO.K. with us doing that.\u201d Mr. Eller, the charity\u2019s spokesman, also said that the Southwest Key board had been told, and that the rent was low compared with other shelters.At least one board member, Ms. de los Santos, said she was never informed about the arrangement. Mr. Weber, the government spokesman, declined to comment specifically on Conroe, but said that the outside accounting firm was reviewing all shelter leases and that their findings would \u201cinform future program decisions.\u201dTwo days after The Times asked Mr. Sanchez about his ownership of the shelter, Southwest Key disclosed it publicly. A few weeks later, Southwest Key said Mr. Sanchez and Ms. Chung would seek to sell their stakes.Mr. Sanchez and his wife built a real estate portfolio of six residential properties with the help of Ms. Hsu, under a company called Sue\u00f1os Grandes Properties, or Big Dreams.Ms. Hsu\u2019s company also donated to Southwest Key\u2019s new headquarters in Austin. To raise money for the building, Mr. Sanchez hustled like a door-to-door salesman, forging new connections and leveraging old ones.He persuaded a local philanthropist to donate land. He was friendly with Austin\u2019s first Latino mayor, Gus Garcia, as he pushed for city approval. He boasted of his credentials and promised jobs at the local branch of the federal Economic Development Administration.\u201cHe was way out of the barrio,\u201d said Pedro Ruiz Garza, then the federal agency\u2019s regional director, who signed off on $4 million in grants to Southwest Key. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it is that he found his way to Harvard. That was very impressive.\u201dThe new three-story glass building had a slide from the third floor to the second, showing the kind of corporate whimsy common in Silicon Valley. Everyone got a thank-you.Mr. Garcia was named to Southwest Key\u2019s board. Ms. Hsu\u2019s company was recognized on a plaque in the lobby. When Southwest Key opened a 275-foot \u201cwalk of heroes,\u201d with mosaics of people considered important to the charity, the first was Mr. Garza, the federal official. The second was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.In 2013, Mr. Sanchez took a \u201cJuan Across America\u201d tour, highlighting Southwest Key\u2019s 25th anniversary. In a YouTube video, he arrived at a new San Antonio shelter. As \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d played, Mr. Sanchez bowed; staff members applauded. \u201cEl Presidente\u2019s in town,\u201d announced the video. At 65, he was nowhere near retirement.The shelter industry was poised to explode. Tens of thousands of migrant children began crossing the border without family members, more than ever before. Southwest Key, with its 15 shelters, became one-stop shopping for new beds. The government needed Southwest Key and Mr. Sanchez\u2019s can-do attitude; he and his team worked closely with Obama officials to set up shelters.\u201cThere were just kids all over the place,\u201d Mr. Sanchez recalled. \u201cThe federal government got embarrassed.\u201dSouthwest Key opened eight shelters in 2013 and 2014. These were no longer small group homes, the kind envisioned by advocates. They were large institutions, with room for 236, 300, even 420 children.\u201cIt clearly had gone through enormous growth, and I think some of the growth was without a lot of scrutiny,\u201d said Mr. Carey, appointed head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement in April 2015.As the shelters multiplied, so did executive pay. Mr. Sanchez earned $279,000 in 2012, and $682,000 in 2015. His wife earned $123,000 in 2012, and $275,000 in 2015.Budgets and shelter costs, not executive compensation, were the administration\u2019s focus. \u201cSalaries at the top and salaries of individuals in the organization were not something that I was looking at,\u201d said Mark Greenberg, then acting head of the agency overseeing the Office of Refugee Resettlement.One reason the charity could pay so much was that it had diversified, operating for-profit companies and charter schools. Mr. Sanchez, who had stepped down from the Southwest Key board in 2007, opted to sit on the boards of the for-profits and the charters.A holding company, Southwest Key Enterprises, oversaw eight for-profits, including those providing construction, maintenance and food services.These aimed to create jobs and earn money for the charity through outside work. But they largely subsisted on government grants and contracts with Southwest Key for work at the charter schools and headquarters. The charity also lent out employees to do work for the for-profits, charging the companies hundreds of thousands of dollars in management fees.Regulating businesses can be tricky for a charity, especially when their major customer is the nonprofit itself and competitive bids are few. Ms. de los Santos, a lawyer, left the charity\u2019s board around the time the companies began operating. \u201cThere would be more headaches and liabilities, especially with the for-profits,\u201d she recalled.Teo Tijerina, who ran the for-profits in 2014 and 2015, said they had to charge enough to help cover the charity\u2019s overhead, making it tough to win bids for outside work. \u201cWe would always be undercut by the small guys,\u201d Mr. Tijerina said.Southwest Key also set up charter schools \u2014 an elementary school on the donated land at its headquarters and a secondary school nearby. It just opened two more, in Corpus Christi and Brownsville.Martha Cotera, a school board member and friend of Mr. Sanchez, said she had grown suspicious over school spending, mostly because the board was given no choice about awarding work to Southwest Key for-profits.\u201cThey were sold to us as economic development enterprises for the community, but I saw that as very self-serving,\u201d Ms. Cotera said.The businesses have charged the two Austin schools more than $4.4 million for food, maintenance and janitorial services since 2009. The charity has also charged the schools more than $6.3 million in rent and unspecified services.Around the time Ms. Cotera quit the board, Ms. Hsu, the real estate broker, joined.Southwest Key\u2019s shelters transformed the institutional landscape in towns near the Mexican border, replacing a psychiatric hospital, a nursing home, college apartments.Mr. Sanchez built the shelter operation on a network of real estate investors. Instead of buying buildings, he engaged in complex rental transactions that charity experts said raised concerns.Southwest Key asked friendly developers to buy properties to rent to the charity. Mr. Sanchez said he did not want to be stuck with empty shelters if children stopped coming. \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth it for us to be purchasing buildings,\u201d he said.The investors were well rewarded. Over the past five years, a group based out of Mesa, Ariz., has earned more than $28 million in rent for properties that cost roughly $16 million. Others who benefited included a former New Mexico state cabinet secretary, a former adviser to a Mexican presidential candidate and two brothers who ran gas stations in Matamoros, Mexico.The charity\u2019s most unusual relationship was with a pair of Brownsville developers, Ryad Bakalem and Rafael Chacon. Mr. Sanchez said he could not recall how he met the men, whose companies bought two former medical centers in 2012 and 2013 to rent to Southwest Key. Since then, the charity has lent almost $9 million to the developers\u2019 companies, for two shelters and a charter school.Though it isn\u2019t illegal, charities rarely lend money for real estate deals. The arrangement \u2014 with no government watchdog, no bank \u2014 can hide kickbacks or other improprieties because no outsider is monitoring whether the loans are repaid on time, and who might benefit.The biggest of those deals was the shuttered Walmart in Brownsville. Mr. Sanchez worked closely with the Obama administration to develop a shelter that could absorb an influx of children.Charity experts questioned why the nonprofit \u2014 now sitting on $61 million in cash \u2014 did not buy a former Walmart that it turned into a shelter. Instead, the charity lent millions to property developers to buy the building. With no bank or government watchdog, such an arrangement can hide kickbacks and other improprieties.$4.5 MIL.Loan to buy buildingSouthwestKeyChacbak$1.5 MIL.Loan to remodelArkansas-based bankRandrVenturesChacbakBoth ownedby Rafael Chaconand Ryad Bakalem$10 MIL.Bank loanRandrVenturesSouthwestKey$400,000Monthly rent$4.5 MIL.Loan to buy buildingSouthwestKeyChacbak$1.5 MIL.Loan to remodelArkansas-based bankRandrVenturesChacbakBoth ownedby Rafael Chaconand Ryad Bakalem$10 MIL.Bank loanRandrVenturesSouthwestKey$400,000Monthly rentArkansas-basedbankSouthwestKeySouthwestKey$4.5 MIL.Loan to buybuilding$1.5 MIL.Loan toremodel$10 MIL.Bank loan$400,000Monthly rentRandrVenturesRandrVenturesChacbakBoth ownedby RafaelChacon andRyad BakalemChacbakBy The New York TimesSouthwest Key lent $6 million to a company run by Mr. Bakalem and Mr. Chacon to buy and renovate the building. Mr. Sanchez said that the nonprofit lent money to the developers because bank financing took too long, and that it also collected interest on the loans.The former superstore reopened as Casa Padre in June, capable of housing more than 1,400 children. Only a tent city built this summer in the Texas desert holds more migrants. The Walmart \u2014 where dorm-style bedrooms replaced racks of clothing \u2014 was controversial from the start, with advocates calling it unsuitable for children.Southwest Key pays $5 million a year in rent for the former Walmart.Mr. Sanchez dismissed the letter as \u201cpretty dramatic,\u201d calling the failure to submit employee fingerprints a paperwork issue.But on Oct. 17, Mr. Sanchez donated $5,100 to the Arizona Republican Party, which controls the state\u2019s government. His wife gave another $5,100. (Their previous political donations totaled no more than $2,100, made only to Democrats and liberal causes, records show.) A week later, the state agreed to a settlement that kept most Southwest Key shelters open.Unbowed, Mr. Sanchez still wants to expand. \u201cWe would love to be twice as big as we are,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause then we could serve twice as many kids as we serve now.\u201dManny Fernandez contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Young Women Have to Play Catch-Up in Retirement Savings", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Lindsay Corner, 25, saving for retirement has a greater urgency than for many of her peers.\u201cNone of my girlfriends talk about it, but I feel fairly confident about managing money and finances,\u201d Ms. Corner said. \u201cI learned about it from my parents and, in college, I studied accounting and finance and took a personal finance class.\u201dMs. Corner, a senior tax analyst from Durham, N.C., began setting aside funds as soon as she graduated in the spring of 2015. \u201cMy first employer offered a 401(k) retirement plan and matched 3 percent of my contribution. I contributed 15 percent of my salary,\u201d she said.She has since increased that amount to 18 percent. \u201cRetirement does not seem like too far away to be saving for,\u201d Ms. Corner said. \u201cI can see why people my age might have that perception, but for me that wasn\u2019t the case. Taking these classes in school really opened my eyes up to it. We would see examples: If you save this much now, this is how much it\u2019s going to be worth later, and you would be, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I would be crazy not to start to save early.\u2019\u201dSaving is a habit for Ms. Corner. \u201cI don\u2019t see the money that goes into my 401(k) account, so it\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even miss it.\u201d\u201cSixty-one percent of women would rather talk about their own death than money,\u201d said Maddy Dychtwald, co-founder of Age Wave. \u201cAnd only 46 percent of millennial women say they are confident in investing.\u201dThat\u2019s a problem when you consider the future for many women. Women typically live longer than men \u2014 81 years versus 76 years \u2014 according to statistics from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. By age 85, women outnumber men by 2 to 1 and a majority of centenarians are women, according to the Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study. This means that women are more likely to be on their own financially as they age.An early start to retirement savings can help change that crystal ball for younger women today, but for many women in their 20s, debt can be a stumbling block to savings.The pay gap, however, is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to the significance of increasing the savings of millennial women. An average woman spends 44 percent of her adult life out of the work force compared with 28 percent for a man, according to the Age Wave calculation.When a woman reaches retirement age, she\u2019ll have earned a cumulative $1,055,000 less than a man who has stayed continuously in the work force, because of the accumulated lifelong pay gap and work force interruptions to care for children, aging parents or a spouse, according to the Age Wave computation based on figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In part, the setback for both women and men in their 20s is the rise of the gig economy, and access to and eligibility for an employer retirement plan. While more than 94 percent of millennials like Ms. Corner, who are eligible for a workplace retirement plan, are saving, many don\u2019t have access to an employer plan.Ms. Blandin had a retirement fund with one of her former employers. \u201cThen I moved on to a different job, and I took that money out\u201d \u2014 about $7,000, she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the craziest thing? I knew it was a bad idea, but I didn\u2019t have an option. I needed to pay off the last of my student loans and credit card debts that had built up from buying furniture for my apartment and purchasing nice office clothes \u2014 I didn\u2019t even have dress pants.\u201d\u201cThe biggest challenge, honestly, is getting started,\u201d Ms. Blandin said. \u201cYou get to this point when you are on your own, and you want to be responsible and put money away, and you realize it\u2019s important, but knowing how to do that gets really complicated. There is all this financial jargon that is hard to understand and you kind of get stuck.\u201dBut about 63 percent of women ages 18 to 29 say \u201cfinancial planning is too difficult to even think about,\u201d Ms. Dychtwald said.One way Ms. Blandin is seeking extra funds to open a Roth IRA is \u201ca side hustle,\u201d she said. \u201cI do sports and concert photography. A lot of my girlfriends do side hustles. One of my friends cooks vegan food, and she caters events. There are people who pick up bar shifts. It\u2019s nice because you can do it within your passion.\u201dDeveloping a contract side gig through an online freelance marketplace like Upwork or Fiverr, or selling craft items on eBay or Etsy, \u201cis a great way to have an incremental pot on the side to use for savings,\u201d Ms. Braxton said.And Ms. Blandin makes it a point to negotiate her salary. \u201cI revisit my pay with my boss regularly and set time aside to discuss everything that I\u2019m doing.\u201dNegotiating for higher pay can make a big difference in the amount young women can set aside for retirement. \u201cI am encouraged by what I see,\u201d Ms. Braxton said. \u201cI have several 20-somethings who have sought me out for help. I encourage them to negotiate as much as they can for salary because more money means more resources all the way around for the rest of their lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arms Sales to Saudis Leave American Fingerprints on Yemen\u2019s Carnage", "Date": "2018-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 When a Saudi F-15 warplane takes off from King Khalid air base in southern Saudi Arabia for a bombing run over Yemen, it is not just the plane and the bombs that are American.American mechanics service the jet and carry out repairs on the ground. American technicians upgrade the targeting software and other classified technology, which Saudis are not allowed to touch. The pilot has likely been trained by the United States Air Force.And at a flight operations room in the capital, Riyadh, Saudi commanders sit near American military officials who provide intelligence and tactical advice, mainly aimed at stopping the Saudis from killing Yemeni civilians.American fingerprints are all over the air war in Yemen, where errant strikes by the Saudi-led coalition have killed more than 4,600 civilians, according to a monitoring group. In Washington, that toll has stoked impassioned debate about the pitfalls of America\u2019s alliance with Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who relies on American support to keep his warplanes in the air.Saudi Arabia entered the war in 2015, allying with the United Arab Emirates and a smattering of Yemeni factions with the goal of ousting the Iran-allied Houthi rebels from northern Yemen. Three years on, they have made little progress. At least 60,000 Yemenis have died in the war, and the country stands on the brink of a calamitous famine.For American officials, the stalled war has become a strategic and moral quagmire. It has upended the assumptions behind the decades-old policy of selling powerful weapons to a wealthy ally that, until recently, rarely used them. It has raised questions about complicity in possible war crimes. And the civilian toll has posed a troubling dilemma: how to support Saudi allies while keeping the war\u2019s excesses at arm\u2019s length.In interviews, 10 current and former United States officials portrayed a troubled and fractious American response to regular reports of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes.At the same time, American efforts to advise the Saudis on how to protect civilians often came to naught. The Saudis whitewashed an American-sponsored initiative to investigate errant airstrikes and often ignored a voluminous no-strike list.\u201cIn the end, we concluded that they were just not willing to listen,\u201d said Tom Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state and an incoming member of Congress from New Jersey. \u201cThey were given specific coordinates of targets that should not be struck and they continued to strike them. That struck me as a willful disregard of advice they were getting.\u201dYet American military support for the airstrikes continued.Nearly 100 American military personnel are advising or assisting the coalition war effort, although fewer than 35 are based in Saudi Arabia.The civilian toll is still rising. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, November was the most violent month in Yemen since the group began tracking casualties in January 2016. There were 3,058 war-related fatalities in November, it said, including 80 civilians killed in airstrikes.For decades, the United States sold tens of billions of dollars in arms to Saudi Arabia on an unspoken premise: that they would rarely be used.The United States had similar expectations for its arms sales to other Persian Gulf countries.\u201cThere was a belief that these countries wouldn\u2019t end up using this equipment, and we were just selling them expensive paperweights,\u201d said Andrew Miller, a former State Department official now with the Project on Middle East Democracy.Then came Prince Mohammed bin Salman.But as the weeks turned to years, and the prospect of victory receded, the Americans found themselves backing a military campaign that was exacting a steep civilian toll, largely as a result of Saudi and Emirati airstrikes.American military officials posted to the coalition war room in Riyadh noticed that inexperienced Saudi pilots flew at high altitudes to avoid enemy fire, military officials said. The tactic reduced the risk to the pilots but transferred it to civilians, who were exposed to less accurate bombings.Coalition planners misidentified targets and their pilots struck them at the wrong time \u2014 destroying a vehicle as it passed through a crowded bazaar, for instance, instead of waiting until it reached an open road. The coalition routinely ignored a no-strike list \u2014 drawn up by the United States Central Command and the United Nations \u2014 of hospitals, schools and other places where civilians gathered.The Americans offered help. The State Department financed an investigative body to review errant airstrikes and propose corrective action. Pentagon lawyers trained Saudi officers in the laws of war. Military officers suggested putting gun cameras on Saudi and Emiratis warplanes to see how strikes were being conducted. The coalition balked.Still, American leaders insisted they need to keep helping the Saudi coalition.\u201cI think this does give us the best opportunity to address these concerns,\u201d he said.In March, Prince Mohammed paid a visit to Washington, where he was feted by President Trump. As the two leaders sat in the White House, Mr. Trump held aloft a chart with price-tagged photos of warplanes and other weapons.\u201c$3 billion,\u201d Mr. Trump said, pointing to the chart. \u201c$533 million. $525 million. That\u2019s peanuts for you.\u201dThe prince chuckled.But in Congress, the mood was souring. In the March hearing, senators accused the Pentagon of being complicit in the coalition\u2019s errant bombing, and pressed its leaders on how directly the United States was linked to atrocities.General Votel said the military knew little about that. The United States did not track whether the coalition jets that it refueled carried out the airstrikes that killed civilians, he said, and did not know when they used American-made bombs. At a briefing in Cairo in August, a senior United States official echoed that assessment.\u201cI would assume the Saudis have an inventory system that traces that information,\u201d said the official, who spoke anonymously to discuss diplomatically sensitive relations. \u201cBut that\u2019s not information that is available to the U.S.\u201dAt the coalition headquarters in Riyadh, he said, American liaison officers had access to a database that detailed every airstrike: warplane, target, munitions used and a brief description of the attack. American officials frequently emailed him copies of a spreadsheet for his own work, he said.The data could easily be used to pinpoint the role of American warplanes and bombs in any single strike, he said. \u201cIf the question was \u201cHey, was that a U.S. munition they used?\u201d You would know that it was,\u201d he said.Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for Central Command, did not deny the existence of the database, but said that American officers only used coalition data to carry out their core mission: advising on civilian casualties, sharing intelligence on Houthi threats and coordinating the midair refueling that ended in November.\u201cI will not speculate on how the United States could have used or compiled the information the Saudi-led coalition shared for some other function,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThat is not the mission these advisers were invited to Riyadh to perform. That is not the way partnerships work.\u201dOther officials have said that collating information about use of American munitions in Yemen would be onerous and, ultimately, pointless. \u201cWhat difference would it make?\u201d the senior United States official in Cairo said.Under American law, customers of American weapons must follow the laws of armed conflict or future sales may be blocked, said Ryan Goodman, a former Defense Department attorney who teaches law at New York University.Mr. Lewis, who left the State Department in 2017, said that in his experience, individual Saudi officers were often concerned or distressed by airstrikes that killed civilians but there was little institutional effort to reform the system.The Joint Incidents Assessment Team, the body set up to investigate errant strikes, worked diligently at first, he said. But when its findings were made public, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs had removed any references that were critical of coalition actions.Asked if that was the case, the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohamed Al Jaber, said, \u201cThe JIAT is an independent team,\u201d and he referred any questions to them.Over the summer, as Emirati warplanes pounded the Red Sea port of Hudaydah, General Votel and the defense secretary at the time, Jim Mattis, held at least 10 phone calls or video conferences with Saudi and Emirati leaders, urging them to show restraint, a senior American military official and a senior Western official said.At least one of the conferences involved Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the effective leader of the United Arab Emirates.\u201cThe Saudis are decent partners,\u201d Gen. C.Q. Brown Jr., a former top commander of American air forces in the Middle East, said in an interview. \u201cAnd sometimes our partners don\u2019t always do things we would expect.\u201dPentagon officials said that in his current job as deputy defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan had recused himself from decisions involving Boeing.Daniel L. Byman, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service, said that a more robust policy toward Saudi airstrikes would not just be good for Yemeni civilians \u2014 it would also help the Saudis.\u201cThis war has been a strategic disaster for the Saudis,\u201d he said. The airstrikes have shown no sign of defeating the Houthis, and the Houthis\u2019 foreign ally, Iran, has gained from Saudi Arabia\u2019s clumsy prosecution of the war.\u201cThe United States needs to use its power to promote peace and stability in Yemen,\u201d Mr. Byman said. \u201cAnd it needs to protect its allies from themselves.\u201dDeclan Walsh reported from Cairo, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Wanted to Cooperate in His Own Way. Prosecutors Had Other Ideas.", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former fixer, always had a high self-regard for his ability to talk \u2014 or bully \u2014 his way out of challenging situations, whether acting on his own or on behalf of Mr. Trump.So when federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York began investigating Mr. Cohen, he seemed to undertake a brazen and risky legal strategy: offer enough information that it might prompt prosecutors to ask a judge for leniency for him \u2014 but nothing more about his or others\u2019 activities.On Friday, the prosecutors made clear that Mr. Cohen was less useful to their investigation because he would not fully cooperate, therefore he would not reap benefits, such as a government letter on his behalf.They said Mr. Cohen had refused to sign a full cooperation agreement, the sort most people in the Southern District sign when agreeing to testify against their partners in crime. Under that sort of deal, witnesses must admit to every crime they have committed and offer any details concerning crimes by others, even ones the government did not know about.\u201cCohen tried to bend the way cooperation works in the Southern District to his own will,\u201d said Elie Honig, a former prosecutor in that district who negotiated dozens of cooperation deals. \u201cHe tried to offer only selective cooperation at his own choosing and he wanted a benefit for that.\u201dThe prosecutors in Manhattan, in a sentencing memorandum to the judge, denounced Mr. Cohen, 52, as devious and greedy \u2014 and asked the court to show him only modest leniency, largely for helping the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.Judge William H. Pauley III will weigh that recommendation when he sentences Mr. Cohen on Wednesday in two separate cases.Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in August to an array of campaign finance and business crimes brought by the Southern District prosecutors, and last month, he pleaded guilty to a charge of lying to Congress that Mr. Mueller had filed.In his first plea, he made the startling revelation that Mr. Trump directed him to arrange illegal payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The payments were intended to ward off a potential sex scandal that might threaten Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning the White House in 2016.Prosecutors wrote Friday that Mr. Cohen \u201cacted in coordination with and at the direction\u201d of Mr. Trump, which could implicate the president in a felony.The prosecutors seemed to voice regret that Mr. Cohen had not signed a formal deal to assist their office. \u201cHad Cohen actually cooperated, it could have been fruitful,\u201d they wrote. But because he did not, the \u201cinability to fully vet his criminal history and reliability impact his utility as a witness.\u201dThe Southern District asked the judge Friday to impose a \u201csubstantial\u201d sentence, of about four years, on Mr. Cohen. His lawyers, on Nov. 30, had recommended Mr. Cohen receive no prison time at all.The lawyers explained that Mr. Cohen had forgone traditional cooperation \u2014 and the promise of a letter from prosecutors \u2014 because he felt that resulting investigations and trials would delay resolution of his case. They wrote that Mr. Cohen wanted to accept responsibility for his crimes, bear any punishment he receives and move on with his life.In seeking leniency, the lawyers noted Mr. Cohen had met voluntarily seven times with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office, also without a formal deal.Mr. Mueller\u2019s office asserted in a letter to the judge on Friday that Mr. Cohen had \u201cgone to significant lengths to assist the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d It said he had provided Mr. Mueller with information about his own conduct and that of others \u201con core topics under investigation.\u201d The office asked for some leniency when Mr. Cohen is sentenced.Mr. Cohen met twice with the Southern District prosecutors after his first guilty plea on Aug. 21, and he willingly discussed the roles of other people \u2014 just not himself \u2014 in the campaign finance crimes to which he had already pleaded guilty, the office said in its memorandum.Mr. Cohen also told the prosecutors through his lawyers that he was considering whether to fully cooperate with their investigation, the Southern District said in the document. Later, Mr. Cohen decided against making such a deal.The prosecutors said that during their meetings with Mr. Cohen, he was \u201cforthright and credible,\u201d and that he had potentially \u201cuseful information about matters relating to ongoing investigations being carried out by this office.\u201dBut Mr. Cohen \u201cspecifically declined to be debriefed on other uncharged criminal conduct, if any, in his past,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. He also \u201cdeclined to meet with the office about other areas of investigative interest.\u201d\u201cIn order to successfully cooperate with this office,\u201d the prosecutors said, \u201cwitnesses must undergo full debriefings that encompass their entire criminal history, as well as any and all information they possess about crimes committed by both themselves and others.\u201dThat process allows prosecutors to \u201cfully assess the candor, culpability and complications attendant to any potential cooperator, and results in cooperating witnesses who, having accepted full responsibility for any and all misconduct, are credible to law enforcement and, hopefully, to judges and juries.\u201dBy not pursuing this process, the prosecutors wrote, \u201cCohen\u2019s efforts thus fell well short of cooperation,\u201d and as a result, he was not offered a deal.Jessica A. Roth, a former Southern District prosecutor who teaches at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, said full cooperation is extensive and demanding in the Southern District. \u201cIt\u2019s a soul-searching process in which you\u2019re being asked to come clean about everything,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s an all or nothing affair,\u201d added Berit Berger, executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity, at Columbia Law School.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers, Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester, pointed out in their sentencing memorandum that Mr. Cohen had helped Mr. Mueller at a time when Mr. Trump was making repeated, strident attacks on the special counsel\u2019s inquiry, calling it \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d They made a virtue of the fact that Mr. Cohen was not angling for a pardon from the president, but had made himself available to prosecutors and put his fate in the judge\u2019s hands.\u201cIt states the obvious to observe that this matter is unique,\u201d the lawyers wrote. (A lawyer for Mr. Cohen declined to comment on Sunday.)Even people who do sign full cooperation agreements do not always fare well at sentencing. Federal judges in Manhattan have imposed prison sentences on cooperating witnesses in major corruption cases, even when the government has endorsed leniency.\u201cI think it still has to be the case that if you engage in a form of public corruption, you must understand that you go to jail,\u201d Judge Jed S. Rakoff said in 2012 as he sentenced a former lobbyist-turned cooperator to three months in a bribery case.And three years ago, Judge Colleen McMahon, while sentencing a Westchester County, N.Y., lawyer who had cooperated to 18 months, said, \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem right to me that you should get off without some real punishment.\u201dIt is uncertain how Judge Pauley \u2014 a Clinton appointee known for his intellect and independence \u2014 will weigh Mr. Cohen\u2019s assistance when he decides on how severe a sentence to impose.Katherine B. Forrest, a former federal judge in Manhattan who was a colleague of Judge Pauley\u2019s before she left the bench, noted that he ordered the lawyers to hand-deliver copies of their sentencing memos to his chambers by 5 p.m. on Friday.\u201cHe wanted to spend the weekend really culling through these,\u201d Ms. Forrest said. \u201cHe will be really thoughtful about this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He moves regularly, staying at each place anywhere from a couple of days to a few months. \u201cThe sharing economy has been transformative for me,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it has enabled me to live my digital nomad lifestyle.\u201dThe entrepreneur takes advantage of every kind of group-share service imaginable: home sharing, bike sharing, car sharing and more. Co-working spaces with reliable Wi-Fi have been particularly vital to him and his business. \u201cI\u2019m only as good as I am connected,\u201d Mehra says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to interact with other people who are out there hustling and working remotely like me.\u201dMehra recently got married in Portugal, and now the couple is back in the Washington, D.C., area for a short stint. But they plan to start traveling again as soon as they can. \u201cSharing other people\u2019s homes, cars and workspaces around the world has given me the ability to basically live like a local in so many of the places I\u2019ve visited,\u201d Mehra says. \u201cThat makes a big difference.\u201d\nHe was happy at how smoothly it all worked. \u201cI\u2019ve been renting out this car almost every weekend,\u201d Lower says. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful program.\u201d Maven takes care of everything from installing keyless entry technology to vetting drivers to a $1 million liability coverage during reservations. Lower only has to remember to keep the car clean, set the pricing and update the availability calendar. \u201cIt\u2019s a truly turn-key system,\u201d he says.Sharing the car helps him offset the costs of keeping it while Julia is away at college, Lower says. Another perk? He can tap into the Maven network and find an affordable rental for himself. \u201cEvery year I get mulch for my garden,\u201d he says. \u201cSo now I can use Maven to get a pickup truck for a day.\u201d And the best part is that whenever Julia comes home from college for holidays and internships, she still has a car to use.Now that he uses Maven, Lower has upgraded his plans for the family\u2019s next vehicle. \u201cOne day I thought: \u2018Aha! Maybe I'll get a sporty Camaro or a Cadillac ATS to share with everyone,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cCar-sharing makes you think about things differently.\u201d\nA sports merchandise analyst for a department store chain, Maben typically would go to a fast-fashion store and buy an affordable outfit that she would wear only a few times. This time, however, she took a different approach. Inspired by a co-worker who had recently signed up for Rent the Runway, a sharing service that provides designer clothes for a fee, Maben decided to give it a try.\u201cI was able to experiment with clothing that\u2019s more fashion forward, made by designers I normally couldn\u2019t afford,\u201d Maben says. \u201cIt made me step outside of my comfort zone in a good way, and I had fabulous clothes for my trip.\u201d\nMaben didn\u2019t cancel her membership when she returned home. She continues to use it to elevate her wardrobe, borrowing four pieces at a time and switching them out whenever she\u2019s ready for a new look.Besides saving money, sharing clothes has paid off in other ways. \u201cIt sounds corny, but you know the quote, \u2018Dress for the job you want, not the job you have?\u2019\u201d Maben says. \u201cI am wearing things that are more executive level.\u201dAbout four months after starting with Rent the Runway, Maben got a promotion. She won\u2019t say that her new role is a result of her new wardrobe, but she does feel that the clothes boosted her self-confidence. \u201cWhen I get dressed in the morning and I look at what I\u2019m currently wearing, it makes me really feel like, \u2018Oh, yeah. I\u2019ve got this.\u2019\u201dThis is not the only sharing service Maben uses: She taps into home-rental sites when she\u2019s on vacation and ridesharing apps when she needs to get around New York. The sharing economy has given Maben access to a world of opportunity that previously seemed unattainable. \u201cIt opens your mind to new possibilities, new ideas and new experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my entire lifestyle.\u201d\nPhotography by Heather Sten, runway image by Belish/ShutterstockThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

In 1989, it returned to private ownership and was restored as a tourist destination. \u201cThe villa is a testimony to the rich Italian historical and architectural heritage,\u201d said Dimitri Corti, the chief executive of Lionard Luxury Real Estate, which has the listing. \u201cThanks to the care and detailed renovations, today it offers the possibility of living in an ancient house with great joy and enjoying modern comforts.\u201dFloors throughout are a mix of original tile and rough stone, and some have been renovated with modern tile and terra cotta. The furniture and artworks, including sculptures and paintings dating to the 18th and 19th centuries, are not included in the asking price but are negotiable, Mr. Corti said. The second floor is anchored by a 1,345-square-foot dining room with wood ceilings as high as 18 feet and a large fireplace with an allegorical fresco over the mantel depicting the theme of Time. Also on the second floor are a modern kitchen, three bathrooms and two bedrooms, including the master, with its original stone fireplace. Of the home\u2019s five wood-burning fireplaces, three date to the construction of the building, with mantels of Pietra Serena, a gray sandstone widely used in Tuscan art and architecture during the Renaissance. A large lawn surrounding the swimming pool extends from the west side of the courtyard. The adjacent gardens include crape myrtle, lime, magnolia and honeysuckle plants, as well as a small pond fed by a spring.With a population of about 1,500, Ozzero is one of many small farming municipalities in the greater Milan metropolitan area. Local amenities include a supermarket and several parks and restaurants. Nearby areas like Abbiategrasso and Morimondo offer dining, shopping and historic churches. Popular activities in the region include golf, biking, canoeing, shooting, horseback riding and bird-watching, Mr. Corti said. The city of Milan, about a 40-minute drive from the property, offers an abundance of night life, cultural attractions and parkland; Milan Malpensa Airport is a 45-minute drive.Milan is Italy\u2019s second-largest metropolitan area and home to its stock exchange, and it has led the country\u2019s gradual recovery from the global financial crisis of 2008, brokers said.The city has seen a marked economic improvement since 2015, when the international Expo Milano fair drew thousands of visitors from abroad, said Fabio Guglielmi, the chief executive of Santandrea Luxury Houses, a brokerage with offices throughout Italy.\u201cMilan is a city full of possibilities, a capital of fashion and design, and really international,\u201d Mr. Guglielmi said, \u201cso the real estate market is going in a positive way.\u201d While the Italian real estate market is stable but less than dynamic, the local market in Milan has begun to see more growth in home prices and sales volume, he said. Average housing prices in Milan increased by about 0.5 percent during the first half of 2018, with properties in new complexes in central and suburban areas increasing by about 0.8 percent, said Simone Rossi, the managing director of Gate-away.com, an Italian property portal.\u201cAmong the big Italian cities, Milan is the only one that can be considered at the same level as other major European capitals,\u201d Mr. Rossi said.Most foreign buyers gravitate to the city\u2019s historic center or to the Quadrilatero della Moda (the fashion district), the adjacent artsy district of Brera or the nearby Castello district, brokers said. The CityLife shopping district, which features large green spaces, is also in demand, Mr. Corti said.While smaller apartments in areas near city services and transportation are the most sought-after by the average buyer, foreign luxury buyers typically request three-bedroom apartments of at least 180 square meters, or about 2,000 square feet, Mr. Guglielmi said.The average price of apartments for sale in Milan is about 3,450 euros a square meter (or about $365 a square foot), Mr. Rossi said. Luxury homes can range in price from 10,000 to 16,000 euros a square meter ($1,000 to $1,700 a square foot), Mr. Corti said.The farther one travels from the city center, the more prices fall, Mr. Rossi said, with smaller apartments in outer areas going for less than 60,000 euros (about $68,000) and terraced houses starting at about 230,000 euros ($262,000).Most foreign buyers in the Milan market \u2014 particularly Americans \u2014 are interested in living outside the city, in the picturesque Lake Como area, about an hour north of the city center, brokers said.Foreigners who buy in the city tend to be from continental Europe, although the number of Russian, American and British buyers there is growing, Mr. Corti said. That may be because Milan is seen as an appealing place for corporations to relocate after Brexit, \u201cparticularly in the finance sector,\u201d he said.There are no restrictions on foreigners buyers in Italy, although nonresidents can buy property only if their home countries have reciprocity agreements or treaties with the Italian government, Mr. Guglielmi said.The United States and Italy have such an agreement, so there are no restrictions on American citizens, Mr. Rossi said.Typically, buyers hire a real estate agency to assist them in the purchasing process, for a fee of about 3 percent of the home\u2019s sale price, Mr. Guglielmi said, although the commission can sometimes be as high as 4 percent, Mr. Corti said.Buyers should be prepared to pay overall closing costs of 10 to 20 percent of the sale price, including the agent\u2019s commission, taxes and other fees, Mr. Rossi said. (For most foreigners, who are buying part-time or vacation homes, this includes a tax of 9 percent on the assessed value, rather than the 2 percent paid by those using a home as a primary residence, brokers said.)While foreign buyers may obtain mortgages from Italian banks, the process can be difficult and may require that they show proof of income in Italy, Mr. Rossi said.Italian; euro (1 euro = $1.14)This property has annual fees of 7,500 euros (about $8,550), which includes taxes, heating, electricity, and pool and garden maintenance, Mr. Corti said.Advertisement"}

But he referred specific questions to his lawyer, who did not respond to a request for comment.In March 2017, Mr. Low\u2019s associates were looking to retain \u201csomeone with political influence,\u201d according to a Friday filing. Their goal was to help him deflect efforts by American authorities to seize assets bought with money he was accused of siphoning from 1MDB, and to end the Justice Department investigation into his activities, according to the filings. They indicate that, after Mr. Low expressed interest in hiring Mr. Broidy and Ms. Rosenzweig\u2019s law firm, Mr. Michel met with Mr. Broidy and an associate \u201cand explained Jho Low\u2019s situation in the 1MDB matters.\u201dMr. Broidy \u201cindicated to Michel that although he was willing to assist Jho Low, he would not take any compensation directly from Jho Low in exchange for his services,\u201d according to the filings. They indicate that Mr. Broidy \u201cwanted $15 million in compensation, but Michel negotiated the price down to approximately $8 million.\u201dAt least $6 million was transferred to Ms. Rosenzweig\u2019s law firm through various accounts set up to \u201cdisguise the true source, origin and purpose of the funds, and, specifically, to conceal from U.S. financial institutions Jho Low\u2019s ownership, control and affiliation with these funds and transactions,\u201d according to the filings.A draft agreement called for a $75 million \u201csuccess fee\u201d to be paid to Mr. Broidy if the investigation was resolved within 180 days, or $50 million if it was resolved within 365 days.Mr. Broidy traveled to Thailand in May 2017 to meet with Mr. Low and Mr. Michel, and he indicated \u201cthat he would sit down with Jho Low\u2019s legal team and figure out the best way to get to a settlement on the 1MDB matters,\u201d according to the filings.Mr. Michel indicated that Mr. Broidy \u201cagreed to try to influence a potential nominee for a federal position that would have authority over the 1MDB forfeiture matters,\u201d according to the filings, which note that the potential office holder was not nominated.And the court filings indicate that Mr. Low\u2019s allies talked with Mr. Broidy about using his \u201cpolitical connections to lobby United States government officials\u201d to force the exit of a Chinese dissident from the United States.Mr. Broidy did not register to lobby for Mr. Razak or Mr. Low, and on Friday, he said that his activities did not constitute lobbying.Friday\u2019s court filings in Mr. Higginbotham\u2019s case cite at least one email from Mr. Broidy that was disseminated to the news media.

When she arrived in the capital for freshman orientation, she ran into Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a civil-rights icon \u2014 and burst into tears.\u201cI said to him, \u2018Sir, I read about you in middle school, and you\u2019re here in the flesh, and I get to be your colleague,\u2019\u201d she recalled, tearing up again. She added, \u201cThere are moments \u2014 every single minute \u2014 that I\u2019ve been here where I almost want to pinch myself.\u201dMs. Omar\u2019s life story is, in many respects, uniquely American, an immigrant who worked hard and made good. She also embodies the complicated crosscurrents around immigration, race and religion that dominate Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.When she was 8, Somalia erupted into civil war, and her extended family fled to a refugee camp in Kenya, where they spent four years before seeking asylum in the United States in 1995. They settled first in Arlington, Va., and later in Minneapolis, whose large Somali population Mr. Trump has called \u201ca disaster\u201d for Minnesota. Her father, a teacher in Somalia, picked up work driving taxis and later got a job at the post office; her mother died when Ms. Omar was 2.Her arrival in this country was the first time, Ms. Omar has said, that she had confronted \u201cmy otherness\u201d as both a black person and a Muslim. She became a citizen in 2000, when she was 17. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, she decided to wear the hijab, as an open declaration of her identity. But from \u201cthe first day we arrived in America,\u201d she said, she concluded that it was not the golden land that she had heard about.\u201cI think back to the orientations I went through a little over 20 years ago in the process of coming to this country, and in those orientations they did not have people who were homeless. There was an America that extended liberty and justice to everyone. There was an America where prosperity was guaranteed regardless of where you were born and what you looked like and who you prayed to,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI wasn\u2019t comfortable with that hypocrisy.\u201dThat feeling led to organizing, and Democratic politics. \u201cShe was almost like a clich\u00e9 of a civic-minded new American,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, a professor at the University of Minnesota who taught Ms. Omar during a public policy fellowship. She would quote the Declaration of Independence, he said, asking, \u201cWhy have we come up short?\u201dAs a candidate, rallying voters for a $15 minimum wage, more relaxed immigration policies, Medicare for all and other progressive agenda items, Ms. Omar proved herself sure-footed and tough, with a flair for inspirational rhetoric \u2014 traits that her predecessor, Representative Keith Ellison, Minnesota\u2019s incoming attorney general, attributes to her early childhood in Somalia, as the daughter of a well-to-do family of educators.\u201cShe grows up with this sense of herself as important, and yet war destroyed everything and essentially put her in a position where she had to go get rice from relief workers for her family at a young age,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cShe had a certain sense of herself, a certain confidence of her own view.\u201dHer election that year made her the first Somali-American state legislator in the nation, but some conservative colleagues were put off by her frank talk about race, religion and discrimination.\u201cThe liberal media in Minnesota likes to paint her as their hero and that\u2019s what they have done here \u2014 Time magazine beauty queen, trailblazer, all of those wrapped together,\u201d said State Representative Steve Drazkowski, who has investigated Ms. Omar\u2019s campaign spending. He said Ms. Omar was \u201creally accusatory and really rode the edge of racial discussion.\u201dAnd Ms. Omar\u2019s careful answer on the 2018 campaign trail to questions about Israel \u2014 and her postelection clarification that she does indeed back the boycott, divest and sanctions movement \u2014 has left some Jewish leaders feeling betrayed.\u201cI think people looked at her as this transformative, inspirational-type figure,\u201d said Lonny Goldsmith, editor of TCJewfolk, a media nonprofit in the Twin Cities, \u201cand maybe she is to some people. But at the end of the day she\u2019s a politician.\u201dMs. Omar\u2019s admirers see her as a powerful symbol, whose \u201cmere presence will hopefully help to educate the American people about who Muslim women are,\u201d said Farhana Khera, the executive director of Muslim Advocates, a civil-rights group.Already, she has worked with Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the incoming chairman of the Rules Committee, to carve out a religious exception to the no-hats rule. She gave a hint of her style in her sassy response to the pastor, Bishop E. W. Jackson, who complained that the House floor would look like an Islamic republic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Drone Deliveries on the Horizon, Europe Moves to Set Ground Rules", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut as e-commerce continues to grow, drones have the potential to reduce the time, cost and energy needed for many everyday deliveries \u2014 assuming they are managed well and used safely.Before a commercial drone industry can thrive, particularly in the crowded urban areas of Europe, different kinds of drones must be able to fly along their delivery routes without crashing into one another \u2014 and under a standardized set of regulations, experts say \u2014 not unlike cars on the road.The path to proving that drones can operate together and be tracked in crowded skies has brought a group of companies to a former military airfield outside Brussels, where they will test their unmanned aviation technology. The project, known as Safir, will help the European authorities devise a set of rules for the commercial use of drones.But Amazon\u2019s ambitions are just one part of the Safir initiative.\u201cIt is about testing 10 drones with different purposes, applications and IT systems,\u201d said Mark Vanlook, the chief executive of DronePort, the recently opened facility where the tests will take place.Other participants produce drones that can assist law enforcement, inspect power lines and monitor wildlife.The overall goal, Mr. Vanlook said, is making sure different drone systems can coexist while in flight. \u201cIf drones can\u2019t account for their surroundings, they will collide \u2014 and hurt people,\u201d he said.\u201cThe technology to build a single drone obviously exists, and now we are playing catch-up with registration, tracking and rule making, all things that will prevent chaotic, ad hoc incidents like the one at Gatwick,\u201d said Ellen Malfliet, an official from Unifly.\u201cThe market is Chinese dominated right now,\u201d said Ulrike Franke, a policy fellow focused on drones at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAnd if Europe wants to catch up, it first has to unify its rules and regulations, which will incentivize European drone producers to engage not just with their country but the entire European market.\u201dMembers of Safir met in Brussels at the end of November for planning. In the coming year, the group will test products together at DronePort, which provides users with office space and outdoor testing areas, as well as a long runway, a control tower and hangars. They are also planning a live demonstration over Antwerp, Belgium, provided that they pass a series of safety and certification tests, said Robin Garrity, an air-traffic management specialist helping to oversee the project.Participants say the live demonstration, if successful, will send a signal to businesses and consumers alike that a vibrant commercial drone industry is achievable.\u201cRight now, we are at the cusp of an industry that is completely changing, with tons of opportunities,\u201d Ms. Malfliet said. \u201cIt is vital to collaborate, to work together and move as quickly and as far as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pelosi and Her No. 2 Go Back 50 Years. But They\u2019re Not Quite Friends.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In her quest to become speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California appears ready once again to sacrifice the higher ambitions of her No. 2, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, and Mr. Hoyer is not shy about expressing his objections.\u201cShe\u2019s not negotiating for me,\u201d he snapped the other day, referring to Ms. Pelosi\u2019s deal with a group of House Democratic rebels to impose term limits on the leadership \u2014 and not just herself \u2014 of four years.The putsch failed spectacularly, but she\u2019s ready to handcuff him again with a deal on term limits that, if approved, would most likely usher both lawmakers from their leadership suites by early 2023, along with the No. 3 Democrat, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina.All three septuagenarians could be weakened by their lame-duck status \u2014 in Washington, power is always prospective \u2014 but Mr. Hoyer, 79, of Maryland, the lone white man in the group and a symbol of the party\u2019s dwindling centrist wing, would appear to be the most vulnerable to an even earlier challenge.Some see Mr. Hoyer as the ultimate corporate pol, out of sync with a Democratic caucus in which women, millennials and people of color are in ascendance, with the loudest new voices on the left. His longstanding ambitions to be speaker would almost certainly be curtailed by the plan\u2019s emphasis on generational change, though under it, he could technically serve four years as majority leader, and then, at 83, run for speaker.But over his more than 50 years in public life, 37 of them in Congress, Mr. Hoyer has proved himself a quiet survivor. He is now the House\u2019s longest-serving Democrat. Last month, he skated to victory to reclaim the majority leader\u2019s post, even as some fellow Democrats pushed for Ms. Pelosi\u2019s ouster.\u201cIs Tom Brady too old at 41 to be quarterback?\u201d he asked in an interview, comparing himself to one of the best N.F.L. players in history.His survival skills may be put to a new test as he fights back against the term limits proposal, which is subject to a vote of the entire caucus when the new Congress convenes in January. The debate will pit old-school Democrats like Mr. Hoyer, who derive their power from the seniority system, against newcomers, who want to shake things up.\u201cSteny entered the political scene at a time when Democratic Party politics was much more conservative and traditional in how it operated,\u201d said Representative Jamie Raskin, a fellow Maryland Democrat, adding, \u201cOne of the last great challenges of Steny\u2019s career is to figure out how to incorporate the surge in progressive feeling in our party.\u201dMr. Hoyer\u2019s stock in trade is his ability to cultivate allies across the Democratic spectrum (not to mention lobbyists and donors), and he is busy making new friends on the left. Among them is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive firebrand from New York, who at 29 is half a century his junior. He dropped in to see her at a cafe in Queens on Halloween, the first time they had met.\u201cI remember feeling very pleasantly surprised,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.But while he may have left her with the impression that he will embrace her vow to make waves, in the interview, Mr. Hoyer was more cautious. He took a dim view of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s decision to join environmental activists at a protest in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s office.\u201cI was a little bit surprised, but you know, she\u2019s gung-ho, she\u2019s full of vim, vigor and vitality,\u201d he said, adding tartly, \u201cOne could say there are other ways to make a point.\u201dLike Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Hoyer raises millions of dollars for Democrats \u2014 more than $10 million in this election cycle alone \u2014 and crisscrosses the country campaigning for them. Unlike her, he has not become the subject of Republican attack ads and is welcome in districts across the country. If Ms. Pelosi is the public face of the caucus, he is the \u201cmember\u2019s member,\u201d guiding younger colleagues on everything from hiring decisions to committee assignments.\u201cHoyer is the old-school pol; everything about him is hail-fellow-well-met,\u201d said Amy Walter, national editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cHe just is so much different than the new generation of leaders. He\u2019s not an outsider, he\u2019s not one who wants to destroy the establishment.\u201dHe opposes Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s call to keep members who take industry contributions off a select committee on climate change, saying the corrupting influence of money in politics can be cured through disclosure.\u201cSteny Hoyer,\u201d Mr. Tillemann said in an interview, \u201cis part of a system that is bought and paid for by powerful people, corporations and interests.\u201dMr. Hoyer makes no apologies. And Mr. Hoyer\u2019s allies see his it\u2019s-not-personal attitude as a virtue. Veronica Escobar, an incoming freshman from Texas, recalled that when Mr. Hoyer agreed to support her, he insisted on breaking the news himself to a friend who was backing her opponent.\u201cIt showed a level of not just courage, but a level of transparency and a desire to be forthright and candid and open and honest,\u201d she said.Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer go back more than half a century. Having known difficult times \u2014 his biological father left him, and his stepfather was an alcoholic \u2014 Mr. Hoyer was working his way through the University of Maryland as a night file clerk for the C.I.A. when he heard a young Senator John F. Kennedy speak on campus.Inspired, he switched his major from public relations to politics, and ditched the C.I.A. job to work part time for a Democratic senator, Daniel B. Brewster of Maryland. There, in 1963, he crossed paths with a summer intern, Nancy D\u2019Alesandro, soon to be Nancy Pelosi, the daughter of a longtime Baltimore mayor and Maryland Democratic royalty.\u201cShe was bright, beautiful, energetic and a big wheel,\u201d Mr. Hoyer recalled. \u201cShe was a D\u2019Alesandro.\u201dThe \u201csomething happened when they were interns\u201d theory of their friction is the stuff of Capitol lore, but Mr. Hoyer dismissed that as \u201cbaloney.\u201d While they were not close, he said they had a \u201cwonderful relationship.\u201d He allowed that they came from very different worlds: \u201cShe ran in different circles than I did.\u201dFour decades later, in 2001, they ran against each other for Democratic whip. Ms. Pelosi won. In an interview, he took pains to note that she had the backing of 30 of the 32 Democrats from her home state of California, while his home state of Maryland had only four Democrats all told.When Ms. Pelosi backed Mr. Murtha in 2006, \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy about it,\u201d Mr. Hoyer said. But he won handily, which seemed to produce a d\u00e9tente.Mr. Raskin said Mr. Hoyer was \u201cvery much at peace with where he is right now,\u201d but Mr. Hoyer is not ruling anything out. Before Ms. Pelosi secured the votes to become speaker, he described himself as \u201cone of the alternatives\u201d should she fall short, and said that \u201cof course\u201d he would one day like to have the job, while adding quickly that he had a pretty amazing job right now.He refused to say whether he would run again or retire in 2020.

{"Headline": "Demanding Wall Funding, Trump Balks at Bill to Avert Shutdown", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Thursday torpedoed a spending deal and sent the government careening toward a Christmastime shutdown over his demand of $5 billion for a wall on the southwestern border, refusing to sign a stopgap measure to keep funds flowing past midnight Friday.With Mr. Trump unwilling to admit defeat on his signature campaign promise despite a clear lack of votes to get it through Congress, House Republican leaders scrambled for a way out of the year-end morass. On a dizzying day in the Capitol, House Republicans pushed through legislation to add $5.7 billion for the wall to a measure to extend government funding into February, making a last stand in the final hours of their majority to back the president\u2019s hard-line immigration promises.The bill is almost certain to die in the Senate, where it would need bipartisan support. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told senators scattered around the country to return Friday for another vote. The House approved it on a nearly party-line vote of 217 to 185.\u201cIt is a shame that this president, who is plunging the nation into chaos, is throwing another temper tantrum and going to hurt lots of innocent people,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said during an evening news conference in the Capitol, as the House prepared to vote on its revised measure. \u201cThe Trump temper tantrum may produce a government shutdown; it will not get him his wall.\u201dMr. Trump appeared undeterred.\u201cI\u2019ve made my position very clear: Any measure that funds the government has to include border security, has to,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a ceremony at the White House, delivering a screed against illegal immigration that recalled the themes of his presidential campaign, including fearsome purported statistics suggesting many unauthorized immigrants were murderers and rapists. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201dOn Thursday, though, there was no mistaking the president\u2019s stand. For the second time in two weeks, he was digging in for a shutdown fight over taxpayer funding for the wall, a project that he once promised Mexico would finance but that has instead become an irritant hanging over every debate over federal spending. It has also become a potent symbol of how Mr. Trump is willing to buck consensus on Capitol Hill and empower a small minority of ultraconservative members.The president balked at the Senate bill after coming under attack from conservative commentators on Fox News and social media for failing to fight for the wall. Personalities like Ann Coulter and members of the House Freedom Caucus warned that if he did not veto the Senate-passed measure that failed to fund it, he would lose the backing of his core supporters \u2014 and any chance at re-election.\u201cThe sun has not yet set on our majority,\u201d Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, wrote in an op-ed posted on Fox\u2019s website. \u201cLet\u2019s stand up and fight. It\u2019s now or never.\u201dMr. Meadows, who had spent much of Wednesday evening and Thursday morning spoiling for a veto of the Senate\u2019s stopgap spending measure and a House vote to force through the $5 billion in wall funding, then accompanied House Republican leaders to the White House to discuss the issue with Mr. Trump. By early afternoon, the House delegation had joined Mr. Trump\u2019s chorus.\u201cThe president was very adamant that he would not support the continuing resolution coming over from the Senate,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, as he returned to the Capitol after the session with Mr. Trump. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to move forward and keep the government open.\u201dBut it was not clear how those two imperatives could coexist given the reality in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance major legislation and Republicans control only 51.\u201cHere we are, twisting in the wind at 7 p.m. on the day before the government shuts down \u2014 what a sad performance, what a regrettable lack of responsibility,\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat, minutes before the House voted. \u201cWe are playing political games here to pander to the president of the United States, who sadly rejected a compromise that was reached by all of us.\u201dThe House Republicans\u2019 maneuver did have a potential political upside for them, turning the tables on Democrats who will now be in the position of blocking a measure to keep the government open because of their opposition to funding the wall.\u201cChuck Schumer and Senate Democrats now have to decide whether it is worth shutting down the government to keep us from securing our border,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\u201cWe want to keep the government open, but we also want to see an agreement that protects the border,\u201d said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. \u201cWe have very serious concerns about securing our border.\u201dIt was an ignominious end to the tenure of Mr. Ryan, who just one day before had given his farewell speech lamenting the outrage-fueled nature of the political discourse and its role in scuttling compromise on major issues including immigration. Mr. Ryan, whose speakership was diminished by an inability to maneuver around the Freedom Caucus at critical moments, had long advocated a broad immigration compromise, but he spent his final hours in the post waging a futile and divisive fight to erect a border wall.The chaos on Thursday in Washington helped send stock prices plummeting. On the edge of one of the biggest travel weekends of the year, the Transportation Security Administration and air traffic control system were about to run out of money, though most of their employees would have to work without pay. Visitors to the national parks were forced to rethink travel plans.\u201cThis is no way to run the corner grocery store, let alone the government of the United States,\u201d said Representative Dan Kildee, Democrat of Michigan.As Republicans toiled to corral the votes for their doomed legislation to fund Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader who is likely to become speaker in two weeks, used procedural maneuvers to make it clear that it was Republicans who were standing in the way of continuing funding for the government. She tried to force action on a measure to do so, prompting an objection from Republican leaders and a vote in which Republicans voted no.\u201cWe\u2019re right in the middle of a sort of a meltdown on the part of the Republicans,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters, declining to speculate on how the drama would end. \u201cThey\u2019re having a breakdown over this.\u201dRepublican leaders began the day with a sense of dread, worried about opposition to the Senate bill among their rank-and-file but unable to assure them that if they did vote for the package, the president would sign it. Their closed-door morning meeting devolved into a tense and confused free-for-all as Mr. Meadows and other Freedom Caucus members said the House should fight for Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, rather than accept what the Senate had sent.But Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third-ranking Republican, argued that the House could accept the stopgap measure and still fight for the wall after the new Congress convenes, forcing Democrats into a messy debate over it just as they assumed control.In the middle of the session, Mr. Ryan stepped away to take a call from Mr. Trump, who vented his frustration about the situation, according to two officials who were briefed on the call. Moments later, the president took to Twitter to blame leaders in his own party for failing to fund the border wall, suggesting they had promised that a spending bill earlier this year would be the last without wall funding.By evening, Mr. Scalise, who had argued privately in the morning that Republicans should delay the wall fight until the new year, was on the House floor making an impassioned plea for them to vote for the revised measure to fund it immediately.\u201cThis is about keeping America safe,\u201d Mr. Scalise said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the person in the White House, but whether or not we are going to respect the rule of law and keep America safe.\u201d\u201cOn the basis of his self-interest alone, he must know that if he doesn\u2019t build the wall, he has zero chance of being re-elected and a 100 percent chance of being utterly humiliated,\u201d Ms. Coulter wrote in a blog post Wednesday night.\u201cThe time to fight is now,\u201d said Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, who joined the pair Wednesday night on the House floor in railing against the lack of border wall funding. \u201cI mean, this is stupid.\u201d \u201dNicholas Fandos and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bolton Outlines a Strategy for Africa That\u2019s Really About Countering China", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration rolled out a new strategy for Africa on Thursday, but it was really all about China.John R. Bolton, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said the United States would lavish money and greater attention on the African continent, casting it as a crucial battleground in the global economic contest between the United States and China.But Mr. Bolton conceded that the United States had limited resources to compete with the tens of billions of dollars China is pouring into Africa. He also threatened to withdraw American aid for some United Nations peacekeeping missions, which he labeled ineffective, as well as for certain African countries like South Sudan that he said were corrupt or ungrateful.Mr. Bolton\u2019s speech, at the Heritage Foundation, was his latest effort to flesh out what Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy means for particular regions. In Africa, he said, the greatest threat came not from poverty or Islamist extremism but from an expansionist China, as well as Russia.\u201cThey are deliberately and aggressively targeting their investments in the region to gain a competitive advantage over the United States,\u201d Mr. Bolton said. \u201cChina uses bribes, opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in Africa captive to Beijing\u2019s wishes and demands.\u201dMr. Bolton announced a new program, \u201cProsper Africa,\u201d to support American investment across Africa. Without attaching a dollar figure, he said the United States would facilitate alternatives to the large, state-directed public works projects pushed by the Chinese.Those projects, he said, were turning some African countries into economic vassals of China. Zambia, for example, owes Beijing $6 billion to $10 billion, according to Mr. Bolton, and is at risk of having the Chinese take over its national power company.China built a military base in another indebted African country, Djibouti, a few miles from where the United States has a base for counterterrorism operations. Earlier this year, Mr. Bolton said the Chinese fired military-grade laser beams at American aircraft, injuring two pilots.Experts welcomed the focus on Africa, which has often been neglected by both Republican and Democratic administrations. But some noted the contradiction between Mr. Bolton\u2019s promise of increased investment and a rollback of American engagement in other areas.\u201cYou can\u2019t counter a multifaceted, long-term Chinese play just by increasing investment,\u201d said Grant T. Harris, a former adviser on Africa to President Barack Obama. \u201cWashington needs to understand that China is investing in relationships, not just infrastructure.\u201dMr. Bolton traced his interest in Africa to his first job in government, working at the United States Agency for International Development during the Reagan administration. Yet he made clear that he viewed much of the American aid sent to Africa as wasted or misspent.\u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said, \u201cthe United States will not tolerate this longstanding pattern of aid without effect.\u201dSouth Sudan, where rival leaders recently agreed to end a ruinous civil war, is among those at risk of losing aid. Mr. Bolton said the country was still being led by \u201cthe same morally bankrupt leaders\u201d who prolong \u201chorrific violence and immense human suffering.\u201dIn the 2017 fiscal year, foreign assistance to Africa from the State Department and the Agency for International Development amounted to $8.7 billion. From 2014 to 2018, the United States provided some $3.8 billion in humanitarian aid to South Sudan and its neighbors. American businesses invested $50 billion in Africa in 2017, according to the State Department.The flow of money from China to Africa has been substantial, but much of it is not what experts consider aid. From 2000 to 2014, Chinese financing to Africa totaled $121.6 billion, according to an analysis by AidData, a research center based at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.About 40 percent of that can be defined as aid, based on the parameters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to Bradley Parks, AidData\u2019s executive director. During the same period, the United States provided $106.7 billion in aid, according to the group.Most of the Chinese money comes in the form of loans, many of which are for projects being built by Chinese state-owned companies. The contracts typically have strict conditions attached to them; borrowers often have to start repaying the loans within a few years, unlike loans from the World Bank, which can have a grace period of a decade.\u201cThe work that they do, the assistance that they provide, seems to be more about China than it is about the countries that are the target, or the recipients of the assistance,\u201d said Mark Green, the administrator of the Agency for International Development.But the Chinese companies have had great success in winning contracts for projects in Africa. In some cases, this is tied to bribing officials. But in others, Chinese companies have been good at managing relations because, unlike American companies, they have a strong presence on the ground.\u201cFor American businesses to compete effectively in the region, the U.S. government must develop methods to come to the table with a full package,\u201d said Mike Davis, an American businessman in Uganda. \u201cThe current approach has not proven effective when you compare it against the competition.\u201dMr. Trump, driven by a desire to confront China\u2019s growing influence, signed a bill to double the war chest of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which finances American businesses in developing nations.

{"Headline": "Mueller Says Manafort Lied About Contacts With Trump Officials", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, lied to federal investigators about his contacts with Trump administration officials and his interactions with a Russian linked to Moscow\u2019s intelligence services, the special counsel\u2019s office said on Friday.They also claimed he misled investigators pursuing a case unrelated to Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential race and whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin\u2019s operations.The special counsel\u2019s office detailed its allegations that Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, lied to prosecutors. (PDF, 10 pages, 6.13 MB)When he agreed to plead guilty to two conspiracy charges and cooperate with prosecutors in September, Mr. Manafort, 69, had hoped that prosecutors would help him convince two federal judges that he merited a lighter punishment for his crimes. He faces at least 10 years in prison as a result of two prosecutions for charges ranging from bank fraud to conspiracy to obstruct justice and is expected to be sentenced early next year.Though he had told prosecutors earlier that he had \u201cno direct or indirect communications\u201d with any Trump administration official while they were in government, Mr. Manafort had in fact kept in touch with a senior official through February 2018, prosecutors said. And three months later, in May, he authorized someone else to speak with a Trump appointee on his behalf, they wrote.They also detailed additional contacts with administration officials, citing a search of his documents. They did not identify the officials or detail the reasons for the contacts.Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has left open the possibility that it could file new charges of lying against Mr. Manafort. His lawyers say he believes he was honest during his interviews with the special counsel\u2019s office.The prosecutors sought about four years in prison for Mr. Cohen when he is sentenced next week for lying to Congress about the extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Moscow, as well as for campaign finance violations and other charges.In Friday\u2019s filing, prosecutors blacked out much of the information related to Mr. Kilimnik but revealed that some of it had been uncovered in emails and testimony. They claimed that Mr. Manafort lied about various interactions and meetings with him, as well as about his involvement with witnesses who might testify against Mr. Manafort.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik remained in touch even after their business in Ukraine came to an end. After Mr. Manafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016, the two men traded emails discussing how to use Mr. Manafort\u2019s position for financial gain. Mr. Kilimnik also traveled to the United States to meet with Mr. Manafort.This year, prosecutors have claimed, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik teamed up to try to persuade two witnesses to lie about the scope of the Ukraine work in order to protect Mr. Manafort. Both men were charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice, one of the felonies to which Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty in September.The prosecutors also said Mr. Manafort misled them about the reason for the $125,000 wire transfer of funds in 2017 \u2014 claiming it was money owed to him as income or as repayment of a debt \u2014 and gave \u201cinconsistent statements\u201d about the source of the money.Associates of Mr. Manafort\u2019s said the money was funneled through a political action committee called Rebuilding America Now, set up in the summer of 2016 to help Mr. Trump\u2019s then-cash-starved campaign. Spending $23 million, it was one of the biggest sources of funds for polls and advertisements on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf.Mr. Manafort, who then headed the Trump campaign, dispatched two longtime friends, Laurance Gay and Ken McKay, to run the operation. Neither could be reached for comment.Most of the committee\u2019s funds came from several big donors: Linda McMahon, a professional wrestling executive who donated $6 million and was appointed by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration; Bernard Marcus, who co-founded Home Depot; and Geoffrey H. Palmer, a California real estate developer. Each gave $5 million.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

But this fall, she took part in a modest graduation ceremony of a different sort.Ms. Arrunategui and 33 peers, who have all faced obstacles and disadvantages ranging from poverty to difficulties at home, recently celebrated completing the Intern and Earn program, a 12-week paid internship program for people 16 to 24.During a graduation dinner in late October, Ms. Arrunategui, 20, put aside her natural shyness and stood to thank her fellow students and the instructors, exuding a newfound self-assurance.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have spoken up at all,\u201d she said afterward, \u201cbut I love them, and I\u2019m doing this for them.\u201dThe group at the Rainhas Churrascaria steakhouse in Corona, Queens, was the 22nd group to complete the program, originally called the Young Adult Internship Program when it started in 2011. Participants undergo extensive assessment by the agency to determine what is preventing them from achieving success in school, at work or in their home lives.\u201cYou might have fallen off track, but it\u2019s normal,\u201d said Michael Hornung, the manager of the Intern and Earn program. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you back on track.\u201dAt the graduation ceremony, dinner featured small towers of bacon-wrapped meats, spice-slathered chicken wings, cuts of picanha and prime beef, and slices of grill-roasted pineapple. After the meal, each participant received a certificate and was invited to give a speech. A few participants were acknowledged for traits and skills that rose above expectationsThe program starts with a three-week paid training period that teaches participants how to conduct themselves professionally and strengthens their confidence. Then they are placed in a nine-week internship that provides hands-on experience in a variety of workplaces, including the offices of local politicians and nonprofit organizations.Students take personality quizzes to assess their strengths and weaknesses and uncover possible career paths. They attend workshops aimed at improving language and communications skills or overcoming disabilities.\u201cA lot of participants drop out of high school because they have dyslexia, A.D.D., A.D.H.D.,\u201d said Mr. Hornung, who shares with the participants that he has dyslexia as a way of encouraging them to overcome difficulties.The respect given to the participants and the lack of judgment resonated with Ms. Arrunategui, who is working toward her high school equivalency diploma.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be ashamed of whatever circumstances you have when you come in,\u201d she said.The program helped her land an internship at Biscuits and Bath, a dog day care. Ms. Arrunategui, an avid animal lover who keeps two geckos and a snake as pets, said her dream is to work with jungle cats on a reserve or sanctuary in Africa or Australia.The dinner provides a chance for participants to celebrate, and it is also a final learning experience. In previous years, many graduates of the program said they needed additional training in professional and social interactions. A meal at a restaurant lets them practice etiquette with their peers and instructors.Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens paid for the students to attend the dinner in October with $2,025 in Neediest Cases funds.For Christopher Jaigopaul, 24, the benefits of a daily routine\u2019s structure and the opportunity to take on responsibility were invaluable. Intern and Earn placed him at a job with Walgreens in East Elmhurst, Queens. Now that the program has ended, Mr. Jaigopaul is looking for jobs closer to his home.

{"Headline": "Roberto Suazo C\u00f3rdova, Ex-President of Honduras, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoberto Suazo C\u00f3rdova, a country doctor who was president of Honduras in the 1980s as the country was becoming the main United States base for proxy wars in neighboring Nicaragua and El Salvador, died on Saturday in Tegucigalpa, the capital. He was 91.His death, following surgery in a military hospital, was confirmed by Carlos Roberto Flores, a former president of Honduras and a former chief of staff to Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova.Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova was the first civilian president of Honduras after nearly a decade of military rule in a Central American country that had been dominated by the military through most of its history.But his authority was limited. The commander of the armed forces, Gen. Gustavo \u00c1lvarez Mart\u00ednez, remained the most powerful figure in Honduras, inviting the United States to train and arm anti-Nicaraguan government forces \u2014 known as the Contras \u2014 on Honduran soil and serving as the point man for United States officials as they poured tens of millions of dollars into defeating the communists in Nicaragua and El Salvador.Still, Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova came to symbolize an overeager embrace of American political ambitions in a country where Washington and American companies had often called the shots.\u201cHe completely and willingly did everything the Americans wanted,\u201d said Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle, a historian, former minister of culture and a presidential candidate in Honduras in the early 1990s.Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova\u2019s main accomplishment, some Americans and Hondurans said, may have been to hold together a nominally civilian government and turn over the presidency to another civilian. In its 161 years of independence before Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova took office, Honduras had endured 385 armed rebellions, 126 governments and 16 constitutions.\u201cThere was always a lot of apprehension, mistrust between the military and the politicians,\u201d said Mr. Flores, who was president of Honduras from 1998 to 2002 and is now an owner of a company that runs the newspapers La Tribuna and El Pa\u00eds and a television station. \u201cIt was a hard transition.\u201dIt was late in the Cold War when Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova became president, in 1982. Washington saw allies of the Soviet Union advancing in Latin America. Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova and General \u00c1lvarez worried that communism could spread to Honduras, a country the size of Tennessee with a population of about 4 million. The Americans and Hondurans wanted to overthrow the Marxist Sandinista government in Nicaragua and help the government in El Salvador defeat leftist guerrillas.Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians died in the fighting before the United States abandoned its campaign against the Sandinistas and the warring sides in El Salvador agreed to a truce. Scores of Hondurans were kidnapped, tortured and killed as political enemies. Human rights groups accused General \u00c1lvarez of directing death squads.When the United States Congress cut funding to the Contras, the Reagan administration raised money by illegally selling weapons to Iran in what became known as the Iran-Contra Affair.Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova loudly proclaimed his animosity toward communism and several times met with President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush in Washington. Mr. Reagan stopped briefly on a Central America trip to talk with Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova in Honduras, and Mr. Bush once went to see him at his home in the small farm town of La Paz, northwest of the capital.The military is still perhaps the most powerful institution in Honduras; it stepped in to depose President Manuel Zelaya in 2009. Six civilian presidents had followed Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova into office. Since the coup, two more civilians have been elected, one for a second term.Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova did not aspire to lofty social goals, former American and Honduran officials said. Nor did he leave much of a mark on the many social problems that had become deeply woven into the life of one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, now struggling with one of the highest murder rates in the world.As a politician, Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova played up his rural origins, often wearing a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. He had a playful, rough-edged and disarming way of talking, said Cresencio S. Arcos Jr., an American diplomat who worked closely with him in the early 1980s and was ambassador to Honduras from 1989 to 1993.But, Mr. Arcos said, Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova had a steely core. In early 1984 he sided with dissident military officers who had put a gun to General \u00c1lvarez\u2019s head and shipped him out of the country. Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova was the godfather of a child of the coup leader, Col. Walter Lopez Reyes of the air force.Later, friends of General \u00c1lvarez tried to assassinate Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova. The F.B.I. discovered the plot in Miami. Ultimately, General \u00c1lvarez\u2019s former chief of staff, an arms dealer he had befriended, and several others were sent to prison. The plot, investigators said, was going to be financed from the sale of cocaine smuggled into Florida. General \u00c1lvarez returned to Honduras and was killed in 1989 in an ambush near his home in the capital.In December 1982, a daughter of Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova\u2019s, Dr. Judith Xiomara Suazo Estrada, then 33, was kidnapped by guerrillas in Guatemala, held for 10 days and released after Guatemala and more than a dozen Latin American newspapers agreed to publish a statement by the guerrillas describing Honduras as the \u201cimperialist headquarters for the invasion of Nicaragua.\u201d The guerrillas referred to Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova as \u201cthe buffoon of the imperialist plans.\u201dMr. Suazo Cordova suffered a heart attack in the summer of 1983, when he was 55. He was treated at an American field hospital in Honduras and then flown by the United States to Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, according to John Negroponte, who worked closely with Mr. Suazo Cordova as the American ambassador in Honduras from 1981, just before Mr. Suazo Cordova was elected, until 1985. (Critics of United State policy in Honduras often focused on Mr. Negroponte. They sometimes referred to him derogatorily as the proconsul and as the third member of a ruling triumvirate.)Mr. Suazo Cordova had once been a hard drinker. \u201cWhen I first met him,\u201d Mr. Negroponte said, \u201cHe would tell you he hadn\u2019t had a drink for years and he would tell you the day he stopped and how long it had been since then.\u201dRoberto Suazo C\u00f3rdova was born in La Paz on March 17, 1927, the youngest of five children of Julian Suazo and Matilde Cordova. His father owned a small farm and was governor of the province of La Paz in the 1930s.Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova had six children with four women, said Jorge Canahuati, the chief executive of a company that publishes the newspapers Diario La Prensa and Diario El Heraldo. Besides his daughter Dr. Suazo Estrada, his survivors include three other children, Joseph Julian Suazo Cervantes, Socorro Maria Suazo Cervantes and Carmen Chavarria.Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova graduated in 1949 from a combined undergraduate and medical program at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala. He worked in a hospital in Guatemala City for four years, then went home to practice medicine for 25 years in La Paz and begin his career as a politician.Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova served several terms in Congress and three times helped rewrite the Constitution. Under pressure from Washington and some Honduran business leaders, the military agreed to permit elections in 1981. Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova had become the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the leader of the Liberal Party, Modesto Rodas Alvarado.After Mr. Rodas died in 1979, Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova became the party\u2019s leader and, later, its presidential candidate. Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova won the election in 1981 with 53 percent of the vote.Toward the end of his presidency 32 years ago, Mr. Suazo C\u00f3rdova maneuvered to get another two years in office. The idea was rejected, and he eventually lost the leadership of the Liberal Party.He went home to La Paz to tend his small dairy farm. At one point he persuaded the government to renovate a building in La Paz as a cultural center. But he never again ventured into national politics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michigan\u2019s Lawmakers Took Aim at Incoming Democrats, but the Hits Were Mostly Minor", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichigan\u2019s Republican-dominated Legislature opened its lame-duck session last month amid claims that it was ready to take actions similar to what its counterparts in Wisconsin and North Carolina had done: Cripple Democratic opponents who had won crucial state posts and limit voters who had pushed policy changes.By the end of a session marked by frequent protests, state lawmakers had passed bills that restricted the rule-making authority of the incoming Democratic administration led by Gretchen Whitmer, the governor-elect, and that prevented the disclosure of \u201cdark money\u201d donors who bankroll thinly veiled political campaigns by nonprofit advocacy groups.The latter move appeared aimed at reining in the power of Ms. Whitmer and the newly elected attorney general, Dana Nessel, also a Democrat, to manage state legal affairs without interference.Earlier in the session, the Republican majority had moved to limit ballot initiatives, passing legislation that effectively gutted citizen campaigns to raise the minimum wage and expand paid sick leave.Whether the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, who is leaving office, will sign all of the measures is a question. So far, Mr. Snyder has signed only the minimum-wage and sick-leave bills, as well as the measure limiting state regulatory authority.Opponents have said they believe Mr. Snyder, who has cast himself as more interested in good policy than bare-knuckled politics, will veto some measures.Many other contentious bills that once seemed likely to pass fell by the wayside during the two-week-plus session, deterred in part by throngs of demonstrators that spilled into the Capitol, often chanting slogans directed at the lawmakers.\u201cThere\u2019s been a ton of public pressure,\u201d Shelli Weisberg, the legislative director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, said. \u201cPeople have been at committee hearings nonstop.\u201dOther measures were softened. Republican lawmakers stripped a provision from an education bill that would have created a state commission to usurp the power of the state Board of Education, which gained a Democratic majority in November\u2019s election.Over protesters\u2019 objections, they enacted legislation to place restrictions on a ballot initiative overwhelmingly approved by voters last month that makes it easier for citizens to register and vote. But the restrictions, which primarily would limit where new voters could register, were eased in the Legislature\u2019s final hours.Republicans also dropped an attempt to shift campaign-finance oversight from the next secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, to a bipartisan commission whose members, critics said, would be perennially deadlocked on any issues.A bill requiring a majority of trade union members to vote to recertify their representation every two years \u2014 targeting a core Democratic constituency that already had been significantly weakened under Republican rule \u2014 failed to clear the State Senate.Democrats and even some Republicans said that the measures that did pass were, by Michigan standards, unusually partisan. But Wisconsin\u2019s and North Carolina\u2019s Republican-led Legislatures went far beyond Michigan in seeking to neuter Democrats.Among many such changes in Wisconsin, for example, the legislators diluted the veto powers of Tony Evers, the Democratic governor-elect, and eliminated the solicitor general post in the attorney general\u2019s office, hindering any efforts to challenge Republican-enacted laws. North Carolina\u2019s Legislature spent part of its regular session seeking to sap the power of the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, over judicial selection; in its lame-duck session, the lawmakers replaced a voter ID law that has been struck down as racially biased.Michigan\u2019s Democrats nevertheless say the state\u2019s Republicans are following their colleagues\u2019 leads. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this comes from a national playbook by the G.O.P.,\u201d the Democratic leader in the State House, Sam Singh, said in an interview. \u201cI think it will have long-term implications.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You\u2019re physically required to be in that space,\u201d said Lisa Panting, a co-founder of Hollybush Gardens, the east London dealership that represents Ms. Prodger, who has been chosen to represent Scotland at next year\u2019s Venice Biennale. \u201cIt\u2019s not like watching a video on YouTube,\u201d she added.Ms. Panting said \u201cBridgit\u201d had been produced in an edition of three. Versions have been sold to the Arts Council of England, a public body that funds cultural events, and the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, for less than \u00a350,000 each, according to Ms. Panting. She said she did not know when or where the film could be seen after the show at Tate Britain closes on Jan. 6.In his groundbreaking 1936 essay, \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Production,\u201d the philosopher Walter Benjamin wrote how the \u201caura\u201d of an original work of art \u201cwithers\u201d the more it is reproduced. But now in the digital age, high resolution illustrations have become so accurate and ubiquitous that we feel we \u201cknow\u201d certain artworks, particularly paintings, without seeing them in the original. By contrast, creators of videos or performances can feel their work is diminished by mass reproduction.\u201cToday I work with artists making film-based works who are wondering whether they should distribute them through Amazon Prime or Netflix,\u201d said Mr. Eccles of Bard. \u201cBut then is it an artwork or not?\u201dThe art market and public institutions can seem at times to be far-distant worlds. One fetishizes the historical prestige of painting; the other, multidisciplinary experimentation. But of course the two worlds overlap all the time.The London branch of the international dealership Hauser & Wirth, for example, is currently showing \u201cToast,\u201d a museum-quality selling exhibition of recent works by the British conceptual artist Martin Creed, who won the Turner Prize in 2001.Free to the public, the show includes his trademark numbered works in painting, drawing, sculpture, textile, music, performance and video. \u201cWork No. 3071\u201d is a bronze of a piece of toast spread with gold peanut butter, priced at $35,000. The gallery is periodically darkened for a performance and videos, including the film \u201cDifficult Thoughts,\u201d showing the artist repeatedly bending 90 degrees in a busy London street. Again, these have to be experienced in person in the gallery and can\u2019t be viewed online.The title of Mr. Kahn\u2019s documentary derives from an interview with Mr. Edlis, the collector.

{"Headline": "Surviving a Criminal Presidency", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo one is above the law in America. Opinion ColumnistIt is very possible that the president of the United States is a criminal. And it is very possible that his criminality aided and abetted his assumption of the position. Let that sink in. It is a profound revelation.Stop there.Yes, there is still information dribbling out about Trump\u2019s efforts to build a tower in Moscow during the election and about his campaign\u2019s ties with Russians during the campaign. Yes, there is the question of obstruction of justice, which I believe has already been proven by Trump\u2019s own actions in public. Yes, there are all the people in Trump\u2019s circle who have been charged with or have admitted to lying about any number of things, including their contacts with Russians.But beyond all that, we now have an actual, and one assumes provable, crime. A federal crime. And the president is its architect.Trump likes to say on the issue of immigration that if we don\u2019t have a border, we don\u2019t have a country. I say that if we don\u2019t have justice, we also don\u2019t have a country.America is a country of laws, and if we are to believe that, and not allow that to become a perversion, no man or woman can be above the law.As Thomas Paine wrote in his 1776 pamphlet \u201cCommon Sense\u201d: And yet, Trump, his team and to some degree his supporters in Congress seem to view Trump as very much above the law \u2014 or at least some laws. The defense is bizarre: Since he is the president, there are laws he isn\u2019t obliged to obey. In other words, it is permissible for him to break some laws, but not others.This all holds the potential to further make a mockery of a system of justice that already privileges power.And yet, people keep making excuses for Trump: \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet seen evidence of collusion.\u201d \u201cYes, he lies, but that\u2019s mostly rhetoric.\u201d \u201cSo what; he paid off a porn star to spare his family shame.\u201dNo, no, no.According to prosecutors, Trump directed Cohen to commit a felony. Then he lied about it and either allowed or instructed others to lie about it on his behalf. He misled the American people through a conspiracy of lies, and he did so to help attain, and then maintain, his presidency.There simply must be consequences for such a brazen act of lawlessness.Now, I am under no illusion that Trump will be indicted as a sitting president or that any efforts to impeach him will prove successful.But at some point his term will end, and at that point the statute of limitations may not have expired. As The Times put it, \u201cThe prosecutors in New York have examined the statute of limitations on the campaign finance violations and believe charges could be brought against Mr. Trump if he is not re-elected, according to a person briefed on the matter.\u201dThe statute of limitations for campaign finance violations is five years. Re-election may well be Trump\u2019s only hope of evading justice.But that also gives voters enormous power in 2020.

{"Headline": "Going, Going, Gone: Explaining Auction Houses\u2019 Executive Exodus", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s been a memorable year in the art world, not for what happened, but for who left.Mr. Gouzer is the third prominent auction house executive whose departure has been announced recently. On Nov. 21, Christie\u2019s said that Francis Outred, its head of postwar and contemporary art in Europe, would be leaving. On Dec. 3, Sotheby\u2019s said that Adam Chinn, its chief operating officer, would also be stepping down, with his role eliminated.Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive of Christie\u2019s, said in an email to The New York Times that the auction house would \u201cprimarily count on our existing teams in Europe and in New York\u201d to replace Mr. Gouzer and Mr. Outred. \u201cI strongly believe the real stars are the brand and the team,\u201d Mr. Cerutti added.\u201cThe equation is more complex today than ten years ago and even than five years ago,\u201d said Mr. Cerutti. \u201cWinning deals or convincing the owners to sell has become more sophisticated.\u201dChristie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, as well as their would-be rival Phillips, frequently find themselves competing to offer the most generous possible terms to finance-savvy owners of multimillion dollar artworks.Sellers at this level are not charged commission, leaving the auction houses to tempt them with higher valuations and bigger percentages of the fees they charge buyers. Increasingly these complex arrangements are pegged to a minimum price guarantee, with the guarantor earning a share of the profit if the work sells above that figure. It is a risky business, and auction houses like to pass on that risk to a third party, who guarantees the sale with a so-called \u201cirrevocable bid\u201d at the auction.Ed Dolman, chief executive of Phillips, said that third-party guarantees have \u201cchanged the dynamics\u201d of big-ticket auctions. \u201cYou prearrange the sale and execute it at the auction. Buyers are locked into deals, so they don\u2019t have the flexibility to bid on other lots,\u201d he added.Because of this, the risk of offering high-value lots that don\u2019t have guaranteed bidders has risen. In October, at Christie\u2019s in London, a Gerhard Richter skull painting and a Jeff Koons \u201cCracked Egg\u201d sculpture \u2014 both seemingly \u201cblue-chip\u201d contemporary masterworks, one estimated at $15 million and the other at $13 million \u2014 failed to sell.Sotheby\u2019s also took financial hits on third-party guarantees in May, when the $157.2 million Modigliani sold below its published estimate, and in June, when a Picasso undersold at $36 million.Official figures have yet to be released. However, Christie\u2019s (which, being a private company, doesn\u2019t have to report profits or losses in the way a listed company would) said it raised a total of $6.2 billion at auction in 2018, a 6 percent increase on the previous year. Total auction sales at Sotheby\u2019s were at least $5.2 billion, 13 percent up on 2017.\u201cNext year we\u2019re going to see a lot of recalibration,\u201d said Evan Beard, an art adviser in the wealth management unit of Bank of America. Mr. Beard said that the auction houses were already \u201cdampening down\u201d the expectations of sellers.\u201cThey\u2019re uninfluenced by interest rate rises and other things that happen in the wider economy,\u201d said Mr. Beard. \u201cTheir arbitrage unlocks the capital that allows the top end of the market to continue,\u201d he added, estimating that the most influential \u201cmega-collectors\u201d amounted to a group of about 40 individuals. \u201cIt\u2019s a small club.\u201dAnd that club isn\u2019t going anywhere.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect auction total for the objects comprising the David and Peggy Rockefeller Collection. The total reached $835.1 million, not $832.6 million.Advertisement"}

I had no idea how immoral Trump actually is.The fact that Trump would be directly implicated in a federal crime that took place on the verge of the election and may have helped hand that election to him is mind-blowing to me.Trump, for his part, lied about these payments and denied them \u2014 while also having those around him lie about them on his behalf \u2014 until he could simply no longer lie about them anymore. Then came the roulette wheel of revolving explanations that makes one dizzy because of their silliness.How can a family that can\u2019t run a charity run a country?But of course, that is not all. Nearly every aspect of Trump\u2019s life is now under investigation for wrongdoing, something I could not have foreseen.I could not have predicted the extraordinary lengths to which the president would go to obstruct justice and undermine the rule of law, nor that he would do these things in full view, for everyone to see.They are all wrong. This is huge, and the longer we pretend that it isn\u2019t, the more damage we do to the health and stability of our own country.While I am away, I will enjoy not having to follow the hourly insanities too closely, but every day I will worry about the republic in which we live. Trump has the capacity to damage or even destroy it. That\u2019s not hyperbole. That\u2019s an observation informed by a close reading of history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Towers of Pudong Took Root in Fields of Little Promise", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareOnce seen as the poor relation of Puxi, the Shanghai district grew into a financial powerhouse.Pudong \u2013 literally \u201ceast of Huangpu River\u201d \u2013 is Shanghai\u2019s growth engine and a shining symbol of China\u2019s modernization. Yet 40 years ago, when the nation launched reform and opened up, the area was mostly farmland.Although it was only a short hop across the river, locals had little interest in\u00a0Pudong as it was far less developed than Puxi, which was already a thriving industrial center.That all changed in April 1990, when the State Council, China\u2019s Cabinet, announced plans to develop\u00a0Pudong\u00a0into a dynamic new area. Today, the district accounts for 20 percent of the city\u2019s land, 25 percent of its population and a third of its GDP, according to official data.Pudong\u00a0New Area\u2019s GDP reached 965.1 billion yuan ($139.36 billion) last year \u2013 up from 6 billion yuan in 1990 \u2013 while its annual per capita disposable income was 60,715 yuan, higher than Shanghai\u2019s average of 58,988 yuan.Weng Zuliang, the district\u2019s Party secretary, said the rapid development from boondocks to boomtown can be divided into three stages.The initial stage, he said, ran from 1990 to 2000, when\u00a0Pudong\u00a0witnessed many firsts: the first finance and trading zone, the first export processing zone, the first bonded area, the first foreign-funded bank, and the first foreign-invested insurance company.Jin Liwang, a photographer who lived in Shanghai between 1996 and 2006, recalled that most of the high-rises that now fill\u00a0Pudong\u2019s skyline did not exist when he first arrived at Shanghai\u2019s Shiliupu Wharf.\u201cWhen I was accepted as an undergraduate student at Fudan University, 22 years ago, I had to take an overnight boat to Shanghai from Ningbo, Zhejiang province,\u201d he said, adding that in the early 2000s, the city\u2019s busy deep-water Yangshan Port was still just a shoal for fishermen.The former mud flat now boasts the world\u2019s largest automated container terminal, with a designed capacity of 6.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, the standard container measurement. It forms part of Shanghai Port, the world\u2019s largest container port.Weng said the second development stage was between 2000 and 2012. During that time,\u00a0Pudong\u00a0seized the opportunities that arose from China\u2019s ascension to the World Trade Organization in 2001 and hosted the 2010 World Expo.The district entered a third period of opening up and innovation-driven development in 2013 when it launched China\u2019s first free trade zone, which aimed to build Shanghai into an international center for finance, shipping, trade and technological innovation, Weng said.Since the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone was expanded in April 2015, the Lujiazui financial area in\u00a0Pudong\u00a0has seen fruitful results in opening the nation\u2019s finance sector to the world.Jiang Tai Reinsurance Brokers was founded there in December 2015. In addition to being China\u2019s first reinsurance company, it was also the first financial institution to obtain a business license before applying for an operating permit thanks to government efforts to cut red tape.Lujiazui is home to Shengang Securities, founded in 2016, the first stock brokerage joint venture between the mainland and Hong Kong; COSCO Shipping Captive Insurance, the country\u2019s first shipping insurance company, launched in 2017; and China\u2019s first wholly foreign-owned nonprofit vocational training institute, established in 2016 by global professional service provider PricewaterhouseCoopers.After central regulators announced plans to further open up the financial sector early this year, Shanghai has again made early inroads.In late March, the city unveiled yuan-denominated crude oil futures contracts, the first open to overseas investors.Willis Towers Watson, the risk management and insurance intermediary headquartered in London, also won approval on April 27 to expand its scope in Shanghai, meaning it can now carry out the same business as domestic insurers. It was the first company to benefit from the relaxation in policies governing foreign insurance firms.\u201cThe goal has always been to build Lujiazui into a world-class financial hub,\u201d said Guo Zhiying, deputy director of the Shanghai FTZ\u2019s Lujiazui administrative bureau.\u201cThe innovative results at the FTZ have become an important driver for regional economic development and helped improve the core competitiveness of Lujiazui.\u201dThe next couple of years will be key for\u00a0Pudong\u00a0as development of the FTZ and technological center is rolled out, said Hang Yingwei, head of the district government.He added that Shanghai aims to grow its GDP at an annual rate of 8 percent and reach per capita GDP of more than $30,000 by 2021.By Wang Ying and Shi Jing The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

{"Headline": "How to Finally Write Your Nonfiction Book", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo, it will not be easy. Yes, it will be rewarding. (Eventually.)\u201cI\u2019d like to write a book someday.\u201dMost authors would probably agree that writing a book is one of the most difficult challenges of their careers. You spend your summer inside writing while your friends post photos of their beach vacations on Instagram. Once your book is published, the work is far from over: You must now sell it like your career depends on it, because it kind of does. Failure is a constant fear, and impostor syndrome can feel overwhelming. But more often than not, it\u2019s also completely worth it.Before you write your first word, ask yourself: Do I have an audience? And, most important: Does my idea actually appeal to readers?Building an audience isn\u2019t a prerequisite, of course, and it\u2019s certainly not easy, but publishers like authors who come with a built-in market.Many aspiring authors assume that getting started means cranking out tens of thousands of words before you approach an agent or publisher, but it might depend on the book. If you have an idea for a nonfiction book, it\u2019s better to write a couple of chapters and then pitch a book proposal. That way, you can see if there\u2019s any interest before you churn out 80,000 words on a given topic.Even though you might not need to write the entire book before pitching it, it\u2019s likely that if an agent or potential publisher likes the idea, they\u2019ll still want to see at least two sample chapters. In any case, you\u2019re going to want to fully flesh out your idea and write up those sample chapters before reaching out to agents, or, if you\u2019re still building an audience, a few blog posts on your topic. Doing so will give you a deeper sense of what your book is about and what the rest of the writing process will be like \u2014 and this will also help you firm up your ideas of what the rest of the book will be like.With traditional publishing, you\u2019ll put together a book proposal, find an agent and then your agent will send your proposal to publishers. If those publishers like your idea, they could make you an offer. If multiple publishers like your idea your book might even go to auction, which could help you secure a more lucrative deal.Self-publishing also means your book will be available on only the platform you publish with, and it likely will never get on shelves in physical bookstores or libraries.Self-publishing means you have to do all of the work, like designing a cover and proofreading, yourself (or hire people to help).While an agent will likely want to see the completed manuscript of a novel, a nonfiction book typically requires a proposal, which is a detailed outline of what your book is and why it matters. Rather than thinking of your proposal as an introduction to the book, think of it as a business case for why it\u2019s worth a publisher\u2019s time and investment.\u201cIf it\u2019s a big New York publishing house, they\u2019re probably looking for an idea with relevancy or currency in the market, combined with an author who has a platform \u2014 visibility to the intended readership,\u201d Ms. Friedman said.Publishers also like to see numbers. Try to quantify your platform using metrics like your combined social media followers, newsletter subscribers or monthly page views on your blog.\u201cAn agent is a near-requirement if you want to be published by one of the major New York publishing houses,\u201d Ms. Friedman said. While you can approach smaller publishing houses and university presses directly, you\u2019ll still need someone to look over your contract. If not an agent, you\u2019ll need to hire a literary or intellectual property lawyer once you get to that step, she added.You may have to query multiple agents about your idea. Ideally, one of them will bite and want to represent you. Then, you\u2019ll have a helping hand through the rest of the process. The agent will pitch your book proposal or manuscript to publishers, which can lead to getting-to-know-you meetings with publishers and editors, or both. If a publisher loves your idea, your agent will then negotiate the contract and terms with input from you as needed. It sounds simple, but this can take much more time than many writers expect.You\u2019ll want to organize your writing workflow so you\u2019re encouraged to keep up with the habit every day.First figure out how much time you have to write each week, then schedule that writing time into your day. Some writers like to get their words out at night, after everyone has gone to bed. Others prefer to write as their first task of the day. Experiment with different times to find what works for you.\u201cYou will recognize a macro planner from his Post-Its, from those Moleskines he insists on buying. A macro planner makes notes, organizes material, configures a plot and creates a structure \u2014 all before he writes the title page. This structural security gives him a great deal of freedom of movement,\u201d Ms. Smith said in her lecture. Micro managers, on the other hand, have no master plan for their writing and simply figure out the ending when they get there.Again, a little trial and error works well. You can try to just start writing your first draft, and if you find yourself stuck, start again with the outline and work from there. Or you might just try to start writing about something that excites you.The most common question aspiring authors asked when I finished my book: How long did it take? It\u2019s hard to quantify how long it took, but writing a book is an exercise in patience.\u201cI think you should plan for at least one year to write the first draft of a book, and a second year to rewrite it,\u201d Ms. Perhach said. Of course, it can take much longer than this, but most writers can expect at least a couple of years to pen a book.\u201cWriting is like putting together Ikea furniture,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a right way to do it, but nobody knows what it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Putin\u2019s personal life has unraveled \u2014 just a little \u2014 with an interview broadcast on state television with a woman who has been described as his daughter.The interview suggested some softening of Mr. Putin\u2019s steely image and the prospect that his two adult daughters may be easing into public life.Russia has no enduring tradition of a public first family, and Soviet and post-Soviet leaders have taken various approaches. Mr. Putin, a former spy, has mostly kept his daughters out of sight.The coverage, as fawning as that accorded to Mr. Putin, portrayed the research as groundbreaking and vital for Russian technology, suggesting an emerging role for Ms. Tikhonova as a champion of Russian science.Her appearance on state television suggests a potential public role for the presidential family, a fraught topic in Russian political culture since Soviet times, Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York and a granddaughter of the former Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, said in a phone interview.Joseph Stalin kept his family cloistered from public view, even while promoting his sons in the army, but in 1959 Mr. Khrushchev toured the United States with his family, Ms. Khrushcheva said. President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s daughter was a public figure in the 1990s, before Mr. Putin reversed course.The apparent shift now, amid sagging ratings in the polls for Mr. Putin, \u201cis a way to show the family is involved in building Russia, and it\u2019s not just Putin sitting in the Kremlin,\u201d Ms. Khrushcheva said. \u201cIt was to show that his girl, his family, is putting a stamp on the future, on science, on the future of Russia.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s youngest daughter, born Yekaterina V. Putina while her father was posted in Germany as a spy, is now 32. Her mother, Lyudmila Putina, mostly vanished from public view midway through Mr. Putin\u2019s tenure, and the two divorced in 2013. She has since reportedly remarried.Putting Ms. Tikhonova on television, Ms. Khrushcheva said, is showing Russians that \u201cthere\u2019s more than one Putin working for us.\u201dFor the television program, Ms. Tikhonova was interviewed in front of a computer graphic of a head seemingly wired to electrodes. Plugged into these devices, she said, \u201cyou can really say that a person realizes the potential of technology, and himself, at the same time.\u201dThe Kremlin has declined to comment on Ms. Tikhonova\u2019s identity. During the television show, she was identified as \u201cdirector of Innopraktika and deputy director of the Institute of Mathematical Study of Complex Systems at Moscow State University.\u201dMs. Tikhonova\u2019s marriage to Kirill N.

The new temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva in their father\u2019s honor, is now being investigated for the same kind of self-dealing and fraud the family is accused of mastering in South Africa.The rise and fall of the Gupta brothers is so improbable that in Saharanpur their story is told like a parable.They began by selling shoes in South Africa and swiftly became central figures in the nation\u2019s post-apartheid history, outsiders who broke into the very pinnacle of political power. Seemingly overnight, they joined the ranks of South Africa\u2019s most influential families, playing a leading role in one of the biggest dramas after the end of apartheid: Who is getting rich, and how?Mr. Mandela\u2019s election as president in 1994 set off a scramble by leaders in his party, the African National Congress, to amass wealth. The early ones succeeded through ties with rich white South Africans. Many others turned to the brothers from Saharanpur.The Guptas found eager partners at all levels of the A.N.C., from bureaucrats to a sitting president, Jacob Zuma, according to dozens of interviews by The New York Times, as well as government investigators, international auditors, emails from a Gupta company, financial records and court documents.Seizing on a chance encounter with a South African official in India decades ago, the three brothers cultivated ties to the governing party so expertly that it became difficult to draw the line between their business empire and the president\u2019s office.They made one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s sons a business partner, enabling them to buy a coal mine through government intervention and set up a media business that the president helped guide himself, according to officials, company emails and people involved in the ventures. The president responded in kind, handing them control over strategic cabinet selections and the boards of state-owned enterprises.The Guptas recruited other senior A.N.C. officials by giving them secret cuts of lucrative contracts from the state\u2019s utility and rail companies, government investigators say. They acted as fixers for multinational companies, like the German software giant SAP, which paid them kickbacks in return for government business, documents show.Even in far-flung rural corners of South Africa, they found A.N.C. officials ready to divert money meant to help the poor.But the story of the Guptas \u2014 who landed in the country a year before the end of apartheid in 1994 and left with Mr. Zuma\u2019s fall \u2014 is also the story of South Africa under the A.N.C.\u201cThe Guptas were so egregious and big-time that they are a story on their own,\u201d said R.W. Johnson, a historian of South Africa. \u201cBut the thing that amazes is that this is only 20 years on from an African nationalist revolution, and here are all these guys happily selling their country down the river.\u201dThey flew everywhere: across oceans in their own planes, to their own helipad here in Saharanpur, to Hindu temples in the Himalayas.And they became so powerful that they clashed with the Oppenheimers \u2014 the family that once owned the De Beers diamond company and the mining giant Anglo American \u2014 whose influence in South Africa had been unrivaled for a century.But as the Guptas brandished their power, they incited a backlash, not only from ordinary South Africans, but also from a far more powerful constituency: the white-led business establishment and its allies, both increasingly worried that the brothers were putting the country\u2019s economic health at risk.The Guptas\u2019 intimate role in steering the nation helped set off an electoral revolt that has already cost the A.N.C. control over South Africa\u2019s biggest cities and could jeopardize its hold on the presidency.From his self-imposed exile in Dubai, Ajay Gupta, 53, the oldest brother, denies all wrongdoing. As newcomers to South Africa, he said, he and his brothers have been turned into scapegoats.He points out that they face no criminal charges in South Africa, adding that their family empire is now bankrupt.But nothing angers him more than the temple.Far more than a gift to their hometown and a testament to their humble beginnings, the $28 million Shivadham Temple is now being investigated by the Indian authorities as the cornerstone of an elaborate scheme to launder \u201cillicit money\u201d from the Gupta fortune in South Africa.\u201cIt\u2019s a 1,000 percent lie,\u201d Mr. Gupta said in his first extensive interview since fleeing South Africa. \u201cI\u2019ll kill the person and I\u2019ll kill myself before I use a cent for this kind of a thing.\u201dIt all started with a few shirts.The father of the Gupta brothers, Shiv Kumar Gupta, owned a tiny shop that sold government rations, or subsidized food, here in Saharanpur. He was a pious, somewhat idiosyncratic man, who tossed bread to stray dogs from the basket of his bicycle on his way to the old temple every day, and he often spent nights meditating in its crematory.But he nurtured grand ambitions. One day, Mr. Gupta called over his oldest son, Ajay, to recount a newspaper article on the war between Iran and Iraq. The price of rice had skyrocketed there because, he told his son, all the traders had left the countries.\u201cBut somebody is going in,\u201d Ajay recalled his father saying. \u201cHe\u2019s getting this advantage because there\u2019s no competition.\u201dIn the 1980s, few people in Saharanpur left to seek their fortunes in places like China, Russia or South Africa. Most went to big cities like New Delhi, or to Britain or Canada.But to people who knew the family, the father\u2019s mind-set reflected that of the family\u2019s caste, the Banias, or traders. The brothers spoke proudly of their background, explaining why they were such good businessmen.So Ajay, who had already set up a computer import business in New Delhi, followed his father\u2019s advice and went looking for opportunities in Russia, China and Singapore.The middle brother, Atul, went to South Africa in 1993, right before it became a democracy. He kept going back, despite his family\u2019s misgivings.\u201cHe alone was the bullish one,\u201d Ajay recalled. \u201cHe loved the place.\u201dIn the years before and after the end of apartheid, South Africa, rattled by violence and political killings, seemed to be slipping into civil war. Many people with means, especially white South Africans, were packing into planes to London or Perth.But others \u2014 exiled South Africans and fortune-seekers \u2014 were flocking in. True to his father\u2019s teaching, Atul settled in Johannesburg and sold shoes downtown. Then he started a company \u2014 Sahara, named after the family hometown \u2014 importing computer parts and assembling them for sale.And by chance, he made a personal connection to the A.N.C. that would prove far more consequential.During a trip home to India, Atul met a South African of Indian origin in New Delhi: Essop Pahad, the right-hand man of Thabo Mbeki, who was then Mr. Mandela\u2019s deputy.In an interview, Mr. Pahad recalled that he had ordered some tailor-made Nehru-style shirts. But he had to return to South Africa before they were ready. Atul volunteered to pick them up and personally deliver them to Mr. Pahad\u2019s office in Johannesburg. After that, they ran into each other at functions at the Indian consulate.\u201cHe talked about Ajay a lot,\u201d Mr. Pahad said. \u201cThen I said, \u2018Who is this Ajay of yours?\u2019\u201dBy then, Ajay was head of the whole family.With their early ventures overseas, the Gupta brothers had found some success and bought their father his first car: a creamy white Contessa, the biggest made in India.But their father died a year later. Only Ajay made it back home in time to say goodbye. An hour before Mr. Gupta died, he gave his watch and ring to Ajay, who wears them to this day.With the responsibility of the family on his shoulders, he eventually moved everyone to Johannesburg.When Mr. Pahad finally met Ajay, he was immediately impressed. Ajay got the big picture in South Africa, and seemed to understand that there was a place in it for the Guptas.In fact, the opening was vast, and Ajay exploited it masterfully.In the late 1990s, as Mr. Mbeki prepared to become president, the A.N.C. government was worried about the enduring power of white South African businessmen and dependence on Western nations. Forging ties with countries like India and China could lessen their influence, Mr. Pahad said.Black South Africans had gained political power. But the white business elite, led by officials at Anglo American, had protected its own interests in the new South Africa.Long before the end of apartheid, Harry Oppenheimer, the head of the mining company, had led efforts to create \u2014 and co-opt, some historians say \u2014 a black elite.Mr. Mandela was particularly close to Mr. Oppenheimer, who gave him money, said Michael Spicer, a former executive at the company.\u201cHarry would say, \u2018It\u2019s important for the country that Mandela not be fussed with all of these problems,\u2019\u201d Mr. Spicer said.But nothing was free.Mr. Oppenheimer put together a team of economic advisers for Mr. Mandela called the Brenthurst Group \u2014 named after the Oppenheimers\u2019 palatial estate in Johannesburg. In meetings, A.N.C. leaders joined the country\u2019s top white businessmen to set the nation\u2019s post-apartheid economic course, Mr. Spicer said.Soon enough, Mr. Mandela, who had supported nationalizing the economy, endorsed pro-business policies. Some historians argue that the policies contributed to South Africa\u2019s income inequality, and to an economy still based on cheap black labor.But after becoming president, Mr. Mbeki moved to dampen the power of white businesses. He created his own group, which met at his residence each month, Mr. Pahad said. It included cabinet ministers, top businessmen, rising stars in the A.N.C. and an unknown figure: Ajay Gupta.Ajay said he enjoyed the meetings. Mr. Mbeki sometimes even dropped by for lunch.Only a few years after settling in South Africa, Ajay had forged links to the highest levels of the A.N.C., thanks to his friendship with Mr. Pahad.Mr. Pahad said that he had appointed Ajay to the group to help build ties to India, but that he had asked nothing of the brothers.After leaving government, however, Mr. Pahad acknowledged receiving favors from the family, including a loan of about $140,000 for a house, seats on the boards of two Gupta companies and help in starting a magazine.As the brothers\u2019 ties to the A.N.C. strengthened, their businesses began flourishing.In the early 2000s, they got their first big break: They won a large government contract to set up computer laboratories in schools in the nation\u2019s richest province.Then they went on a buying spree, acquiring a struggling information technology company that helped them become one of the biggest computer distributors in South Africa.They later bought a uranium mine, a steel manufacturer and other businesses.By the time Ajay was invited to join a separate advisory group \u2014 this one established by the Oppenheimers\u2019 foundation \u2014 he had a private plane, an eight-seat Hawker, said Mr. Spicer, who once hitched a ride aboard it.\u201cThe Guptas\u2019 plane flew in, the Oppenheimers\u2019 plane flew in,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cAnd, yes, there was always a bit of whose is longest.\u201dEven as the Guptas thrived off their ties to Mr. Mbeki\u2019s allies, they were reaching out to his archrival, Mr. Zuma, the No. 2 in the party.The two leaders fought bitterly. So Mr. Pahad, Mr. Mbeki\u2019s right-hand man, was surprised to learn that the Guptas had cultivated ties with the other side.\u201cThey were having some function at their home, and Ajay said to me, \u2018Do you mind if we invite Zuma?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pahad recalled.Money was an unspoken dynamic in the battle between Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Zuma: Who in the A.N.C. had gotten rich since the end of apartheid? And, perhaps more important, who had not?Mr. Mandela and some others \u2014 including South Africa\u2019s current president, Cyril Ramaphosa \u2014 became wealthy, in part through connections to white business leaders.During Mr. Mbeki\u2019s tenure, his allies got their chance, often by directing the course of the country\u2019s Black Economic Empowerment policies, which required white businesses to take on black partners.So when Mr. Zuma became president in 2009, it was his faction\u2019s turn.But Mr. Zuma, plagued by personal and political scandals, was distrusted by the white business establishment. And more than a decade after apartheid, many white businesses felt they had done enough to help \u2014 a sentiment that angered people close to Mr. Zuma.\u201cShould Anglo be allowed to say, \u2018We\u2019ve assisted Cyril Ramaphosa, so exonerate us?\u2019\u201d said Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane, Mr. Zuma\u2019s former mining minister. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201dCHINASaharanpurPAKISTANNew DelhiINDIAArabianSeaBay of BengalSRI LANKABy The New York TimesOne path to riches was still clear, though: government coffers.The Guptas hired or became business partners with the sons of powerful A.N.C. politicians, like Mr. Zuma\u2019s son Duduzane, and Tshepiso Magashule, the son of Ace Magashule, the party\u2019s current secretary general.It fell to the youngest of the Gupta brothers \u2014 the friendly and easygoing Rajesh, nicknamed Tony \u2014 to keep the sons happy. They went to nightclubs together and hung out in the family\u2019s compound in Johannesburg.The politicians\u2019 sons flew first class to Dubai and India, staying in the best rooms at high-end hotels, all at the Guptas\u2019 expense, according to emails from a Gupta-owned company leaked to South African news organizations and examined by The Times. One December, they joined the Gupta family on an extended vacation to Delhi, Dubai, New York and Venice, the emails show.In an interview, Mxolisi Dukwana, then Mr. Magashule\u2019s provincial minister of economic development, recalled how he and his boss went to visit Tony in Johannesburg. The president\u2019s son, Duduzane, was also there, he said.Tony asked Mr. Dukwana to endorse a large-scale development project in the province, promising him a monthly cut, Mr. Dukwana said.Tony added that he and the other two men in the room had a similar arrangement in a mining project, Mr. Dukwana said. He recounted Tony\u2019s saying that he \u201cpersonally gave\u201d monthly payments of about $71,000 each to Mr. Magashule and to the president\u2019s son.\u201cThen he asked them, \u2018Have I ever failed you?\u2019 And they both said no,\u201d Mr. Dukwana said.The three of them \u2014 Tony Gupta, Duduzane Zuma and Mr. Magashule \u2014 declined interview requests.Mr. Dukwana said he turned down the offer and thought he would never see Tony again.But a few years later, after Mr. Dukwana had left government, he said Tony invited him to Johannesburg. He sensed that Tony was hedging his bets \u2014 leaving open the possibility of a future relationship.Tony ended the meeting by handing him about $1,100, for \u201cpetrol.\u201d\u201cSo I took it,\u201d Mr. Dukwana said, \u201cand that was it.\u201dThe Guptas also gained great influence over the president and his affairs.According to witnesses in the government inquiry into the Zuma years, the Guptas had a say in choosing ministers, or even offered positions to candidates directly.When Mr. Zwane was appointed Mr. Zuma\u2019s mining minister in 2015 \u2014 one of the most important positions in the government \u2014 other politicians and industry officials were taken aback. He had been unknown on the national stage, and had no experience in mining.The Guptas, who had a stake in the project, sponsored a trip to India for Mr. Zwane and his church choir, according to the Gupta company emails. They paid for his first-class flight to Dubai and his stay at a five-star hotel.Then, as soon as he became mining minister, Mr. Zwane went to extraordinary lengths to help the brothers land a mining deal.The Guptas, along with Mr. Zuma\u2019s son as their business partner, had been trying to buy a troubled coal mine from Glencore, the Swiss commodities giant. Glencore had rejected the family\u2019s offer until Mr. Zwane, as mining minister, got directly involved.In Zurich in late 2015, Mr. Zwane and Tony Gupta met with the head of Glencore and persuaded him to sell the mine to the Guptas. After the meeting, Mr. Zwane flew out on the Guptas\u2019 private jet, according to the Gupta company emails. A Glencore spokesman declined to comment.Mr. Zwane\u2019s trip was an effort to \u201cunfairly and unduly influence a contract\u201d for the president\u2019s son, according to a report by the Public Protector\u2019s office, a government body that investigates corruption.But Ajay Gupta denied any \u201cinterference by Zwane.\u201d He said that his brother Tony had happened to be in Zurich on vacation and joined the meeting with Glencore.\u201cIt was a coincidence that my brother was there,\u201d Ajay said.In an interview, Mr. Zwane also denied improper ties with the Guptas, declining to answer questions about his trip to Zurich.But the relationship was so close that a Gupta employee coached Mr. Zwane after he was appointed minister, the leaked emails show.Days before Mr. Zwane was scheduled to address the South African news media, an executive at a Gupta company sent an email with detailed advice.If questioned about his role in the coal mine deal, he should call it a purchase \u201cby a black-owned consortium of which the Guptas form a part,\u201d enabling him to change \u201cthe complexion of the mining industry.\u201dDuduzane Zuma, the president\u2019s son, also helped the Guptas expand beyond mining. They started a newspaper and a television news station, ANN7, that thrived on government advertising, which their political connections easily secured.As in other projects, Duduzane Zuma was the Guptas\u2019 Black Economic Empowerment partner in the venture. But it was clear he was simply a proxy for the president, said Rajesh Sundaram, an Indian journalist who worked directly under Atul Gupta to start the channel.In meetings that Mr. Sundaram attended with the Guptas and the president, Mr. Zuma was intimately engaged in the network\u2019s launch, giving advice on everything from the background set for news presentations to the tone of the coverage, he said.At one meeting, the president expressed satisfaction with video of a rival politician getting out of a helicopter because it made him look \u201ccorrupt,\u201d Mr. Sundaram said.\u201cIt was actually Zuma who was acting like a business partner, not Duduzane,\u201d Mr. Sundaram said. \u201cHis son was there just goofing around, cracking jokes.\u201dSeeing how close the Guptas were with Mr. Zuma, Mr. Sundaram said he once asked Atul, \u201cWhat if Zuma goes?\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got everyone in our pocket,\u201d Atul replied, Mr. Sundaram recalled. \u201cMany in the A.N.C. are waiting and are desperate to get in touch with us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not fools to put all our eggs in one basket,\u201d Mr. Sundaram recounted Atul saying.Atul Gupta and Mr. Zuma declined to be interviewed.As the Gupta brothers prospered, they flaunted it.They enlisted a top Bollywood actor, Anil Kapoor, to produce a 2007 movie they financed, \u201cGandhi, My Father,\u201d touching on Gandhi\u2019s time in South Africa. Both Mr. Mandela and Mr. Mbeki publicly showered the Guptas with praise.But two events \u2014 both, as it turned out, related to planes \u2014 contributed to their undoing.In 2013, the brothers chartered a plane with about 200 guests from India to attend the extravagant wedding of a niece in Sun City, South Africa\u2019s Las Vegas. They invited relatives, friends, businessmen and politicians, mostly from India.\u201cThey needed to shout from the roof, \u2018Hey, we have arrived,\u2019\u201d said Amar Singh, a political figure in the Guptas\u2019 home province in India.But the brothers miscalculated. Using their political connections, they landed the plane near Sun City \u2014 at a military base. Its use by a private family set off a government inquiry, turning the Guptas into a favorite target of opposition politicians eager to expose corruption under Mr. Zuma.Ajay Gupta said he followed the rules to get permission and did not regret the lavish wedding.\u201cAfter that, we hand over the girl to the other family,\u201d Mr. Gupta said, tears welling in his eyes.Soon enough, the Guptas were embroiled in another drama, one that pitted them against the Oppenheimers, the family dynasty that had been South Africa\u2019s most powerful for a century.But the Oppenheimers couldn\u2019t get permission to handle international flights. Despite countless letters and calls to A.N.C. officials, the Oppenheimers were getting nowhere.Eventually, they sued the government, accusing the Guptas of using their political influence to stall the business. The brothers, the Oppenheimers said, wanted in on the terminal.According to court documents, the Guptas sent a message to the Oppenheimers that they had \u201cthe wrong B.E.E. partner\u201d \u2014 referring to the Black Economic Empowerment program. If the Oppenheimers chose a partner endorsed by the Guptas, the documents said, their \u201cproblems would go away.\u201dThe last straw was another appointment: In late 2015, Mr. Zuma chose an unknown lawmaker \u2014 considered close to the Guptas \u2014 as finance minister.Alarmed, the business establishment and its A.N.C. allies struck back, forcing Mr. Zuma to remove the minister after only four days.Within weeks, a major South African bank cut ties with the Gupta family. The country\u2019s other big banks followed.With the Guptas increasingly shut out of South Africa\u2019s economy, an Indian bank handed them a lifeline.For more than a decade, the Guptas had fostered relations with the South African branch of the Bank of Baroda, India\u2019s second-biggest national bank.When the bank\u2019s chief executive in South Africa asked for an internship for his son, the family obliged and even sent a round-trip ticket, according to the Gupta company emails. When the bank\u2019s employees needed help getting work visas from the South Africa bureaucracy, the Guptas obliged.After South Africa\u2019s banks cut ties with the Guptas, Baroda continued to do business with the brothers. Its chief executive in South Africa issued a letter of support when the Guptas moved to buy the coal mine from Glencore \u2014 without telling his superiors in India.In an interview in Mumbai, the bank\u2019s chief executive, P. S. Jayakumar, said branch employees did not collude with the Guptas.\u201cBank of Baroda is an Indian bank,\u201d Mr. Jayakumar said. \u201cGuptas are Indian. So there was a connection made and a lot of heightened observations made, all of which are not true.\u201dBut an investigation by the South African Reserve Bank, the nation\u2019s central bank, found that Baroda\u2019s internal systems had flagged about 4,000 suspicious transactions in the Guptas\u2019 accounts. Employees dismissed nearly all of the alerts \u201cwithout adequate reasons being provided,\u201d according to a confidential report by PwC, the international auditing firm, that was reviewed by The Times.Baroda announced this year that it would leave South Africa, but said the decision was unrelated to the Guptas.Here in Saharanpur, questions also emerged around the family\u2019s temple. A separate series of complicated bank transfers \u2014 intended, experts say, to hide the source of the money \u2014 was financing the construction, according to the Gupta company emails.Pressure from South Africa drove the Indian authorities to investigate. Officials raided the Guptas\u2019 properties in Saharanpur, saying they had information that the family had brought \u201cillicit money\u201d to India.The Guptas were getting nervous. Their most powerful ally, Mr. Zuma, was scheduled to step down as the A.N.C.\u2019s leader in late 2017. The brothers would soon find out whether they had eggs in more than one basket.Mr. Dukwana, the former official in Free State, said that right before the party election he got a call from Tony Gupta, who had given him gas money at their last meeting.Sounding \u201cbubbly,\u201d Tony told him he was calling from Dubai, Mr. Dukwana said.\u201cThey needed some friends,\u201d Mr. Dukwana said.The Gupta empire was getting squeezed. Locked out of banks, the brothers could not pay their employees or debts. Their only public company was delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange. South African companies, big and small, refused to do business with them.Cornered, they sold a mining company and their media empire in quick succession. Many of their remaining companies filed for bankruptcy protection and are now managed by outside supervisors.Mr. Zuma technically had more than a year left as South Africa\u2019s president. But it became clear he would be forced out much sooner.South Africans, predicting the end of the Guptas, began tracking the family\u2019s prized Bombardier Global 6000 jet as it traveled to Dubai, Russia, Switzerland and elsewhere.On Feb. 4, the Guptas turned off the jet\u2019s GPS tracking device, according to Canada\u2019s export credit agency, which had lent the Guptas $41 million to buy the Bombardier. The agency sued to get the plane back, saying the Guptas might use it \u201cto escape justice.\u201dSpeculation spread that Ajay Gupta had fled aboard his private jet. A South African pilot, who had supposedly refused to take off, briefly became a hero on Twitter. But they were just rumors.In fact, most of the family and their private jet were already in India for a wedding, Ajay said.And on Feb. 6, as the battle in the A.N.C. raged, Ajay boarded an Emirates red-eye flight to Dubai, airport officials later confirmed.On his last flight out, Ajay said, he kept to his normal routine, avoiding meals and movies. He closed his eyes and drifted off.Outside it was cloudy and windy. The plane banked north and flew up the continent\u2019s eastern coast, taking him out of Africa.Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

What she was doing was no different than what her employer had done to Facebook and what Facebook had done to their users. And had those users not valued the serendipitous reconnections with high school boyfriends, the ego strokes from bragging about their expensive vacations and their little child prodigies and a public forum in which to harangue their elected officials, they would not have put their private information out there.Facebook users understood that they had to give away a part of themselves for easy connections and the much-coveted limelight.Sofie tore off a hangnail with her teeth. She had become her father. She\u2019d thumbed her nose at his poker dens and bookie operation, signed her name to a boatload of student loans and declared independence. But after Cambridge Analytica gave her the boot without so much as a kind word or her last paycheck, she finally understood that money bought self-respect. Without self-respect, she was nothing.She returned to her auction site on the dark web. Still no action. Her reserve price had surfaced the four whales. Would she be showing weakness or, worse, desperation sending them a reminder? No, she was in charge, and she would demonstrate that with a final prod, a do-it-or-lose-forever stick-in-the-eye. Above all else, her bidders could not abide losing. Nor could they afford to.She began with Saeed, her Iranian contact. Micro-targeted spear phishing would be much more potent than the SQL injection and DDoS attacks they had used to cripple American banking websites. Her database would provide a rash of entry points for their malware to take down Saudi oil fields.Sal\u00e2am alaikum. Our auction ends in 4 minutes. Just between us, the Chinese are coming in with a billion at the close. I\u2019d rather you win AND stick it to the American infidels by paying me with their hostage ransom money. Are you going to let their crippling sanctions and the Israeli destruction of your priceless centrifuges go unanswered?She waited for a reply, but heard just the drumming of her own heart. She moved on to Pak, her North Korean connection. Their Reconnaissance General Bureau was at least 5,000 hackers strong and adept at brute force cyberattacks. Their email hack of Sony Pictures for the lampooning of their supreme leader had devastated the company. With Sofie\u2019s database, they could take down more financial institutions and military agencies, keep themselves on the world stage and finance their feeble economy at the same time.\uc815\uc2dd\uc5ec\ubcf4\uc138\uc694. Billion dollar bid just came in from your neighbor. Show your rivals you are no laughingstock. Long live North Korean strength, unpredictability and wily intelligence!Her laptop pinged. She pumped her fist: Her two messages were just opened.Three minutes and counting. Sofie forged ahead and considered how best to rile Misha. He represented a coalition that included the Russian government, wealthy oligarchs and criminal gangs. Should she emphasize the financial gain possible with the pairing of her database and the massive storehouse of credit card information that their mafia had already amassed? The opportunity to disrupt Western military, electrical and banking infrastructures? The ability to misinform, divide and reshape Western opinions? She went for the highest stake.\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0442. Auction for the weapon of the century is ending. The Chinese have sent in a kill bid. I\u2019m obligated to take it, but hey, I make the rules. I\u2019d prefer my database be used to change elections and blackmail hypocritical, holier-than-thou American politicians. And smarmy British toadies. And German rats. You have 90 seconds to win this.With less than 2 minutes left, she considered ignoring Lao Da. The Chinese had ticked her off with two insultingly low \u201cfill-or-kill\u201d bids and then threatened to walk away. They returned each time though, unabashed. They had more resources than all of the other bidders combined and were above spear phishing for petty gains. By combining Sofie\u2019s database with the 22 million U.S. Office of Personnel Management files in their possession, they could steal intellectual properties and military secrets at will for their industrial and state-owned operations.The Russians have come to play with a cool billion. Can you do better??? You have 30 seconds to enter your final bid.Watching her clock tick down, Sofie dug the tip of her father\u2019s lucky Montblanc \u2014 the one he reserved for his second set of books \u2014 into her thigh. She smiled picturing him tossing his apartment for it and cursing her.At 00:30, her message box began to ding. She was right. Auctions happened in the last seconds. Her body went limp with relief.$525 million final bid, $530 million, $505 million and $509 million.The bastards were colluding. Not only did they disregard her billion-dollar threat, their bids were obscenely close. Someone had unlocked the multilayer state-of-the-art security on her site and contacted their rivals. Of course they did. She was dealing with the best hackers in the world. Sofie\u2019s head pounded with rage.She should invalidate the auction and start over. The thought depressed her. It had taken her nearly a year to disguise her identity, set up her site, get the word out, vet all the players and create an airtight verification process. Moreover, portions of her data were time sensitive.By colluding, they would all get her database, so why shouldn\u2019t they each pay her price? They had invalidated the auction. A new game was in play.A corner of her lip crooked upward as Sofie crafted her message. She congratulated each player for winning the auction at their submitted bid and enclosed an OAuth token \u2014 good for 1 minute only \u2014 that would unlock the encryption keys to her database upon the transfer of funds. One way or another, she would get her billion dollars.Maggie Shen King is author of \u201cAn Excess Male,\u201d published by Harper Voyager in 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigeria Says Soldiers Who Killed Marchers Were Provoked. Video Shows Otherwise.", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byABUJA, Nigeria \u2014 The message sent on Twitter was clear: When Nigerian soldiers opened fire on rock-throwing protesters in late October, Nigerian officials swiftly defended them, saying their forces had simply done what President Trump told American soldiers to do in the same situation.Nigeria\u2019s defense came after its soldiers had shot at protesters \u2014 members of a minority Shiite organization \u2014 marching on the outskirts of the capital, Abuja. The military insisted that the soldiers had taken action only after being provoked by the protesters, who hurled rocks at them. Ten soldiers were injured in the melee, it said. The military also said a total of six protesters were killed during marches.But a close review of video from the largest and most deadly of the protests, as well as interviews with more than a dozen witnesses, clearly shows the military opening fire on unarmed demonstrators, sometimes shooting indiscriminately into the crowd at close range as people turned and tried to flee.Photos and videos recorded that day show at least 26 bodies. The group said it had collected a total of 49 bodies during four days of protests.Now Mr. Buhari is facing re-election in February, and his critics are pointing to a new unraveling of the security situation across Nigeria that has rattled citizens in all corners of the country.The Nigerian president has struggled to address a broad range of problems in the military. Its abuses have been carried out not only against protesting Shiites, but also against separatists in the southeast, where the president has launched major military operations. It has used excessive force in the northwest, where he has scrambled fighter jets against gangs roaming the forest.At the same time, Mr. Buhari\u2019s campaign against Boko Haram, the terrorist group that has been at war with the nation for nearly a decade, has suffered crippling failures on the battlefield.In recent weeks, more than 100 Nigerian soldiers have been killed in at least 20 attacks against military installations, one of which was captured on video and posted online by a Boko Haram faction.Parts of neighboring countries that have been peaceful for years have suffered attacks by militants, who have emerged armed from their new victories with heavy military equipment confiscated in raids.Soldiers fighting Boko Haram have complained of low food rations, shoddy equipment and no days off in more than a year, the local news media has reported.On Friday, the military suspended the operations of Unicef in the areas most affected by Boko Haram, saying that the organization trains and deploys spies to help Boko Haram because it offered programs to help spot human rights abuses by the military. The military later rescinded the suspension.Mr. Buhari recently traveled to the war zone to rally troops, but he has yet to address the military abuses.The president\u2019s \u201cturn-a-blind-eye approach has bolstered the military\u2019s culture of impunity,\u201d said Matthew Page, a former top expert on Nigeria for the State Department.\u201cNigerians\u2019 growing frustration with insecurity \u2014 whether it be kidnapping, armed robbery, communal violence or terrorist attacks \u2014 outweighs the disgust they feel about human rights abuses by security forces,\u201d he said.Nigeria is a mix of Christians and Muslims, but officials say the group is financed and influenced by Iran. Most Muslims in Nigeria, including Mr. Buhari, are Sunni. The group does not believe the Nigerian Constitution applies to it \u2014 largely because its members do not feel protected by the rule of law. That sentiment has angered officials.The military said it had killed three people who were blocking the road and trying to steal military equipment, and then another three at the Oct. 29 march who were throwing fuel bottles and large rocks at soldiers.But the video from the march clearly contradicts those claims. The melee began that day as more than 1,000 marchers approached a military checkpoint. Soldiers arrived to block off the road. An armored vehicle with high-caliber weapons patrolled the highway. After soldiers began to fire, they targeted protesters fleeing the chaos. Many of the injured were shot in the back or legs.Brig. Gen. John Agim, the spokesman for the Nigerian military, said soldiers had abused no one during the recent marches. He said he had not seen video of the events but was certain that whatever existed had been manipulated to make Nigerian soldiers look bad, calling it \u201cstage managed.\u201dThe protesters from the group generally \u201ccause a lot of disruption,\u201d he said. \u201cThey destroy other people\u2019s cars. They block the traffic.\u201d\u201cWhen they attack the military, what do you expect soldiers to do?\u201d he said, adding that the military had retrieved weapons from protesters, including knives and homemade firebombs. \u201cOf course, there will be a necessary course of action.\u201dMuhammed Sani said he had watched soldiers shoot to death one of his brothers, who had attended the Oct. 29 protest with him, and later learned that another brother had also been killed. He said he had lost friends that day, too.\u201cOur protests are peaceful, but they kill us anyway,\u201d he said.The Islamic Movement in Nigeria, founded about four decades ago and inspired by the Iranian Revolution, has been repeatedly labeled a terrorist threat. In the city of Kaduna, where many of the members live, the group is barred from protesting or assembling. Its places of worship, schools and community centers have been demolished by officials who say the group wants to spark a Shiite revolution and could turn to terrorism.Many of the marchers on Oct. 29 were protesting his detention.On a recent visit to a hospital in Abuja, more than 40 injured protesters, all in their late teens or 20s, lay on thin mattresses in a dimly lit ward.Umar Shittu, a 20-year-old student from Kaduna, sat silently on a bed stained by damp blood and urine, rocking back and forth, his face badly drooped. A bullet had pierced the top of his skull and lodged in his neck.Fatima Muhammed Sani, 16, was also wounded. She had trailed her mother on many marches in the past and was in the middle of the crowd at the Oct. 29 march when she heard gunfire. She said she had run and suddenly felt a strange sensation in her left thigh. A bullet had fractured her bone. Her movement is likely to be restricted forever.\u201cIf I could walk right now, I would go back to protest again,\u201d Ms. Sani said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to sacrifice my life for my leader.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Arizona to Yemen: The Journey of an American Bomb", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "When a bomb like this explodes, it doesn\u2019t just kill people; it rearranges them.Supported byThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer CenterBesides, things like airstrikes didn\u2019t happen to people like him. Rabee\u2019a was a charitable man from a privileged family \u2014 a little self-satisfied, perhaps, but he had enjoyed good fortune for much of his life, and that wasn\u2019t about to change. Despite a mischievous grin, he was a godly man, a good man, and finding water in poor places for poor people had become his calling; he even forgave debts when his customers couldn\u2019t pay. His big heart, he was certain, had locked in his good luck. \u201cI\u2019m doing a good, legitimate business!\u201d he said. \u201cThose jets have no quarrel with a man on the road to God!\u201dHe hung up. It was a peaceful night. There was electricity in the air. Behind him, people were celebrating, and they were celebrating him, really.Arhab had been running low on water. Villagers didn\u2019t have enough to drink or to irrigate new fields. They needed a well, but no government entity was capable of undertaking such a public-works project; no bank was available to extend a line of credit. None of the villagers in the district, most of whom farmed plots five or 10 meters square, had anywhere near the kind of capital it would take to finance the dig.So people from villages around the district found their own solution, working out a kind of shared-ownership arrangement. They all would benefit together if the drill struck water; each shareholder would get a few hours at the well every week. If the digging didn\u2019t succeed, though, they would all lose money they couldn\u2019t afford to lose. And there was no guarantee of success: The land was hard, and the best location for the well was high up on the black volcanic rock. Rabee\u2019a arrived excited for the chance to be the one who found water in a hard place.He had started six weeks earlier. After 12 days, the machine broke. Rabee\u2019a and his workers managed to fix the drill and get it through 400 meters before layers of earth began collapsing, pinning the drill in place. For a day, he made no progress. Then two more days, then a week, as the villagers\u2019 tab continued to run. After two weeks, with costs rising, Rabee\u2019a got the drill free and guided it down through a few hundred more meters until water bubbled forth with the waste sand.News spread; people cheered. The gamble had paid off. Some villagers made their way up to the site, to bring Rabee\u2019a food and to celebrate their new well. Eid was the next day, so it felt a little like a miracle. For Yousef, one of the drill workers, striking water meant he would go home for the holidays flush with cash. He went about his work, moving between the rig and a big tanker truck full of water to cool the drill. He took a break in the back of one of the trucks.Rabee\u2019a\u2019s cousin arrived, a young judge whose name was Judge \u2014 Al-Qadi \u2014 a usually studious man who needed something to celebrate. He had worked at a court in Amran until the compound was bombed. He got a job in the capital, Sana, at the traffic court, but with the Saudis blockading the country, there wasn\u2019t as much fuel, which meant less driving and fewer cases. He didn\u2019t have anything else to do, so he decided to come to Arhab. Mahdi arrived, too, a pale old man chosen as a representative of the shareholders. Once he heard Rabee\u2019a hit water, he set out for the well site, carrying all the villagers\u2019 money to pay the next installment.Fahd also showed up, the closest thing the villagers had to a lush. Just about every man in Yemen chews khat, a mild narcotic leaf, but they don\u2019t all chew it the way Fahd did. He chewed it both sides at a time, two big, puffed-out Louis Armstrong cheeks, whenever villagers gathered. Tonight he was even more energetic than usual, thanks to his acute sense of relief. Though he couldn\u2019t really afford to invest in the well project, he had felt compelled to buy a share; he felt that the village needed him. He spent a month visiting friends and relatives, charming and cajoling them into giving him loans; when he still didn\u2019t have enough, he asked his wife if he could sell her gold jewelry. Rabee\u2019a\u2019s striking water had spared Fahd and his family from financial ruin.Fahd felt a little cold, though, so he walked away from the drill toward an old stone hut where some friends had gathered. At about that moment, thousands of feet above him, a pilot pushed a button that sent an electrical signal to a rack mounted underneath his plane. A series of pyrotechnic cartridges flashed, and a set of hooks holding a bomb in place popped open, while small pistons shoved the weapon away.Now, as Fahd walked into the hut, a weapon about the length of a compact car was wobbling gracelessly down through the air toward him, losing altitude and unspooling an arming wire that connected it to the jet until, once it had extended a few feet, the wire ran out and ripped from the bomb.Then it was as if the weapon woke up. A thermal battery was activated. Three fins on the rear extended all the way and locked in place. The bomb stabilized in the air. A guidance-control unit on the nose locked onto a laser reflection \u2014 invisible to the naked eye but meaningful to the bomb \u2014 sparkling on the rocks Fahd walked over.Fahd was in a buoyant mood as the weapon homed in on a point just a few meters from him, a few meters from the drill, from Rabee\u2019a, from the judge whose name was Judge, from the drill worker lying down for a rest, from the old man arriving with the installment of cash the villagers owed.Above them, the warhead closed in at a few hundred knots.Almost immediately, the United Nations and human rights groups expressed alarm about the way the war was being prosecuted, with its startling toll on civilians and critical infrastructure. The Saudis\u2019 bombs have struck factories, roads, bridges, hospitals, wells, funerals, weddings, gatherings entirely of women and a school bus full of children. The United Nations reported last month that it has documented about 18,000 civilian deaths and injuries that have resulted from the fighting, almost 11,000 of them from airstrikes alone. Several other groups believe these estimates to be conservative.The Saudis have also blockaded Yemen, with the stated purpose of keeping weapons out of Houthi hands, but that has also made it extremely difficult to get food and humanitarian assistance into an already poor country. Together, the bombing campaign and blockade have spurred the worst continuing humanitarian crisis in the world. Eight million people are on the brink of famine; according to Save the Children, an international aid organization, 85,000 Yemenis under age 5 have already died of starvation. A cholera outbreak has spread to 21 of Yemen\u2019s 22 provinces.In carrying out the campaign in Yemen, the Saudis have been drawing on help from other Persian Gulf states, like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, as well as nearby African countries, like Sudan and Egypt. But its most important source of material support is one faraway ally: America. In 2015, the United States began assigning Navy warships to the region to help prevent weapons shipments from reaching Yemen. As the Saudis began running sorties into Yemen, United States Central Command began flying American Stratotankers on refueling missions every day, until last month, allowing Saudi jets to loiter in the sky for longer in search of targets, rather than having to plan strikes in advance. Perhaps most crucial, America has sold the Saudis billions of dollars\u2019 worth of high-tech weapons to help them counter Iranian influence to their south.It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Iran was the prime beneficiary of the American arms trade. According to William Hartung, the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, Iran was a favored customer of Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, back when it was considered a stalwart of modernization and order in the Middle East. But after the revolution in 1979 that put the ayatollah in power, Saudi Arabia came to look like a model of stability in the region. And soon the Sunni kingdom became one of the most reliable patrons of the American defense industry.By the time of the Clinton administration, the United States was the world\u2019s biggest exporter of arms, with billions of dollars in weapons going to Saudi Arabia alone every year. Each successive president had new hopes for what propping up the Saudi military with weapons sales might accomplish. In 2007, President George W. Bush announced a $20 billion sale to the Saudis, in part to rebalance the region after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which had deposed a Sunni government and allowed a Shia one to replace it. Bush had inadvertently empowered Iran, and he thought selling weapons to Saudi Arabia could counteract that. In 2010, President Barack Obama announced a package of deals worth $60 billion to provide advanced fighter jets and other arms to the Saudis, citing both Iranian influence and American job creation.And then, in 2015, just as the Obama administration\u2019s signature foreign-policy goal \u2014 a nuclear deal with Iran \u2014 came within view, and just as gulf countries got anxious that the deal might signal that the United States was distancing itself from them, the Houthis moved on the Yemeni capital, and a new country fell under Iranian influence. Saudi Arabia needed more American bombs to drop, and within a month of the nuclear deal\u2019s adoption, the Defense Department announced an approved sale of $1.29 billion in mostly precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia. A year later, it was clear to the Obama administration that the Saudis were not using the guided weapons to minimize civilian casualties. So just before leaving office, Obama suspended the transfer of smart bombs to the Saudis.President Trump immediately reversed the suspension. On his first foreign trip as president \u2014 to Saudi Arabia \u2014 he announced that he would resume and expand the sale of weapons. There was an effort in Congress to stop the process. Senator Rand Paul \u2014 a Kentucky Republican, who co-sponsored a bill to halt the sale of weapons to the Saudis with Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat \u2014 took to the Senate floor with a picture of a starving Yemeni child. \u201cIt is astounding what is going on there,\u201d Paul said, \u201cand it is being done without your permission, but with your weapons.\u201d The resolution was defeated 53 to 47, mostly along party lines, a vast majority of Republicans siding against Paul and with the president.Congress is again debating American involvement in the war in Yemen, but regardless of what happens in the future, the United States has already provided formidable capacity to the Saudi-led aerial campaign. From just 2010 to last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s Arms Transfer Database, the United States delivered to Saudi Arabia 30 F-15 multirole jet fighters in the F-15SA-configuration \u2014 the most advanced iteration the United States produces \u2014 as well as 84 combat helicopters, 110 air-to-surface cruise missiles and nearly 20,000 guided bombs. This last category includes 11,320 Paveways: a type of laser-guided bomb that can be dropped from nine miles away and 40,000 feet up and that will, more often than not, strike within 10 feet of its target.The back of the tanker truck launched off its chassis and slammed into rock. Jagged pieces of bomb flew thousands of miles per hour outward, and Rabee\u2019a \u2014 still celebrating his success \u2014 was almost fully decapitated. The top half of his face was removed, leaving just an open lower jaw; the heat of the blast burned most of his clothes off and charred his skin, so he was left naked, his genitals exposed, his body actually smoking. Next to him, his cousin Al-Qadi, the judge, was burning alive, his blood vessels expelling water and his body inflating. He began to scream.Fahd had just stepped into the stone shelter and registered only a sudden brightness. He heard nothing. He was picked up, pierced with shrapnel, spun around and then slammed into the back wall, both of his arms shattering \u2014 the explosion so forceful that it excised seconds from his memory. Metal had bit into leg, trunk, jaw, eye; one piece entered his back and exited his chest, leaving a hole that air and liquid began to fill, collapsing his lungs. By the time he woke up, crumpled against stone, he was suffocating. Somehow he had survived, but he was killing himself with every breath, and he was bleeding badly. But he wasn\u2019t even aware of any of these things, because his brain had been taken over by pain that seemed to come from another world.He couldn\u2019t think of anything except that he had to get out of the hut. As the dust began to clear, he saw that the ground was littered with burning chunks of metal. The hut had been turned into an oven, and he was trapped inside it. He felt as if he were in hell, as if it were Judgment Day. He had to get away, but when he tried to crawl over the burning metal, he fell down to his side because his forearms were pulverized. He began to roll, like a child going down a hill. He rolled over superheated metal, over the body parts of his friends. He wasn\u2019t thinking about his friends. He wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone. He wasn\u2019t even thinking about his family. In that moment, Fahd forgot he had children.Yousef woke up on top of the drilling truck\u2019s cab, with the vague sense that he had been carried there by a wave of fire. He looked down and saw that his left leg had been ribboned into strings of blood and bone. He realized he was shaking. He groped around the debris littering the truck cab, trying to find something to tie off his leg; he knew, maybe from movies, maybe from friends, he didn\u2019t know exactly how, that this is what you were supposed to do when a limb was ripped off. He saw a burst of bright flashes in the air \u2014 tracer rounds, a tribal S.O.S. \u2014 and knew someone was calling for help.When bombs fall, though, he escapes the paperwork. He goes down to the operating room and works nonstop, one patient after another, sometimes not emerging from surgery for 24 hours. And he has seen, in those hours standing over the operating table after airstrikes, grim things.He has seen his own son. Just 20 years old, he was brought to the hospital blackened almost beyond recognition, after the car he was in was hit by an airstrike. Abotaleb found some grace in the severity of the burns \u2014 as he operated, he was able to imagine that the young man wasn\u2019t his son. The illusion fell apart when he saw a scar he recognized on the patient\u2019s big toe. Abotaleb couldn\u2019t save him. He operated on his own brother, hit in a different strike, one that killed his other brother and his father, too. So now Abotaleb tries to banish feeling when he\u2019s at work. He thinks of it as making his heart like stone. And when he\u2019s done, he goes home and cries with his surviving children.That morning in September 2016, when he arrived at the emergency department, he found the corridors lined with dying patients and desperate family members from a different airstrike, one that happened closer by in Sana. People yelled for him as he walked by, trying to hold his attention. Abotaleb tries to resist these appeals. He tries instead to focus on the patients he has a chance of saving. He does not count on miracles; even miracles require equipment, and because of the blockade, he was running low on pretty much every critical resource and diagnostic tool that a normal hospital needs to function, let alone one that sees regular mass-casualty events from bombs designed to dismember people hundreds of yards in every direction.They were nearly out of general anesthesia. Lately, they had been relying on halothane, a cheap anesthetic suspected of causing liver damage, no longer used in North America. They weren\u2019t able to get enough gloves or masks. They barely had any blood, because they couldn\u2019t get the bags that hold donated blood past the blockade. They were even low on bedsheets, which they could change only once a week. And they couldn\u2019t get the correct parts to properly fix the washing machine, so it broke nearly every day. Everything was dirty. The hospital was a septicemia factory; Abotaleb often worried that he was desperately trying to save patients just so they might survive long enough to die of an infection caught at his hospital.But since the blockade began, Abotaleb had taught himself tricks. He used IV lines to join severed arteries; he used IV lines as feeding tubes. He is up against bombs so proficient at traumatic amputations that his burn patients often don\u2019t have other limbs to graft from, so he has learned to be creative when finding places on of the body to harvest skin. And he has learned not to try to help patients he doesn\u2019t think he can save.That morning, he saw a boy he should have walked past but didn\u2019t. Three years old, maybe younger, certainly no older. The boy\u2019s legs were gone; part of an arm was, too. As Abotaleb worked in vain on the boy in the operating room, victims from Arhab began arriving outside, piled together in the back of a pickup truck. Al-Qadi was almost unrecognizable from the swelling. A slight man, he now looked obese. Yousef the drill worker looked possessed, his eyes vacant and, somehow, at the same time wrathful. Fahd was suffocating and bleeding out, five minutes from death, maybe less.Abotaleb knew immediately that Fahd needed equipment he didn\u2019t have, but Abotaleb chose him anyway. The bleeding and the fractures and the shrapnel were not Fahd\u2019s only \u2014 or even most pressing \u2014 issues. One side of his chest was totally compressed, and he was almost unable to breathe. Abotaleb needed an underwater seal drainage system, a piece of equipment that creates closed suction, which allows air and fluid to escape the pleural cavity but none to come back in, relieving pressure on the chest and allowing the patient to breathe.The hospital didn\u2019t have one of those. So Abotaleb improvised. He asked someone to bring him a plastic water bottle. He cut a hole in one end and put an IV line into it. He cut into Fahd\u2019s chest and bound the other end of the IV line into the space between his rib cage and his lungs. Fahd was in agony as Abotaleb cut into him. He also felt intense thirst; he had lost so much blood that he was in shock. To Fahd, it seemed as if the people hovering over him were there to continue his torture. He had an animal instinct to strike back. He couldn\u2019t use his arms but wished Abotaleb would get close enough for him to bite.Still, the doctor continued to work. With one end of the IV line inserted into Fahd\u2019s chest and the other end attached to a hole in the plastic water bottle a few centimeters below the water line, the contraption created a one-way valve that let air and fluid out of Fahd\u2019s chest while preventing any from going the other way. With the lines in place, Fahd\u2019s chest began to empty. Fahd\u2019s lung finally began to inflate.Next, Abotaleb tried to stabilize Al-Qadi; he and his nurses bound as much of his skin as they could with the little gauze they could expend on him, but the director knew they needed to get him out of there. With his skin flaking off, Al-Qadi was losing his barrier to the outside world, and this hospital was the worst place for someone susceptible to infection. They sent him to another hospital, where he survived for two more days.Abotaleb went to the next patient, who seemed to be bleeding internally, but it was unclear where, and he didn\u2019t have access to imaging tools, so he did what he often did: He cut the patient open and looked around. He found the worst of it was the patient\u2019s liver, so he began trying to stitch it with the wrong kind of needle, because the hospital didn\u2019t have liver needles. He made the liver bleed more. He waited a few minutes for it to subside before trying to stitch again. But before he could finish, he got a call: Something else had happened at the well in Arhab. More patients were coming.Normally, after a sale through F.M.S., the military\u2019s transportation command takes possession of the weapons and delivers them to the foreign customer. But Saudi Arabia instead hires private charter flights \u2014 giant Soviet-era Ilyushin cargo planes, filled with guided-bomb components \u2014 and flies them all the way to Saudi Air Force bases. There, the tail fins and the laser-guidance kits are attached to either end of the warheads, and free-fall gravity bombs are transformed into laser-guided weapons, which are then loaded up onto the bomb racks beneath jet fighters. It\u2019s a process that happens at the Saudi\u2019s base in Dhahran on the Persian Gulf and at King Khalid Air Base in Saudi Arabia\u2019s southwestern corner. King Khalid is the country\u2019s southernmost base and has a squadron of F-15s strategically stationed there. It happened to be just 200 miles from a new well about to come online in a district called Arhab. An F-15 at top speed can close that distance in about six minutes.That morning, villagers all around Arhab were making their way to the bomb site. Some came to try to help; some came searching for missing loved ones. Many of them, especially the children, came out of curiosity, running out of the house before parents could grab them, trying to find out what that rumble was that woke them in the middle of the night. A little after daybreak, more than a hundred people had gathered.There is some disagreement about what happened next. Some say they heard multiple planes. Some heard others scream. Some swear that there was no warning, that they didn\u2019t hear or see anything beforehand. What\u2019s not in dispute is that the second wave of bombing began about six hours after the first explosion, once a sizable crowd had formed.There was a sudden, massive upwelling of air and debris, and everybody started to run. People went in all different directions as the planes roared overhead and things started to explode. Cars and motorcycles went hurtling through the air. Boys were cut down as they tried to escape; grown men dove into nearby cornfields. The attack lasted for hours. It felt as if another bomb fell every few minutes \u2014 each of them seeming to strike people trying to escape, as if following them. The people said it did not feel like an attack. The word they used translates to \u201cextermination.\u201dHuman Rights Watch reported that at least 31 civilians were killed, three of them children, and that 42 more were injured. It\u2019s hard to know the numbers for sure, because all that was left of many victims were very small parts, very far from one another. People dragged sheets around the bomb site, trying to collect parts they thought might belong to loved ones. Cellphones didn\u2019t always survive explosions, but inside them, memory cards sometimes did, and sometimes those memory cards had photos that helped villagers identify the missing. At least 11 bodies were so charred or mutilated that they could not be identified. And most of the villagers were so traumatized, so terrified, that they didn\u2019t want to go outside at all.Islam compels its adherents to bury the deceased within 24 hours, so the villagers of Arhab had to hold funerals, but they were too afraid to gather outside. No one knew when planes might appear out of nowhere again. In homes all across Arhab, minor dramas played out as surviving family members argued with one another about who got to go say goodbye and who had to stay home. The funerals were poorly attended.All across the country, people were learning a version of the same lesson. They stayed home from factory jobs, because even if their factory hadn\u2019t been hit, maybe it would be next. On the roads, people kept extra car lengths when driving behind cargo trucks. Anything of value \u2014 anything bringing commerce or food or health \u2014 could, at any moment, explode and disassemble your friends.It\u2019s hard to say what the aggregate effect of living in constant terror of airstrikes has been. A local human rights worker pointed out one thing, though: She noticed that Yemenis had stopped digging wells. And maybe this is part of the reason the number of people in critical need of clean water rose. With sanitation facilities and wells like the one in Arhab coming under attack, cholera was, perhaps, inevitable. The first cases were reported three weeks after the strike in Arhab (and a few dozen miles away). Seven months later, the country had more than 100,000 suspected cases. Arhab had one of the highest attack rates in the country, and after a year, there were nearly one million suspected cases of cholera in the country, making it not only the worst outbreak in the world but also one of the worst in recorded history.She was surprised, at first, that nobody had bothered to pick them up yet. But the strike in Arhab had not become the focus of international attention, and the Houthis were more interested in publicizing other strikes. Villagers later told me that many people were simply afraid of bomb parts, believing, based on what happened to the victims, that the weapons must have contained some strange poison. Whatever the reason, the bomb fragments just sat there.Among all the other bits and shards lying around, Motaparthy found a data plate from a wing section that, though curled and partly damaged, had mostly survived the strike. This fragment was a key to a whole history of the weapon\u2019s journey.Because of Motaparthy\u2019s research, we have been able to find out a wealth of information about the bomb\u2019s provenance. The data plate had a Department of Defense Identification Code that indicated it was part of a fin on a guided bomb. It also had a manufacture date, showing that it had rolled off an assembly line in October 2015. It had a stock number that, when combined with an assembly number, revealed that the data plate belonged to part of the control mechanism for something called a Paveway II laser-guidance system.This sort of kit is designed to attach to a 500-pound MK82 warhead, a bomb manufactured in Garland, Tex., at a General Dynamics facility. There, about 300 pounds of blank steel is heated up and then forged into hollow shells. Those shells then travel 150 miles north to an Army munitions plant in McAlester, Okla., a 45,000-acre compound where the shells are hung, nose down. Next, they\u2019re filled with 200 pounds of warm explosive, sometimes Tritonal but more often something called Composition H6, a compound whose main ingredient is RDX, the explosive used in bombs the Allies dropped on the Germans. The explosives cool and harden, base plates are attached and the steel shells become bombs, ordnance you can drop out of the sky and, if you drop enough of them, have some modest confidence that you\u2019ll hit your target. Or you can attach them to a guidance system made by one of the private companies that build modification kits for dumb bombs. The scrap Motaparthy found had an assembly code unique to one American manufacturer: Raytheon, which makes Paveway II guidance kits at its facility in Tucson, Arizona.On Nov. 28, the Senate voted on a resolution to open debate about ending the American role in Yemen wholesale, and this time, it passed. But the White House has threatened to veto any bill that would unwind American involvement in the conflict and continues to vociferously defend its relationship with Saudi Arabia. Earlier in November, President Trump put out an official statement defending, in mercenary terms, his continued support of the Saudis. \u201cAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOf the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.\u201d (The State Department has acknowledged that only a $14.5 billion deal had been made at present.)Because American jobs are the Trump administration\u2019s stated reason for selling the weapons, I went to Tucson to see what those jobs were like. The city is surrounded by dry, scrubby land. Not much grows there. Brown mountains rise in jagged peaks; the topography is almost identical to northern Yemen. Tucson even has F-16s from an Air National Guard base soaring around the valley \u2014 single-engine jets that are smaller and slower than the F-15s the Saudis fly. When you hear the air curdling, you don\u2019t know at first if it\u2019s wind or an 18-wheeler pushing down Interstate 10, and then there\u2019s a roar, and backswept wings appear and disappear above you. Tucson also has a wealth of defense contractors, all part of the Sun Corridor, a booster group that puts up signs proclaiming the region\u2019s laurels; that Tucson, for example, was named one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s best cities for global trade\u201d by Global Trade Magazine. Of all the companies in the Sun Corridor, though, the biggest private employer, by a sizable margin, is Raytheon Missile Systems, a subsidiary of Raytheon.Raytheon began its corporate life as the American Appliance Company, developing refrigerators and radio parts, but it was drawn into military contracting during World War II. By the 1990s, the industry was contracting with the end of the Cold War, but Raytheon remained committed to defense. It even began selling off nonmilitary businesses and buying up military-oriented subsidiaries of other companies, including those at Texas Instruments and Chrysler. One of the more tectonic shifts in the industry, however, occurred when Raytheon outbid Northrop Grumman to buy Hughes Electronics.Howard Hughes, the aircraft pioneer and industrial magnate, had not wanted to build missiles at his aircraft plant in Los Angeles \u2014 it was too close to the coast, and therefore, he feared, susceptible to attack \u2014 so he went looking for someplace inland, eventually settling on Tucson. When Raytheon acquired Hughes Electronics in 1997, it also acquired the missile plant. The acquisition nearly doubled its annual sales, and today Raytheon employs nearly 10,000 people in Tucson alone. Raytheon makes more money on defense than any company in the world except Lockheed Martin, with nearly $25 billion in sales a year.At a local union hall in Tucson, I met two funny, gentle, welcoming men, and we spoke for an evening about their lives at Raytheon. (I have elected not to identify them.) One of them, a quiet man with an easy, endearing laugh, worked in assembly, where all the pieces come together before a weapon goes out the door. His story of going to work at Raytheon sounded to me like the Platonic ideal of the American working family in the postwar industrial boom. His father had a good job at the plant, and he wanted to be just like his dad. He started out as a custodian, working his way up to his current position.The other man, who had been a machinist for years, was proud of his work, too. He described at first a line of reasoning that politicians use too: that better precision-guided weapons help countries avoid hurting anyone they\u2019re not trying to. For him, though, the thing that he said made him most proud about working at Raytheon was helping to keep American servicemen and women safe. The company makes a point of hiring veterans with combat injuries, which reminds him of whom he\u2019s working for and why. He feels it when he sees the gigantic photos of service members that the company hangs in the most prominent parts of the plant. The photos, he explained, are of relatives of Raytheon workers. When he\u2019s at work, the notion of helping American servicemen and women is not abstract. It\u2019s almost tactile.The company\u2019s impact is considerably more abstract from the C-suite. On the most recent earnings call, an analyst asked Raytheon executives about the Saudi arms sales. His concern was whether \u201cissues in the Middle East at the moment and specifically Saudi Arabia\u201d could have \u201cany negative ramifications for your business.\u201d The answer was, in essence, Don\u2019t worry. The company\u2019s chief executive, Thomas Kennedy, reminded analysts that Raytheon has customers in over 80 countries. Raytheon\u2019s chief financial officer, Anthony O\u2019Brien, then chimed in to add that the Saudis accounted for just 5 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.It had been two years and a month since the strike by the time I made my way to Yemen, and then up to Arhab in rebel territory, after months of negotiations; I had to get permission from the Saudi-backed government in the south and from the Houthis in the north. I needed to fly into Saudi-controlled Aden and make my way by road to rebel territory. I was made to dress in traditional Yemeni clothes and chew khat in order to sneak through the checkpoints, though I\u2019m not sure whether this was necessary for my own safety or for the amusement of my fixers. I arrived in the north to find other journalists who had simply gotten in cars in their safari shirts.I had expected the scene of the attack to be sterilized by the time I arrived. But the bomb site still looked like a bomb site: bits of headlight housings, things that looked like spark plugs, curled pieces of rubber that I assumed had once been tires. There were craters a few feet from the well, then a few meters away another one, some a hundred meters away or more. People had run far. The tank from the water truck still lay smashed against a bank of rocks; it looked like a giant soda can shot through buckshot and then crushed by a giant hand. The chassis was still there too, twisted up on the rock. Both of them were too heavy, or too pointless, to move. Villagers kicked around the rocks, nudged pebbles aside with their shoes and handed little things to me that felt much heavier than they looked. These, they said, were from the bombs.My first morning in Arhab I spent in a classroom with 30 or maybe 50 people, maybe 60. Many had obvious and horrifying injuries, while others were brandishing ID cards to show me. I didn\u2019t at first understand, and then my translator started saying, \u201cThat\u2019s his brother\u201d; \u201cThat\u2019s his son.\u201d They had come anticipating that they would need proof. That the American might not believe they lost who they said they lost. I had never been in a room with so many grown men in tears.I met Yousef, the drill worker, in that classroom. He looked sad, but I thought he was wrongly translated when he told me that he had lost a leg. He must have seen my confusion, because he hiked the fabric of his skirt up and showed the basic plastic prosthesis clipped to a stump, above where his knee would have been.I met Fahd in that classroom, too. And after that, I spent a lot of time with him, mostly on the floor of a room in a village elder\u2019s house. By then he had spent most of a year in the hospital, managing to evade deadly infection, then most of a year out of it, but he had changed. His arms were curled and contracted. He couldn\u2019t lift much of anything, so he was mostly useless in the fields. He couldn\u2019t provide for his family, and he had lost his entire investment that day at the well.But what frustrated him most was the shrapnel the doctors couldn\u2019t remove from his head. He told me it changes the way his mind works; he\u2019s angry all the time, and he thinks there\u2019s a chemical reason for that, something in the metal. Sometimes, he said, it hurts so badly that he has an urge to remove it and has to stop himself from grabbing a knife and cutting into his face. As Fahd was explaining this, the room grew quiet. He stopped midconversation, and someone pointed up at the ceiling as if having a thought. \u201cF-15s.\u201dThey told me to go outside so I could hear better, to look up. I did, and I couldn\u2019t see anything, but I could hear, just barely. I wouldn\u2019t have identified it as a fighter jet. I\u2019m not even sure I would have identified it as a plane. It sounded like a very concentrated wind, miles away. I asked how they knew it wasn\u2019t a commercial flight, and they reminded me of the blockade: There are no commercial flights here. And anyway, the sound is different. Even children there knew the sound F-15s make. They had learned to tell the difference between the sonic signatures of the aircraft that fly overhead, making up names, onomatopoeia for the noises they make, like zanana and waziza, for the buzzing drones. The next day, I would learn of an airstrike in the neighboring district.Back inside, we resumed our conversation, but again, Fahd stopped talking for a moment, and this time, he began moving across the carpet toward me. He hoisted himself over his bad leg and leaned forward. His eyes were suddenly bright, and I saw what other villagers had described when they spoke of Fahd before the strike, this once-energetic man, once so intense and charismatic.He tilted his head toward me, and then I understood he wanted me to touch his face. I turned my wrist to use the back of my hand, as if checking a child for a temperature; somehow that seemed less intrusive. Fahd moved his head closer, and then my hand was against his face, and I could feel hard bits of metal rolling around beneath the cartilage of his jaw. He guided my hand up to his temple, where some misshapen thing slid around beneath the skin, as if trying to escape my fingers. He pulled his eyelid down to show where the steel still was. And it struck me that this was a surreal way to encounter American ordnance, at the end of journey that began in the American Southwest and brought it all the way here, in this remote part of a desperately poor country, to the face of a man who, for just a moment two years and one month ago, thought he had something to celebrate.An earlier version of this article misstated one aspect of the involvement of the United States in the war in Yemen. In 2015 the United States Navy began assigning warships to the region to prevent weapons shipments from reaching Yemen. The United States did not send warships to help Saudi Arabia enforce a blockade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mueller Exposes the Culture of Lying That Surrounds Trump", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThey lied to federal authorities even when they had lawyers advising them, even when the risk of getting caught was high and even when the consequences for them were dire.Even more Trump associates are under investigation for the same offense. They are part of a group of people surrounding Mr. Trump \u2014 including some White House and cabinet officials \u2014 who contribute to a culture of bending, if not outright breaking, the truth, and whose leading exemplar is Mr. Trump himself.Mr. Trump looks for people who share his disregard for the truth and are willing to parrot him, \u201ceven if it\u2019s a lie, even if they know it\u2019s a lie, and even if he said the opposite the day before,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. They must be \u201cloyal to what he is saying right now,\u201d she said, or he sees them as \u201ca traitor.\u201dCampaign aides often echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements knowing they were false. People joined the top levels of his administration with the realization that they would be expected to embrace what Mr. Trump said, no matter how far from the truth or how much their reputations suffered.For Sean Spicer, the first White House press secretary, that included falsely insisting, on Mr. Trump\u2019s first day in office, that his inaugural crowd was the biggest in history. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who replaced him, dialed back once-daily news briefings to once every few weeks as her credibility was increasingly battered.For decades, such behavior was relatively free of consequence for those who aligned with Mr. Trump. The stakes in the real estate world were lower, and deceptive statements could be dismissed as hardball business tactics or just efforts to cultivate the Trump mystique.If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.But in Mr. Mueller, those in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit now confront a big-league adversary with little tolerance for what one top White House adviser once called \u201calternative facts.\u201d He leads a team of prosecutors and F.B.I. agents who are methodically and purposefully examining their words and deeds.Mr. Trump\u2019s own lawyers, wary of how frequently their client engages in falsehoods, are trying to hold the special counsel at bay. Jay Sekulow, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, has already been forced to pull back his own public remarks about an issue of concern to Mr. Mueller.Fearful of more deceptions, the president\u2019s legal team has insisted that Mr. Trump answer questions only in writing. They delivered replies to some of the special counsel\u2019s queries on Nov. 20 after months of negotiation. If unsatisfied, Mr. Mueller could try to subpoena the president to testify.Many witnesses or subjects of the inquiry lack the president\u2019s negotiating power or resources. Some have been stunned by their encounters with prosecutors, who arrive armed with thick binders documenting their text messages, emails and whereabouts on any given date.Sam Nunberg, a former longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, said he feared that the special counsel was creating the impression of a wide-ranging conspiracy among liars, when witnesses could have dispelled much of the suspicion simply by testifying truthfully.\u201cPeople are conspiring against themselves, and they are playing right into Mueller\u2019s hands,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Flynn had said he discussed sanctions, he could very well be national security adviser today,\u201d he added. Instead, Mr. Flynn awaits sentencing for lying to F.B.I. agents about various matters, including his talks with the Russian ambassador over whether the new administration would lift sanctions against Russia.The reasons for the lies vary, but, not surprisingly, people were most often trying to protect themselves. Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime fixer, said in federal court this past week that he had misled Congress about the details of a Trump hotel project in Moscow because he did not want to contradict the president\u2019s own false characterizations of his business dealings in Moscow. He specifically cited his loyalty to Mr. Trump, referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in court papers, as the reason for his crime.While the Moscow hotel was never built, Mr. Cohen\u2019s court filing suggested that Mr. Trump at best minimized his knowledge of the proposed venture, both as a candidate and once he had been elected. Nearly two dozen times, Mr. Trump has publicly insisted that he had no business dealings in Russia.But Mr. Cohen, who discussed the hotel project with the aide to a key Kremlin official in early 2016, said in Friday\u2019s court filing that he kept Mr. Trump apprised of negotiations that continued through June of that year, just before Mr. Trump formally became the Republican nominee.Mr. Trump has been Mr. Mueller\u2019s most vociferous critic, accusing his team of manufacturing lies by threatening witnesses with severe consequences if they refuse to agree with the special counsel\u2019s narrative.What prosecutors have called lies, Mr. Trump has insisted is truth. What they called truth, he has framed as lies.Where all this is headed is unclear, but it appears that more allegations of lying are ahead. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which has also been investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the election, has referred other cases to the special counsel\u2019s office involving witnesses who may have lied.Jerome Corsi, a conservative author, has cast doubt on whether Mr. Stone testified truthfully to Congress about what inspired a Twitter message he posted in the summer of 2016. In it, Mr. Stone predicted, with a missing verb, \u201cTrust me, it will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201dMr. Corsi said he had helped Mr. Stone concoct a \u201ccover story\u201d for the message so that it would not appear Mr. Stone had advance knowledge that WikiLeaks planned to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign by releasing emails stolen from the computer of her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. He said Mr. Stone then incorporated those falsehoods into his congressional testimony \u2014 an allegation that Mr. Stone vehemently denies.But in a turnabout, Mr. Corsi said prosecutors had now accused him of lying to them about other communications he had with Mr. Stone regarding WikiLeaks. He claims his only crime is a faulty memory.Follow Sharon LaFraniere on Twitter: @SharonLNYTMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Michael S. Schmidt from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Improvises New Defense in Hush Money Payments", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Thursday that if there was anything illegal about the hush payments made to two women claiming to have had affairs with him, it was the fault of his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, part of a newly improvised attempt to combat the legal exposure the president may now have because of the payments.In a series of Twitter messages sent from the White House residence, Mr. Trump tried again to distance himself from Mr. Cohen, who federal prosecutors say was directed by his boss to make the hush payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels at a time in the 2016 campaign when their claims could have been highly damaging.Mr. Trump asserted that his former lawyer had pleaded guilty to embarrass him and to receive a reduced prison term.Later, during an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Cohen had cut a deal to save his family and in exchange had agreed to \u201cembarrass\u201d the president. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible system we have.\u201dIn an interview, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president\u2019s personal lawyers, elaborated on the points that Mr. Trump had made in his tweets, arguing that there was no evidence that Mr. Trump knew about the payments. And he said that even if investigators were able to prove that Mr. Trump had known about them, legal scholars were divided about whether the knowledge was in itself a crime.\u201cIt\u2019s a crime of interpretation,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cAre you going to charge the president with a crime of interpretation?\u201dMr. Giuliani said that if prosecutors or members of Congress did try to make the case that Mr. Trump should be punished for the payments, the president would argue that he believed Mr. Cohen, as his lawyer, was going to follow the law.Mr. Trump had \u201ca right to expect that he is going to handle it honestly,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cHe has a right to rely on the fact that he thought the lawyer was doing it correctly.\u201dMr. Giuliani singled out Congress in particular on the question of whether the payments to Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal constituted illegal campaign contributions, contending that many lawmakers had engaged in the very activity that federal prosecutors had suggested, without naming them, that Mr. Trump had.Without providing specifics, Mr. Giuliani said that nearly three dozen members of Congress had made similar payments to people who have accused them of harassment and other embarrassing allegations.\u201cIf they want to pursue an investigation for impeachment on this and if they do want to vote on an article of impeachment, somewhere between 30 to 40 of them better get a lawyer,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.But some of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s assertions are contradicted by the evidence that prosecutors presented, and reflect the inconsistent accounts the president has given of what he knew about Mr. Cohen\u2019s efforts.Prosecutors also revealed in a sentencing submission last week that Mr. Trump attended at least one meeting involving Mr. Cohen and David Pecker, the A.M.I. chairman, during which Mr. Pecker \u201coffered to help deal with negative stories\u201d about Mr. Trump\u2019s affairs with women \u201cby identifying such stories so that they could be purchased and \u2018killed.\u2019\u201dThe government also suggested that in addition to Mr. Trump, others associated with the Trump campaign may have been involved, and said that Mr. Cohen \u201ccoordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature and timing of the payments.\u201dNorman L. Eisen, the co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said prosecutors in the Southern District of New York appeared to be building a broader case against the Trump Organization and the Trump campaign, possibly for whatever role they may have played regarding illegal campaign donations, using Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea as a steppingstone.\u201cThe big fish here are the Trump campaign, the Trump Organization and, as an unindicted co-conspirator, the president himself,\u201d Mr. Eisen said.A full cooperation agreement in the Southern District of New York would require Mr. Cohen to admit to every crime he has ever committed and provide details about the crimes of others.In Twitter posts this month, Mr. Trump also suggested that Mr. Cohen\u2019s wife and father-in-law might face legal troubles of their own.\u201cHis father-in-law\u2019s a very rich guy, I hear,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Thursday.Eileen Sullivan and Michael Tackett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Slows Sharply, in Challenge for Xi Jinping", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow badly this hurts him could depend on the extent to which Chinese workers like Yu Hong find their jobs disappearing. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Yu, 46, was boarding a train home, to Hubei Province in central China, for a nearly three-month unpaid holiday. The lamp factory in Dongguan where he works had drastically reduced pay and cut hours.\u201cThe whole environment is different now,\u201d Mr. Yu said. \u201cFor migrant workers like us, we just want to earn more money.\u201dGauging the magnitude of the slowdown is difficult, given the unreliability of China\u2019s economic data. But there are signs that the country\u2019s problems are deepening.\u201cXi Jinping has likened China to an ocean that no storm can disturb, but the tempest now hitting it is by far the biggest\u201d in years, said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics in London, who estimates that growth has fallen even lower than during the crisis.Mr. Xi now faces more of a diplomatic balancing act. The Chinese authorities have detained two Canadian nationals, in apparent retaliation for Canada\u2019s arrest of a top Chinese telecommunications executive at the behest of Washington. But Chinese officials have struck a quieter tone with the Trump administration over the arrest and separate allegations of hacking, since a sharp escalation in the trade war could seriously damage the economy.President Trump already senses an advantage. \u201cChina just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them,\u201d he tweeted on Friday. (The slowdown began before the imposition of the tariffs, but they have hurt both business and consumer confidence and will probably pinch even more if they linger or intensify.)Thanks to the government\u2019s tight hold on important industries and the financial sector, it has more levers to pull in case of a downturn than practically any other country. Beijing\u2019s efforts in the spring to wean the economy off debt, a major cause of the slowdown, are now being reversed.Already, China has ramped up the sort of government-led spending that bailed out its economy in the past. At Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant that supplies many highway and rail builders, sales have jumped 50 percent from a year ago, said Wang Min, the company\u2019s chairman.But China\u2019s options for juicing the economy aren\u2019t as effective as they used to be.A small but notable rise in defaults in China has made some lenders nervous. Rules adopted since the financial crisis make China\u2019s bank managers responsible for life for loans that aren\u2019t repaid, and that has them more leery of extending financing to keep troubled businesses afloat. Government-led spending adds to the huge debt pile, making that long-term drag on growth even worse.But beneath the surface, a sharp slowdown is building. Foreign investment plunged last month. Auto sales over the past three months have fallen by record percentages. Floor space completed, one gauge of the housing market\u2019s health, has slumped this year. Sentiment among Chinese purchasing managers has soured.\u201cWe don\u2019t have much to do, so I decided to go home and rest,\u201d said Li Shulian, a 46-year-old worker at a Dongguan plastics factory, as she stood at a train station with her husband, her teenage daughter and several suitcases. Their factory gave them a week off in October and nearly a week in November, both times with almost no pay. Overtime pay also vanished, so Ms. Li\u2019s monthly earnings were nearly halved to $435.Told early this month that the three of them would be working \u2014 and paid \u2014 only on alternate days, they quit and bought tickets on the nearly 12-hour train back to their hometown in central China.\u201cI haven\u2019t gone home this early for the holidays since I left my hometown in 2005,\u201d Ms. Li said.Businesses say they are cutting hours as demand has slowed. In part, they have room to cut back because many factories were previously running full out.\u201cYou quite easily can reduce overtime,\u201d said Jochem Heizmann, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group China, which directly and through joint ventures employs 100,000 Chinese workers.The slowdown is palpable in southern China\u2019s manufacturing capitals of Guangzhou and Dongguan.\u201cThis year, people are just going home earlier than before,\u201d said Judy Zhu, who runs a small shop selling cheap plastic suitcases outside a Dongguan train station. Her busiest time is usually January, when the Lunar New Year holiday typically begins, but this year her sales picked up early.Li Xiaohong, a 50-year-old construction worker, stood near a job recruitment storefront on the outskirts of Guangzhou. Handwritten signs advertised low-wage jobs, but most had age limits. None went up to 50.Mr. Li said he had worked only two weeks in the past month, as real estate developers across China ran low on cash.\u201cI used to be very busy working 12 hours a day, with only three to five days\u2019 rest in a month,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cNow, we don\u2019t have much work to do.\u201dEmployers are becoming more cautious about whom they hire, government and private sector surveys show. Not surprisingly, fewer people appear to be job-hopping.\u201cThey do not dare to quit without being able to find another one,\u201d said Lei Kaifeng, a labor recruiter at a hiring hall in Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southeastern China.The big question is what will happen next year, particularly in coastal areas dependent on exports to the United States.Many supply chains to the United States are stuffed with extra inventory thanks to stockpiling, so American importers may need fewer goods in the months ahead.\u201cI am still panicked now, afraid of facing a winter for business next year,\u201d said Cyril Liu, a 23-year-old engineer in southeastern China, who was recently sent home for a nine-day unpaid vacation because his employer, a manufacturer of printed circuit boards, has few orders. \u201cMany friends in small businesses are worried about their jobs next year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Done With Michael Cohen, Federal Prosecutors Shift Focus to Trump Family Business", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen federal prosecutors recommended a substantial prison term for President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, they linked Mr. Trump to the crimes Mr. Cohen had committed in connection with the 2016 presidential campaign.Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s self-described fixer, has provided assistance in that inquiry, which is separate from the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.In addition to implicating Mr. Trump in the payments to the two women, Mr. Cohen has told prosecutors that the company\u2019s chief financial officer was involved in discussions about them, a claim that is now a focus of the inquiry, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.Mr. Cohen has told prosecutors that he believes Mr. Trump personally approved the company\u2019s decision to reimburse him for one of the payments, one of the people said.Neither the chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, nor any other executives at the Trump Organization have been accused of wrongdoing, and there is no indication that anyone at the company will face charges in connection with the inquiry.But in recent weeks, the prosecutors contacted the company to renew a request they had made this year for documents and other materials, according to the people. The precise nature of the materials sought was unclear, but the renewed request is further indication that prosecutors continue to focus on the president\u2019s company even as the case against Mr. Cohen comes to a close, the people said.At the time of the payments to the two women, Mr. Trump was the head of the company, and although he turned over its management to his elder sons, he still owns it through a trust. While the prevailing view at the Justice Department is that a sitting president cannot be indicted, the prosecutors in Manhattan could consider charging him after leaving office. It is also possible the prosecutors could seek his testimony before he leaves office if they continue the investigation into anyone else who might have had a role in the crimes, a person briefed on the matter said.A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.A spokesman for the federal prosecutors in Manhattan, the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Weisselberg, Mary E. Mulligan, also declined to comment, as did Guy Petrillo, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen.Mr. Cohen has told the Southern District prosecutors that he arranged the hush money to the two women at the direction of Mr. Trump. In the filing on Friday, the Southern District prosecutors put the weight of their office behind Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission, saying that \u201cwith respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of\u201d Mr. Trump.The Southern District\u2019s filing also said Mr. Cohen had provided potentially \u201cuseful information about matters relating to ongoing investigations being carried out by this office.\u201d It added that prosecutors \u201cassessed Cohen to be forthright and credible, and the information he provided was largely consistent with other evidence gathered,\u201d a potentially problematic sign for the Trump Organization.Though Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers declined to comment, people close to Mr. Trump argue that Mr. Cohen would not be sentenced now if he had substantially more to offer to investigators \u2014 and they note that the Southern District memo cited Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201cpattern of deception that permeated his professional life.\u201d What\u2019s more, people who have worked for the Southern District have said that prosecutors might say things in a sentencing memo that they would not try to pursue as a separate case.Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to \u201ccausing\u201d an illegal corporate donation to Mr. Trump when he urged American Media Inc., which publishes The National Enquirer, to buy the rights to a former Playboy model\u2019s story of an affair with Mr. Trump. The deal effectively silenced the model, Karen McDougal, for the remainder of the campaign.Mr. Cohen has also told the Southern District that Mr. Weisselberg, who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime loyalists, was involved in discussions about how to pay Ms. Daniels, according to a person briefed on the matter. Mr. Cohen linked him to the deal with American Media as well.During the campaign, Mr. Cohen recorded a conversation he had with Mr. Trump about buying the rights to negative information American Media had collected on Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen told Mr. Trump, who did not know he was being recorded, that \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up.\u201d The deal was signed by American Media and Mr. Cohen, according to court papers. But a person familiar with the arrangement said that Mr. Trump balked at reimbursing America Media, as had been agreed to, and the media company was never reimbursed in relation to Ms. McDougal.But after the campaign, Mr. Weisselberg handled reimbursing Mr. Cohen for the payment to Ms. Daniels, according to people briefed on the matter. In early 2017, Mr. Cohen sought to recoup the $130,000 he paid out of his own pocket to Ms. Daniels as well as $50,000 he spent on a technology company in connection with the campaign, prosecutors have said.Not only did the Trump Organization repay those expenses, but it agreed to pay taxes Mr. Cohen might have incurred on the reimbursements. This decision to \u201cgross up\u201d Mr. Cohen went against the Trump Organization\u2019s typical reimbursement practices, people briefed on the matter said.The company also agreed to pay Mr. Cohen a $60,000 bonus. (Mr. Cohen left the company once Mr. Trump became president). In total, the company paid Mr. Cohen $420,000, doled out in monthly installments of $35,000. In internal documents, the company \u201cfalsely accounted\u201d for the payments as \u201clegal expenses,\u201d when, in fact, they were campaign expenditures, prosecutors say.One person familiar with Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s work at the Trump Organization, who was not authorized to speak on his behalf, suggested that he might not have known the purpose of Mr. Cohen\u2019s reimbursements, noting that Mr. Cohen often did personal legal work for the president and his family. That kind of work was generally performed with few, if any, questions asked, the person said.Rebecca R. Ruiz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Effectively Accuse Trump of Defrauding Voters. What Does It Mean?", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The latest revelations by prosecutors investigating President Trump and his team draw a portrait of a candidate who personally directed an illegal scheme to manipulate the 2016 election and whose advisers had more contact with Russia than Mr. Trump has ever acknowledged.In the narrative that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and New York prosecutors are building, Mr. Trump continued to secretly seek to do business in Russia deep into his presidential campaign even as Russian agents made more efforts to influence him. At the same time, in this account he ordered hush payments to two women to suppress stories of impropriety in violation of campaign finance law.The prosecutors made clear in a sentencing memo filed on Friday that they viewed efforts by Mr. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to squelch the stories as nothing less than a perversion of a democratic election \u2014 and by extension they effectively accused the president of defrauding voters, questioning the legitimacy of his victory.On Saturday, Mr. Trump dismissed the filings, and his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, minimized the importance of any potential campaign finance violations. Democrats, however, said they could lead to impeachment.\u201cWhile many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.\u201cHe did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1,\u201d they continued. \u201cIn the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.\u201dThe exposure on campaign finance laws poses a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, which before now has focused mainly on rebutting allegations of collusion and obstruction while trying to call into question Mr. Mueller\u2019s credibility.\u201cUntil now, you had two different charges, allegations, whatever you want to call them,\u201d Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the incoming Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cOne was collusion with the Russians. One was obstruction of justice and all that entails. And now you have a third \u2014 that the president was at the center of a massive fraud against the American people.\u201dMr. Giuliani pointed to that outcome on Saturday to argue that the president should not be similarly charged.But Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty under that interpretation of the law, and even if Mr. Trump cannot be charged while in office, the House could still investigate or even seek to impeach him. The framers of the Constitution specifically envisioned impeachment as a remedy for removing a president who obtained office through corrupt means, and legal scholars have long concluded that the threshold of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d does not necessarily require a statutory crime.If the campaign finance case as laid out by prosecutors is true, Mr. Nadler said, Mr. Trump would be likely to meet the criteria for an impeachable offense, and he said he would instruct his committee to investigate when he takes over in January.But he added that did not necessarily mean that the committee should vote to impeach Mr. Trump. \u201cIs it serious enough to justify impeachment?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat is another question.\u201dThe strategy of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers has been predicated on the assurance by senior Justice Department officials that if Mr. Mueller found evidence that the president broke the law, he would not be indicted while in office. But the hush money investigation is being led by a separate office of prosecutors in New York, and far less time has been spent publicly or privately trying to protect Mr. Trump from that inquiry.And while the prevailing view at the Justice Department is that a sitting president cannot be indicted, that does not mean a president cannot be charged after leaving office. The prosecutors in New York have examined the statute of limitations on the campaign finance violations and believe charges could be brought against Mr. Trump if he is not re-elected, according to a person briefed on the matter.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers view that as unlikely if it is based solely on the current charges.At the White House on Friday evening, staff members gathered for a holiday dinner with Mr. Trump and the first lady as if nothing were wrong. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have told him that the latest filings do not present a danger to him legally, although they cautioned him that the political risks were hard to calculate, according to people familiar with the discussions.One adviser said the president\u2019s team had concluded that Mr. Trump was not likely to face a threat from prosecution in the New York case because if Mr. Cohen had more to deliver, then prosecutors would not be bringing him to court for sentencing in the coming week or requesting substantial prison time. Another adviser said that the Cohen threat appeared to be over.For public consumption, at least, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies chose to focus on the Russia matter on Saturday, arguing again that no wrongdoing had been proved.\u201cOn the Mueller situation, we\u2019re very happy with what we are reading because there was no collusion whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cThe last thing I want is help from Russia on a campaign. You should ask Hillary Clinton about Russia.\u201dRepresentative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who will be the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the new Congress, which begins next month, said he saw no reason conservatives should walk away from Mr. Trump given his record of policy achievements and questions about the impartiality of the president\u2019s investigators.\u201cI always come back to the facts,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cTo date, not one bit of evidence of any type of coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election.\u201dIf prosecutors have conclusive evidence of conspiracy, they have not shown their hand. But the filings in recent days made clear that while Mr. Trump repeatedly insisted he had no business dealings in Russia, it was not without trying.Mr. Trump\u2019s business was pursuing a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow until June 2016, while Mr. Trump was locking up the Republican nomination and long after Mr. Cohen had previously said the project was dropped.At the same time, Mr. Cohen, starting in November 2015, was in contact with a well-connected Russian who proposed \u201csynergy on a government level\u201d with the Trump campaign and proposed a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The Russian said such a meeting could grease the way for the tower, telling Mr. Cohen that there was \u201cno bigger warranty in any project than consent\u201d by Mr. Putin.In his own court memo, Mr. Mueller said that Mr. Cohen\u2019s false account that the deal had collapsed in January 2016 was designed \u201cin hopes of limiting the investigations into possible Russian influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election \u2014 an issue of heightened national interest.\u201dThe president\u2019s lawyers have been deeply concerned that Mr. Trump could be portrayed as an unindicted co-conspirator in court documents. As he was preparing to submit written responses to questions from Mr. Mueller last month, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers learned about language the special counsel wanted to include in a plea agreement with a conservative conspiracy theorist, who was under investigation for his links to WikiLeaks, which released Democratic emails that intelligence agencies said were stolen by Russian agents.The document said that the conspiracy theorist, Jerome Corsi, understood that one of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates, Roger J. Stone Jr., was \u201cin regular contact with senior members of the Trump campaign, including with then-candidate Donald J. Trump,\u201d when Mr. Stone asked Mr. Corsi to find out from the head of WikiLeaks what he had in store for the Clinton campaign.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers feared that Mr. Mueller was trying to cast Mr. Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers held off sending the answers and demanded a meeting with Justice Department officials and Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, according to one person close to the president.In a meeting at the Justice Department that was presided over by the principal associate deputy attorney general, Ed O\u2019Callaghan, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers \u2014 including Mr. Giuliani and Jay Sekulow \u2014 expressed concern to Mr. Mueller\u2019s team. It was unclear what Mr. Mueller\u2019s team said in response, but shortly thereafter Mr. Trump sent in his answers.Mr. Corsi has declined to accept a plea deal and has not been charged with a crime.Although Mr. Trump asserted on Saturday that he was \u201chappy\u201d with the latest filings, others did not agree. The Cohen information alone \u201cputs impeachment on the table, and I can\u2019t help but think that that is what this is barreling toward,\u201d said Rob Stutzman, a California-based Republican strategist who has been critical of Mr. Trump. \u201cAny other presidency at this point would have been done when their own Department of Justice filed something like that.\u201dBut while the House can impeach a president on a majority vote, conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds vote, meaning that unless at least 20 Republican senators abandon Mr. Trump, he is safe from removal. Despite the losses in the House last month, Republicans, if anything, have moved closer to the president.While liberals are pressing Democrats to move on impeachment, party leaders remain wary, fearing a backlash. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, said the standard set during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton for lying under oath certainly puts Mr. Trump \u201cin impeachment territory\u201d because of the campaign finance issue.\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d he added, \u201cin the compendium of Donald Trump\u2019s offenses against the rule of law and the Constitution, this may not be in the top five.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Michael S.

{"Headline": "Vietnam\u2019s Sad Hunt: 300,000 Missing Souls ", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDecades after the war with America ended, Vietnamese families continue to search for the remains of their kin who are still missing in action. Mr. Babcock, a teacher of writing, is working on a book about contemporary Vietnam.On July 27, the day a collection of remains believed to be those of American soldiers lost in the Korean War were flown out of North Korea, I was driving from Hanoi to Vietnam\u2019s rural northern province of Yen Bai. My host that morning was Ngo Thuy Hang, the 42-year-old vice director of Marin, a local nonprofit devoted to helping Vietnamese families locate the remains of their loved ones.More than 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers are still missing from the war with America, a heartbreaking statistic that reverberates across thousands of Vietnamese families, mostly in the north. And though Vietnam\u2019s government has made scattered efforts to search for remains, the resources devoted to finding the missing Vietnamese are a small fraction of those devoted to recovering the 1,600 Americans still listed as M.I.A. from the same war.Having a missing family member is particularly traumatic in Vietnam\u2019s culture of ancestor worship, which dictates that if the dead aren\u2019t found and buried along with other ancestors in their hometown, where relatives can pray and honor them, the dead person becomes a lost soul, wandering homeless and hungry, in a kind of permanent purgatory.We were headed to a small village outside of Yen Bai\u2019s sleepy main town to visit Nguyen Thi Sinh, 96, who lost two sons in the war with America. In 2014 the government made her one of 40,000 Heroic Mothers of Vietnam, an official title given to \u201cmothers who have made numerous contributions and sacrifices for the cause of national liberation,\u201d the sacrifices being losing more than one son, losing an only son or losing one son and having another return wounded. The younger of Ms. Sinh\u2019s two sons killed in the war, Binh, died in 1973 near the city of Hue; his body was recovered and buried in the family cemetery. Her older son, Ky, who reportedly died in 1968 in the southern-central province of Binh Dinh, is still missing.\u201cI try not to worry because worrying doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Ms. Sinh said, smiling, \u201cbut it would be great if my son could come home by the end of this year.\u201dTo the right of where we sat was a large, carved wood altar holding fruit and incense. On the wall above the altar hung pictures of Binh and Ky in military uniform.A volunteer from Ms. Hang\u2019s group sitting next to Ms. Sinh took her hand and said the process took time, with a lot of old paperwork to sort through and people to contact.\u201cYes, yes, I know,\u201d Ms. Sinh said, her voice wavering a bit but still firm. \u201cReally, I am happy to just hear any news at all about my son.\u201dBack in Hanoi, Ms. Hang runs Marin from a two-bedroom apartment in a leaky building on the city\u2019s outskirts. The apartment doubles as her home. Marin is financed by small, individual donations and operates on an annual budget of about $10,000. \u201cYou need to call the local military office in Ninh Thuan province and find out where and how he was killed,\u201d she told a caller who was looking for his uncle.After 15 years of helping families track down missing soldiers, Ms. Hang has become an expert on the minutiae of military records and arcane government paperwork. The families seeking her help usually have little more information than that on the official death notice \u2014 name, birth date, enlistment date, date and place of death (which is often recorded simply as \u201cThe Southern front\u201d). For many families, Ms. Hang is their only hope.Since the fighting between Americans and Vietnamese ended in 1975, the Vietnamese government has taken some steps to recover the bodies. Shortly after the war ended, official remains-gathering teams traveled to the central provinces, to the sites of some of the worst battles, to dig up hastily buried or abandoned soldiers. The task of identifying the remains was complicated by the brutal nature of the war; the artillery used by Americans and their Southern Vietnamese allies was so powerful it often obliterated everything in its path. Even when the search teams found a corpse or a set of bones, identification was difficult because North Vietnamese soldiers weren\u2019t issued dog tags as their American and South Vietnamese counterparts were.It wasn\u2019t until the early 2000s, when Vietnam\u2019s economic situation had improved after market reforms in the 1990s, that families began to search in earnest for their missing loved ones. In overwhelmingly self-financed efforts, they pooled resources and began to travel from the north to the central provinces to search for the bodies of relatives. Though the Vietnamese government has made overtures of support for gathering and identifying remains, its efforts continue to be mostly limited and often inept, according to volunteers and families with whom I spoke.\u201cIn theory,\u201d one Hanoian who had spent 10 years looking for the body of her uncle told me, \u201cmy family could make an application and request the army to go find the body of my uncle, but I knew it would take lots of time and not be much help.\u201dThe Vietnamese government has focused its search efforts mostly on mass graves and offers help only to families who already know the exact place where their loved one died. The thousands and thousands of other families who don\u2019t have this information are on their own.In 2014, the Vietnamese government announced that it would invest about $25 million in a huge DNA identification project \u2014 a joint venture with a German biotech firm named Bioglobe. But little has been done so far. \u201cThey say they\u2019re building something, but we never know,\u201d the woman who was still looking for her uncle said, adding that she assumes any funds actually set aside for identifying remains would just end up in the pockets of corrupt government officials.The United States spends about $100 million annually on efforts to find its own 1,597 service members who are listed as missing in Southeast Asia. Since 1991, the United States has maintained an office in Hanoi dedicated to finding its missing; today it operates as an outpost of the Defense P.O.W./M.I.A. Accounting Agency on Tran Phu, one of downtown Hanoi\u2019s most beautiful leafy streets.In the Vietnamese government, there is no similarly centralized office devoted to finding the missing Vietnamese soldiers. There is, though, a centralized government office devoted to finding missing American soldiers. The missing Vietnamese soldiers are hardly forgotten, though. The search for remains has become something of an obsession for the public. Remains-gathering stories are the subject of TV specials, postwar literature and local newspaper stories. \u201cIt\u2019s just normal to us,\u201d a Vietnamese friend remarked.One night, I started chatting with a taxi driver, Tuan, and found out that two of his uncles were killed in the war and listed as missing. The family had gone on multiple search trips, driving all day down to Quang Ngai province, to look for the bodies. They\u2019d managed to find one set of remains, but the other, his uncle Thanh, was still missing.A few days later I visited Tuan at home to get the rest of the story from his mother and father, veterans themselves. Tuan\u2019s mother, Minh, recounted the last search trip, when the family had come up short and been forced to drive back to Hanoi empty-handed.What will you do now? I asked.Minh stared at me for a second as if the answer was obvious.\u201cKeep looking,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, we\u2019re already planning a trip for next year.\u201dReporting for this article was made possible by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Joseph Babcock teaches writing at the University of California, San Diego, and is working on a book about contemporary Vietnam.Advertisement"}

Instead, He Went Home to Make \u2018Roma.\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "FeatureThe director\u2019s new film tells the story of his childhood in Mexico \u2014 but seen from the vantage of the domestic worker who raised him.Supported byIt\u2019s tempting to compare Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s extraordinary new film, \u201cRoma\u201d \u2014 which has already won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and begins streaming on Netflix on Dec. 14 \u2014 to landmark neorealist movies. An exquisite party scene at a country estate reminded me of Jean Renoir\u2019s \u201cThe Rules of the Game.\u201d A climax near a churning ocean brought to mind Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s \u201cThe 400 Blows.\u201d A landscape of urban poverty recalled Vittorio De Sica\u2019s \u201cBicycle Thieves.\u201d But Cuar\u00f3n himself sought to imitate no one. What he wanted was something like the scene of the girl and her dolphin balloon: beauty, naturalism and spontaneous emotion.To achieve this, Cuar\u00f3n returned to Mexico to shoot a film in his homeland for the first time in nearly 20 years. He hired a cast of mostly nonactors and filmed in absolute continuity. None of the cast and crew ever saw the script, so every plot twist hit them with surprise. The crew was so blindsided by one scene that they burst into tears as the camera rolled. Actors were given their lines only the morning of the shoot. Many times, they had no lines at all; Cuar\u00f3n simply suggested how they might react to other characters or even disrupt an entire scene. Often Cuar\u00f3n gave them contradictory instructions. \u201cSo when we began filming, we had chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was it. Everyone would have to exist inside that chaos, as in life.\u201d More than anything, he told me, his job was to watch the actors carefully to spot the moments when some essential truth emerged.For most of his life, Cuar\u00f3n has struggled to juggle his auteur ambitions with his need to stay solvent. For years, when asked why he directed this or that Hollywood movie \u2014 \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d say, or \u201cHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\u201d \u2014 Cuar\u00f3n has given journalists variations on \u201cI was running out of money and I needed to survive.\u201d He wrote \u201cGravity\u201d with his eldest son, Jon\u00e1s Cuar\u00f3n, in a fit of desperation after another project they started lost its funding in the 2008 financial crisis. Together they knocked out a rough draft of the script in a day. Making the existential space thriller, however, took four and a half years \u2014 a process complicated by the challenges of filming the effects of microgravity and the need to sign an A-list star to justify its $100 million budget. Sandra Bullock ultimately agreed to spend nine hours at a time in a 10-by-10-foot special-effects box, executing choreographed moves so precise that her acting verged on modern dance. Released in 2013, \u201cGravity\u201d grossed more than $700 million worldwide, won seven Academy Awards and made Cuar\u00f3n the first Mexican ever to receive the Oscar for best director. After that, he could shoot whatever he liked.\u201cThey offered me bigger pictures with bigger budgets, bigger everything,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n explained. Instead, he poured himself into \u201cRoma\u201d: a Spanish-language, black-and-white period piece. Most of the film is set in the same Roma neighborhood of Mexico City where Cuar\u00f3n grew up. Ninety percent of its scenes were inspired by his family\u2019s history. \u201cThis,\u201d his manager, Steve Golin, told me, \u201cwas the most expensive home movie ever made.\u201dWhat Cuar\u00f3n wanted, the director told me, was to make \u201ca kind of spiritual X-ray of my family, with its wounds and its sores.\u201d Staring into childhood trauma, stylizing it, exploring it from the vantage of maturity in order to understand the construction of the self: Such therapeutic forensics are so common among artists that they\u2019re almost a clich\u00e9. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s brilliance lies not in his subject but in his decision to make himself a peripheral character. Almost every scene includes an event that would have been unforgettable for a young boy: the night he witnessed a fire, the afternoon he discovered a family secret, the day he nearly killed a sibling. But you need to track back to piece that all together, because Paco, the character based on Cuar\u00f3n, rarely holds the center of the frame. Instead \u201cRoma\u201d follows Cleo \u2014 a character based on a domestic worker who has lived with Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s family ever since he was a newborn.One of the most potent memories of Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s childhood is an absolute lack of freedom of expression. He felt it viscerally at school, where he and his three siblings tried to hide the fact that their father, Alfredo Cuar\u00f3n, a doctor specializing in nuclear medicine, abandoned their family when Cuar\u00f3n was 10. Dr. Cuar\u00f3n never paid much attention to his second-eldest son \u2014 Cuar\u00f3n has few childhood memories of him \u2014 but after his departure their contact slowly dwindled to nothing. His mother, Cristina Orozco, a pharmaceutical biochemist, struggled alone to pay the family\u2019s bills. (She bought Cuar\u00f3n a Super 8 camera, but couldn\u2019t afford to keep him stocked in film.) In high school, priests taught that divorce was a mortal sin. Cuar\u00f3n never believed that, but when other kids asked questions, he lied: Of course his father lived at home. He just needed to travel for work. A lot.\u201cThat contributed to whatever continued later on as insecurities, as solitudes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also had a lot do with a pretty lonely adolescence where film was not only a passion, it turned into a refuge, into the only friend.\u201d Long before his parents split, Cuar\u00f3n knew he wanted to make films. When his cousins played war games, he played \u201cshooting war movies.\u201d But when he was a Catholic-school pariah, his need for cinematic escape intensified. He tried to visit every single movie theater in Mexico City, often watching a double feature a day.Cuar\u00f3n found tenderness mostly in Liboria Rodr\u00edguez, a domestic worker who, he said, is like his second mother. She sat next to him at the movies and told him stories about Tepelmeme, the Oaxacan pueblo where she was born. He grew up calling her \u201cMam\u00e1\u201d as well. \u201cI think that it\u2019s one of the strongest emotional ties in my family,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says of Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cIt\u2019s part of that very perverse relationship that the bourgeoisie has with domestic workers. It\u2019s that on one hand, yes, they do the laundry, they do the cooking, they do the shopping. But in addition to working extremely hard in what would be the definition of their employment, they also take on roles that should be filled by the parents, you know? They wake the children, they give them breakfast, they tuck them into bed, they pick them up from school. That presence is so beautiful, but why is that presence needed? Simply because the parents are absent.\u201dAfter \u201cGravity,\u201d when Cuar\u00f3n decided to make a movie about these years, he asked Rodr\u00edguez and his family for permission. \u201cI said yes,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez told me, recalling their conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s already healed. It\u2019s not important anymore. So it\u2019s fine now.\u201d They spent hours on long-distance calls talking about the tiniest details of her daily life in the 1970s. What kind of alarm clock did she use? Where did she keep her clothes? When I asked if she would like money for her story, she scoffed. \u201cHow barbaric. I did it because he\u2019s my child. It\u2019s something done for love.\u201dReconstructing their past, Cuar\u00f3n saw how little, as a child, he understood of her life. As an indigenous woman born into rural poverty, Rodr\u00edguez suffered different heartbreaks and challenges than her white, middle-class employers. \u201cWhen I was a boy, she would tell me about her pueblo, and she told me about the terrible cold they suffered and the hunger they suffered. But for me as a boy, it\u2019s the cold equivalent to \u2018Shoot, I forgot my sweater to the movie,\u2019 and the hunger is \u2018[Expletive], they\u2019re running two hours late with dinner,\u2019 you know? I had no awareness,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n said. His grandmother discouraged Rodr\u00edguez from using electricity for anything other than work. \u201cThe family can have all the damn lights on all day, and it\u2019s her job to go around turning them all off while the family is upstairs, but they\u201d \u2014 domestic workers \u2014 \u201care not allowed to use electricity in their own room.\u201d Cuar\u00f3n shook his head with disgust. \u201cIt speaks not only to what she did, but to my family\u2019s attitude toward her.\u201dCuar\u00f3n methodically shredded his old blindness so he could make Rodr\u00edguez the protagonist of \u201cRoma.\u201d The film paints 1970s classism, parental neglect and federal violence with icy neutrality, but love colors its close-ups of Cleo, the character he based on Rodr\u00edguez. She bears witness to many of her employers\u2019 humiliations: slaps, betrayals, car accidents. Cuar\u00f3n makes us the witnesses to hers. She works while her employers relax and rests only when they sleep. The children snuggle with her. The adults bark at her. By training and by necessity, Cleo shares little of what she thinks, and even less of what she feels, with other characters. She is a woman of tremendous sensitivity and limited verbal expression.The search for an actor to carry this tricky role took eight months. The casting director, Luis Rosales, traveled all over southern Mexico auditioning more than 3,000 women in cities and villages. Then one day Yalitza Aparicio appeared at an audition in a town in Oaxaca as a favor to her sister. Aparicio had just finished her degree at a teachers\u2019 college and was looking forward to taking charge of her own preschool classroom. She and her close friend Nancy Garc\u00eda, who plays the family cook, decided to do \u201cRoma\u201d as a lark. \u201cAt the beginning, I told Alfonso I don\u2019t know how to act,\u201d Aparacio told me. \u201cHe said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll explain it to you later.\u2019\u2009\u201d She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting.\u201d Yet Aparacio possesses an ability to convey emotion through the tiniest shifts in her brows and eyes. In one powerful scene she suggests Cleo\u2019s entire sexual history while murmuring no more than a handful of words.Some journalists have accused Cuar\u00f3n of not going far enough, claiming that Cleo is a passive character. The criticism puzzles Cuar\u00f3n. \u201cThere\u2019s a flaw in commercial film where the strong character, the active character, has to give big speeches and make big disclosures,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n told me. He wanted to show Cleo\u2019s strength without deforming her into a Hollywood stereotype. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have grand speeches, but in the end she\u2019s someone who binds together an entire family.\u201dBut after his first child, Jon\u00e1s, was born in 1981, when Cuar\u00f3n was 20, he shelved his cinematic dreams in favor of supporting his son. With no prospects and no degree, he took a job at the National Museum of Art and was rescued from a career as a sad bureaucrat only when the producer Fernando C\u00e1mara and the director Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda Agraz came searching for him a year later. If Cuar\u00f3n left right away to become the assistant director for one of their pictures, they\u2019d pay him even more than his pathetic salary.So began Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s life as a \u201cblue collar\u201d worker in the Mexican film industry. Boom operator, editor, production assistant, assistant cameraman: He took every gig he could until he established himself as the go-to assistant director for foreign productions filming in Mexico. That was his best shot at learning technique in the 1980s. State funding for films had almost disappeared. Many Mexican directors scrounged together a living by shooting political spots for corrupt politicians or \u201cvideohomes,\u201d cheap films shot quickly for export to Mexican immigrants in the United States. Scarce resources fostered a culture of secrecy and rivalry. One well-respected Mexican cinematographer would cover his lenses on set, so that no one could learn which apertures he used. Cuar\u00f3n feared that he might never direct anything of his own.For two years, Cuar\u00f3n shuttled back and forth between Mexico and California. His relationship with Jon\u00e1s\u2019s mother, Mariana Elizondo, had fallen apart. In Los Angeles, he lived out of a beat-up Volkswagen Rabbit and crashed with friends like Lubezki. Every dollar he saved on motels was a dollar he could bring back home. He jokes that he was a \u201cwetback deluxe.\u201dHis break came in 1993 when Sydney Pollack hired him to direct an episode of \u201cFallen Angels,\u201d a Showtime series that he produced. Aiming for highbrow at a time when cable movie channels showed mostly soft porn, \u201cFallen Angels\u201d contracted a roster of hotshot directors, like Steven Soderbergh and Jonathan Kaplan. To keep the budget low, however, Pollack also hired Cuar\u00f3n. \u201cWe brought him in because we thought we could beat him up to do it for less money,\u201d Steve Golin, then a producer on the series, told me.Cuar\u00f3n felt so insecure when he showed up for shooting that he stuttered when he spoke English and could barely bring himself to talk to the lead actors, Alan Rickman and Laura Dern. By the end of Day 1, he was wildly behind schedule. Then Rickman called for him. Cuar\u00f3n dreaded being chewed out. He found Dern and Rickman sitting together. Alfonso, Rickman said. We are here for you. We want you to tell us what you want. We believe in you.That night Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki stayed in a dive motel near the Hollywood sign. There were stains all over the carpets, stains all over the sheets, stains all over the synthetic coverlet. \u201cAll that night I wanted to cry,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n told me. \u201cBut there were Alan\u2019s words.\u201d The next morning, he announced that they would reshoot all the scenes they\u2019d done the day before. His assistant director protested, but Cuar\u00f3n insisted. They reshot Day 1 and shot everything they needed for Day 2. In the end, Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s episode, \u201cMurder, Obliquely,\u201d won a CableACE Award for best directing, paving the way for the rest of his career.So began Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s years as a director for hire. He moved to New York \u2014 he says he couldn\u2019t bear the industry chatter in Los Angeles \u2014 and devoted himself to reading scripts. A studio executive advised him that if he wanted work in Hollywood, he shouldn\u2019t mention writing. At first, this wasn\u2019t so painful. Cuar\u00f3n focused on polishing other skills. His third film, \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d (1998), is proof of how quickly he came to master every aspect of movie production: sets, costumes, lighting, sound, choreography, shot-planning. When the French critic Michel Ciment screened a clip of it at Cannes last year \u2014 a long take of Ethan Hawke searching for Gwyneth Paltrow as an aria plays \u2014 the audience responded with cheers. But Cuar\u00f3n himself looked sheepish.He had signed on to \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d because he needed money and liked the idea of working with Robert De Niro. He didn\u2019t really get Dickens, but he thought he could compensate with visuals. As he shot the film with Lubezki, though, he felt disgusted with the process of making only aesthetic decisions. One day as he and Lubezki drove a van full of lighting gear from a shoot in New Jersey, he gazed at the passing landscape and asked out loud, \u201cWhy are we stylizing all this?\u201dBefore \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d premiered, he was developing a screenplay for a road movie with Miramax, to star Viggo Mortensen. But when \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d tanked, Miramax abandoned him again. The scripts that came his way got worse. He didn\u2019t like movies anymore. He didn\u2019t like movie people. In the midst of this depression, Cuar\u00f3n rented a couple dozen of his favorite films and holed himself up in his apartment on West 11th Street for two weeks. The old cure still worked. Buoyed, he called his brother Carlos and asked him to come to New York so they could write another script. He and Lubezki ditched the dollies and cranes in favor of hand-held cameras and natural lighting. The producer David Linde \u2014 then a partner at Good Machine and now the executive producer for \u201cRoma\u201d at Participant Media \u2014 financed the picture so that Cuar\u00f3n could reinvent himself in Mexico.Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s second mother, Liboria Rodr\u00edguez, has a bit part in the film, as a domestic worker who carries a sandwich on a plate to Luna. As she walks through a mansion, a telephone rings and rings. Loafing on a sofa, Luna ignores it until \u201cLeo\u201d hands him lunch, passes him the phone and pats his head. Later in the movie, Luna remembers her as the station wagon passes the village where she was born, but he says nothing to his feckless companions. Fleeting though they are, these scenes stayed with me for years. In them, you can feel the mix of affection and indignation that would fuel \u201cRoma.\u201dCritics often focus on Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s prowess with the long take. Certainly, his 12\u00bd-minute opening for \u201cGravity\u201d \u2014 shot by Lubezki \u2014 ranks among cinema\u2019s more jaw-dropping feats. For Cuar\u00f3n, however, the long take is only a means to an end. \u201cThe Olympics of the long take don\u2019t interest me,\u201d he says. \u201cRoma\u201d contains scenes that are full of quick cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s about how to lead to that thematic content through the filmic experience,\u201d he told me, \u201cso that it\u2019s given in the filmic experience, not explained.\u201dFor the first time in his career, he wrote a feature-length script entirely by himself. He wrote scenes randomly at first, using memory as a kind of Geiger counter to locate where the most potent material lay. He didn\u2019t question whether the script was too long or too short, whether it had a first, second and third act, whether it would be boring. For a while, he thought the screenplay might not have any plot, but he still decided not to share it with his usual sounding boards \u2014 del Toro; Carlos; the director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, whom he met in the 1990s. Lubezki wanted to shoot it \u2014 \u201cI thought that it was the most beautiful script, probably, I\u2019ve ever read in my life\u201d \u2014 but shortly after preproduction began he had to depart for a family situation. \u201cI would have never abandoned Alfonso in his most personal movie for anything else.\u201dCuar\u00f3n gave producers dates to research, having them look up, say, which television programs played on a certain night in 1970. I was particularly stunned by his recreation of the Corpus Christi massacre. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s crew not only watched archival footage of the event, they also located and interviewed survivors. More than 800 extras were cast for the scene: students, paramilitaries, police, bystanders. These moments in \u201cRoma\u201d amount to an indictment of Mexico\u2019s federal government, a dossier on a crime against humanity.When the shooting wrapped, he spent months in color correction to ensure that every frame looked like a photograph by Ansel Adams. In truth, Cuar\u00f3n never gave up on beauty; he has just subordinated that passion. \u201cIf you begin with aesthetics, you begin with preconceptions about what is beautiful,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd in great art, it\u2019s the reverse. It\u2019s the revolutions in language that create other aesthetic forms.\u201dThough he didn\u2019t understand it as he composed the screenplay, he later realized that the urgent need he felt to do this film stemmed from a need to reclaim, and to come to terms with, his own identity. \u201cFor almost a decade I lived in that chimera of cosmopolitanism,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I do believe that we are all citizens of the world, but if you\u2019re not centered and deeply rooted in a cultural identity, then that cosmopolitanism turns infertile.\u201d One of Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s greatest themes is the tension between the individual and the environment. His movies can be read as studies in how what we do is shaped by where we live. In \u201cRoma,\u201d he turned that approach on himself. \u201cThe film confronted me with the mystery of what I no longer am yet still am at the same time,\u201d he said.Mexico has also changed and not changed since the 1970s. \u201cNow I go back to Mexico, and I almost envy the young people,\u201d he said. \u201cMexico is exuberant, full of life, very creative.\u201d The changes, he thinks, have to do with the arrival of the internet and the end of the PRI\u2019s political monopoly. Yet many of the miseries of the 1970s endure. In 2014, 43 students from a teachers\u2019 college in Ayotzinapa disappeared. Three film students disappeared in Jalisco this past March. Social mobility remains dismal. \u201cRoma\u201d speaks to the present through the past.Still, cycles can be broken. The last day that I saw Cuar\u00f3n, he received an urgent text. \u201cHold on,\u201d he told me. His eyes lit up with amusement as he understood the situation. His 13-year-old son had forgotten his computer at home. Could Dad run and fetch it before he needed it for class? Cuar\u00f3n had been up until 2 the night before, preparing \u201cRoma\u201d for Mexico\u2019s Morelia film festival and going through page proofs of a companion book of photographs published by Assouline. Every time I saw him, he looked like a man badly in need of a good night\u2019s sleep. Yet he turned to me without a trace of irritation: Would I mind?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Fight Gentrification, a Brooklyn Pastor Plans to Build 2,100 Apartments", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "The Rev. A.R. Bernard has partnered with a developer to transform the land around his Brooklyn church into shops, a school and 2,100 apartments.Supported byOn Sundays, hundreds of cars squeeze into the 10-acre parking lot of a sprawling megachurch in East New York, Brooklyn, that caters to the largest evangelical congregation in the city.That dream may finally come true.Mr. Bernard has partnered with the Gotham Organization, a real estate developer, to transform the land around the church into an all-encompassing campus of nine residential buildings with 2,100 units for very low to middle-income residents, as well as a school, a grocery store and on-site services for seniors.\u201cThe mind-set in inner-city conditions is doing everything you can to get out and not come back,\u201d said Mr. Bernard, whose 43,000-member congregation makes the church, founded as a storefront church in Williamsburg in 1978, a requisite stop for any politician on the campaign trail. \u201cHere you\u2019re talking about, \u2018Wow. I want to stay. I want to experience this community. There\u2019s a future. There\u2019s hope.\u2019\u201dThe rezoning plan faced fierce opposition from many residents who, pointing to nearby gentrified neighborhoods like Williamsburg, feared an influx of new residential buildings would invite wealthier newcomers, displace longtime residents and alter the character of the neighborhood.\u201cThe gentrification of Brooklyn is not the future,\u201d Mr. Bernard said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening now, and I think that this is a very creative response to that reality.\u201dThe plans include curbless streets that lead to the heart of the complex, where the church, the school, a 299-seat theater and a community center surround a green quad similar to those on college campuses. The shops, on the ground-floor of the residential buildings, mostly face public avenues around the development\u2019s perimeter.\u201cWe need to rebuild an infrastructure of opportunity in this country,\u201d said Vishaan Chakrabarti, the founder of PAU, the company overseeing the design. \u201cAll of the things that create social mobility, whether it\u2019s affordable housing, cultural institutions, health care, education \u2014 this project is about all of that. That was very fundamental for us.\u201dCouncilwoman Inez Barron, whose district includes the church, said the plan was ambitious and had great potential. She initially raised concerns about the proposed heights of the buildings, which the developers eventually modified: Most will be 13 to 15 stories high, lower than the looming towers of Starrett City.\u201cI think that housing in East New York should be affordable to the people that live in East New York,\u201d Ms. Barron, a Democrat, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a significant amount of people that live at 130 percent of area median income.\u201dAnd while many residents in the area said they supported the project, in no small part because of Mr. Bernard\u2019s stature in the community, others remained skeptical.\u201cHow many more buildings do you need in this neighborhood? It brings in too many people,\u201d said Daniel Sedney, 59, who lives in East New York and was visiting his mother in Starrett City on Sunday.He added, \u201cAffordable housing has turned out to be a lot of garbage. A lot of it is for middle income people,\u201d said Mr. Sedney, who said he had unsuccessfully applied for an affordable unit on multiple occasions.Mr. Bernard, citing the deterioration of public housing in New York City as an example, argued that mixed-income buildings, in which units with higher rents help subsidize the lower-rent units, were one of the few viable ways of creating a sustainable model of housing.\u201cWe cannot warehouse one income level,\u201d Mr. Bernard said. \u201cThe only way that we can change the community and respond to the gentrification of Brooklyn is to have a mixture of income in our communities.

{"Headline": "Secret Experiment in Alabama Senate Race Imitated Russian Tactics", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Russia\u2019s online election machinations came to light last year, a group of Democratic tech experts decided to try out similarly deceptive tactics in the fiercely contested Alabama Senate race, according to people familiar with the effort and a report on its results.The secret project, carried out on Facebook and Twitter, was likely too small to have a significant effect on the race, in which the Democratic candidate it was designed to help, Doug Jones, edged out the Republican, Roy S. Moore. But it was a sign that American political operatives of both parties have paid close attention to the Russian methods, which some fear may come to taint elections in the United States.One participant in the Alabama project, Jonathon Morgan, is the chief executive of New Knowledge, a small cyber security firm that wrote a scathing account of Russia\u2019s social media operations in the 2016 election that was released this week by the Senate Intelligence Committee.An internal report on the Alabama effort, obtained by The New York Times, says explicitly that it \u201cexperimented with many of the tactics now understood to have influenced the 2016 elections.\u201dThe project\u2019s operators created a Facebook page on which they posed as conservative Alabamians, using it to try to divide Republicans and even to endorse a write-in candidate to draw votes from Mr. Moore. It involved a scheme to link the Moore campaign to thousands of Russian accounts that suddenly began following the Republican candidate on Twitter, a development that drew national media attention.\u201cWe orchestrated an elaborate \u2018false flag\u2019 operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet,\u201d the report says.Mr. Morgan said in an interview that the Russian botnet ruse \u201cdoes not ring a bell,\u201d adding that others had worked on the effort and had written the report. He said he saw the project as \u201ca small experiment\u201d designed to explore how certain online tactics worked, not to affect the election.Mr. Morgan said he could not account for the claims in the report that the project sought to \u201cenrage and energize Democrats\u201d and \u201cdepress turnout\u201d among Republicans, partly by emphasizing accusations that Mr. Moore had pursued teenage girls when he was a prosecutor in his 30s.\u201cThe research project was intended to help us understand how these kind of campaigns operated,\u201d said Mr. Morgan. \u201cWe thought it was useful to work in the context of a real election but design it to have almost no impact.\u201dThe project had a budget of just $100,000, in a race that cost approximately $51 million, including the primaries, according to Federal Election Commission records.But however modest, the influence effort in Alabama may be a sign of things to come. Campaign veterans in both parties fear the Russian example may set off a race to the bottom, in which candidates choose social media manipulation because they fear their opponents will.\u201cSome will do whatever it takes to win,\u201d said Dan Bayens, a Kentucky-based Republican consultant. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Russia, which showed folks how to do it, you\u2019ve got consultants willing to engage in this type of behavior and political leaders who apparently find it futile to stop it.\u201dThere is no evidence that Mr. Jones sanctioned or was even aware of the social media project. Joe Trippi, a seasoned Democratic operative who served as a top adviser to the Jones campaign, said he had noticed the Russian bot swarm suddenly following Mr. Moore on Twitter. But he said it was impossible that a $100,000 operation had an impact on the race.Mr. Trippi said he was nonetheless disturbed by the stealth operation. \u201cI think the big danger is somebody in this cycle uses the dark arts of bots and social networks and it works,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019re in real trouble.\u201dDespite its small size, the Alabama project brought together some prominent names in the world of political technology. The funding came from Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, who has sought to help Democrats catch up with Republicans in their use of online technology.The money passed through American Engagement Technologies, run by Mikey Dickerson, the founding director of the United States Digital Service, which was created during the Obama administration to try to upgrade the federal government\u2019s use of technology. Sara K. Hudson, a former Justice Department fellow now with Investing in Us, a tech finance company partly funded by Mr. Hoffman, worked on the project, along with Mr. Morgan.A close collaborator of Mr. Hoffman, Dmitri Mehlhorn, the founder of Investing in Us, said in a statement that \u201cour purpose in investing in politics and civic engagement is to strengthen American democracy\u201d and that while they do not \u201cmicromanage\u201d the projects they fund, they are not aware of having financed projects that have used deception. Mr. Dickerson declined to comment and Ms. Hudson did not respond to queries.The Alabama project got started as Democrats were coming to grips with the Russians\u2019 weaponizing of social media to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump.Mr. Morgan reached out at the time to Ren\u00e9e DiResta, who would later join New Knowledge and was lead author of the report on Russian social media operations released this week.\u201cI know there were people who believed the Democrats needed to fight fire with fire,\u201d Ms. DiResta said, adding that she disagreed. \u201cIt was absolutely chatter going around the party.\u201dBut she said Mr. Morgan simply asked her for suggestions of online tactics worth testing. \u201cMy understanding was that they were going to investigate to what extent they could grow audiences for Facebook pages using sensational news,\u201d she said.Mr. Morgan confirmed that the project created a generic page to draw conservative Alabamians \u2014 he said he couldn\u2019t remember its name \u2014 and that Mac Watson, one of multiple write-in candidates, contacted the page. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t do anything on his behalf,\u201d he said.Mr. Watson, who runs a patio supply company in Auburn, Ala., confirmed that he got some assistance from a Facebook page whose operators seemed determined to stay in the shadows.Of dozens of conservative Alabamian-oriented pages on Facebook that he wrote to, only one replied. \u201cYou are in a particularly interesting position and from what we have read of your politics, we would be inclined to endorse you,\u201d the unnamed operator of the page wrote. After Mr. Watson answered a single question about abortion rights as a sort of test, the page offered an endorsement, though no money.\u201cThey never spent one red dime as far as I know on anything I did \u2014 they just kind of told their 400 followers, \u2018Hey, vote for this guy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Watson said.Mr. Watson never spoke with the page\u2019s author or authors by phone, and they declined a request for meeting. But he did notice something unusual: his Twitter followers suddenly ballooned from about 100 to about 10,000. The Facebook page\u2019s operators asked Mr. Watson whether he trusted anyone to set up a super PAC that could receive funding and offered advice on how to sharpen his appeal to disenchanted Republican voters.Shortly before the election, the page sent him a message, wishing him luck.Inside the Moore campaign, officials began to worry about online interference.\u201cWe did have suspicions that something odd was going on,\u201d said Rich Hobson, Mr. Moore\u2019s campaign manager. Mr. Hobson said that although he did not recall any hard evidence of interference, the campaign complained to Facebook about potential chicanery.\u201cAny and all of these things could make a difference,\u201d Mr. Hobson said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely frustrating, and we still kick ourselves that Judge Moore didn\u2019t win.\u201dWhen Election Day came, Mr. Jones became the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate in a quarter of a century, defeating Mr. Moore by 21,924 votes in a race that drew more than 22,800 write-in votes. More than 1.3 million ballots were cast over all.Many of the write-in votes went to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Condoleezza Rice \u2014 an Alabama native and former secretary of state \u2014 certain popular football coaches and Jesus Christ. Mr. Watson drew just a few hundred votes.Mr. Watson noticed one other oddity. The day after the vote, the Facebook page that had taken such an interest in him had vanished.\u201cIt was a group that, like, honest to God, next day was gone,\u201d said Mr. Watson.\u201cIt was weird,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing was weird.\u201dJonathan Martin and Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Say Trump Directed Illegal Payments During Campaign", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors said on Friday that President Trump directed illegal payments to ward off a potential sex scandal that threatened his chances of winning the White House in 2016, putting the weight of the Justice Department behind accusations previously made by his former lawyer.The lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, had said that as the election neared, Mr. Trump directed payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. But in a new memo arguing for a prison term for Mr. Cohen, prosecutors in Manhattan said he \u201cacted in coordination and at the direction of\u201d an unnamed individual, clearly referring to Mr. Trump.In another filing, prosecutors for the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference said an unnamed Russian offered Mr. Cohen \u201cgovernment level\u201d synergy between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in November 2015. That was months earlier than other approaches detailed in indictments secured by prosecutors.And in a separate case on Friday, the special counsel accused Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, of lying about his contacts with an individual they accuse of having ties to Russian intelligence, and about his interactions with Trump administration officials after he was indicted on criminal charges.Together, the filings laid bare the most direct evidence to date linking Mr. Trump to potentially criminal conduct, and added to an already substantial case that Russia was seeking to sway the 2016 election in his favor.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was less unequivocal. \u201cThe government\u2019s filings in Mr. Cohen\u2019s case tell us nothing of value that wasn\u2019t already known,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMr. Cohen has repeatedly lied and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr. Cohen is no hero.\u201dShe tried to distance Mr. Trump from the accusations against Mr. Manafort, who was convicted on financial fraud and conspiracy charges unrelated to his work for the Trump campaign. President Trump has repeatedly defended Mr. Manafort as a \u201cbrave man\u201d and dangled the possibility of a pardon for his 10 felonies, likely to result in a prison term of at least 10 years.The revelations came in multiple filings by federal prosecutors for the Southern District of New York and by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Their work has intersected because both teams have charged Mr. Cohen with crimes, and he had sought to cooperate with both.The prosecutors in New York mounted a scathing attack on Mr. Cohen\u2019s character. They rejected his plea to avoid a prison term, saying that he had \u201crepeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.\u201dThey argued that he deserved a \u201csubstantial\u201d prison term that, giving him some credit for his cooperation, could amount to just under four years. \u201cHis offenses strike at several pillars of our society and system of government: the payment of taxes; transparent and fair elections; and truthfulness before government and in business,\u201d they wrote.Mr. Cohen, 52, is to be sentenced next week for campaign finance violations, financial crimes and lying to Congress about the extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Russia.Mr. Cohen\u2019s crimes marked \u201ca pattern of deception that permeated his professional life,\u201d the Manhattan prosecutors wrote, saying that he did not deserve much leniency in exchange for his cooperation.\u201cThe sentence imposed should reflect the seriousness of Cohen\u2019s brazen violations of the election laws and attempt to counter the public cynicism that may arise when individuals like Cohen act as if the political process belongs to the rich and powerful,\u201d they said, adding that he \u201csought to influence the election from the shadows.\u201dThey emphasized that Mr. Cohen had implicated the president in payments to two women during the campaign to conceal affairs that they said they had with Mr. Trump. \u201cCohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. \u201cIndividual-1\u201d is how Mr. Trump is referred to in the document.The prosecutors have said that a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress, violated campaign finance law prohibitions against donations of more than $2,700 in a general election. A $150,000 payment by American Media Inc. to silence Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, constituted an illegal corporate donation to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the prosecutors said.The special counsel\u2019s prosecutors offered a somewhat more positive view of Mr. Cohen than the New York team, saying he went \u201cto significant lengths to assist\u201d their inquiry, including by providing relevant information he had learned from Trump Organization executives during the campaign.They cited a series of disclosures during their seven meetings with Mr. Cohen. He revealed to them that he talked with Mr. Trump about meeting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during Mr. Putin\u2019s trip to New York for a United Nations session in September 2015. That was three months after Mr. Trump had declared his candidacy for president, at a time when Mr. Cohen was aggressively pursuing the building of a Trump hotel in Moscow that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the Trump Organization.After conferring with Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen said, he reached out \u201cto gauge Russia\u2019s interest in such a meeting.\u201d It ultimately did not take place.Two months later, Mr. Cohen said, he was approached by a Russian claiming to be a \u201c\u2018trusted person\u2019 in the Russian Federation.\u201d The individual, who was not named, offered \u201csynergy on a government level\u201d with the Trump campaign. He pushed for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin to discuss politics and the proposed hotel, saying Mr. Putin\u2019s consent was the biggest \u201cwarranty\u201d for any project.Mr. Cohen said he never followed up on the Russian\u2019s invitation, in part because he was working with someone else who he believed had Kremlin connections. He also \u201cprovided information about attempts by other Russian nationals to reach the campaign\u201d and about his own interactions with Russian officials who might have tried to use the business proposal as leverage over Mr. Trump.Before he testified falsely to Congress about the Moscow hotel project, Mr. Cohen has admitted, he consulted with White House staff members and Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team. The prosecutors characterized his information about his contacts with people tied to the White House over the past two years as \u201crelevant and useful information.\u201dUnder federal guidelines, Mr. Cohen faces about four to five years in the Manhattan case, and up to six months in Mr. Mueller\u2019s case. The special counsel suggested that any prison terms be served concurrently. But the guidelines are not binding, and Judge Pauley will decide his punishment.Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Cohen of lying to prosecutors in hope of a lighter sentence. On Friday, he kept up his continuing effort to undermine public trust in the special counsel\u2019s office and in the Justice Department. In a series of Twitter messages, he derided Mr. Mueller as a friend of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director who said the president fired him in May 2017 after demanding \u201cloyalty.\u201dAsked why the president was so upset about the special counsel, Roger J. Stone Jr., a fellow critic of Mr. Mueller, said it had dawned on Mr. Trump that the inquiry was not going away, his lawyers\u2019 promises notwithstanding. \u201cHe has finally figured out that this is about him,\u201d he said.Spurred on by the White House, House Republican lawmakers used their last days in control of the chamber\u2019s majority to press Mr. Comey Friday on what they claim is a pattern of abuse of power by the F.B.I. Mr. Comey reluctantly agreed to testify behind closed doors before two House committees \u2014 Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform \u2014 after they agreed to release a public transcript of his testimony.Emerging after six hours of questioning, Mr. Comey defended the F.B.I.\u2019s actions in the Russia case, and accused Republicans of a misguided preoccupation with the bureau\u2019s handling its 2016 inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.Mark Mazzetti, Nicholas Fandos and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting Rent-to-Own Racism This Christmas", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor low-income shoppers, the holiday season can be particularly precarious.Mr. Coleman is a writer who covers race and economics.I am not done with my Christmas shopping. I realize this is not great. Partly, I blame procrastination. I also don\u2019t like crowds.But I also hate the way searching for the perfectly priced present reminds me that for many Americans, especially African-American shoppers, prices are never going to be perfect.I saw this for myself when I walked into a holiday sale at Rent-A-Center in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Oversize flat-screen TVs lined the walls and overstuffed couches filled the floors. The large \u201cNo Credit Needed\u201d sign on the window made me feel as if I might actually be able to afford something.While walking me through the season specials, a sales representative pointed out an advertisement selling Beats by Dre headphones for $20 a week. It sounded reasonable enough until I read the fine print that explained after a 61-week payment plan the headphones would cost $1,219.39.You can buy the headphones outright for $349.95 or less. So that\u2019s not just an exorbitant markup. In some states it could be illegal.I have not been tempted to finance an Xbox this way, even though I grew up in black neighborhoods south and east of Atlanta \u2014 areas with no shortage of rent-to-own stores. I was lucky, though, to hear this simple advice from my dad from an early age: Spend cash, not credit.This is what he taught on our Saturday-morning shopping trips. Whether we were on the way to buy a new refrigerator or look at a used car, the lesson was the same: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough to buy it cash, don\u2019t buy it,\u201d he\u2019d tell us.Mom\u2019s lessons were equally sober. She had a few credit cards but hated them all. Whenever she finally paid one off, she\u2019d call us into her room. There, she asked us to help her demolish the card. We twisted it. We bent it. We folded it until the blue and red plastic turned white along the creases. Then, finally, we\u2019d snip it to pieces. It was a ceremony of sorts. The itinerary concluded in a lecture about the evils of interest and how we were now free from the shackles of another company. By the time I reached the age of 18, my approach to finance was \u201cJust say no.\u201d\u201cNo, I do not want to sign up for a store credit card.\u201d\u201cNo, I do not want to finance a computer over several payments.\u201dNo. No. No.I had internalized the distrust my parents taught me, but it wasn\u2019t until I went to college that I began to better understand where they were coming from.It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Black neighborhoods can support legitimate stores.In the void, many urban black neighborhoods are left with few alternatives. Online shopping is a good option for some people. But a lack of reliable internet access and the necessity of having a credit or debit card prevent many low-income people from participating in this digital economy. Not everyone lives in a neighborhood where packages and presents can sit safely on a stoop while they are at work.My dad\u2019s advice was simple \u2014 spend cash, not credit. But that advice is not easy to follow when the gift-giving season is here and every store in your neighborhood is promising a way to be Santa for just $20 a week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Just Raised Interest Rates. Here\u2019s What That Means for Your Wallet.", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe interest rate increase has consequences for savers and spenders alike. Whether you\u2019ve got a savings account or a credit card (or both), here\u2019s what you need to know.Here\u2019s a refresher on what it all means for your wallet.When the Fed raises rates, some banks may pay more interest on savings accounts, particularly when they want to lure consumers to park their money. But the big banks haven\u2019t been too generous lately, and you shouldn\u2019t expect much to change with the latest increase. Today, the average savings and money market deposit accounts pay a paltry 0.22 percent, according to BankRate.com. That\u2019s up from 0.10 percent in 2015, when the Fed starting raising rates. You also shouldn\u2019t rush to tie up your money in certificates of deposit, which tend to move in step with similarly dated Treasury securities. Two-year C.D.s are paying just more than 1 percent on average, but you can find some paying 3 percent if you take the time to comparison-shop, according to BankRate.com.Bond investors often get nervous when interest rates rise because bond prices tend to fall in response. Why? When rates increase, the price of existing (and lower-yielding) bonds drop because investors can buy new bonds that offer higher interest rates. But higher rates also mean that bonds will generate more interest income, which is good for investors over the long run.But fear not, that\u2019s not the full picture: A fund like that also pays investors interest, and will soon be adding new bonds paying a higher rate. That offsets some of the decline in value.Many people think mortgage rates are tied to the Fed\u2019s short-term rate, but there is no direct link. Most 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are priced off the 10-year Treasury bond, which is influenced by a variety of factors, including the outlook for inflation and long-term economic growth here and abroad.But some home loans are more directly connected to the Fed\u2019s action, including home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.s. A typical home-equity borrower has already seen rates rise to about 6.5 percent, according to BankRate.com, from roughly 4.5 percent three years ago. And now rates will probably move a quarter-point higher.The good news related to adjustable-rate mortgages \u2014 which typically have a fixed rate for a certain number of years, and then adjust each year thereafter \u2014 is that few people have them, Mr. Gumbinger said. But borrowers who are already out of their fixed-rate period and are set for an annual reset in December can expect to pay more. They will most likely see a rise to about 5.36 percent for 2019, up from a rate of 4.3 percent over the past year.For the sake of comparison, rates on 30-year fixed mortgages are now about 4.75 percent. That\u2019s still favorable from a historical standpoint, and those loans are usually the most practical for most buyers. Credit-card holders with variable rates \u2014 averaging around 17.6 percent, up from about 15.7 percent at the end of 2015, according to BankRate.com \u2014 can expect their rates to rise another quarter-point within one or two monthly cycles.While the rate hikes\u2019 cumulative effect is beginning to squeeze car buyers, the latest increase probably won\u2019t change your decision to finance a car. It would only your raise monthly payments by a few dollars a month on a $25,000 loan that will be repaid in five years.Those paying off federal student loans don\u2019t have to worry, because they carry a fixed rate. The next round of new loans will have their rate set in July, based on the 10-year Treasury bond. But private student loans generally base their fixed and variable rates on the Libor index, which tends to track the Fed funds rate pretty closely. So students in that market can expect to see a more immediate increase.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018A Simple Private Transaction\u2019: Trump Lays Out a Defense in a Campaign-Finance Case", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump \u201clooks pretty guilty from what we see so far, but whether he would actually face any liability is a huge question,\u201d Mr. Hasen said.Though it is rare to charge a politician with campaign-finance crimes over hush-money payments to mistresses, one clear precedent stands out: the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution in 2012 of John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator and 2004 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, over similar payments to hide a pregnant mistress while he was running for president in 2008.A potential indictment of Mr. Trump for conspiring in the illegal campaign transactions to which Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty would look a lot like the charges prosecutors brought against Mr. Edwards. In both instances, law-enforcement officials have alleged elaborate and deceptive schemes to influence \u201can election from the shadows,\u201d as prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum on Friday seeking a relatively harsh sentence for Mr. Cohen on several crimes.Mr. Trump directed Mr. Cohen to arrange payments for Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, and Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress, to buy their silence about alleged affairs with him \u201cwith the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election,\u201d prosecutors wrote.The potential crimes include unlawful contributions in excess of the $2,700 individual limit \u2014 a personal loan counts as a contribution, even if it is repaid. They also include failure to report the transactions and unlawful corporate contributions; the Trump Organization eventually repaid Mr. Cohen for the payment to Ms. Daniels, and a tabloid publisher allied with Mr. Trump bought Ms. McDougal\u2019s story and killed it after Mr. Cohen promised repayment, according to prosecutors.But the meaning of the Edwards precedent for Mr. Trump\u2019s fate is complicated, legal experts said. Because that case ended with a mistrial on five charges and an acquittal on one, it shows the risk of charging a politician with campaign-finance crimes over hush-money payments to mistresses, in which it is unclear whether the transactions were about trying to win an election or trying to protect the candidate\u2019s personal life.Indeed, after prosecutors made their filing in the Cohen case, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, pointed to the jury\u2019s failure to convict Mr. Edwards in support of the notion that Mr. Trump does not face realistic legal jeopardy over the payments.\u201cAs a prosecutor, you look at the jury results and that helps inform you, tactically, when you go forward again about trial strategies and likelihood of success and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in terms of precedential value, what it shows is that the Department of Justice believes that this is a legally cognizable theory of prosecution, and a judge has agreed.\u201dThe question, then, is whether prosecutors have more convincing factual evidence to present to a jury about Mr. Trump than they did in the case of Mr. Edwards. Legal experts pointed to several major differences.For one thing, one of the payments to Mr. Edwards\u2019s mistress took place as he was ending his candidacy, which further muddied how to interpret his motivation. By contrast, the payments to Ms. McDougal and Ms. Daniels came just ahead of the election.By contrast, a key figure in both of the Trump transactions, Mr. Cohen, is available as a witness and has already admitted his principal purpose in helping pay off the women was to \u201csuppress the stories and thereby prevent them from influencing the election,\u201d as the sentencing memo said.Still, prosecutors themselves have accused Mr. Cohen of \u201ca pattern of deception that permeated his professional life,\u201d and Mr. Trump\u2019s defense lawyers would certainly attack his credibility. Mr. Trump foreshadowed that strategy on Monday. \u201cCohen just trying to get his sentence reduced,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cWITCH HUNT!\u201dCiting the Edwards mistrial, Mr. Hasen said that federal prosecutors would be reluctant to go forward with a similar case against Mr. Trump unless they had credible corroborating evidence, especially in documentary form, to back up accusations that Mr. Trump was thinking about his campaign, not his personal life, when he instructed Mr. Cohen to arrange the payments.\u201cWe don\u2019t know everything the prosecutors have, and it really depends on that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this is the sum total.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump\u2019s political future, the new revelations did little to shift the calculus on Capitol Hill.\u201cThese guys were all new to this at the time,\u201d Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said of the Trump campaign team. \u201cMost of us have made mistakes when it comes to campaign finance issues. In many cases, campaigns end up paying fines and penalties.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, similarly dismissed questions about the matter by saying prosecutors were relying on a \u201cliar.\u201dSome Republicans privately held out the possibility that the forecast could worsen but said they did not view the new information about possible violations of campaign finance laws as likely to make much of a political impact on Mr. Trump, at least in the short term.Still, prosecutors could also wait and charge Mr. Trump with conspiracy after he leaves the presidency. If he were to lose re-election in 2020, the statute of limitations will not have expired by January 2021 when he would leave office.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Thwarts U.S. Effort to Promote American Culture on Campuses", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The American ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, wanted to make what in most nations would have been a routine trip.One of his favorite schools, Iowa State University, had opened a center to promote American culture in an inland Chinese province, and the laid-back former governor of Iowa was eager to take questions from Chinese students.But Henan Normal University, a campus set on the Yellow River with a prominent statue of Mao Zedong out front, denied Mr. Branstad permission to visit the center this fall \u2014 and offered no explanation.The rebuff underscored how the United States and China compete not only in trade and technology, but also over the values and beliefs that define their societies, an echo of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.In China, such programs provided a window into American culture outside the filter of the Communist Party, and their unwinding could deepen the divide between the societies of the world\u2019s two largest economies.The center that turned down Branstad was one of more than 20 that the State Department opened in the past decade on college campuses across China to promote American culture and counter anti-American propaganda by offering English lessons, screening movies and hosting visiting music and dance performances.Today, the American centers have closed after the Chinese authorities denied American officials entry to them and state security agents interrogated an American academic working on a Chinese campus.\u201cIt became clear after a while that the centers were no longer an asset to the Americans and became a terrible liability,\u201d said Jennifer Tarlin of the University of North Dakota, who served as director of an American center at a Shanghai university from 2011 until this summer.The program\u2019s start coincided with a rise in nationalist sentiment in China. Shortly after he came into power six years ago, President Xi Jinping rolled out a campaign against Western values, investing Communist Party members in academia with the power to redline even the most innocuous and apolitical expressions of American culture.And funding American culture in China became particularly unpopular in Washington as the Trump administration worked to distance the countries and anger built over Beijing\u2019s propaganda in America.China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.When the American centers opened a decade ago, they bucked a trend. Promoting American culture abroad, once a high point of American foreign policy, was considered obsolete, an idea that was dispensed with at the end of the Cold War.But China was a special case. The American government was concerned about negative depictions of the United States in China\u2019s tightly controlled state media.In 2011, only five roughly equivalent American places existed in China \u2014 at American embassies or consulates, sites that are closely watched by Chinese security and forbidding for local residents to enter.The Obama administration felt compelled to act.By 2012, the State Department had made individual grants of $100,000 to more than two dozen American universities to open centers on Chinese campuses. To distance itself, it urged the centers to seek extra funds from private American sources and stayed away from decisions about programming.William Brustein, then-vice provost for international affairs at Ohio State University, recalled meeting the American ambassador, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., in Beijing in 2011.The ambassador told Mr. Brustein about the State Department\u2019s new venture.\u201c\u2018They\u2019re like the Confucius Institutes \u2014 this is America\u2019s answer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brustein recounted the ambassador saying. \u201c\u2018You should open a center \u2014 try to pick a place that is not Beijing or Shanghai.\u2019\u201dOhio State prided itself on its already large number of fee-paying Chinese students, and the university thought the center would attract more. Many students came from Hubei Province, so it was easy for Mr. Brustein to persuade Wuhan University, a major university there, to agree to host a place that would showcase American themes.The center opened in 2012 in a loft-like space with a kitchen and English-language cookbooks, and was led by an English teacher at Ohio State, Bob Eckhart, who brought jazz groups and dance ensembles over for performances.The most successful gig was a group of African-American step dancers, Mr. Eckhart said. \u201cWe stressed that we were presenting authentic American culture and that we were not just cheerleaders for America.\u201dOther centers opened at campuses across China.Often the programming was quirky. At the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Ms. Tarlin invited American musicians who played Depression-era folk. She staged a workshop production of the opera \u201cScarlet Letter\u201d with a libretto by the feminist writer Carol Gilligan.Strict edicts announced by the education minister, Yuan Guiren, in early 2015 signaled the official disfavor. Books highlighting Western values had no place in the classroom; Chinese universities must ensure that Mr. Xi\u2019s ideology was front and center, Mr. Yuan said.Suddenly, university officials barred American cultural groups and speakers. The Chinese homed in on the ties with the State Department, suspicious that the United States was using the centers as a cover for spreading democratic ideas, former and current diplomats said.In Nanjing, Chinese state security officials summoned a dean of the New York Institute of Technology, Monique Taylor, for questioning for several hours in 2015.Ms. Taylor was responsible for the American center sponsored by the institute at the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; she was also in charge of a separate academic program with faculty from New York City on the Nanjing campus.The interrogation rattled the American university, according to three people familiar with the episode. A spokeswoman for the university declined to comment.After the episode, the university declined a new State Department grant and deleted the word American from the center\u2019s name. It was renamed Campus Commons.In the 2000s, as the Confucius Institutes flourished in the United States, those who wanted to promote American soft power eventually prevailed with the opening of the centers in China. But American diplomats responsible for culture could never get the centers to take off: In Washington, the economic relationship was considered far more important, former diplomats said.As secretary of state, John Kerry took up the cause of the centers with Liu Yandong, who was a vice premier until this year and China\u2019s top culture czar.The Chinese dismissed Mr. Kerry\u2019s complaints, said Richard Stengel, who was under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs at the time.\u201cIn my experience, the Chinese project, rationalize and then minimize,\u201d Mr. Stengel said, explaining that senior Chinese officials denied any problems. \u201cThey first say, \u2018You do it, too.\u2019 Then they say: \u2018It\u2019s not my responsibility, it happens on the local level.\u2019 And finally: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter much anyway.\u2019\u201dIn all, the State Department spent $5.1 million on 29 centers, though about 10 of them never opened. The inspector general\u2019s report concluded that the effort had been \u201clargely ineffective.\u201dThe State Department said it had stopped funding all of the centers.Mr. Branstad was not the first American envoy to run into trouble over one of them.Mr. Kerry complained to the Chinese ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, that the American ambassador at the time, Max Baucus, had also been prevented from traveling to one.According to Mr. Stengel, who was in the conversation, Mr. Kerry turned to Mr. Cui and asked: \u201cHave we ever limited where you can go?\u201dMr. Cui replied: \u201cNot yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Other Democrats Shift Into High Gear for 2020", "Date": "2018-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Kamala Harris of California is eyeing Baltimore or Atlanta as a possible base of operations for her likely 2020 presidential bid and is close to bringing on a top aide to run her campaign.Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, has completed a detailed review of her writings and political record to identify potential vulnerabilities, and her aides have been scouting headquarters near Boston.Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has been interviewing possible campaign managers, as well as strategists who could run his Iowa caucus effort.And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has been reaching out to more women than men for campaign roles, though she is expected to pick a man \u2014 her current top aide \u2014 to manage a campaign likely to be based near her upstate New York home.These four high-profile Democratic senators are poised to enter the 2020 presidential race in the next several weeks, advisers and people briefed by their associates say, after spending December finalizing the outlines of their political operations, selecting top campaign staff and conducting research into their own political weak spots. In some cases, they may first announce the creation of presidential exploratory committees to ramp up their fund-raising and hiring efforts, before launching their candidacies more formally in the following weeks.The speed of the senators\u2019 efforts reflects intense political pressure to establish themselves as leading candidates in a Democratic field that could get crowded, fast. All four are likely to spend considerable time and money in 2019 competing with one another to answer the strong yearning from Democrats for new leadership, and they don\u2019t want to lose a step to a rival fresh face, such as Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas Senate candidate who has been the focus of intense speculation in recent weeks as a potential presidential candidate.\u201cBetween the first of January and the middle of February, it would not surprise me for us to see six to eight people say, \u2018I\u2019m jumping in,\u2019\u201d said Jaime Harrison, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman who now serves as associate chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He said he has heard in recent weeks from an assortment of likely candidates, including several senators and mayors.For the Senate foursome, moving quickly into the race is also a pre-emptive effort to undercut the early advantages of a duo of universally known contenders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who may enter the race in the coming months. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders would start off with important advantages, including existing networks of support among early-state activists and party donors, and the stature to generate impressive displays of support at early rallies.But as white men, Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Rourke do not reflect the gender and racial diversity of many Democratic candidates and swaths of the electorate that dominated the 2018 midterms. Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren, Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Booker, by contrast, would instantly make the 2020 Democratic field the most diverse array of presidential candidates in history. And they might well scramble the early polling leads held by Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, who benefit from strong name recognition but would be in their late 70s by Election Day 2020, at a moment when some in the party are agitating for generational change.The four senators hope that jumping into the race early will give them some organizational advantages in a contest that will almost certainly grow to more than a dozen candidates.This kind of early frenetic activity \u2014 almost two years before the election \u2014 has happened before in primaries without a clear front-runner. At this time four years ago, many Republicans began preparing campaigns, wooing supporters and tacitly permitting fund-raising by allies in the wide-open race for the 2016 nomination, a contest that would ultimately attract more than a dozen candidates within months.Already, at least two of the senators have nearly settled on close political lieutenants to serve as campaign managers, turning to male aides with whom they have deep and trusting personal relationships. Ms. Gillibrand is eyeing Jess Fassler, her current top aide, who is leaving his role in the Senate early in 2019, as a leading contender to manage her campaign. Ms. Harris is expected to name Juan Rodriguez, who helmed her campaign for the Senate in 2016, as her manager.In a further sign of how developed her plans are, Ms. Harris\u2019s aides are close to selecting Baltimore or Atlanta for her headquarters, according to people who have met with her team. She is likely to maintain a sizable office on the West Coast, perhaps in her native Oakland, but her political advisers have concluded that for practical reasons it is essential that she have a base in the Eastern Time zone.Ms. Warren is expected to install Dan Geldon, her former chief of staff who was once her student at Harvard Law School and left her Senate office to plan her likely campaign, in a senior role directing campaign strategy. She has a head start on staffing: During the midterm campaign, Ms. Warren deployed staff to the four early primary states and a number of general election battlegrounds to elect other Democrats. Many of those organizers stayed involved after her re-election, leaving her with a staff of several dozen total.To keep those staffers employed into 2019, Ms. Warren needs to raise campaign dollars \u2014 a situation that places pressure on her to quickly jump into the race.Like Ms. Warren, Ms. Harris has completed a substantial research project into her own political vulnerabilities, people in touch with their advisers said. Ms. Harris\u2019s team has scrutinized her paper trail in public office, including her service as California\u2019s state attorney general and San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, while Ms. Warren has conducted an exhaustive review including her academic writings and Senate votes.Mr. Booker and his chief of staff, Matt Klapper, have interviewed a number of potential campaign managers in recent months, according to people who have spoken with his team. Addisu Demissie, who managed Mr. Booker\u2019s first Senate race and led Gavin Newsom\u2019s campaign for governor of California this year, is most widely mentioned as a presidential campaign manager, and has been advising Mr. Booker on other potential hires.Mr. Booker\u2019s team has also been in touch with Democratic operatives in Iowa for leadership roles there, including Michael Frosolone, the top political strategist for the Democratic caucus in the Iowa House. He\u2019s expected to base his campaign in Newark, where he served as mayor. Steve Phillips, an influential San Francisco-based Democratic donor, says he\u2019s already collected $4 million to fund a new super PAC to boost Mr. Booker\u2019s expected campaign.The number of male operatives under consideration for campaign manager posts has raised concerns among some female Democratic strategists who hoped the diversity of the 2020 field would prompt more hiring of female and minority staffers for senior roles.\u201cYou have to have a diverse leadership team, and that, more than anything, is something that these campaigns have to be paying attention to,\u201d said Anne Caprara, a Democratic operative who is now working as chief of staff to the incoming governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, after running his campaign. \u201cWhen it comes to women and women of color, so many of them are going to want to see that the candidate is not just hiring women but really paying attention to them when they\u2019re giving advice.\u201dThe focus on staff diversity reflects not only the influence of the #MeToo movement on Democratic politics but the demands of a party that has shifted to the left during the Trump era, as well as a changing primary map. While the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire will still technically host the first nominating contests, an increase in the popularity of early voting means Democrats will begin casting ballots in more diverse states like California and Georgia during those early elections.Mr. O\u2019Rourke, for one, has mentioned to political strategists that he\u2019d like to hire a female campaign manager.Those close to the four senators caution that no decisions on hiring and organizing will be made until the politicians make a final call about jumping into the race. In fact, formally offering a job could trigger campaign finance reporting requirements mandating that they file a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission \u2014 a step no candidate wants to take before they\u2019re ready to announce a bid.Several other Democrats have indicated they will make up their minds early in 2019. Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who recently joined the Democratic Party, has been conducting polling and other research to test his prospects, and has suggested he will decide on the race in January or February. And Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and his team have interviewed at least 80 people for potential campaign roles, settling on a veteran adviser of his own, Bradley Komar, to lead his effort if he enters the race.\u201cThere\u2019s no benefit to being scared of your own shadow. We want to form the best team possible if he decides to run,\u201d Mr. Komar said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the decision making: Can we get the team together?\u201dA number of other influential politicians may be slower to decide on a presidential race, including Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as Mr. O\u2019Rourke. All have been asking for advice about the presidential campaign, and supporters of Mr. Brown and Mr. O\u2019Rourke have formed committees to draft them into the race.Even for these deliberating Democrats, however, there is a sense that the pressure to decide may escalate quickly after the holidays, as other Democrats begin to compete more openly for the hearts of primary voters.Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a co-chairwoman of the Committee to Draft Sherrod Brown, said she believed Mr. Brown would have to decide on a presidential race within the first quarter of 2019 \u2014 and start campaigning in Iowa even sooner.\u201cI think he needs to be in Iowa in January, frankly,\u201d said Ms. Whaley, adding that her group might begin running ads for Mr. Brown in the leadoff primary states. \u201cWe recognize that Sherrod doesn\u2019t have much name recognition in the first four, so we\u2019ll probably be doing some digital work around those.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. to Spin Off Its Digital Business", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeneral Electric is spinning off its software business as part of the campaign by its new chief executive, H. Lawrence Culp Jr., to streamline the struggling industrial company.The move, announced on Thursday, is an effort to create a sustainable business from G.E.\u2019s ambitious and costly foray into the software industry.G.E., analysts say, correctly identified that the digital wave of the internet, sensors, data and software would fundamentally alter how heavy equipment was built, maintained and repaired. But the company\u2019s digital push, they say, was propelled by too much corporate optimism and too little appreciation of the challenges \u2014 a microcosm of G.E. management missteps in recent years.Investors cheered the decision, and G.E.\u2019s battered stock rose more than 7 percent on Thursday.G.E. spent billions and hired an army of engineers for the software business, called GE Digital. Jeffrey R. Immelt, then the chief executive, declared in 2015 that the goal was to become a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.\u201cIts approach to the market was overhyped and way too broad,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS.Instead, the market demand was for software to parse the sensor data streaming off heavy equipment for tasks like predicting when a machine needed maintenance. In short, customers wanted software applications tailored for specific industries.G.E. has long made industrial software that animates its jet engines, power generators, medical-imaging equipment and other machinery. But GE Digital, based in San Ramon, Calif., was developing internet-era cloud software.\u201cG.E. is a 19th- and 20th-century industrial company with no real experience in modern software,\u201d said Thomas M. Siebel, chief executive of C3, a Silicon Valley start-up that competes with GE Digital.Unlike G.E., C3 followed the typical high-tech model for a software company, beginning with small team and steadily improving its product. The company, founded in 2009, has more than $100 million in yearly revenue and is growing at 80 percent annually. C3\u2019s last venture funding round values the company at $1.4 billion, Mr. Siebel said.In the last year, GE Digital has cut its spending and more tightly focused its business on software for specific industries. The spinoff move is a further move in that direction.The step is also a measured vote of confidence in the software business. Some analysts and competitors had expected Mr. Culp to shut the unit down or sell it off. Once GE Digital is spun off early next year, the business will have its own brand, board of directors and equity structure. It will be run independently, while still owned by G.E.But G.E. said it would sell a majority stake in ServiceMax, whose software is used to manage industrial field service workers, to Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm. The financial terms were not disclosed. G.E. bought ServiceMax in 2016 for $915 million.GE Digital, the company said, will begin with yearly revenue of $1.2 billion, much of that software sales to its large base of customers in industries including aviation, electric power and health care.In a statement, Mr. Culp said, \u201cAs an independently operated company, our digital business will be best positioned to advance our strategy to focus on our core verticals to deliver greater value for our customers and generate new value for our shareholders.\u201dThe separate share structure is intended partly to be able to attract tech workers, who often want to be compensated with stock options as well as salary.There has been little appeal in G.E.\u2019s stock, which has shed 60 percent of its value in the past year, amid the industrial company\u2019s surprising cascade of troubles.G.E.\u2019s big power business has been battered, its finance arm has absorbed billions in losses, and government investigators are examining its accounting and financial reporting practices.G.E. is saddled with debt and has cut its dividend twice in the past year. Turning G.E.\u2019s fortunes around is the daunting challenge that Mr. Culp accepted when he became chief executive in September, succeeding John Flannery, whose tenure lasted just 14 months.William Ruh, a former Cisco executive who led GE Digital, is leaving the company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Oil Exports Are Rising. So Is the Trade Deficit.", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States exported more oil and fuel than it imported last week for the first time in 75 years, a significant milestone in the resurgence of domestic energy production that comes as the Trump administration pushes to increase energy exports even further.To President Trump, increased sales of oil and gas are a way to rebalance trade and close the gap between what the United States buys from foreign countries and what it sells. So far, however, that strategy is not working.In theory, the rise of domestic energy production was supposed to help narrow the trade gap. Edward L. Morse, a prominent energy economist at Citigroup, predicted in 2012 that the annual trade deficit would be reduced by 60 percent by 2020. \u201cThe energy sector in the next few decades could drive an extraordinary and timely revitalization and reindustrialization of the U.S. economy, creating jobs and bringing prosperity to millions of Americans,\u201d he wrote.Instead, the size of the trade deficit has continued to grow.The basic explanation is that the United States\u2019 appetite for foreign investment, including the financing of the federal debt, is driving the country\u2019s consumption of imports. The dollars that the United States borrows from foreign countries are the dollars that the United States spends on foreign products.Under Mr. Trump, the combination of tax cuts and spending increases is causing a rapid expansion in the government\u2019s borrowing. \u201cIt is pretty much a recipe for increased trade deficits,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who previously served as the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The rise in the dollar\u2019s value reduces the relative cost of foreign goods and services while increasing the relative cost of domestic goods and services. The effect is to discourage foreign customers from buying American products, while encouraging American customers to buy foreign products.Since spending on foreign oil is falling, it follows that other industries are bearing the brunt.A wide range of companies outside the oil sector have warned that the dollar\u2019s recent strength is likely to reduce profits, including the appliance maker Whirlpool, Carnival Cruise Line and Coca-Cola.Investment growth under Mr. Trump has leaned much more heavily on oil and gas than it did under his two immediate predecessors. Under President George W. Bush, investment in resource extraction accounted for about 8 percent of total investment growth in the United States economy. Under President Barack Obama, the figure was about 10 percent. Under Mr. Trump, it is running at about 30 percent.And the administration is seeking to intensify the trend. Larry Kudlow, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said in a recent interview that the administration is drawing up a new proposal for infrastructure development that revolves around expanded construction of oil and gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas export terminals and other energy projects.\u201cI want a lot of the infrastructure build out to be based on the energy industry,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cOil and gas pipelines. Coal transportation. L.N.G. terminals. Things that the private sector will finance, but will add to our energy dominance.\u201d He cast the effort in both economic and national security terms, predicting that it would be a \u201cgigantic\u201d job creator and that it would allow the United States to \u201cundercut the Russians\u201d in selling natural gas to European allies such as Germany.Mr. Trump, said Mr. Kudlow, was enamored of the plan: \u201cThe president loves this stuff.\u201dThe emphasis on oil- and gas-related investment partly reflect the weakness of investment in other parts of the economy. During Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure, year-over-year capital investment growth has averaged 5.9 percent per quarter. Excluding mining investment, that growth falls to 4.6 percent.As part of the administration\u2019s efforts to expand energy exports and find new markets for its products, the Treasury Department has started reaching nonbinding agreements with Latin American countries, including Chile, Argentine, Panama and Jamaica, to offer technical assistance on energy infrastructure projects.The initiative \u2014 known as \u201cAmerica Crece,\u201d a Spanish phrase meaning \u201cThe Americas Grow\u201d\u2014 is aimed at increasing demand for American energy exports, and to create opportunities for American firms to work on infrastructure projects, said David Malpass, Treasury\u2019s under secretary for international affairs.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter: @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Trump, the Swamp Is Draining", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA grifter president has inspired an elite housecleaning.Opinion ColumnistIt isn\u2019t just that he\u2019s already implicated in actions (for instance, paying off a porn-star mistress in possible violation of campaign-finance laws) that a hostile Congress might reasonably cite as a reason for impeachment. It\u2019s that the whole Trump operation, now lying exposed on Mueller\u2019s table \u2014 the shady business empire, the constant practice of deceit, the dim-bulb hangers-on \u2014 screams corruption in a way that few politicians\u2019 circles do. With Trump there is no pretense of respectability or rectitude. There is only the open, shrugging grift.That hasn\u2019t worked out; it turns out that when you send a businessman-grifter into the world of political grifters he hires some of the worst of them to help him with the fleecing.But there is one odd way in which Trump\u2019s supporters have gotten what they wanted. Trump isn\u2019t draining the swamp himself, but the shock of his ascent has created swamp-draining conditions \u2014 in which other corruptions have suddenly been exposed, and there have been many deserved falls from grace.Some of these scandals might have come out under any president, and Clinton was overdue for a feminist reassessment. But Trump has clearly been a catalyst: The sense of moral crisis created by his ascent, the sense of moral outrage felt by women, especially, and the finger-pointing within a divided, freaked-out establishment has made it easier to acknowledge rot in meritocracy, and to purge the grossest examples from our entitled class.In fact our elite is rotten and deserves judgment, yet Trump\u2019s mix of kleptocracy and kakistocracy is worse. So the question of how you replace a bad elite with a better one, not just with something more corrupt, is what both left and right should be pondering while this particular purgation runs its course.Advertisement"}

This is all Qatari,\u201d a supervisor said, pointing out Qatari-made laundry detergent, dish soap and disinfectant.Producing such products at home may be business as usual for many countries, but for Qatar it was one of many defensive shifts made to survive a political and economic assault by its neighbors.Qatar has beefed up its military, pursued deeper ties with neighbors like Iran, and doubled down on the maverick behavior that rankled its Arab neighbors in the first place, like breathlessly covering their scandals on its Al Jazeera satellite network.Many countries would have collapsed under the type of restrictions imposed on Qatar by its larger and more powerful neighbors, who accused it of financing terrorism, interfering in their domestic affairs and growing too close to Iran. They were especially incensed by Qatar\u2019s support for a range of activists across the Arab world, including the political Islamists that other Gulf monarchs consider a threat to their rule.Qatar\u2019s leaders deny the allegations of interference and financing terrorism, and say what really angered their neighbors was the country\u2019s independence, its refusal to march in lock step with the Saudi and Emirati leaders who have long called the shots in the region.The country\u2019s vast wealth cushioned the blow of the blockade. Qatar dipped deeply into its $340 billion reserve funds to establish new trading partners, build up domestic industries and, in some cases, create new ones from scratch.\u201cIt seems that the Qataris, the people as well as the government, have closed the door a bit on trying to get back into the G.C.C. at all costs,\u201d said Andreas Krieg, an assistant professor of security studies at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThey want to get this resolved, but the threshold for finding a solution to the crisis is very low.\u201dQatar would like progress on certain issues, like being able to use its neighbors\u2019 airspace and some easing of travel restrictions for families separated by the crisis, he said.\u201cNothing else is itching or hurting them anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pain they thought they would feel they don\u2019t feel.\u201dIn a meeting with New York Times editors last month, Foreign Minister Thani said Qatar was no longer spending its reserves to adjust to the new reality.\u201cWe are over the blockade,\u201d he said, adding that, perversely, it had helped Qatar by pushing it to open new markets.Economists, however, say the blockade has sapped Qatar\u2019s economy as the government has marshaled its reserves to airlift in supplies and stabilize banks. Tourism income and real estate prices have fallen, they say, and consumer prices have gone up, cutting into the budgets of the foreign workers who make up 88 percent of the country\u2019s 2.4 million people.The Doha Forum pointed to Qatar\u2019s new direction. The government flew in hundreds of businessmen, researchers, journalists and officials from Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America for the event. Len\u00edn Moreno, the president of Ecuador, gave opening remarks, and Hassan Ali Khaire, the prime minister of Somalia, spoke on a panel. While previous editions of the conference featured speakers from Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, this time Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran was given his own session.Foreign Minister Thani said that the Khashoggi killing lifted the veil on Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cimpulsive\u201d leadership.\u201cThe world is starting to see what Qatar has seen for the last 18 months,\u201d he said.Qatar\u2019s foes have taken aim at Al Jazeera, demanding that Qatar take it off the air for its often critical coverage of Arab leaders and its sympathetic treatment of dissidents and political Islamists. But that demand has been a nonstarter, too.\u201cAl Jazeera continues its business as normal,\u201d Abdulla al-Najjar, an executive at the channel, said in an interview.The channel had been outlawed and blocked on digital platforms in the blockading countries, he said. But it is still widely watched across the Arab world, even in countries where it is banned, by viewers with VPNs.\u201cWe speak truth to power,\u201d Mr. Najjar said. \u201cThis is why most of the Middle Eastern governments don\u2019t like us.\u201dQatar\u2019s biggest concern with the rift is security, which has led to increased investment in the military. Qatar recently extended mandatory military service to one year from three or four months for Qatari men and began allowing voluntary service for Qatari women. It has been buying top-of-the-line fighter jets from the United States, and is expanding Al Udeid, the largest American military base in the Middle East, which Qatar hosts.For many Qataris, the biggest blows have been social and psychological, as they have come to terms with their closest neighbors branding them as enemies and waging a propaganda campaign against them.\u201cThe biggest damage was to the social ties,\u201d said Hizam al-Qahtani, a Qatari law student sitting down to a steak in the glitzy district of Pearl Qatar with three friends. All four had relatives on the other side of the blockade, they said. Some of the relatives had cut off all but basic communication, fearful of being accused of disloyalty by their governments. Others had cut off all contact.Mr. Qahtani said that his uncle, a Saudi citizen, had died recently in Saudi Arabia and that none of his brothers, who are Qataris, were able to attend the funeral.\u201cHe was buried there without his family present,\u201d Mr. Qahtani said.His friends complained that they could no longer easily travel to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for religious visits or to Dubai for fun. One said he had enrolled in a summer program at an Emirati university but lost his tuition payment of more than $4,000 when the blockade began.Even if the crisis ended, the distrust would remain, they said.\u201cEven if it is solved, Qatari citizens won\u2019t forget the betrayal that happened and the fierce media attacks,\u201d said Abdulkarim al-Qahtani, also a law student. \u201cWe cannot forget.\u201dHerbert Buchsbaum contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Asked a Mississippi Senator to Refund Donations. They Are Still Waiting.", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When video surfaced last month of Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi telling a supporter she would be \u201con the front row\u201d if he invited her to a \u201cpublic hanging,\u201d some of the country\u2019s largest corporations found themselves in a public relations nightmare.Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign told at least one company, Walmart, on Thursday that it did not intend to refund its money. What it did not say: The campaign is out of money anyway after a frantic push to the finish line, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the finances.Another company, the drugmaker Amgen, said that it had been able to cancel a $5,000 check before it was cashed by the campaign, but that it was still waiting for another $4,000 in earlier contributions to be returned.A host of other companies, including some of the nation\u2019s largest, said they had not received checks or even a promise of returns. Among them were AT&T, Union Pacific, Aetna and Pfizer. Google and Facebook, which had also requested refunds, did not return requests for comment.But she is not required to return the contributions, and on the campaign trail she never said she would do so. Federal law and campaign finance regulations require only that campaign committees refund prohibited or illegal contributions or checks that exceed the maximum allowable dollar amount.\u201cIn other words, the act and regulations don\u2019t mandate refunds upon request,\u201d said Judith Ingram, a spokeswoman for the Federal Election Commission.Ms. Hyde-Smith declined to discuss the refund requests. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a list,\u201d she said briskly in the Capitol, referring additional questions to her campaign. On Friday, a top campaign official declined to comment on the matter.The senator\u2019s decision not to return the money puts many of the companies in a difficult position. Corporate giving is typically handled by government affairs specialists in Washington and funneled through a company\u2019s political action committee to help smooth relationships with lawmakers. But the companies have little recourse or even incentive to demand the money at this point. And they will have to decide soon whether to support Ms. Hyde-Smith in her re-election campaign in 2020.Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s \u201cpublic hanging\u201d comments, which surfaced in November in the run-up to a special election to fill the seat of Senator Thad Cochran, helped infuse the contest with questions about race and racism.Her problems worsened with the release of a second video that appeared to show her joking about voter suppression, but which her campaign said was selectively edited.Walmart, the country\u2019s largest retailer, said that \u201cSen. Hyde-Smith\u2019s recent comments clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates\u201d and asked for its $4,000 contribution back.Union Pacific, one of the country\u2019s largest rail systems, wrote on Twitter that it \u201cin no way, shape or form condones or supports divisive or perceived to be divisive statements.\u201dAnd a spokeswoman for Boston Scientific, a medical device maker, which last month issued a tweet announcing that \u201cwe reject the Senator\u2019s statements, which are not aligned with our company\u2019s core values,\u201d said Thursday that the company had followed up several times with the campaign about its donation, without luck.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ryan Zinke, Face of Trump Environmental Rollbacks, Is Leaving Interior Department", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a key figure in President Trump\u2019s sweeping plan to reshape the nation\u2019s environmental framework, resigned under pressure on Saturday as he faces numerous ethics investigations into his business dealings, travel and policy decisions.Mr. Zinke is the latest Trump official to exit an administration plagued by questions of ethical conflict. And his departure comes as Mr. Trump has begun a shake-up in his administration. In early November, the president fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and last weekend he announced that his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was leaving.In one of the final acts of Mr. Kelly\u2019s tenure, his team told Mr. Zinke that he should leave by year\u2019s end or risk being fired in a potentially humiliating way, two people familiar with the discussion said.Mr. Trump has been looking at replacing a number of other cabinet officials. He has been telling associates for weeks that the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, will be leaving now that the midterm elections are over, and he has also frequently complained about Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, is also seen as likely to depart soon.But Mr. Trump is aware that the confirmation processes for any new nominees are likely to be more contentious in the second half of his term, as he faces re-election.The inquiries include an examination of a real estate deal involving Mr. Zinke\u2019s family and a development group backed by the Halliburton chairman, David J. Lesar. Mr. Zinke stood to benefit from the deal, while Mr. Lesar\u2019s oil services company stood to benefit from Mr. Zinke\u2019s decisions on fossil fuel production.Mr. Zinke has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. \u201cI love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we\u2019ve accomplished together,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cHowever, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations.\u201dMr. Trump had tolerated the seemingly endless drips of scandal surrounding Mr. Zinke in part because he liked him personally and in part because his focus on the cabinet was concentrated on his desire to oust Mr. Sessions.At the same time, though, Mr. Trump disliked the bad press that was amassing for Mr. Zinke, given how it reflected on him personally. And as the incoming House Democratic majority made clear that Mr. Zinke would be a prime target, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides convinced him that the time had come to shove out Mr. Zinke.A few months ago, the White House Counsel\u2019s Office indicated to some West Wing aides that officials would be less likely to be subpoenaed by the new House majority if they left before the new Congress was sworn in in January. That has helped speed up the departures of several.\u201cThis is no kind of victory, but I\u2019m hopeful that it is a genuine turning of the page,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, who as the incoming chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee has repeatedly tangled with Mr. Zinke. He added, \u201cThe next interior secretary should respect the American people\u2019s desire for strong environmental standards and an end to corporate favoritism.\u201dDelaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said Mr. Zinke\u2019s actions had sometimes been overshadowed by Mr. Pruitt\u2019s more obvious fumbles. That let the secretary operate in an \u201cethical Wild West,\u201d she said.\u201cThere are these laws and these ethical norms that are being blown to bits by these cabinet secretaries,\u201d Ms. Marsco said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the pattern, the problem, that keeps us up at night.\u201dSince President Trump\u2019s inauguration, White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations, one after the other.Mr. Zinke\u2019s resignation, rather than an end to his pro-fossil fuel policies, quite likely signals a passing of the playbook. Mr. Zinke\u2019s deputy, David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist, is expected to step in as acting head of the department.Mr. Zinke, 57, grew up in Whitefish, Mont., a timber and tourism town at the edge of Glacier National Park. When he took charge of the Interior Department, he promised that his youth in the West would help him balance conservation and extraction on the land in his care. Much of that land is in the West, and it includes the national parks and monuments that have become the nation\u2019s environmental icons.With his flashy leadership style and aggressive approach to deregulation, Mr. Zinke had largely escaped the public thrashing that Mr. Trump has directed at other cabinet members. But in recent weeks the president had signaled that the secretary\u2019s tenure might be coming to end, possibly as a result of the ethics inquiries.\u201cI do want to study whatever is being said,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Nov. 7, referring to the investigations into Mr. Zinke. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing an excellent job, but we will take a look at that, and we\u2019ll probably have an idea on that in about a week.\u201dMr. Zinke was considered a surprise choice for the position. He had reportedly gained favor with Donald Trump Jr., because, like the president\u2019s son, he is an avid game hunter.He ran the office with a swaggering flair that won him the admiration of the president and conservative Westerners, many of whom applauded his effort to move major department operations to places like Denver or Boise, Idaho. But his style also drew derision from the environmental community and the quiet mockery of many career staff members in his own agency.In Washington, he flew a special interior secretary flag above the Interior building when he was present, and he often skipped a coat and tie for fishing shirts and boots. Beyond the capital, he hiked and rode across landscapes in a cowboy hat, even as he pushed plans to drastically reduce monument boundaries.Because Halliburton is the nation\u2019s largest oil services company, and because Mr. Zinke regulates the oil industry on public land, the deal raised questions as to whether it constituted a conflict of interest. Mr. Zinke\u2019s schedule also showed that he had hosted Mr. Lesar and a developer involved with the hotel-brewery project in his secretarial office in 2017.Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for Mr. Zinke, has said that the secretary did nothing wrong and that he resigned from his charitable foundation\u2019s board of directors before the deal was made.His policies have angered environmentalists, who have filed lawsuits trying to block these plans. Many have argued that Mr. Zinke has turned his back on the nation\u2019s environmental heritage just as dire news about climate change has made land, water and air protection increasingly urgent.The likely replacement by Mr. Bernhardt of his former boss in an acting capacity echoes events that followed the resignation of Mr. Pruitt at the E.P.A. Mr. Pruitt, once a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s for many of the same reasons as Mr. Zinke, was replaced in an acting capacity by his deputy, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist with a low profile and a deep knowledge of the agency he ran and the regulations he sought to undo.While Mr. Zinke spent his tenure as the face of many of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts, many on the inside saw Mr. Bernhardt as the effective manager who was able to push policies through. Mr. Bernhardt, with years of experience in the George W. Bush administration, and as a former lawyer and lobbyist for some of the nation\u2019s largest oil companies, brings a deep insider\u2019s knowledge to his job that Mr. Zinke lacked. His former legal clients included the Independent Petroleum Association of America and Halliburton.Since his Senate confirmation last summer, Mr. Bernhardt has generated criticism from environmental and government watchdog groups that his new role will create a conflict of interest, as he oversees proposals that could directly benefit his former clients.Maggie Haberman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.Follow Julie Turkewitz and Coral Davenport on Twitter: @julieturkewitz and @coralmdavenport.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It Doesn\u2019t Matter if Ecuador Can Afford This Dam. China Still Gets Paid.", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "A giant dam was supposed to help lift Ecuador out of poverty. Instead, it\u2019s part of a national scandal, and a future tethered to China.Supported byREVENTADOR, Ecuador \u2014 The dam sits under the glare of an active volcano, with columns of ash spewing toward the sky.Officials had warned against the dam for decades. Geologists said an earthquake could wipe it away.Now, only two years after opening, thousands of cracks are splintering the dam\u2019s machinery. Its reservoir is clogged with silt, sand and trees. And the only time engineers tried to throttle up the facility completely, it shook violently and shorted out the national electricity grid.This giant dam in the jungle, financed and built by China, was supposed to christen Ecuador\u2019s vast ambitions, solve its energy needs and help lift the small South American country out of poverty.Instead, it has become part of a national scandal engulfing the country in corruption, perilous amounts of debt \u2014 and a future tethered to China.Nearly every top Ecuadorean official involved in the dam\u2019s construction is either imprisoned or sentenced on bribery charges. That includes a former vice president, a former electricity minister and even the former anti-corruption official monitoring the project, who was caught on tape talking about Chinese bribes.It doesn\u2019t matter whether Ecuador can afford them.China gets paid either way.To settle the bill, China gets to keep 80 percent of Ecuador\u2019s most valuable export \u2014 oil \u2014 because many of the contracts are repaid in petroleum, not dollars. In fact, China gets the oil at a discount, then sells it for an additional profit.Pumping enough oil to repay China has become such an imperative for Ecuador that it is drilling deeper in the Amazon, threatening more deforestation.But that is not enough. Hobbled by the debts, President Len\u00edn Moreno has slashed social spending, gasoline subsidies, several government agencies and more than 1,000 public jobs. Most economists expect the country to slide into recession, stirring outrage.\u201cChina took advantage of Ecuador,\u201d said Ecuador\u2019s energy minister, Carlos P\u00e9rez. \u201cThe strategy of China is clear. They take economic control of countries.\u201dThe story of how the dam got built brings together two natural allies, both eager to change the course of the hemisphere and displace the United States as the unrivaled power in the region.Still, as the giant dam in Ecuador shows, the two sides were hardly equal partners.Both nations were willing to overlook deep design flaws, questionable economics and independent warnings that the technical studies for the dam were decades out of date.The gamble was all Ecuador\u2019s, and now the country is looking for new loans to plug its many gaps, including more money from China.Just this month, Mr. Moreno flew to China to renegotiate some of his country\u2019s debt \u2014 and borrow another $900 million.\u201cThe Chinese put the hook in,\u201d said Steve Hanke, a Johns Hopkins economist. \u201cAt the end of the day, what do these countries have? A pig in a poke.\u201dWhen Fernando Santos, an energy minister in the 1980s, found out that the Coca Codo Sinclair dam was actually being built, he could hardly believe it.During his time in government, officials had rejected a much smaller version of the project. The whole idea was doomed, he said, because of the volcano nearby. A major earthquake had decimated oil infrastructure in the area in 1987.\u201cThe volcano has been erupting since the time the Spanish came to Ecuador in the 16th century,\u201d Mr. Santos said, adding that investing so much money \u201cin such a risky location was nonsense.\u201dThere were other alarm bells.An independent review of the project in 2010, prepared by a Mexican government agency and obtained by The New York Times, warned that the amount of water in the region to power the dam had not been studied for nearly 30 years.Since that time, Ecuador had suffered punishing droughts, and there were concerns that its glaciers were melting because of climate change.Despite the advice, Luciano Cepeda, the dam\u2019s former general manager, said top Ecuadorean officials pressed ahead anyway because \u201ca new study would have taken several years\u201d and they didn\u2019t want to slow down.Even a Chinese diplomat in Ecuador, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said he had his doubts about the project.\u201cWe didn\u2019t give sufficient attention to the environmental reporting,\u201d the diplomat said.China\u2019s record offered both encouragement and cause for concern. Its massive Three Gorges Dam, which cuts the Yangtze River and rises 600 feet high, was the largest hydroelectric project in the world, designed to produce 20 times the power of the Hoover Dam.But inadequate safety measures led to the deaths of 100 workers, the dam displaced more than one million people, and the environmental damage was considerable, including the destruction of forests.Elected in 2006 under a surge that brought leftists to power across Latin America, Mr. Correa took aim at the United States with fiery, anti-imperialist speeches. In 2008, he refused to renew a lease that allowed American anti-narcotics surveillance flights to operate from an Ecuadorean air force base.Soon, Western financial institutions fell in Mr. Correa\u2019s cross hairs. He denounced the International Monetary Fund, saying it put restrictions on his spending. Then in 2008, he defaulted on $3.2 billion of his country\u2019s foreign debt and invited China to fill in the breach.\u201cCorrea wanted to get away from Western banks and institutions,\u201d said Diego Borja, Mr. Correa\u2019s former minister of economic coordination. \u201cWe knew this relationship wouldn\u2019t be an easy one with China.\u201dMr. Borja and other officials were staggered by the terms on Chinese loans. Most came from a large state-owned lender, the Chinese Export-Import Bank, which had high interest rates and required Ecuador to use Chinese companies in construction, effectively eliminating competition.China seemed particularly interested in oil from Ecuador, one of OPEC\u2019s smallest members. In one deal in 2009, China lent Ecuador $1 billion, to be repaid in oil shipments to the state oil company PetroChina.\u201cBut we didn\u2019t have other options,\u201d Mr. Borja recalled. \u201cThe doors were closed to the West.\u201dMr. Correa suddenly had access to money, but a new crisis emerged: The country was running out of power. A drought was depleting the nation\u2019s reservoirs, paralyzing its dams. Rather than look for another source, Mr. Correa doubled down on hydro power.Officials say it was Mr. Correa\u2019s electricity minister, Aleksey Mosquera, who first mentioned Coca Codo Sinclair: a megaproject that was supposed to provide a third of the country\u2019s electricity and represent the single largest investment in Ecuador\u2019s history.It ended up being built right under the Reventador volcano \u2014 and nearly twice the size of the proposed dam that had been rejected decades before.When it finally opened in late 2016, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, flew to Ecuador to celebrate.Yet only two days before the visit, the dam was in chaos.Engineers had tried to generate the project\u2019s full 1500 megawatts, but neither the facility nor Ecuador\u2019s electrical grid could handle it. The equipment shuddered dangerously, and blackouts spread across the country, officials said.Ecuadoreans were never told about the failure, and a full power test has not been attempted since.Today, the dam typically runs at half capacity. Experts say that given its design \u2014 and the cycle of wet and dry seasons in Ecuador \u2014 it would be able to generate the full amount of electricity for only a few hours a day, six months out of the year.That is, if everything worked perfectly.Ecuador still has to pay back the debt, though. The $1.7 billion loan from China\u2019s Export-Import Bank is lucrative for China: 7 percent interest over 15 years. In interest alone, Ecuador owes $125 million a year.Now, many Ecuadoreans say the burden falls on them.Under the constant hum of the dam\u2019s transmission towers, residents in the town of Cuyuja worry that the towers will topple in the constant mudslides. Geologists say the tower foundations weren\u2019t built into bedrock by the Chinese.Another complaint is the bill. Maria Esther Tello paid $60 last month to keep the lights on in her home, a shock given the government\u2019s promises electricity prices would go down.\u201cWhere have my old mother\u2019s taxes gone?\u201d asked her daughter, Isbela Nole, as she helped harvest and peel fava beans to pay the government.At an entrance to the dam is an inscription, in marble.\u201cJorge Glas Espinel, vice president of the republic,\u201d it says. \u201cFor having forged and envisioned this monumental project.\u201dMr. Glas now sits in a cell in Ecuador, sentenced to six years in prison.Now Ecuadorean officials are investigating whether the Chinese also made payments to Mr. Glas and others around him.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that all the same people managed all these projects,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez, the energy minister.The officials include Mr. Mosquera, the former electricity minister, who is serving a five-year sentence for taking $1 million from Odebrecht; and Carlos P\u00f3lit, the former anti-corruption official, who was charged with receiving millions in bribes from the company. Ricardo Rivera, another close associate of Mr. Glas, was also convicted of receiving payments from the Brazilians.But evidence has emerged suggesting that officials took bribes from China as well.Ecuadorean law enforcement officials say they have confirmed a secret tape recorded by an Odebrecht executive, given to Brazilian prosecutors and leaked to the Brazilian news media. In the recording, made at the house of Mr. P\u00f3lit, the anti-corruption official, the two men discuss a bribe.The executive can be heard saying that Mr. Glas, Ecuador\u2019s vice president, was \u201casking for a lot of money.\u201dThe executive then explained that he was told \u201cit was an obligation because the Chinese had already paid.\u201dThe recording has set off an investigation, particularly around Mr. Rivera, who presented himself as the vice president\u2019s representative during multiple visits to China, according to Ecuadorean law enforcement officials.They say they are examining 13 bank transfers worth $17.4 million authorized by Mr. Rivera to an HSBC account in Hong Kong. Law enforcement officials say they consider the bank transfers authentic \u2014 and want to know how Mr. Rivera deposited so much money in China.Until recently, Attorney General Pa\u00fal P\u00e9rez was leading an investigation into corruption by the Chinese, and traveled to China in November to ask for help.But Mr. P\u00e9rez abruptly resigned on Nov. 13, shortly after returning. He did not respond to interview requests.A lawyer for Mr. Glas denied that his client had been involved in corruption with Coca Coda Sinclair, calling Mr. Glas \u201can honorable, honest man\u201d and describing the dam\u2019s problems as \u201csmall imperfections.\u201dMr. Correa, the former president, is in exile in Belgium, wanted for organizing the kidnapping of a rival. Many of his lieutenants have been sentenced for corruption or are on the run as well.Mr. P\u00f3lit and a lawyer for Mr. Rivera did not respond to requests for comment; nor did Sinohydro, the Chinese state-owned construction giant that built the dam.Mr. Polit did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but after publication his lawyer said that his client denied any wrongdoing.When you approach Coca Codo Sinclair along the Quijos River, it\u2019s hard to tell you\u2019re nearing a dam at all.Much of the reservoir containing the project\u2019s water supply has filled up with small trees and bushes. Boats sometimes get grounded because the sediment is so thick.Workers at the dam say the silting, a consequence of design flaws, is only the latest problem.As early as 2014, technicians noticed cracks in the Chinese-made stainless steel equipment. That December, 13 workers were killed when a tunnel flooded and collapsed.A senior engineer sent records to Mr. Correa, the president, asking to brief him on the problems, according to documents viewed by The Times. The engineer was fired days later, according to former officials.Mr. P\u00f3lit, the anti-corruption official, performed audits. But they resulted in only mild criticism like work delays, with minor fines against the Chinese.Ecuadorean law enforcement officials say they are investigating whether Mr. P\u00f3lit and other officials were paid by the Chinese to overlook the problems. It was part of Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s inquiry before his resignation, they say.Now, 7,648 cracks have developed in the dam\u2019s machinery, according to the government, because of substandard steel and inadequate welding by Sinohydro. Sand and silt are also big concerns because they can damage vital equipment.On a recent visit, an engineer looked on nervously as readouts showed sand flowing into the dam. But workers say they\u2019re sometimes confused because of shoddy translations.One sign in Chinese reads correctly: \u201cDirect-Current (DC) Pumping Group.\u201dThe Spanish does not: \u201cPressure Group from Washington, D.C.\u201dThe communication problems extend downriver.The heavy sedimentation means engineers sporadically release large amounts of water to clear out the system, causing flash floods where Carlos Usam\u00e1, a sugar cane farmer, lives. No one warns him, he says.In December, he said, his brother and a friend were fishing near another Chinese-built dam when a similar flood washed them away.The bodies were found two days later, he said.The piles of debt have led the country\u2019s new leaders to rail against China much as they did against the United States.\u201cWe are not going to pay,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez, the energy minister, said of the possible billion-dollar price tag to fix Coca Codo Sinclair.But escaping China\u2019s orbit will be difficult, said Risa Grais-Targow, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting company.\u201cThey know they don\u2019t have too many financing sources, so they are going back to knocking on China\u2019s door,\u201d she said.China has already made some concessions to Ecuador, like paying 92 cents more per barrel of oil. The share of Ecuador\u2019s oil going to the Chinese has also dropped \u2014 to 80 percent, from 90 percent.But the government still needs $11.7 billion to finance its debt, and it is billions short, analysts say.Beyond China, the new government is going back to the institutions Mr. Correa demonized: the World Bank and the I.M.F. Some worry that Ecuador is simply seeking another set of financial masters.\u201cWe are addicted to loans,\u201d said Mr. Santos, the former energy minister.Leopoldo G\u00f3mez, who works at a water treatment facility built under Mr. Correa, agrees.\u201cNow we realize,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s things we didn\u2019t need \u2014 like the dam.\u201dNicholas Casey reported from Reventador, and Clifford Krauss from Quito, Ecuador.

{"Headline": "In Paris, \u2018Yellow Vest\u2019 Protests Cut Sharply Into City\u2019s Luxury Trade", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral weekends of violent demonstrations across France have hit the capital\u2019s sellers of high-end goods hard during the year\u2019s most important shopping periodTourists and local residents alike, many of them wearing fur or cashmere and laden with bags, hurry into glittering temples of French heritage like Chanel and Dior, Longchamp and Ladur\u00e9e to stock up on holiday gifts. The luxury-goods industry, one of France\u2019s top export categories and a major driver of tourism in Paris, has been hit hard during its most important month of the year. A police lockdown and fears of widespread vandalism prompted executives at several high-profile companies to close their Paris stores, and their mouths, after some protesters seized on French fashion logos as symbols of inequality and elitism. Some chief executives, however, did stick their heads above the parapet.\u201cThis time of year is the most important selling period for Lanvin, with December counting for at least two regular months of full-price sales,\u201d Mr. Hecquet said. \u201cOne could say that our online business could cover our losses, but when it comes to shopping for luxury ready-to-wear, physical stores remain very important.\u201d Dior, Burberry and Kering all declined to comment on how the protests were affecting sales. Chanel confirmed only that its stores had been closed as a safety precaution, although Karl Lagerfeld, the creative director, noted in an interview with New York magazine last week: \u201cI like the moment we are living through, but not the \u2018yellow raincoats\u2019 in the street.\u201dSome people in the industry expressed concerns that luxury brands could become targets in a workers\u2019 revolt against the increasingly unpopular Mr. Macron.Fears are growing that Paris could enter a sharp downturn similar to the one that followed the terrorist attacks of 2015.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to shop at Louis Vuitton on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es when cars are burning on the street,\u201d said Mario Ortelli, managing partner of the luxury advisers Ortelli & Company. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to walk around with an Herm\u00e8s bag when there\u2019s a violent protest happening.\u201dMarc-Andre Kamel, the head of Bain\u2019s retail practice for Europe, Africa and the Middle East, said that while sales elsewhere might help luxury brands with global footprints offset the losses in Paris, department stores like Galeries Lafayette and Printemps were more likely to experience a blunt impact from the protests, since regional stores outside Paris are affected by disruption in other cities.\u201cIt is a grim situation for those retailers,\u201d Mr. Kamel said. \u201cJust how bad will be seen when sales figures are released early next year.\u201dUntil the protests began, Mr. Kamel said, \u201cit had been a relatively decent year\u201d for luxury spending. \u201cFor France as a brand, for luxury players, who are a major reason many people travel here, these are nerve-racking times,\u201d he added.Yet, there a quiet sense of defiance was in evidence on some street corners. Around the Place Vend\u00f4me, a hub of luxury jewelry shops and designer stores, rioters had smashed windows and built barricades on recent weekends. Many of the shops had boarded their windows up entirely, blocking everything inside from view. Other stores, like Louis Vuitton, created giant, clear barriers instead, allowing a showcase for sparkling Christmas trees framed by expensive shoes, handbags and accessories, a reminder that those dream purchases were still available, if out of reach for many.Jean Cassegrain, the chief executive of Longchamp, said some of his Paris stores were closed and security had been added at others. But he emphasized that luxury brands were not the primary object of the protesters\u2019 ire.\u201cThe protests did not target luxury stores specifically: bus stops, cafes, construction sites, cars were also damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a moment in the life of the city. Paris remains a great and enjoyable city for residents and for tourists.\u201dNevertheless, for an industry that builds itself on trading in branded aspiration and fantasy, the recent upheaval in luxury\u2019s capital city has undeniably tarnished that image. Just how badly will only become clear in the coming weeks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Cohen, Ex-Trump Lawyer, Asks U.S. Judge for Leniency", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer who has twice pleaded guilty to crimes that have implicated Mr. Trump in illegal or questionable conduct, asked a federal judge late Friday night that he be allowed to avoid prison when he is sentenced in less than two weeks.In a deeply personal memorandum that expressed Mr. Cohen\u2019s contrition and shame, defense lawyers portrayed him as a man whose personal and professional lives had been shattered, and who had harmed himself legally while trying to protect Mr. Trump.Arguing against a prison sentence, the lawyers cited Mr. Cohen\u2019s cooperation with the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose legitimacy is regularly denounced by the president.\u201cIn the context of this raw, full-bore attack by the most powerful person in the United States,\u201d the lawyers wrote, \u201cMichael, formerly a confidant and adviser to Mr. Trump, resolved to cooperate, and voluntarily took the first steps toward doing so even before he was charged.\u201dThe lawyers noted that Mr. Cohen could have fought the government, \u201cpositioning himself perhaps for a pardon or clemency,\u201d but instead took personal responsibility for his wrongdoing \u201cand is prepared to continue to contribute to an investigation that he views as thoroughly legitimate and vital.\u201dThe lawyers, Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester, submitted the memo one day after Mr. Cohen entered a surprise guilty plea in federal court in Manhattan to a charge of lying to Congress in a case filed by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential ties to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and financial crimes in a case brought by the United States attorney in Manhattan.Mr. Cohen, 52, is to be sentenced by Judge William H. Pauley III on Dec. 12 on the charges in both cases. The government is also expected to file a sentencing memo.The Cohen memo offered no new revelations about alleged misconduct involving the president, but it shed new light on Mr. Cohen\u2019s role in the various investigations being conducted into Mr. Trump and his inner circle, and on his frequent contact with the president\u2019s legal counsel and advisers as he prepared for congressional testimony that he later admitted was false.The document provided a detailed, on-the-record glimpse of what took place between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump in relation to arranging payments to two women who said during the 2016 campaign that they had previously had affairs with the candidate.The memo mentions that \u201cClient-1,\u201d as Mr. Trump is described throughout, did not reimburse the corporation that owns the tabloid for the payments to her, as he had agreed to.The document depicts Mr. Cohen as an unsophisticated and flawed man who was trying to please an exacting, demanding and powerful boss: Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers wrote that he realized his guilt in lying to Congress about the duration of his involvement with a Trump Tower project he was exploring for Moscow.Mr. Cohen consulted with White House staff members and Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201clegal counsel\u201d as he prepared for his false congressional testimony, though it did not identify the lawyer, according to the memo. The document did not say if Mr. Cohen was asked to lie, nor did it identify which counsel he spoke with.But the lawyers wrote that Mr. Cohen had consulted with Mr. Trump\u2019s aides because he knew the president wanted to \u201cdismiss and minimize the merit\u201d of the special counsel\u2019s inquiry, and that Mr. Trump and his aides \u201cwere seeking to portray contact with Russian representatives in any form by Client-1, the campaign or the Trump Organization as having effectively terminated before the Iowa caucuses of Feb. 1, 2016.\u201dMr. Cohen\u2019s false statements to Congress and his assistance to Mr. Trump with the hush-money payments arose out of his \u201cfierce loyalty\u201d to Mr. Trump, the lawyers wrote.\u201cMichael regrets that his vigor in promoting Client-1\u2019s interests in the heat of political battle led him to abandon good judgment and cross legal lines,\u201d they added.The memo said that Mr. Cohen had met seven times with Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors \u2014 the first time on Aug. 7, two weeks before he entered his first guilty plea \u2014 and that he intended to keep making himself available when needed for additional questioning.It revealed that he had also met twice with federal prosecutors in Manhattan \u2014 and would continue to do so if needed \u2014 responding to their questions concerning \u201can ongoing investigation,\u201d which the memo did not describe.The memo noted that Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was expected to provide the judge with an assessment of Mr. Cohen\u2019s cooperation, and that the Manhattan prosecutors were to join in presenting Mr. Cohen\u2019s assistance as a factor for the judge to consider.The memo disclosed that Mr. Cohen had also met voluntarily with investigators from the New York attorney general\u2019s office regarding a lawsuit it has brought against Mr. Trump and his foundation.Mr. Cohen also provided the attorney general\u2019s office with documents concerning \u201ca separate open inquiry,\u201d the memo added, also offering no elaboration.Threaded throughout the document were testimonials from people closest to Mr. Cohen \u2014 drawn from some three dozen letters that were also submitted \u2014 depicting an image of generosity that undercuts the public perceptions of him since his guilty plea.The most powerful letter was from his 83-year-old father, Maurice Cohen, a Holocaust survivor, who wrote that his son is \u201cthe oxygen in the air that I breathe.\u201d\u201cI pray and beg, beg and pray that you won\u2019t take my oxygen away from me,\u201d the elder Mr. Cohen wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 Plan in Pakistan Takes a Military Turn", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "Under a program China insisted was peaceful, Pakistan is cooperating on distinctly defense-related projects, including a secret plan to build new fighter jets.Supported byThe reality was that Pakistan already had a replacement sponsor lined up.Chinese officials have repeatedly said the Belt and Road is purely an economic project with peaceful intent. But with its plan for Pakistan, China is for the first time explicitly tying a Belt and Road proposal to its military ambitions \u2014 and confirming the concerns of a host of nations who suspect the infrastructure initiative is really about helping China project armed might.As China\u2019s strategically located and nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan has been the leading example of how the Chinese projects are being used to give Beijing both favor and leverage among its clients.Since the beginning of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, Pakistan has been the program\u2019s flagship site, with some $62 billion in projects planned in the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. In the process, China has lent more and more money to Pakistan at a time of economic desperation there, binding the two countries ever closer.For the most part, Pakistan has eagerly turned more toward China as the chill with the United States has deepened. Some Pakistani officials are growing concerned about losing sovereignty to their deep-pocketed Asian ally, but the host of ways the two countries are now bound together may leave Pakistan with little choice but to go along.Even before the revelation of the new Chinese-Pakistani military cooperation, some of China\u2019s biggest projects in Pakistan had clear strategic implications.UzbekistanKashgarTajikistanTurkmenistanChinaKabulIslamabadAfghanistanLahoreIranPakistanIndiaChinese road projectsChinese port projectsKarachiGwadar Port200 milesArabian SeaUzbekistanKashgarTajikistanTurkmenistanChinaKabulIslamabadAfghanistanLahorePakistanIndiaIranChinese road projectsChinese port projectsKarachiGwadar Port200 milesArabian SeaKashgarUzbekistanTajikistanTurkmenistanChinaKabulIslamabadAfghanistanLahorePakistanIranIndiaGwadarPortKarachiChinese road projects200 milesChinese port projectsSource: Center for Strategic and International Studies | By The New York TimesA less scrutinized component of Belt and Road is the central role Pakistan plays in China\u2019s Beidou satellite navigation system. Pakistan is the only other country that has been granted access to the system\u2019s military service, allowing more precise guidance for missiles, ships and aircraft.The cooperation is meant to be a blueprint for Beidou\u2019s expansion to other Belt and Road nations, however, ostensibly ending its clients\u2019 reliance on the American military-run GPS network that Chinese officials fear is monitored and manipulated by the United States.In Pakistan, China has found an amenable ally with much to recommend it: shared borders and a long history of cooperation; a hedge in South Asia against India; a large market for arms sales and trade with potential for growth; a wealth of natural resources.Now, China is also finding a better showcase for its security and surveillance technology in a place once defined by its close military relationship with the United States.\u201cThe focus of Belt and Road is on roads and bridges and ports, because those are the concrete construction projects that people can easily see. But it\u2019s the technologies of the future and technologies of future security systems that could be the biggest security threat in the Belt and Road project,\u201d said Priscilla Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, a cyberthreat intelligence monitoring company based in Massachusetts.The tightening China-Pakistan security alliance has gained momentum on a long road to the Arabian Sea.Linking the port to western China would be a new 2,000-mile network of highways and rails through the most forbidding stretch of Pakistan: Baluchistan Province, a resource-rich region plagued by militancy.The public vision for the project was that it would allow Chinese goods to bypass much longer and more expensive shipping routes through the Indian Ocean and avoid the territorial waters of several American allies in Asia.From the beginning, though, key details of the project were kept from the public and lawmakers, officials say, including the terms of its loan structure and the length of the lease, more than 40 years, that a Chinese state-owned company secured to operate the port.If there was concern within Pakistan about the hidden costs of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, also known as CPEC, there was growing suspicion abroad about a hidden military aspect, as well.In October, Vice President Mike Pence said Sri Lanka was a warning for all Belt and Road countries that China was luring them into debt traps.\u201cJust ask Sri Lanka, which took on massive debt to let Chinese state companies build a port of questionable commercial value,\u201d Mr. Pence added. \u201cIt may soon become a forward military base for China\u2019s growing blue-water navy.\u201dMilitary analysts predict that China could use Gwadar to expand the naval footprint of its attack submarines, after agreeing in 2015 to sell eight submarines to Pakistan in a deal worth up to $6 billion. China could use the equipment it sells to the South Asian country to refuel its own submarines, extending its navy\u2019s global reach.When China inaugurated Belt and Road, in 2013, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s new government in Pakistan saw it as the answer for a host of problems.Foreign investment in Pakistan was scant, driven away by terrorist attacks and the country\u2019s enduring reputation for corruption. And Pakistan desperately needed a modern power grid to help ease persistent electricity shortages.Pakistani officials say that Beijing first proposed the highway from China\u2019s western Xinjiang region through Pakistan that connected to Gwadar port. But Pakistani officials insisted that new coal power plants be built. China agreed.With CPEC under fresh scrutiny, Chinese and Pakistani officials in recent weeks have contended that Pakistan has a debt problem, but not a Chinese debt problem. In October, the country\u2019s central bank revealed an overall debt and liability burden of about $215 billion, with $95 billion externally held. With nearly half of CPEC\u2019s projects completed \u2014 in terms of worth \u2014 Pakistan currently owes China $23 billion.But the country stands to owe $62 billion to China \u2014 before interest balloons the figure to some $90 billion \u2014 under the plan for Belt and Road\u2019s expansion there in coming years.Pakistan\u2019s central bank governor, Ashraf Wathra, said publicly in 2015 that he had no clarity on Chinese investments in Pakistan and was concerned about rising debt levels. It still took him months after that to secure a briefing from cabinet officials.\u201cMy main question was, \u2018Do we have any feasibility studies of these projects and a cost-benefit analysis?\u2019 Their answers were all evasive,\u201d recalled Mr. Wathra, who has since retired.Ahsan Iqbal, a cabinet minister and the main architect for CPEC in the previous government, said the project was well thought-through and dismissed Mr. Wathra\u2019s account.\u201cNo one wanted to invest here \u2014 the Chinese took a chance,\u201d Mr. Iqbal said in an interview.But the bill is coming due. Pakistan\u2019s first debt repayments to China are set for next year, starting at about $300 million and gradually increasing to reach about $3.2 billion by 2026, according to officials. And Pakistan is already having trouble paying what it owes to Chinese companies.According to the undisclosed proposal drawn up by the Pakistani Air Force and Chinese officials at the start of the year, a special economic zone under CPEC would be created in Pakistan to produce a new generation of fighter jets. For the first time, navigation systems, radar systems and onboard weapons would be built jointly by the countries at factories in Pakistan.The proposal, confirmed by officials at the Ministry of Planning and Development, would expand China and Pakistan\u2019s current cooperation on the JF-17 fighter jet, which is assembled at Pakistan\u2019s military-run Kamra Aeronautical Complex in Punjab Province. The Chinese-designed jets have given Pakistan an alternative to the American-built F-16 fighters that have become more difficult to obtain as Islamabad\u2019s relationship with Washington frays.The plans are in the final stages of approval, but the current government is expected to rubber stamp the project, officials in Islamabad say.For China, Pakistan could become a showcase for other countries seeking to shift their militaries away from American equipment and toward Chinese arms, Western diplomats said. And because China is not averse to selling such advanced weaponry as ballistic missiles \u2014 which the United States will not sell to allies like Saudi Arabia \u2014 the deal with Pakistan could be a steppingstone to a bigger market for Chinese weapons in the Muslim world.For years, some of the most important military coordination between China and Pakistan has been going on in space.Like GPS, Beidou has a civilian function and a military one. If its trial with Pakistan goes well, Beijing could offer Beidou\u2019s military service to other countries, creating a bloc of nations whose military actions would be more difficult for the United States to monitor.\u201cBeidou, whatever any users use it for \u2014 whether it\u2019s a civilian navigating their way to the grocery store or a government using it to coordinate their rocket launches \u2014 those are all things that China can track,\u201d said Ms. Moriuchi, of the research group Recorded Future. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what is most striking: that this authoritarian government will be a major technology provider for numerous countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.\u201dFor the Pentagon, China\u2019s satellite launches are ominous.In October, Pakistan\u2019s information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, said that by 2022, Pakistan would send its own astronaut into space with China\u2019s help.\u201cWe are close to China, and we are getting more close,\u201d he said in a later interview. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the West to wake up and recognize our importance.\u201dCampaigning during the parliamentary elections that made him prime minister in July, Imran Khan vowed to review CPEC projects and renegotiate them if he won. In September, after meeting in Saudi Arabia with the crown prince, Mr. Khan said that the kingdom had agreed to invest in CPEC too.Pakistan\u2019s new commerce minister then proposed pausing all CPEC projects while the government assessed them.The moves by Pakistan\u2019s new government angered Beijing, which was concerned they could set back Belt and Road globally.Shortly after the commerce minister\u2019s comments, the Pakistani Army\u2019s top commander, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, hurried to Beijing for an unannounced visit with President Xi Jinping. The meeting came six weeks before Mr. Khan made his first official visit with the Chinese president, a trip he had listed as a priority.Statements from the military said General Bajwa and Mr. Xi spoke extensively about Belt and Road projects.Shortly after the Beijing meeting, Pakistan\u2019s government rolled back its invitation to Saudi Arabia to join CPEC and all talk of pausing or canceling Chinese projects has stopped.But China could face another challenge to its investments: a Pakistani financial crisis that has forced Mr. Khan\u2019s government to seek loans from international lenders that require transparency.Throughout September, international delegations traveled to Islamabad carrying the same message: Reveal the extent of Chinese loans if you want financial assistance.In a late September meeting with visiting officials from the International Monetary Fund, Pakistan\u2019s government asked for a bailout of up to $12 billion. The fund\u2019s representatives pressed Pakistan to share all existing agreements with the Chinese government and demanded I.M.F. input during any future CPEC negotiations \u2014 a previously undisclosed facet of the negotiations, according to communications seen by the Fund and a Pakistani official. The fund also sought assurances that Pakistan would not use a bailout to repay CPEC loans.But the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad stepped up its engagement as well, demanding that CPEC deals be kept secret and promising to shore up Pakistan\u2019s finances with bilateral loans, Pakistani officials say.Three months after taking office, Mr. Khan still has not made good on his campaign promises to reveal the nature of the $62 billion investment Beijing has committed to Pakistan, and his government has backtracked on an I.M.F. deal.In early November, Mr. Khan visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, a trip during which he was expected to clinch bilateral loans and grants to ease Pakistan\u2019s financial crisis.Instead, his government walked away with vague promises of a deal \u201cin principle,\u201d but refused to disclose any details.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Year Justice Caught Up With Trumpworld", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2018, impunity came to an end.Opinion ColumnistAmid this ceaseless barrage, things many of us have taken for granted have been called into question, including the endurance of liberal democracy, the political salience of truth and the assumption that it would be a big scandal if a president were caught directing illegal payoffs to a pornographic film actress. Often it feels like in American politics, none of the old rules still apply.But in 2018, they did. (At least some of them.) Alien probes aside, this was a year in which things started to make sense again. The Democratic landslide in the midterms proved that the laws of political gravity haven\u2019t been suspended; Trump\u2019s incompetence, venality and boorishness had electoral consequences. Further, it was a year of justice and accountability for at least some of those who foisted this administration on the country. An awful menagerie of lowlifes was swept into power by Trump\u2019s victory two years ago. In 2018, at least some of them started to fall back out again.At the beginning of 2018, Michael Cohen was still Trump\u2019s loyal personal lawyer. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was sleeping in his own bed at night. Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s deputy, had not yet made a plea deal with Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Mueller\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t yet sent anyone to prison. The Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about work he\u2019d done with Gates for the former Ukrainian president, became the first, in May. He was followed by Richard Pinedo, seller of fake IDs and fraudulent bank accounts, and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.If Trump opponents had known a year ago that 2018 would bring so many revelations and comeuppances, we might have assumed that the Trump administration would be entering its terminal phase. But living under Trump has inured many of us to shock; momentous developments, like Cohen being sentenced to three years in prison, end up feeling anticlimactic, particularly with most Republicans refusing to act.Advertisement"}

If the ranking position, which is awarded on the basis of seniority, is offered to him, he said he would take it. \u201cI want to do whatever I can to help my country and my state,\u201d he said.The senator has also addressed his critics another way, by reversing himself to vote against Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Mr. Manchin was the sole Democrat to vote in favor of the nominee, Bernard McNamee, in committee. But he changed his mind, he said, after seeing video footage of Mr. McNamee denying that climate change is caused by humans.A statement he issued seemed designed to send a strong message to his detractors.\u201cClimate change is real, humans have made a significant impact, and we have the responsibility and capability to address it urgently,\u201d it said. Despite his opposition, Mr. McNamee was confirmed on Thursday, 50 to 49.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand Democrat and incoming House freshman from New York who has been pushing for a so-called Green New Deal, cited those contributions last week when she expressed opposition to Mr. Manchin.Under the seniority system by which Senate Democrats govern themselves, several of Mr. Manchin\u2019s colleagues are ahead of him in the line for the top spot on the energy panel. But for various reasons \u2014 including the tradition that a senator serves as the ranking member of only one committee \u2014 they seem likely to turn it down. The maneuvering, which will be sorted out before the next Congress begins, is like a game of political musical chairs.Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, currently the top Democrat on the energy panel, may move to the Commerce Committee, replacing Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who lost his re-election bid. Next in seniority is Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, but he wants to keep his top spot on the Finance Committee. Then comes Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who has shown no inclination to vacate the top spot on the Agriculture Committee.That leaves Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and holds the party\u2019s top spot on the Budget Committee; he has not stated his intentions, and waved away questions on Thursday. If Mr. Sanders rejects Energy and Commerce in favor of remaining the ranking member on the budget panel, the job would be Mr. Manchin\u2019s \u2014 unless Mr. Schumer intervened, which would be likely to cause an uproar in his caucus.A spokesman for Mr. Schumer declined to comment.As the controversy swirled, other Democrats came to Mr. Manchin\u2019s defense on Thursday, arguing that no one senator \u2014 not even one in a top spot of a relevant committee \u2014 will set policy on climate change. Even so, Mr. Manchin\u2019s future is likely to come up when Democrats organize their committee slates for the coming Congress.\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some discussion among members; I think it\u2019s a worthwhile conversation to have,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. But, Mr. Murphy added, \u201cnobody in our caucus has veto power over climate policy, whether they\u2019re the ranking member on a committee or not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Urges Maximum Sentence for Lawyer Who Implicated Him", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump used his Twitter feed on Monday to accuse his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, of lying under oath and said he should receive the maximum jail sentence as he praised another former adviser, Roger J. Stone Jr., for saying he would never testify against the president.Mr. Trump\u2019s latest Twitter fusillade came after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the duration of his work for the Trump Organization on a proposed, but never completed, Trump Tower project in Moscow.In reality, Mr. Cohen testified, the work on the proposal did not end in January 2016, as he had claimed, but lasted until May 2016, when Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination for president. The charge was brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating possible collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials interfering in the presidential election.In his plea agreement, and in a presentencing memo written by his lawyers in a separate federal case in the Southern District of New York, Mr. Cohen said that he had kept Mr. Trump updated about the project as he tried to expedite the proposal. During the early months of 2016, Mr. Trump had been publicly pushing for warmer relations with Russia, a position that might have benefited his business.In the first Twitter post related to Mr. Cohen on Monday morning, Mr. Trump referred to the presentencing memo.Mr. Cohen has since spent more than 70 hours with investigators working with the Southern District, as well as Mr. Mueller\u2019s team and the state attorney general of New York, who has an open inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s use of his charitable foundation. He has emerged as one of the biggest threats to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.The president\u2019s tweets could be read as trying to interfere in Mr. Cohen\u2019s case as he prepares for his sentencing date on Dec. 12.In another tweet, Mr. Trump addressed Mr. Stone, who is being investigated by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team over whether he had advance knowledge of plans by the website WikiLeaks to release troves of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Stone has denied any direct link to Julian Assange, who founded WikiLeaks, and has insisted he was told information by others or boasted that he knew more than he did.Mr. Stone \u2014 who recently predicted that Mr. Trump would not seek a second term and would claim he had achieved what he wanted to in his first few years in office \u2014 has said he will not testify against Mr. Trump and has accused Mr. Mueller\u2019s team of trying to force false confessions from witnesses.It was unclear why Mr. Trump put quotation marks around his own name and title.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As the Trumps Dodged Taxes, Their Tenants Paid a Price", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey were collateral damage as Donald J. Trump and his siblings dodged inheritance taxes and gained control of their father\u2019s fortune: thousands of renters in an empire of unassuming red-brick buildings scattered across Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.Those buildings have been home to generations of strivers, municipal workers and newly arrived immigrants. When their regulated rents started rising more quickly in the 1990s, many tenants had no idea why. Some heard that the Trump family had spent millions on building improvements, but they remained suspicious.\u201cI\u2019ve always thought there was something strange going on,\u201d said Jack Leitner, who has lived in the Beach Haven Apartments in Coney Island, Brooklyn, for more than two decades. \u201cBut you have to have proof, and it\u2019s an uphill battle.\u201dPadding the invoices had a secondary benefit for the Trumps, allowing them to inflate rent increases on their father\u2019s rent-regulated apartments.\u201cThe higher the markup would be, the higher the rent that might be charged,\u201d Robert Trump, the president\u2019s brother, once admitted in a sworn deposition obtained by The Times.The president and his siblings have long since sold their father\u2019s buildings and moved on with their inherited fortunes. But for tenants, the insidious effects of the scheme continue to this day.The padded invoices have been baked into the base rent used to calculate the annual percentage increase approved by the city. The sum total of the rent overcharges cannot be calculated from available records. As a way to appreciate the scope of the impact, a onetime $10 increase in 1995 on all the 8,000 apartments involved would put the total overpaid by tenants at more than $33 million to date, an analysis of approved rent increases shows.Mr. Leitner, a retired computer programmer, was not pleased to learn that his rent had been artificially inflated. Like other tenants interviewed by The Times, he wants that money back.\u201cIf they passed on phony costs to tenants, they should lower our rents,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump and his brother Robert did not respond to requests for comment for this article. But in a written statement for The Times\u2019s original piece, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Charles J. Harder, said that \u201cthere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone,\u201d and that Mr. Trump had delegated tax matters to relatives and tax professionals.The most overt fraud uncovered by The Times involved the sham corporation, All County Building Supply & Maintenance, created by the Trumps in 1992. It appeared, on paper at least, to be a purchasing agent for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings.In reality, the creation of All County did not change how Fred Trump\u2019s business functioned. He and his executives continued to negotiate prices for everything from roofs to window cleaner, but vendors began receiving checks from an All County bank account. Fred Trump\u2019s apartment buildings then reimbursed All County, with an extra 20 to 50 percent tacked on.All County was owned by Donald Trump, his three siblings and a cousin. In some years, the amounts distributed to each Trump sibling ballooned to nearly $1 million, records obtained by The Times show.Because All County performed no real work, the transfer of money through the corporation was essentially a gift that evaded the 55 percent tax in place at the time, tax experts told The Times.Former prosecutors told The Times that the filing of padded invoices with state rent regulators could have led to criminal charges at the time, but that the statute of limitations has long since expired. Civil penalties in cases of fraud remain a possibility, and tax authorities in New York City and New York State have said they are examining issues raised by The Times\u2019s investigation.Lawyers who specialize in representing tenants say the Trumps\u2019 current and former tenants may have an opening to challenge the decades-old increases, potentially rolling back rents and collecting damages.Michael Grinthal, supervising lawyer with the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center, a nonprofit legal services and advocacy group, said that the current owners would be held responsible for any damages, but that those owners could have a claim against the president and his siblings.\u201cIf I was talking to those tenants right now, I\u2019d say: \u2018Do it. Go,\u2019\u201d Mr. Grinthal said. \u201cThis case should be fought.\u201dRegulations generally allow tenants to challenge rent for the past four years. But the state\u2019s highest court has held that tenants can look back further to show their landlord increased rent through fraud (though damages are still limited).\u201cIf they are making false statements about how much it costs, that would be pretty much dead center of the definition of fraud,\u201d Mr. Grinthal said.Although the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal oversees rent-regulated apartments, the responsibility for uncovering overcharges falls mostly to tenants, many of whom are unaware of the rules. Just trying to figure out the codes on rental history forms and discern what drove up their rent can seem daunting.Susan Shavitz, 73, moved into her two-bedroom at Trump Village in Coney Island with her mother when Fred Trump completed construction in 1964. Decades later, her rent begin to rise more quickly. She believed at the time that the increases were exclusively because the Trumps had switched the building to a different affordable-housing program.Ms. Shavitz obtained her apartment rental history from the state at the request of The Times, but she could not translate the soup of numbers and abbreviations.\u201cIt made no sense to me whatsoever,\u201d said Ms. Shavitz, a retired teacher. \u201cI have no idea how much of it was because of the improvements.\u201dOther records show the state approved a building-wide rent increase in 1997 of almost $1.1 million after the Trumps installed new windows, terrace doors and boilers, which were an early focus of the All County purchases. That project increased Ms. Shavitz\u2019s rent by $32 a month. While it is not known how much of that is attributable to All County, the cost of improvements bumped up her rent in five of the last eight years that the Trumps owned the buildings, adding 11 percent in all.Ms. Shavitz said that she was financially comfortable and could afford her rent but would still participate in a lawsuit to win back overcharges.Like Ms. Shavitz and her mother, thousands of tenants once saw moving into a Fred Trump building as a step up the economic ladder, an arrival of sorts. In the postwar era, the president\u2019s father came to own more than 10,000 apartments in New York City, and thousands more elsewhere, often financing the construction through low-interest government loans aimed at creating affordable housing for returning veterans and the booming middle class.The rules attached to those loans kept rents low, but Fred Trump excelled at keeping costs low, and the empire became enormously profitable. In just one six-year span, 1988 through 1993, Fred Trump reported $109.7 million in total income, the equivalent today of $210.7 million, according to confidential tax records obtained by The Times.His buildings share a uniform austerity. Most are six-story brick rectangles with incongruously aristocratic sounding names \u2014 Saxony Hall, Westminster Apartments, Green Park Essex. His largest projects were sprawling complexes with acres of lawn in and around Coney Island \u2014 Beach Haven, Shore Haven and Trump Village.The folk singer Woody Guthrie took an apartment at Beach Haven in 1950. He wrote a song called \u201cOld Man Trump,\u201d contemplating the morality of paying rent to someone who would not allow blacks to live in the building. The chorus began:Mr. Leitner, 69, remembers that when he signed his first lease at Beach Haven in 1996, the rent was significantly higher than the one quoted during his apartment hunt.He recently obtained the official rental history of his apartment from the state at the request of The Times. It shows that his initial rent was $728, an increase of $154 from the prior tenant\u2019s rate. Most of that jump, in fact, was because of the improvement costs.The effect of those costs was compounded through the years, as every approved rent increase built upon the starting point. And while some portion was certainly legitimate, even a $10-a-month increase because of a padded All County invoice would mean that Mr. Leitner had given his landlords at least $3,800 more than they were legally entitled to over the past 22 years.Housing advocates have long argued that there is widespread abuse of the two programs that owners of rent-regulated apartments use to raise rents based on improvements or repairs. Two Albany lawmakers introduced legislation last August that would end one, known as Major Capital Improvements.\u201cThe M.C.I. program has been subject to abuse by landlords for years \u2014 the fact the Trump family did it just highlights that,\u201d said one of the lawmakers, state Senator Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s time to scrap the program.\u201dBecause the increases carry forward, even tenants who moved in years after the Trumps sold the last of their father\u2019s empire in 2004 were affected by the family\u2019s invoice-padding scheme.\u201cI want it looked at because a lot of tenants may be owed money,\u201d said Angel Castillo, 49, who moved into Beach Haven a few years after the Trump siblings sold it.He moved out just a few weeks ago. The reason: The current landlord increased his rent by $150 a month.\u201cThey told me I was lucky it wasn\u2019t more,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vatican Expels 2 Cardinals Implicated in Sexual Abuse From Pope\u2019s Council", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The Vatican announced Wednesday that it had removed two cardinals implicated in sexual abuse cases from a powerful council of advisers picked by Pope Francis to guide him on matters critical to the future of the Catholic Church.One of the cardinals is George Pell of Australia, who has been facing charges of sexual abuse of minors in legal proceedings that are subject to a gag order in that country, suppressing news coverage until after they have concluded.The other is Cardinal Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz of Chile, who has been accused of covering up abuse.Members of the nine-member council of advisers, known as the C9, who met in Rome this week, had asked the pope to reflect on the \u201cwork, structure and composition of the council, taking into account the advanced age of some members.\u201d According to a statement on Wednesday by a Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, the pope had done just that.Mr. Burke\u2019s statement said the pope had written in October to both Cardinal Pell and Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz, and had concluded by \u201cthanking them for their service\u201d over the last five years.The pope also dismissed a third Cardinal, Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, the 79-year-old archbishop of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.But Cardinals Pell, 77, and Err\u00e1zuriz, 85, the other oldest members on the council, had much more than their age going against them.He has been facing charges of \u201chistorical child sexual offenses\u201d in the county court of Victoria.For years, Cardinal Pell was considered the Vatican\u2019s de facto finance chief, and his allies in Rome attribute the charges against him to church infighting.More accusations subsequently surfaced that he had sexually abused minors beginning early in his priesthood.He has repeatedly denied the accusations, including during an extraordinary news conference in the Vatican last year, when he said, \u201cI\u2019d just like to restate my innocence.\u201dThe proceedings against him in Australia have been extremely secretive because of the Australian gag order, which is designed to prevent the swaying of juries.Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz, the retired archbishop of Santiago, is well over the usual retirement age and, along with the rest of the Chilean bishop\u2019s conference, had tendered his resignation to Francis in May.Months earlier, during a trip to Chile and Peru, the pope had defended Chilean bishops against accusations of covering up abuse. That remark, and other missteps, led to an outcry among victims of sex abuse and their supporters, who considered the pope tone-deaf on an issue that has jeopardized his legacy.The pope ultimately changed direction, dispatching his top sex abuse investigator to Chile and convening all the Chilean bishops at a meeting in Rome, where he accused them of mishandling and covering up an extensive child sexual abuse scandal in the country. They offered their resignations en masse.Francis has accepted the resignation of several of the bishops so far, but not that of Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz.And in October, The Associated Press reported that some victims of Father Karadima had filed a criminal complaint against Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz, accusing him of perjury and of covering up Father Karadima\u2019s crimes. The cardinal has denied he did so.Pope Francis is facing the greatest crisis of his pontificate as the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic Church has exploded once again in countries around the world. In the United States, especially, civil authorities have more aggressively investigated abuse in the church, including widespread abuse in Pennsylvania over decades.Attorneys general in about 16 states have undertaken their own investigations.In August, the pope\u2019s former ambassador to the United States, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, accused him of knowing about the inappropriate behavior of a former American cardinal, Theodore McCarrick, who resigned as a cardinal in July and was ordered by the pope to a life of prayer and penance.Opponents to Pope Francis have seized on the accusations, which have until now been unsubstantiated, to weaken the 81-year-old pontiff.In October, the pope reluctantly accepted the resignation of the former cardinal\u2019s successor, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who in a report by a Pennsylvania grand jury was frequently cited for poorly handling accusations against priests when he was the bishop of Pittsburgh.Francis suggested that Cardinal Wuerl could have defended himself (he in fact did) but chose not to for the unity of the church and was thus a model for the future unity of the church.Abuse victims and their supporters, while dubious of the accusations against the pope by Archbishop Vigan\u00f2, have nevertheless expressed repeated concern that Pope Francis, for all his attention to the plight of migrants and the poor, has insufficiently safeguarded minors.They want a concrete, systematic and universal set of norms that enforces zero tolerance and accountability within the church when it comes to sex abuse.The pope, who has championed a collegial approach to church governance that empowers bishops and takes into account their cultural diversity, has responded to the crisis by scheduling a meeting in February of the presidents of bishops conferences.In November, the pope surprised American bishops at a meeting of their conference in Baltimore by sending a letter that required them to delay voting on measures to hold bishops accountable for failing to protect children from abusive clergy.The reason was to avoid interfering with the February meeting, his supporters said, acknowledging that the action only raised expectations that the pope would force the church to take concrete demonstrable actions to address the abuse.Neither Cardinal Pell nor Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz attended the meetings in Rome this week. Among the subjects discussed, according to the Vatican statement, was the February meeting with the presidents of the world\u2019s bishops conferences on the theme of the protection of minors.Advertisement"}

They become, by sheer force of repetition, \u201calternative facts\u201d and staples of his campaign rallies and speeches.Yet Mr. Trump does not rely on repetition alone. He also embellishes talking points to amplify his achievements.In the face of controversy or criticism, Mr. Trump has defended initial falsehoods with additional dubious claims.The president is known for being unscripted and loose with language, but he sometimes shows tactical restraint.The omission of a name and the use of the words \u201cthe accuser\u201d may give the misleading impression that Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to Congress that Justice Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, had recanted her account.

{"Headline": "In Britain, a Team Effort to Help Local News Survive", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When Lucy Ashton quit The Sheffield Star in 2009 to have children and work in public relations, she had already seen other reporters steadily leaving the paper as circulation and advertising fell, and figured she\u2019d never see jobs being added again.Now she has returned, as part of a new initiative with a simple goal: to help news organizations cover local government.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t on the agenda,\u201d Ms. Ashton said. \u201cWithout a reporter at that meeting, we wouldn\u2019t have got that.\u201dIn an unusual effort to revive coverage of local government, smaller news publishers in Britain can get a share of the BBC\u2019s license fee, the annual charge paid by every household with a television that has sustained the BBC as local newsroom budgets have shrunk.The money, 8 million pounds a year (about $10.2 million), is used by local newspapers and news sites to pay the salaries of additional reporters, like Ms. Ashton.Publications across Britain can apply for the reporting positions, and so far about 90 percent of the 144 places have been filled. The reporters, who are expected to be experienced journalists, receive additional training from the BBC and are paid a minimum of \u00a322,000 each, a salary broadly comparable to other reporting positions at Britain\u2019s regional news organizations. The reporters are hired by the newspapers for an initial period of about two years.Matt Hancock, a member of Parliament and former minister for the government department responsible for media and culture, said he hoped the program would restore some vigor to the way local government was being covered.Fewer journalists were challenging statements by politicians, he said, and reporters who once covered public officials were now often working for them in public relations jobs.\u201cYou think, hold on, is that really how to have a vibrant democracy?\u201d Mr. Hancock said.The partnership with the BBC has already yielded some significant stories. Among them are these:Stories like these are helping to remind readers about areas that aren\u2019t always being covered, said Jeremy Clifford, editor in chief of Johnston Press, a chain of newspapers that includes The Sheffield Star.\u201cIt\u2019s a really important investment in the lifeblood, our way of life,\u201d Mr. Clifford said.In return for the financing, newspapers cannot use the new positions as an opportunity to cut newsroom staffs, and must assign the reporters to cover local government beats. The BBC and dozens of media organizations are allowed to republish the articles, creating a kind of wire service for local news.For the BBC, the arrangement also serves as a counter to critics in Parliament who say that it can crowd out commercial companies. Some have even argued that the TV license fee should be scrapped.There are no strict benchmarks to determine whether the project has been a success. But organizers at the BBC and the News Media Association said they would measure how the stories were shared, how often they were picked up by other news outlets and whether attendance at meetings was affected by the presence of a reporter.Some officials were taken aback to see reporters at their meetings, said Calvin Robinson, one of the reporters. Others put on a performance when they know that a reporter is in the room, said Daniel Jaines, the other Local News Partnership reporter at the website. \u201cIf there\u2019s a reporter there, they\u2019re a lot more shouty,\u201d he said.The partnership with the BBC will be no more than a Band-Aid over a gaping wound, said Roy Greenslade, a former editor and honorary visiting professor of journalism at City, University of London. \u201cThese companies are gradually going out of business because their business model is wrecked, totally and utterly wrecked.\u201dMr. Ionescu said he had seen the traffic to his site driven by Facebook slow, and advertising money increasingly spent on platforms like Google and Facebook rather than local online publishers.He isn\u2019t sure there is much more that can be done to stave off the growing power of huge technology companies.\u201cI don\u2019t see what more they could do in order to tackle the advertising gap or the revenue gap,\u201d Mr. Ionescu said. \u201cThe publishers who create everything, they just get the scraps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Credit Cards Are Used to Finance Mass Shootings", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "Massacres are frequently carried out by killers using military-grade equipment that\u2019s easier to obtain when buying on credit.Two days before Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, he went on Google and typed \u201cCredit card unusual spending.\u201d Mr. Mateen had opened six new credit card accounts \u2014 including a Mastercard, an American Express card and three Visa cards \u2014 over the previous eight months. Twelve days before the shooting, he began a $26,532 buying spree: a Sig Sauer MCX .223-caliber rifle, a Glock 17 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, several large magazines, thousands of rounds of ammunition and a $7,500 ring for his wife that he bought on a jewelry store card. His average spending before that, on his only card, was $1,500 a month.His web browsing history chronicled his anxiety: \u201cCredit card reports all three bureaus,\u201d \u201cFBI,\u201d and \u201cWhy banks stop your purchases.\u201d He needn\u2019t have worried. None of the banks, credit-card network operators or payment processors alerted law enforcement officials about the purchases he thought were so suspicious.Mass shootings routinely set off a national debate on guns, usually focused on regulating firearms and on troubled youths. Little attention is paid to the financial industry that has become an instrumental, if unwitting, enabler of carnage. A New York Times examination of mass shootings since the Virginia Tech attack in 2007 reveals how credit cards have become a crucial part of the planning of these massacres. There have been 13 shootings that killed 10 or more people in the last decade, and in at least eight of them, the killers financed their attacks using credit cards. Some used credit to acquire firearms they could not otherwise have afforded. Those eight shootings killed 217 people. The investigations undertaken in their aftermath uncovered a rich trove of information about the killers\u2019 spending. There were plenty of red flags, if only someone were able to look for them, law enforcement experts say.\u201cBanks will complain this is the government\u2019s job and it\u2019s not our job, but you know what? They are the only ones with the ability to do this,\u201d said Kevin Sullivan, a former New York Police fraud investigator who consults with banks as president of the Anti-Money Laundering Training Academy. After the shooting last February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and staff members were killed, this column suggested that financial firms had an opportunity to help reduce violence by pushing for more responsible practices by the gun industry. As a result, some banks ended their relationships with gunmakers and some investors pushed manufacturers for more transparency. Financial firms have so far resisted changing the way they deal with the sale of guns.Banks and credit-card networks say it is not their responsibility to create systems to track gun purchases that would allow them to report suspicious patterns.\u201cWe do not believe Visa should be in the position of setting restrictions on the sale of lawful goods or services,\u201d said Amanda Pires, a Visa spokeswoman. \u201cOur role in commerce is to efficiently process, protect and settle all legal payments. Asking Visa or other payment networks to arbitrate what legal goods can be purchased sets a dangerous precedent.\u201dA spokesman for Mastercard echoed that sentiment, emphasizing its protection of \u201ccardholders\u2019 independence\u201d and the \u201cprivacy of their own purchasing decisions.\u201d But the financial industry is uniquely positioned to see, if it chose to do so, a potential killer\u2019s behavior in a way that retailers, law enforcement officials, concerned family members or mental health professionals cannot.

They Can Use It With Gun Makers.Citigroup Acted. Now, Two New Ideas on How Banks Can Limit Gun Sales.When it comes to certain crimes, banks are on the front lines. They crunch transaction data to protect their customers from fraudulent purchases \u2014 often identifying stolen credit cards within seconds \u2014 and to detect money laundering, funding of terrorist organizations and other crimes. A labyrinth of rules prevents banks and credit-card networks \u2014 many of which also handle debit card transactions \u2014 from seeing exactly what customers are buying. Retailers have historically resisted providing item-by-item information \u2014 known as SKU-level data, a reference to the stock-keeping unit number of an item \u2014 for fear that banks would sell that information or use it to steer customers to rival merchants. In the case of gun purchases, even the nature of the retailer can be obscure: The Merchant Category Code, which identifies the type of store that sold an item, is the same for gun shops and sporting goods stores.But retailers have the ability to send far more detailed transaction information. A feature known as a \u201cboxcar\u201d allows retailers to tag transactions with extra data. It is often used by online retailers to send the bank details about consumer behavior, such as the device used to make a purchase and the location of the buyer.If banks required retailers to transmit details on sales of guns and ammunition, they would be able to make more informed decisions about transactions.\u201cThey can fine-tune their own systems, because in these cases the suspicious purchasing patterns could have been picked up on and quite frankly should have been picked up on,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, the Anti-Money Laundering Training Academy president.Banks could also add information about gun sales to the infrastructure they already use to help the government investigate other criminal activity.\u201cWe need to step back and think about what tools we use to combat terrorism and money-laundering and think about the financial rules associated with the Patriot Act,\u201d said John Streur, chief executive of Calvert Investments, a mutual fund firm that is an advocate for responsible investing. \u201cIn a very real sense, I think these mass shootings are terrorism.\u201dThe shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas last year was described as the worst mass murder on American soil since the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The gunman, Stephen Paddock, killed 58 people and injured more than 800.When his body was found on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, the police noticed four credit cards scattered across the kitchenette countertop next to his hotel key card.Unlike most other mass killers, Mr. Paddock was wealthy. He spent over $600,000 at casinos in the two years leading up to the massacre, and paid over $170,000 to credit card companies. Law enforcement officials saw the full picture of his gun purchases only after they talked to the banks, but they wish they could have connected the dots in advance.\u201cThey have all the infrastructure in place,\u201d said Joseph Moreno, a former federal counterterrorism prosecutor and a staff member of the F.B.I.\u2019s 9/11 Review Commission who is now a partner at Cadwalader. \u201cA.T.F. is already involved in S.A.R.s task forces,\u201d he said, referring to suspicious-activity reports. \u201cIt would just be tweaking it to consider firearm-related information.\u201d Over the last several months, I have spoken to senior executives at the country\u2019s largest banks and credit card companies who were taken aback when I presented them with the list of shootings that involved their cards: Virginia Tech in 2007, Binghamton in 2009, Fort Hood in 2009, Aurora in 2012, San Bernardino in 2015, Orlando in 2016, Sutherland Springs in 2017 and Las Vegas in 2017. That list is based on interviews and hundreds of documents including police reports and credit card receipts. It may actually underreport the use of credit cards in shootings: In some cases the payment method could not be learned.While some executives expressed grief and were open to discussing possible solutions, virtually none were willing to speak about them on the record for fear of upsetting gun-rights advocates and politicians invoking the Second Amendment. Some raised the prospect that by trying to help they would be held responsible if the system failed. Others made a slippery-slope argument: If they were to police gun sales, should they do the same for alcohol in an effort to prevent drunk-driving deaths? After the school shooting in Parkland, Citibank and Bank of America said they would no longer finance or advise gun manufacturers, while investment firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the retirement fund for public employees in California, said they would demand more information from the gunmakers they invested in.Several payment systems \u2014 including PayPal, Square and Apple Pay \u2014 already had established rules that ban the sale of guns and gun-related items using their systems.But no bank has instituted a ban or committed to tracking gun purchases.John Shrewsberry, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo \u2014 which counts the National Rifle Association as a client \u2014 has dismissed the notion that banks should regulate the use of its credit cards for gun purchases.\u201cThe best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process,\u201d he said in April on a conference call with investors.The bill was directed at banks that changed their policies regarding guns.  \u201cOur friends at Citigroup and Bank of America apparently aren\u2019t busy enough with their banking business; they have decided that they are going to set policy for the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Kennedy wrote on Twitter.And a policy expert at the American Civil Liberties Union recently expressed concern about how efforts to prevent mass shootings could infringe on individual rights.\u201cThe implication of expecting the government to detect and prevent every mass shooting is believing the government should play an enormously intrusive role in American life,\u201d Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst at the A.C.L.U. Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, wrote in July.Not all the concerns involve privacy or politics. Some are practical.George Brauchler, the district attorney who oversaw the investigation of Mr. Holmes after the Aurora shooting, said the deluge of data the police receive already presents challenge.\u201cTo some extent we are looking for a needle in a haystack and that haystack keeps getting bigger and bigger,\u201d he said. The data could inform old-fashioned police work that might or might not lead to something more, he said.\u201cDo I wish someone from law enforcement had been able to go to his door and knock on his door and figure out a way to talk their way into it or to freak him out?\" he said of Mr. Holmes. \u201cYeah, absolutely.\u201d Jared L. Loughner had the Chase Visa he used to buy a 9-millimeter Glock handgun in the pocket of his jeans when he shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords in the head outside a Tucson supermarket on Jan. 8, 2011. She survived, but six people died. \u201cThere are a lot of steps that credit card companies can take that could prevent some of the tragic gun violence in the country,\u201d said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cFor companies to say they can\u2019t solve the entire problem and therefore shouldn\u2019t take any steps is just blindly ignoring what they can contribute to the solution.\u201dElected officials could force the financial system to act.In 29 states, consumers cannot use credit cards to buy lottery tickets because legislators don\u2019t want consumers racking up debt gambling. And under the Gun Control Act of 1968, firearms dealers must report if someone buys two or more handguns in a span of five business days.That requirement can be evaded simply by buying at more than one store, but a system involving the banks and credit card networks could have the opportunity to flag the purchases.Mr. Sanfeliz\u2019s father, Carlos, was surprised to learn that the same industry that once employed his son had unwittingly bankrolled other shootings.\u201cSomething needs to be done to prevent more attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI live with this torment every day of my life.\u201dOlivia Carville contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "A Power Grab? Politics as Usual? Michigan\u2019s Governor Will Decide", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLANSING, Mich. \u2014 On both sides of Lake Michigan this month, Republican-dominated legislatures pushed forward measures aimed at hamstringing Democrats who will take over their statehouses in January. On the Wisconsin side, Gov. Scott Walker shrugged at accusations of dirty politics and partisan overreach and signed them into law.In Michigan, all eyes are on Gov. Rick Snyder.A term-limited Republican, Governor Snyder is hardly beloved by the Legislature\u2019s Democrats. But as a lame-duck legislative session draws to a close this week, he has become their best hope to halt an effort by Republican lawmakers to lock their priorities into place before Democrats take over the governor\u2019s office and other major state offices next month.Michigan Republicans are expected to take up bills this week to strip campaign-finance regulation authority from the new Democratic secretary of state, give the Legislature an unchallenged voice in lawsuits overseen by the new Democratic attorney general, and prevent Democratic officials from forcing nonprofit political advocacy groups to disclose who bankrolls their campaigns.In a state whose political traditions might be called radically moderate \u2014 George Romney and William Milliken are famous examples of Republican governors who bent over backward in search of compromises \u2014 the Legislature\u2019s moves are unsettling to some members of both parties.Some Democrats say it is no accident that the three state offices targeted by the male-dominated Legislature will all be occupied by women in January. The state\u2019s incoming Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a former Senate minority leader; the new attorney general, Dana Nessel, is a Detroit lawyer and L.G.B.T.Q. activist. Jocelyn Benson, an associate law professor, will become secretary of state.Republican leaders in the House and Senate, who did not respond to requests for interviews, have called the chambers\u2019 actions politics as usual, albeit bare-knuckled. Yet even some veteran Republicans say the moves, which echo similar power plays by Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and North Carolina, shatter the old notion that losing parties should cede power gracefully.\u201cThe political DNA is this country has changed so dramatically that if you\u2019re in control, you\u2019re going to use it to the utmost and beyond,\u201d said Kenneth R. Sikkema, a Republican consultant who held leadership positions in both the State Senate and House.Governor Snyder has already signed other lame-duck bills that have infuriated his critics, including two that undo increases in the minimum wage and in paid sick leave that the Legislature itself had enacted this summer. Republicans had passed the bills to shortcut citizen initiatives that would have placed the issues on the November ballot.Mr. Snyder has not tipped his hand on his views of legislation that would curb his successors\u2019 power.\u201cPeople should not expect that I\u2019m just going to sign things or I\u2019m just going to veto things,\u201d he said at an end-of-term news conference last week. \u201cIf I believe it\u2019s in the best public-policy interest of the state, I\u2019ll sign it, and if it\u2019s not, I won\u2019t.\u201dMr. Snyder dodged questions about whether Republicans were being overzealous in their rush to cripple incoming Democrats, but suggested that lack of comity was not confined to his party. \u201cI think there\u2019s a civility issue across the board,\u201d he said, apparently taking a swipe at the crowds that have jammed the State Capitol to protest the Legislature\u2019s actions. \u201cOne of the ways people are trying to convince me why I should veto bills or be against them is to come yell at me. I\u2019m not sure that I follow the logic of it.\u201dThe governor\u2019s depiction of himself as a policy wonk who is above petty politics is vintage Snyder, but it is not without support.Michigan voters seemed to take issue with that in November, electing Democrats to the top three state offices over opponents aligned with President Trump.They also overwhelmingly approved three ballot initiatives with broad Democratic support. One legalized recreational marijuana use; two others overhauled election laws to make it easier to vote and shifted redistricting authority from the Legislature to a new nonpartisan citizens\u2019 commission.To its critics, the Legislature is essentially using the lame-duck session to settle scores with both the voters who refused to elect Republicans and the Democrats they chose.But it is the proposals to rein in executive powers that have drawn the most attention.\u201cThese guys have never not been in power. They\u2019ve had all three branches of government the whole time they\u2019ve been here,\u201d said James Ananich, a Democratic senator from Flint who is the chamber\u2019s minority leader. \u201cThey can\u2019t grasp that the things they\u2019ve been doing, most people don\u2019t like, and so there\u2019s got to be some way to protect the state from these horrible Democrats.\u201dSuch objections are na\u00efve, some Republicans say.\u201cIs it partisan? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt about that,\u201d said Robert LaBrant, a Republican strategist, who defended the constitutionality of the measures.\u201cI wish we could conduct public policy under sterile lab conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re probably back to the 1880s as far as extreme partisanship goes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meng Wanzhou Was Huawei\u2019s Professional Face, Until Her Arrest", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 As Huawei\u2019s finance chief and daughter of its founder, Meng Wanzhou has been a polished, professional face for a huge technology firm that long was opaque to the outside world.Ms. Meng, the eldest daughter of Ren Zhengfei, the leader of the telecom equipment maker, has appeared before reporters to announce the company\u2019s financial results. She has spoken at company events in New York; Canc\u00fan, Mexico; and beyond. She helped inaugurate centers in Britain, a key market for the Chinese giant\u2019s expansion into the Western world.She also sat on the board of a Huawei partner company in Hong Kong called Skycom Tech that Canadian authorities now say did business in Iran. And through that position and her job at Huawei, Ms. Meng may have personally been involved in tricking financial institutions into making transactions that violated United States sanctions against Iran, they said.Huawei has said that it is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and China\u2019s Foreign Ministry has called for her immediate release.\u201cWe have these sanctions on Iran, it runs against our policy, why shouldn\u2019t we enforce that?\u201d he said.Reuters reported several years ago that Skycom, one of Huawei\u2019s partners in that country, had tried to sell Hewlett-Packard equipment to an Iranian telecom carrier in 2010. The sale, which Huawei said was never completed, would have violated Washington\u2019s ban on exporting computer products to Iran.Huawei said at the time that its Iranian business was entirely lawful, and that it required its local partners to heed the same laws and regulations.According to Hong Kong corporate filings, Ms. Meng was a member of Skycom\u2019s board from February 2008 to April 2009.In a May 2007 filing, Skycom reported that all of the company\u2019s shares had been transferred that year to a Hong Kong company called Hua Ying Management. In August 2007, Hua Ying reported to the Hong Kong authorities that its company secretary was Ms. Meng.Ms. Meng, who started at Huawei as a secretary 25 years ago, is not its most prominent executive. But as chief financial officer, she has played a part in the company\u2019s efforts over the past five years to become more transparent about its operations. After United States lawmakers labeled Huawei and another Chinese manufacturer, ZTE, as security threats, Huawei saw openness as a way to help dispel the swirl of suspicions surrounding it.Mr. Ren, 74, was a member of the Chinese military\u2019s engineering corps for nearly a decade before starting Huawei in 1987. His military service has informed American officials\u2019 concerns that Huawei has links to the Chinese government or the Communist Party \u2014 something the company has strenuously denied.\u201cShe\u2019s very presentable,\u201d Duncan Clark, the chairman of the advisory firm BDA China, who once did consulting work for Huawei, said of Ms. Meng.That is a stark contrast with her father, Mr. Clark added. \u201cHe is, for me at least, refreshingly unpolished and direct.\u201dFor many people in China, Huawei represents how far their nation has come since it began climbing out of the economic ravages left by Chairman Mao \u2014 and how far it can continue to go.But after winning over cellular providers across the developing world with its cost-effective networking gear, the company faced a tougher task convincing large carriers in the wealthier nations of Europe and North America.For many years, Mr. Ren\u2019s reluctance to appear in public, combined with the company\u2019s aversion to the news media, even after it had become a globe-straddling giant, fed the impression that he and Huawei had something to hide. How much of the company did he own? How did key decisions get made? Could there really be a military link?\u201cWe will honor our commitment to transparency and openness,\u201d Ms. Meng said then.This year, Ms. Meng was made Huawei\u2019s deputy chairwoman in addition to finance chief, leading some to wonder whether she might succeed her father at the top someday. But hers was not an heiress\u2019s upbringing.Ms. Meng, who also uses the names Sabrina and Cathy, was born in 1972 in the western city of Chengdu, to Mr. Ren\u2019s first wife, Meng Jun. The family moved to Shenzhen, in China\u2019s south, during the turbulent economic reforms of the 1980s.Shenzhen eventually became a hub of China\u2019s mighty manufacturing base and home to Huawei\u2019s global headquarters. Back then, it was a backwater.As Ms. Meng later recalled in a Huawei employee newspaper, the walls of the family\u2019s house let in all the neighbors\u2019 chatter. The roof leaked. When it rained \u2014 which it did constantly in southern China \u2014 everything got wet.After college, Ms. Meng hoped to attend graduate school in the United States. A university gave her an offer, she recalled in a 2016 speech. But her visa was rejected because an American consular interviewer decided that her English was too poor.Ms. Meng found a job at a bank instead. She was laid off after a year. In 1993, she joined fledgling Huawei as one of its three secretaries.She answered the phone, printed out documents and put together product catalogs. A few years later, after completing a master\u2019s degree in management, she returned to Huawei, this time in the finance department. And she began climbing the ladder.As Huawei\u2019s business spread across the world in the 2000s, Ms. Meng helped expand its accounting operations with it. Her brother, Ren Ping, works for a Huawei-owned company. Annabel Yao, a daughter of the elder Mr. Ren by his second wife, is an undergraduate at Harvard.Kate Conger and Li Yuan contributed reporting, and Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Week Into Government Shutdown, Ire Turns to Fear for Federal Workers", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the government shutdown began a week ago, many federal workers were more irked than anxious.They\u2019re really anxious now. What at first seemed like ho-hum political brinkmanship is looking more like a prolonged, punishing shutdown, more akin to the 27-day funding lapse in 1995 and 1996 than the blink-and-miss-it shutdowns earlier this year.\u201cThis one feels different,\u201d said Celia Hahn, a Transportation Security Administration officer at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, who is working without pay and worried about her mortgage and her son\u2019s orthodontic expenses. \u201cIf it were to go about two weeks, that\u2019s when people would start panicking.\u201dDena Ivey, a furloughed probate specialist in the Anchorage office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, lost many of her possessions during the recent Alaska earthquake, and feels overwhelmed by the man-made disaster now afflicting her family.\u201cWe\u2019re sort of being held hostage in the middle, and we have families and obligations,\u201d said Ms. Ivey, a single mother. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to make rent.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m basically living on credit now.\u201dCharles Aitken, who works in inventory management for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is continuing to report to work in Virginia. But he is not being paid and just informed his ex-wife that he may be late with child support payments.\u201cWe have to grin and bear it,\u201d Mr. Aitken said.Steve Reaves, the president of the union that represents FEMA workers, said Friday that he was getting four or five times the number of calls he ordinarily received from his membership.\u201cThe worry\u2019s mounting, the stress is mounting,\u201d Mr. Reaves said. \u201cTheir concern is, what do we next? Where do we go from here? How are we going to make ends meet and pay our bills?\u201dMr. Reaves said he expected federal workers to begin making more drastic decisions about their financial well-being within a week or so. He would decide within two weeks whether to use some of his retirement savings.Some charitable groups are attempting to fill the breach.The nonprofit Coast Guard Mutual Assistance is helping out lower-ranking members, offering $550 to married members and $350 to single Coast Guard members who need help paying for food or overdue bills. If all 21,000 members who are eligible for the aid request it, that would cost some $12 million.\u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge for us,\u201d said Cari Thomas, a retired rear admiral and the chief executive officer of a nonprofit that is the official relief society of the Coast Guard. \u201cIt\u2019s about $150 million each pay period to pay the active duty and civilian employees of the Coast Guard, and our nonprofit does not have $150 million, as you can imagine.\u201dShe said she had been on the phone on Friday morning with a senior member of the Coast Guard, who is not eligible for the aid and was in tears, worrying about whether he would be able to pay his rent on Jan. 5.Anxieties are highest for the 800,000 federal workers furloughed or forced to work without pay. But the fear is spreading far beyond the federal work force, hitting government contractors, local governments forced to cover for furloughed sanitation and maintenance workers and organizations that feed the poor, who are dealing with a possible interruption to sources of funding and provisions.\u201cSo far we have been able to say that the sky isn\u2019t falling yet,\u201d said Joel Berg, chief executive of Hunger Free America, a national advocacy group for nonprofits that manage federal food programs for the poor. \u201cBut give it another week or two, or a month.\u201dMr. Berg said that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, would likely be fine. But other programs \u2014 including Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, which provides aid to states \u2014 could see supply-chain interruptions if the shutdown drags on.The Department of Agriculture\u2019s emergency food assistance program, which sends surplus agricultural products to food banks, and the commodity supplemental food program, which provides food to low-income seniors, are both at risk, according to Catherine Drennan, the director of communications and public affairs at the Greater Boston Food Bank.Ms. Drennan said federal officials had informed the state that those programs would be funded until February. \u201cAfter that date, we don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.The shutdown is already causing major problems at national parks despite efforts by states and private groups to offset the loss of federal funding.A pileup of trash and dirty toilets during the shutdown has drawn intense concern at Joshua Tree National Park in California. December is historically one of the park\u2019s busiest months \u2014 last year, 284,398 people visited Joshua Tree in December. Visitors are still being allowed into the park, but there are no federally funded services being provided, including maintenance.John Lauretig, the executive director of Friends of Joshua Tree, said local organizations have stepped in with toilet paper and volunteer cleaning crews to keep up with the park\u2019s maintenance.\u201cTrash and dirty bathrooms are just the start of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThose issues lead to health concerns for visitors in the park and for the wildlife, which will start eating that trash and spreading that trash.\u201dThe National Zoo, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution, has announced plans to close to visitors on Jan. 2. The zoo plans to furlough 130 of its employees, while an additional 191 involved in the care and feeding of animals are working without pay, according to officials.The zoo has enough fodder and frozen foods to last a few weeks, they said, but administrators would need to tap alternative funding sources if the impasse drags on a month or longer, said Bryan Amaral, the senior curator in charge of mammals.\u201cThis is absolutely the stupidest thing ever,\u201d said Antar Davis, 23, a former zookeeper at a private zoo who showed up in the elephant house on Friday to take one last look at Maharani, a 9,100-pound Asian elephant, before the zoo closed.Even Mr. Trump cannot entirely escape the sights, sounds and smells of the shutdown.Inside the White House, callers to the main switchboard were greeted by a message asking them to \u201cplease call back\u201d when the government reopened.Outside the gates, heaps of garbage spilled out of cans on the Ellipse, just south of the executive complex. Nearby, a trailer rented by a private philanthropic group to offset shuttered park restrooms did a brisk tourist business.A Jimi Hendrix impersonator, usually kept away by federal officials, was teeth-plucking a noisy rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d in front of the East Wing.Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington has deployed some of her work force to cover for the absence of federal maintenance workers, but said the shutdown was damaging the city\u2019s businesses.\u201cThe level of anxiety that people feel and the trickle-down impact of people not being at work intensifies the longer it happens,\u201d Ms. Bowser said in an interview on Friday.Still, there was little sense of urgency to quickly resolve the stalemate. House Democrats are still flatly refusing to finance the president\u2019s proposed border wall with Mexico, and have little incentive to make a deal before assuming the majority next week.If the uncertainty gives politicians leverage, it gives federal workers and their families a sense of insecurity at the worst possible time.\u201cWe spent money on Christmas and all that thinking that we were going to have a paycheck on the first, and now we were told today that it\u2019s official, we\u2019re not getting one,\u201d said Britaini Armitage, 30, whose husband is a gunner\u2019s mate in the Coast Guard and is deployed in the Middle East.Alan Blinder, Jose A.

{"Headline": "Lottery-Like Prizes Coax Savings. What\u2019s the Risk in Expanding Them?", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewPopular though they may be, lotteries, with their billion-dollar jackpots, come uncomfortably close to being taxes on those who can least afford them.But protecting people by ending lotteries isn\u2019t a practical solution: If anything, gambling and state-run lotteries are growing enterprises in the United States and many other countries.Therefore, it may be time to focus more attention on the ways that some lotteries have already been transformed into something that truly benefits ticket-buyers: by nudging people to save more or, even, to engage in safer sex.While the state lotteries in the United States don\u2019t achieve those particular goals, they already do some good. Roughly 40 percent of the lottery income is used to finance education, environmental protection and other causes.But the state lotteries pay out only about 60 cents on the dollar in prize money, much less than slot machines in Las Vegas. This means that playing the lottery regularly can be a huge drain on personal resources.The lottery experience may be so much fun that it seems to be worth the expense. But it\u2019s quite possible that lotteries are taking advantage of psychological biases like a common tendency to overestimate the slim odds of hitting the jackpot.Nonsavers might start saving if they were offered something more exciting than an account with standard steady interest payments. How about an account that offers randomly chosen prizes? Prize-linked savings, as this approach is known, dates back to the late 1600s in Britain.We can get a preview of what we might see from South Africa, where a commercial bank in 2005 introduced a Million-a-Month Account \u2014 so named because if offered people with savings accounts a top prize in a monthly drawing of 1 million South African rand, then the equivalent of about $167,000.Unlike state lotteries, most prize-linked savings accounts are actuarially fair, meaning that the average payment through prizes is the same as with a typical interest-bearing account. If you put $1,000 in a regular savings account, for example, you might earn about $15 in steady interest payments over a year. If you instead used an account with a lottery feature, you might get steady payments that amount to only $10, but you also have a one-in-a-thousand chance of winning a $5,000 prize. On average, the payments for the two accounts are the same. (You might also have a one-in-a-thousand chance of a $500 prize and the chance to win several other smaller but still substantial prizes.)In other words, the lottery feature in this case is not making people systematically worse off, though the outcomes will differ among individuals, because some will win while many others will lose.Because of this feature, among others, using lotteries to coax people to save is not completely free of the ethical concerns that cast a shadow over state lotteries. For one thing, gamifying savings appears to work simply because it makes saving more fun. But people attracted by the chance winning of a life-changing prize might overestimate their odds. Like standard lotteries, prize-linked savings accounts would then be exploiting people\u2019s biases. That cost needs to be weighed against the benefit of nudging people to save more.A promising finding in South Africa is that the inflow of money into prize-linked savings accounts came partly from people cutting back their purchases of national lottery tickets. Putting money in a savings account may be a far more socially beneficial way of scratching the itch to gamble than buying lottery tickets.Lotteries have also been used to reduce the spread of H.I.V. in Lesotho, in southern Africa. Because lottery tickets appeal especially to risk-takers, they tend to be attractive to people who engage in risky sexual activity, researchers have found.To encourage safer sex, the research team designed a program that rewarded people who tested negative for two sexually transmitted diseases. The payout was made in the form of a lottery, in the hope of adding suspense and excitement, enticing more participants to forgo risky sex. In fact, the researchers found that H.I.V. infections dropped the most among people who tended to be financial risk-takers. The prizes were not life-changing: Staying H.I.V.-negative was the real jackpot.In South Africa, for people whose savings accounts have grown because they sought lottery winnings, the big prize has been financial well-being. It may not be $1 billion, but it\u2019s worth quite a lot.Advertisement"}

Wanted: A new White House chief of staff. That leaves the White House in another chaotic staffing scramble. According to one study, turnover among senior staff is at 62 percent, far higher than at the same point in the administrations of President Obama (24 percent) and George W. Bush (33 percent).Among the possible successors in the role are Representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican; the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin; Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney; and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer.__________The S&P 500 ended 0.18 percent higher, after having dropped more than 1.5 percent. Markets in Europe and Asia ended their trading sessions lower._____Although she appears to have the authority to unilaterally postpone the vote, there was opposition to such a move \u2014 adding yet more uncertainty to the process._____Over the last two years, the U.S. has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars and dozens of law enforcement and military personnel to fighting gangs like MS-13 that send so many Salvadorans fleeing to the U.S. border. Above, a gang tattoo.The goal is to create a self-sufficient Salvadoran justice system. But the consequences of the effort are difficult to assess.And President Trump\u2019s fiery rhetoric and threats to walk away \u2014 including claims that most Salvadoran immigrants are gang members in disguise \u2014 have at times endangered his administration\u2019s diplomacy in a region where American involvement has long been viewed with suspicion._____At a panel discussion, President Trump\u2019s energy and climate adviser said it was in the world\u2019s interest to find more efficient ways to develop and burn those fuels. The panel was interrupted by protesters chanting \u201cShame on you\u201d and \u201cKeep it in the ground!\u201d Above, a protester outside the meeting.But there are signs that the administration has gained some powerful allies. On the panel, Australia\u2019s representative expressed agreement. And the U.S. was joined by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in withholding support for a report on cutting global fossil-fuel emissions._____Ocean temperatures surged in 2016 around the Great Barrier Reef, causing severe damage. But researchers found that the corals that survived were more heat-tolerant, and were able to survive a period of extreme warmth the following year.\u201cIt\u2019s one enormous natural selection event,\u201d said one researcher.__________One recent study showed that male children of abused Civil War prisoners were more likely to die than their peers were in any given year after middle age. Another showed a link between famine in one generation and body mass in the next. Above, doctors in Annapolis, Md., examining a Civil War prisoner of war.But many scientists aren\u2019t so sure.\u201cThese are, in fact, extraordinary claims, and they are being advanced on less than ordinary evidence,\u201d one said._____A study on children\u2019s use of electronic devices, featured on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d over the weekend, is sure to alarm parents.Early results from research financed by the National Institutes of Health seem to show that heavy screen use is associated with lower scores on some aptitude tests, and with accelerated \u201ccortical thinning\u201d \u2014 a natural process \u2014 in some children.

{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Economic Crisis Drags Down the Middle Class Almost Overnight", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Less than a year ago, he was running a thriving computer accessories business, driving a new car and renting a comfortable two-bedroom apartment in the center of Tehran. But last month, Kaveh Taymouri found himself riding a rusty motorcycle on his hourlong commute to his family\u2019s new lodgings, a 485-square-foot apartment in one of the city\u2019s worst neighborhoods, next to its sprawling cemetery.When he arrived home one recent night at 10:30 from his new job at an arcade, there was no food on the stove. The sandwich he had for lunch would have to do.Nevertheless, his wife and former business partner, Reihaneh, said she thought his mood was improving.\u201cAt least he has stopped screaming in his sleep,\u201d she said.Before their \u201cdownfall,\u201d as they call it, the Taymouris were the model middle-class Iranian family, prosperous college-educated business owners who made enough money to save for a down payment on their own home. Now, they are a model for a different sort: the millions of middle-class Iranians who almost overnight have seen their lives shrink, dragged down by economic forces beyond their control.Iran\u2019s economy is in a shambles, savaged by years of mismanagement and renewed economic sanctions.The government has expanded the money supply by more than 30 percent annually for more than a decade, using the extra cash to cover budget deficits and other expenses. In the United States, by comparison, a broad measure of the money supply has increased by an annual average of 6.4 percent over the last decade, according to the Federal Reserve.As a result of Iran\u2019s rapid expansion of the money supply, says Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a professor of economics at Virginia Tech University, inflation has exploded and by official figures is now running at an annual rate of 35 percent, compared with below 10 percent a year ago.President Trump\u2019s decision to leave the nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A., and to reimpose harsh economic sanctions prompted the other major economic disaster to befall Iran: a collapse in its currency, Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said. The rial lost about 70 percent against the dollar before strengthening recently, but its rates are still fluctuating heavily.\u201cThe withdrawal busted the expectations for an economic boom created by the J.C.P.O.A. and Iran\u2019s return to the global economy, which was expected to boost oil exports and foreign investment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reversal caused people to convert their rials into other assets, mainly dollars and gold.\u201dBy raising the cost of imports, the currency collapse has reinforced the inflationary surge and decimated small businesses that, like the Taymouris\u2019, rely on imported goods.Mr. Taymouri, saying it was best to let his money \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 do the talking, sat down and calculated the financial calamity that had befallen the family in the past year. Their monthly income fell from 50 million rials, or about $1,400, a year ago to 10 million rials, or $90, at the current heavily devalued rate.\u201cIf someone had ever told me I would one day live like this, I would\u2019ve laughed,\u201d Mr. Taymouri said bitterly, before falling silent. Finally, his wife spoke.\u201cI\u2019m not really that sad, because we are not alone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening to so many people.\u201dMr. Taymouri attributed the fall in the currency to speculators as well as the government \u201cfor just having stood by.\u201d Others blame Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s really because of Trump,\u201d said Nasim Marashi, the 29-year-old author of a best-selling book, \u201cAutumn Is the Last Season.\u201d The book, on the lives of three middle-class young women in Tehran, has had 35 print runs in four years. \u201cHe left the nuclear agreement, not Iran.\u201dIran, with a population of about 80 million, has long had a large and thriving middle class, covering roughly everyone from bus drivers to lawyers and doctors, and earning an average of $700 a month in local currency, according to government officials. That income was frequently padded by unreported side businesses in the country\u2019s large black market and government subsidies that lowered the cost of utilities, food and gasoline.Politically quite influential, Iran\u2019s middle class has consistently favored candidates like the current president, Hassan Rouhani, who support better relations with the West. But seldom have they been under as much economic pressure as they are today. Recently at least two people have been hanged after they were convicted in highly publicized trials for manipulating markets.In a sign that the government is taking the issue seriously, Mr. Rouhani introduced his administration\u2019s budget on Tuesday, and it included more support for state employees and more subsidies on basic goods.Not all have suffered as much as the Taymouris, whose business was so vulnerable to the currency collapse. But Abbas Torkan, a former adviser to Mr. Rouhani, said recently that the middle class had shrunk by 50 percent.Even for those in higher income ranges, the difficult times have meant a sudden lifestyle change.Royalties checks for Ms. Marashi\u2019s book dropped from 120 million rials a month to 20 million rials recently, she said. \u201cBooks aren\u2019t a necessity.\u201dOutwardly, Tehran looks every bit the bustling metropolis it has been. New restaurants are still opening. An Iranian theater version of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d sells out every night for 3,500 people who pay the equivalent of $16 a person. But cracks are appearing.In supermarkets, where the cost of Red Bull, for example, has quadrupled, people can be seen carefully studying the prices. Some imported products, like Purina pet food, have vanished entirely.Along Tehran\u2019s high-end shopping district on Jordan Street, stores selling Western brands are shutting down. Rent increases are pushing people out of their longtime neighborhoods, and plane tickets to Europe now often cost two months\u2019 salary.The pain many people are feeling may just be the start, said Faezeh Forouzan, an Iranian economist. \u201cFor the short term, those better off in the middle class will respond by changing their lifestyle, eliminating luxuries and excess,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the future, all will suffer as a result of a lack of investment in creating jobs.\u201dFor the Taymouris, the pain was seemingly instantaneous. They met five years ago at work, and between stealing kisses by the copy machine, they figured out they could make more money with their own business selling computer accessories.From their shop in the center of Tehran, the couple would buy keyboards, cables and other computer accessories from wholesalers. Ms. Taymouri would then resell them in the provinces, while her husband took care of the shop and short-term financing for the business.A son was born, and just weeks before everything came crashing down, they happily informed their parents that they were expecting a second child.But in January, the rial began to slide, and goods like the Taymouris\u2019 accessories that were priced in dollars and euros rapidly became unaffordable for most Iranians. Ms. Taymouri\u2019s phone stopped ringing, and sales orders dried up.A Western Digital hard disk still costs around the equivalent of $90 in Iran, but in the local currency it soared to 18 million rials from 3 million, Ms. Taymouri said. \u201cWhen your customers make only twice that a month,\u201d she added, \u201cyou can understand how our sales went down to zero.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Taymouri was getting plenty of calls \u2014 from the wholesalers he had bought accessories from on credit.\u201cThey were asking for their money, but clients in the provinces weren\u2019t paying us back and we were not selling anything,\u201d he said.One night, Ms. Taymouri said, \u201che just came home, dropped on the couch and said, \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019\u201dIn a country that still puts debtors in jail, the Taymouris had no choice but to make good on their debts. They sold the car, their furniture and the carpets they had been given as wedding presents.Mr. Taymouri sold the shop to the arcade man on the condition that he could work there. Then they moved to their current apartment, which has a communal shower in the hallway.\u201cWe don\u2019t like it here,\u201d he said, gesturing to the cemetery, one of the largest in the world. \u201cWe had been planning to move uptown, not next to the dead.\u201dMr. Taymouri brought out his infant daughter, Anita, from the tiny bedroom, and his wife started crying.\u201cI was just pregnant when everything suddenly turned upside down in our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cI admit that I thought of having an abortion. But despite all of this, I\u2019m so happy we have her now.\u201dEven Iranians in the upper strata of the middle class, like Ms. Marashi, are feeling the pinch. Malmal, her white Persian cat, played in the background as Ms. Marashi\u2019s husband, a filmmaker, rummaged in the refrigerator.\u201cWe are very lucky that we bought this house last year,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, we would never be able to afford it.\u201dIn her book, the three main characters face setbacks after the anti-government protests of 2009. One gets fired from her job as a reporter, the other becomes depressed about society and the third dreams of emigration but cannot get a visa.\u201cHad I written the book now, there would be no reference to visas, as going abroad has become too expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting fired as a journalist is still possible, but more so because paper has gotten too expensive and publications are closing.\u201dThe couple had been planning a European tour around an award she had won in Italy, but a ticket now costs more than she makes in two months, she said. \u201cSo we canceled.\u201dStill, Ms. Marashi said things could be worse, thinking of people who lived through the 1980s war with Iraq.\u201cWe have had much harder times,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a best-selling author in Iran. She is Nasim Marashi, not Narsin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nissan and Renault Face Leadership Crisis After C.E.O. Is Jailed", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring the nearly two decades he dominated the alliance of Renault and Nissan, Carlos Ghosn achieved something of a miracle in the auto world. He managed to get the French and Japanese companies to act as one entity so both could prosper in an industry where scale is everything.Now that Mr. Ghosn is in a Tokyo jail, and both he and Nissan face criminal charges of illegally underreporting his income, the flaws in that structure have become obvious.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s fall has left the unlikely Franco-Japanese union in limbo and revealed how much of its success revolved around his forceful personality. Mr. Ghosn was invested with more powers and ruled far longer than is typical for large, publicly traded corporations.Mr. Ghosn had not cultivated a clear successor, and that leaves the alliance\u2019s survival in doubt: Neither Nissan nor Renault has a plan for preserving the arrangement that has been a juggernaut, accounting for sales of 10.6 million autos last year. Nissan decided to investigate Mr. Ghosn without giving Renault a heads-up.\u201cThey need a leader,\u201d said Christopher Richter, deputy head of Japan research at CLSA, an investment and brokerage group. \u201cThe alliance is in a crisis right now and there are hard decisions that need to be made.\u201dNissan\u2019s board will meet on Monday to appoint a replacement for Mr. Ghosn, who had already been removed as chairman, according to a person with knowledge of Nissan\u2019s internal investigation. At some point after that, it will set a date for a shareholders meeting to vote to remove Mr. Ghosn from the board altogether. The board is also expected to propose a shareholders resolution to remove Greg Kelly, a former Nissan human resources manager who was arrested with Mr. Ghosn, the person said.Renault has stuck by Mr. Ghosn amid tensions between it and Nissan. The Renault board said on Thursday that an internal inqurity into Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation had uncovered no irregularities, and that he would remain chief executive.Renault said its lawyers would review information recently handed over by Nissan related to the allegations against Mr. Ghosn, but that the French carmaker still did not \u201chave information concerning Carlos Ghosn\u2019s defense.\u201dAccording to the person with knowledge of the investigation, Nissan and Renault are discussing a separate, independent inquiry into the activities of Renault-Nissan BV, the entity in the Netherlands that oversaw the alliance, and whether Mr. Ghosn wrongly used it as a vehicle for a deferred-compensation plan.That investigation could complicate efforts to fill the alliance\u2019s leadership vacuum. A spokesman for the alliance declined to comment.Nissan is deeply entangled in the Ghosn inquiry in Japan. It alerted prosecutors to possible wrongdoing by Mr. Ghosn based on allegations from a whistle-blower. This week it found itself charged with violating financial laws with Mr. Ghosn. The Tokyo Stock Exchange last month opened its own investigation into Nissan, examining its internal management controls and securities filings.Since the arrest in November, Nissan\u2019s stock has slipped close to 9 percent.\u201cWhat is actually happening now is the worst case of all messes,\u201d said Nicholas Benes, a representative director at the Board Director Training Institute of Japan, a nonprofit organization specializing in corporate governance. \u201cThe company has been indicted and has the scarlet letter of criminal stamped on its forehead. Who\u2019s thinking about shareholders here?\u201dThe Renault-Nissan Alliance, which since 2016 has also included Mitsubishi Motors, was studied at business schools as a unique example of how to achieve many of the benefits of a merger without the complications of actually merging.As Mr. Ghosn\u2019s star rose, he took on a more active public and social life, attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and making speeches and appearances at a variety of conferences. He spent less time on site at Nissan and Renault factories and relied more on senior managers to fix problems.Yet there were tensions. Renault is Nissan\u2019s largest shareholder, with 43 percent of the shares. Renault shareholders have long complained that Nissan lacked adequate governance procedures and independent directors who could question decisions, said Pierre-Henri Leroy, the head of Proxinvest, a French shareholder advisory group.Renault\u2019s board and shareholders for years sought to rein in executive compensation, a task that was influenced by the French government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault.\u201cMr. Ghosn was more surveilled in France. We were always on his back,\u201d said Mr. Leroy, whose advisory group frequently criticized Mr. Ghosn\u2019s efforts to raise his own pay. \u201cThey weren\u2019t on his back in Japan.\u201dRenault\u2019s dominance of Nissan allowed Mr. Ghosn to increase power, a point that Hiroto Saikawa, the Nissan chief executive, complained about publicly after Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest.Potential successors at Renault fell by the wayside over the years, a sore point in France for Renault shareholders. In 2011, Patrick Pelata, Renault\u2019s chief operating officer and a close adviser to Mr. Ghosn who was widely viewed as a potential successor, left the company after a political storm over Mr. Ghosn\u2019s handling of an internal industrial espionage case.Two years later, Carlos Tavares, the chief operating officer at Renault who was also considered a successor, stepped down after he told Bloomberg News in an interview that it wasn\u2019t possible for him to advance with Mr. Ghosn there. Mr. Tavares went to PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars and a Renault rival.\u201cThe succession line was not seriously managed at Renault,\u201d said Mr. Leroy, the shareholder activist. \u201cFor years we were worrying that Mr. Ghosn would take the opportunity to entrench himself in Renault, Nissan and the entire thing, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201dIn retrospect Renault-Nissan suffered from what is known in business school jargon as a \u201ckey person problem,\u201d said Christoph Schalast, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer in Frankfurt who also teaches at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.\u201cEverything depends on one key person,\u201d Mr. Schalast said.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s power and unusually long tenure may have prevented the alliance from evolving as Nissan became by far the bigger and more profitable partner, yet Renault exercised more control, a situation that some in Nissan grew to resent, according to interviews with three former Nissan employees.Now that the Ghosn era appears to be ending, Mr. Schalast said, Nissan and Renault \u201cshould establish a new, more cooperative management team which is not dependent on one person.\u201dAccording to the plan, almost all of the vehicles produced by Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi would be based on four so-called platforms, combinations of chassis, engines and transmissions that are largely invisible to consumers. Two-thirds of the vehicles would use common engines, up from one-third in 2016. Sales would rise to 14 million vehicles a year by 2022 from 10.6 million in 2017.While Mr. Ghosn insisted that the companies would retain their autonomy, the debate continued. If Nissan provided damaging information about Mr. Ghosn to prosecutors as part of an effort to dethrone him \u2014 as many Ghosn sympathizers believe \u2014 it backfired badly.With Mr. Ghosn in jail, the most complicated problem for the alliance is that it simply has no leader.\u201cYou have major technological change coming that threatens and is really an existential crisis for any automaker out there,\u201d Mr. Richter of CSLA said. \u201cWhile these two companies are fiddling over who should run it or who is feeling aggrieved or all these petty differences, Rome is burning.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, Motoko Rich from Tokyo and Liz Alderman from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Doug Jones \u2018Outraged\u2019 by Russian-Style Tactics Used in His Senate Race", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Doug Jones of Alabama on Thursday said he was \u201coutraged\u201d to learn of deceptive online operations used by fellow Democrats to assist his election last year, and called for a federal investigation into the matter.\u201cWe have focused so much on Russia that we haven\u2019t focused on the fact that people in this country could take the same playbook and do the same damn thing,\u201d Mr. Jones said.He called on the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department to examine whether the episode violated any laws and, if it did, to prosecute those responsible. Officials need \u201cto let people know that this is not acceptable in the United States of America,\u201d he said in a statement.The Times reported that the secret project used deceptive social media practices in the Alabama Senate election a year ago to boost Mr. Jones and damage his Republican opponent, Roy S. Moore. The effort included the creation of a Facebook page designed to look like the work of conservative Alabamians, as well as what an internal report called a false-flag operation to make it appear as if an army of Russian accounts were following Mr. Moore on Twitter.There is no evidence that Mr. Jones, his campaign or Democratic Party officials encouraged or even knew about the small-scale effort.Mr. Moore, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and a conservative Christian, said the meddling was a sign of moral decline. \u201cThe immorality of our society has seeped into our political system to corrupt our election process, threaten democracy and destroy our country,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly an appeal to God and our Constitution can preserve our republic.\u201dA social media expert involved in the project, Jonathon Morgan, said in a statement that it was designed to \u201cbetter understand and report on the tactics and effects of social media disinformation,\u201d not to influence the election. But the internal report portrayed it differently \u2014 as an aggressive effort to divide conservatives, suppress Republican turnout and drive Democrats to the polls.The effort, financed by Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, is unlikely to have had a significant effect on the outcome, given its modest budget. It cost $100,000, out of $51 million spent on the entire race, including the primaries.But Mr. Moore seized on the disclosure to suggest that perhaps it did have an impact, saying the Times article amounted to proof of \u201csomething we\u2019ve always known: A lot of people and a lot of money went into a gigantic effort to allow a radical liberal Democrat to steal Alabama\u2019s Senate seat.\u201dThe revelation that tech-savvy Democrats had used fakery in the race was galling for fellow party members, who have been vocal in denouncing such tactics when they were used by Russia to boost President Trump\u2019s election campaign.\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been warning of for months,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee has been critical of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms for failing to guard against misuse.\u201cThe threat these tactics pose to our democracy are not uniquely Russian, which is why it is imperative that the companies get a handle on the problem now and not later,\u201d Mr. Warner said.On Thursday, Alabama\u2019s chief elections regulator said he had warned Facebook and Twitter last year that he believed there was sustained interference under way from boosters of both Mr. Jones and Mr. Moore, though he thought the candidates were not themselves involved in it.\u201cWe were asking for help,\u201d Alabama\u2019s secretary of state, John H. Merrill, a Republican, said in an interview. \u201cIt was clear to us that this was being done intentionally by certain parties to mislead candidates and mislead candidates\u2019 supporters.\u201dMr. Merrill said he had become particularly alarmed after a wave of bots followed Twitter accounts connected to Alabama politicians and their campaigns.Part of the appeal of online machinations is that they cost so little, said Wendy R. Weiser, the director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\u201cI am certainly very worried that the tactics that were used by the Russians are going to be repeated and used by others in 2020 and beyond,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re going to see an escalation.\u201dMiles Rapoport, a senior fellow in American democracy at Harvard Kennedy School, said he feared that online deception could degrade the political process. To defend against it, he said, greater skepticism will be required.\u201cCampaigns and voters and citizens now will need to factor in: Where is this information coming from? Who\u2019s generating it? Can I believe it?\u201d Mr. Rapoport said.Attempts to regulate the kind of the tactics used in Alabama could run into constitutional barriers, according to Richard L. Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law who specializes in election law.\u201cWe generally don\u2019t have laws \u2014 and the First Amendment prevents us from having laws \u2014 that prohibit candidates from lying,\u201d he said.A requirement for more detailed reporting of what is often vaguely recorded as \u201conline services\u201d might help, at least for activities carried out by an official campaign, he said. But he is not holding out hope for 2020.\u201cIt\u2019s not as though this Congress \u2014 and this president \u2014 is going to pass any kind of campaign-related regulation that would have teeth in it,\u201d Mr. Hasen said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Efforts to End Democracy", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis group will not willingly cede its power. Opinion ColumnistDo not believe that we are still living in a functioning democracy. We are not. Republicans across this country are doing everything they can to impede, alter and override the power of the personal vote. This strikes at the very heart of democracy, both undermining people\u2019s faith in it and contorting it until it no long resembles what it claims to be.\u201cAfter hours of mysterious closed-door meetings that went past midnight, the Wisconsin Senate convened at 4:30 on Wednesday morning and passed by one vote a package of bills devised to curb the powers of the incoming Democratic leaders.\u201dAltering the structure of power in a state to limit the influence of an incoming executive of an opposing party wasn\u2019t something I thought I\u2019d ever see in America, but unfortunately this isn\u2019t even the first time we\u2019ve seen it. This is not the first time Republicans have done it.Republican anti-democratic tendencies aren\u2019t limited to the transfer of power. They extend to areas like the widespread efforts to enact voter suppression, from voter ID laws to voter roll purges to shortening early-voting windows to gerrymandering.We found that between 2014 and 2016, states removed almost 16 million voters from the rolls, and every state in the country can and should do more to protect voters from improper purges. Almost 4 million more names were purged from the rolls between 2014 and 2016 than between 2006 and 2008. This growth in the number of removed voters represented an increase of 33 percent \u2014 far outstripping growth in both total registered voters (18 percent) and total population (6 percent).But many people have the same name, which poses a problem for the database. That problem is heightened for minority voters because, as the report says, \u201cAfrican-American, Asian-American, and Latino voters are much more likely than Caucasians to have one of the most common 100 last names in the United States.\u201dEven our current immigration debate is far more about future voters than about safety or criminals or the other canards Republicans typically use to oppose it.That is why immigration is such a burning issue on the right and why Donald Trump is able to exploit it: Immigration, both legal and illegal, represents a loss of political power for Republicans.When the diversity lottery first started in fiscal year 1995, citizens of European countries, including those that were part of the former Soviet Union, received the largest number of diversity visas (about 24,000). In fiscal 2017, which ended Sept. 30, the largest number of visas went to citizens of African countries (about 19,000), while applicants from European countries (nearly 21,000) and from Asia (almost 8,000) received fewer visas.Republican power is increasingly synonymous with white power. The party\u2019s nationalist tendencies are increasingly synonymous with white nationalism.This group will not willingly cede its power just because demographics predict its downfall and current circumstances demonstrate its weaknesses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Conservative Magazine May Pay a Price for Being Unfriendly to Trump", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorThe Weekly Standard didn\u2019t go along, and now its future is in danger.Other conservative magazines, websites and news empires have thrived since President Trump took office by cheering him on or, at least, playing down his faults.The magazine\u2019s billionaire owner, Philip F. Anschutz, bought into the plan \u2014 or so it seemed \u2014 and its editor in chief, Stephen F. Hayes, set out to increase the size of the staff by a third. He also banned alt-right-style, partisan clickbait stories and encouraged investigative and feature reporting that often put the magazine on the wrong side of Mr. Trump and his allies.That experiment may have now run its course. And the outcome has called into question whether the conservative media world can abide journalism that questions the new orthodoxy.Under Mr. Hayes\u2019s leadership, The Weekly Standard did not see itself as part of the home team. Unlike some other conservative outlets, it did not, for instance, shift its longtime free-market views so that they were suddenly aligned with the president\u2019s strategy of imposing trade tariffs. The magazine did not nod in agreement at a notion, newly popular in right-wing circles, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is part of a nefarious \u201cdeep state.\u201dAt the same time, the company announced it was seeking to expand The Washington Examiner, a conservative publication that is far friendlier to the president than The Weekly Standard.People familiar with the relationship between The Weekly Standard and its parent company told me that it had deteriorated in recent months.Things got so bad that, at one point, the two sides discussed parting ways after hitting an impasse over The Standard\u2019s request for more autonomy, and Clarity Media suggested a sale. The magazine\u2019s leadership team worked up a plan to find a buyer, floating the idea to various venture capitalists and investors last spring. But Clarity ultimately decided against it, these people said.They say there were a variety of factors at play, including the magazine\u2019s commitment to cultural coverage and its refusal to engage in traffic-driving clickbait. But it also had to do with its often critical coverage of Mr. Trump and other Republicans, as well as the \u201cNever Trump\u201d stance of the magazine\u2019s co-founder William Kristol as he made the rounds on cable television \u2014 at times raising hackles at the home office.Pro-Trump coverage is to conservative media what anti-Trump coverage is to liberal media \u2014 a great driver of internet traffic and ratings. The Standard team told potential investors that while it suffered some print subscription losses \u2014 down 7,000, or nearly 10 percent, since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Politico reported \u2014 its online subscriptions were up and it had more than doubled its online traffic.Clarity would not comment beyond its initial statement.Mr. Kristol started the magazine in 1995 with Fred Barnes and John Podhoretz, with financing from Rupert Murdoch, who sold to Mr. Anschutz, the owner of Clarity Media, in 2009.The Weekly Standard came to define the \u201cneocon\u201d stance of the Bush era. Its role in making the case for the Iraq war placed it in a camp that had little in common with the views of the more isolationist Mr. Trump, who positioned himself during the 2016 campaign as an anti-interventionist opposed to the Iraq war.And on election night, Representative Steve King of Iowa barred a Standard reporter from his victory reception because of its report that he had referred to immigrants as \u201cdirt\u201d during his campaign.On Wednesday, I caught up with Mr. Kristol, who is now an editor at large, handing the day-to-day operation over to Mr. Hayes a couple of years ago.He wouldn\u2019t comment on the internal back and forth, but he indicated he still wasn\u2019t sure the magazine was a goner. And he said there was still room in conservative media for Trump-critical voices.\u201cI\u2019m obviously very proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished over 23 years, but there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m prouder of than the last two years, under Steve\u2019s leadership, in making the case for a conservatism that stands apart from the current disfigurement of conservatism,\u201d Mr. Kristol said. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely committed to keeping the voice of The Weekly Standard alive in its current form with its current ownership, or under different auspices, or maybe in a somewhat different way.\u201dThe threat to The Weekly Standard drew an outcry from some conservative commentators.In an interview on Wednesday morning, Charlie Sykes, the conservative radio host and a contributing editor at The Weekly Standard, said he wasn\u2019t sure exactly why Clarity Media was weighing the magazine\u2019s future.\u201cI have argued for some time that it\u2019s very difficult to craft a business model for non-Trump media these days,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think a lot of people on the right think of conservative media as a safe space for them. There\u2019s a great deal of resentment for conservatives who are going to push back against Trump and Trumpism.\u201dThe Weekly Standard staff may find out its fate next week, after a planned meeting between its leadership team and Clarity Media executives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Nicaragua, Ortega Was on the Ropes. Now, He Has Protesters on the Run.", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAGUA, Nicaragua \u2014 A life on the run was not one any of these Nicaraguans ever intended.But many people in this desperately poor Central American nation now live in a bleak new reality. They have exchanged their routine lives as lawyers, engineering majors, radio broadcasters and merchants for one of ever-changing safe houses, encrypted messaging apps and pseudonyms.\u201cThey are hunting us like deer,\u201d said Roberto Carlos Membre\u00f1o Brice\u00f1o, 31,who fled Nicaragua this year after he said a photograph of him at a protest began circulating. He now lives in hiding on a ranch in Costa Rica with 50 strangers, including a ballet dancer who goes by code name \u201cThe Eagle.\u201dInstead, convinced that he was facing an attempted coup by well-financed political parties, Mr. Ortega responded with an increasingly brutal and repressive strategy to quell the opposition movement and has tightened his grip on his power.Now, nearly 40 years after the leftist Sandinista Front led by Mr. Ortega ousted the Somoza dynasty that had ruled Nicaragua for decades, he is accused of becoming the very dictator he helped depose all those years ago.The 73-year-old Mr. Ortega and his wife, 67, control virtually every aspect of government, including the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, the armed forces, the judiciary, the police and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The many Ortega adult children manage everything from gasoline distribution to television stations.Hundreds of civilians who never picked up a weapon or lit a match have been charged with terrorism-related crimes under a new law that broadened the definition of terrorism.In the past few days alone, the government shut down a popular television station, jailed its news director and expelled international human rights observers. Private gas stations that had participated in strikes were shuttered. The police raided the offices of the country\u2019s leading human rights organization and seized its computers.\u201cOur field work demonstrated that crimes against humanity are underway,\u201d said Paulo Abr\u00e3o, the executive secretary of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, who was among the international monitors expelled from the country on Thursday.While Mr. Ortega\u2019s crackdown has managed to silence the dissent for now, mounting international pressure and a plummeting economy \u2014 marked by the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs since the uprising began \u2014 could pose significant challenges to his power over the months ahead.Last week, President Trump signed the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act, or Nica Act, a law aimed at crippling Mr. Ortega\u2019s presidency economically by cutting off lending from international development banks.Those in the opposition fear that this tightening economic noose could result in increasingly desperate acts as Mr. Ortega fights for his political life.Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a journalist whose newsroom was raided and padlocked by the police this month, said he was \u201cabsolutely convinced that this movement is irreversible,\u201d referring to the push to oust the Ortega government. \u201cBut what worries me is: How many people is Ortega going to kill before the police say, \u2018We can\u2019t keep killing people?\u2019\u201dWhen the older people who would see their pensions reduced picketed in Managua, the capital, pro-government mobs attacked them. The college students who rushed to support the protesters were assaulted, and some were killed.\u201cThey didn\u2019t come to injure us,\u201d said a former college student who goes by the name \u201cLa China\u201d and now lives in hiding. \u201cThey came to kill us.\u201dThe surge of social unrest quickly spread to other cities as the social security measure became an unexpected detonator of a monthslong campaign to end Mr. Ortega\u2019s rule. He returned to the presidency in 2007, after heading the country from 1979 to 1990.University students took over college campuses, and masked residents armed with homemade mortars and other weapons set up road blocks around the country that paralyzed commerce. Some protesters set fire to government buildings and burned cars, while the police responded with deadly force against even unarmed groups of protesters, human rights observers say.Officially, the organization no longer exists: The National Assembly eliminated the legal status for her group and six others accused of financing or plotting a coup.\u201cWe are all terrorists, according to them,\u201d said Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 80.Ms. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a former Sandinista who was held as a political prisoner in 1970s, said the repression Nicaraguans are experiencing today was far worse than anything the Somozas did. Her organization took reports from activists who said they had been sexually assaulted with bayonets. In the first days after the protests, men were stripped naked and tortured, and were then released barefoot with shaved heads.Rallies now require a permit, which no antigovernment group receives. People are afraid to carry the flag or sing the national anthem for fear of being viewed as a subversive.Experts estimate that 60,000 people have fled, with more than 23,000 of them seeking refugee protection in Costa Rica.On Thursday, before the O.A.S. observers released their investigative report, the government kicked them out, saying they were operating under the direction of the Trump administration.\u201cDespite much evidence of the violent nature of the supposed peaceful protests, the existence of police and citizens who were assassinated with high-caliber fire arms, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights characterized said protests as peaceful,\u201d said Denis Moncada Colindres, Nicaragua\u2019s foreign minister, reading from a statement.The Ortega administration channels all media requests through the office of the vice president, which did not respond to repeated requests for interviews. In past communiqu\u00e9s, Ms. Murillo described the protesters as petty criminals and gang members who were financed by right-wing political parties.The O.A.S. observers found that of the 109 killings that took place in the first six weeks of the uprising, only nine criminal cases were opened. Six of those were related to Sandinistas killed in the violence.Of the 109 dead, 95 were shot in the head, neck and thorax, which suggested extrajudicial executions. Mobs of men in civilian clothes clearly worked in concert with the police, the investigators said.At least 1,400 people were hurt, and the number is probably far higher because most people were too afraid to go to public hospitals, where doctors were fired for treating wounded protesters, investigators said.An analysis of videos posted on social media showed that the government went from using tear gas to rubber bullets, then real bullets and finally military firepower like assault rifles and grenade launchers.The country\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office seemed uninterested in investigating and unaware that prosecutors should be independent of the president\u2019s office, said Claudia Paz y Paz, a former Guatemalan attorney general who was among the experts. \u201cWhere were the prosecutors?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere were they?\u201dA group of former college students, now expelled and living in hiding, said that while they acknowledged that the government had succeeded in crushing the protests, the activists continue small activities like singing the national anthem in public, or setting a tire on fire and fleeing.One safe house visited in Managua was occupied by seven former college students, who passed the time playing Monopoly when they were not glued to their phones in search of updates about recent arrests of their fellow activists. Some have been there for months, without ever going outside.At a house of Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica, dozens of the activists slept on mats on the floor separated by curtains. The protesters vowed not to get too comfortable there: Their fight, they said, remains at home.\u201cWe are in a phase now where massive events cannot be done,\u201d said a student who goes by the name of \u201cJos\u00e9\u201d because he fears that his family will be targeted. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s over? It\u2019s not over. It\u2019s not going to end.\u201dHe pulled out his phone to read aloud some of the death threats against him on Facebook. Then he pulled a shirt over his face and recorded a video calling for a hunger strike.Alfonso Flores Berm\u00fadez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Businesswoman Became a Voice for Art\u2019s Black Models", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Murrell was working as a business executive when, in 1999, she started taking art history classes. She wasn\u2019t interested simply in identifying black figures in art. She wanted to contextualize their presence, focusing on periods in which the black model remained woefully underexamined.\u201cDuring the Renaissance, there is \u2018The Adoration of the Magi,\u2019 and there is always an African king,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cI really wanted to understand why that was. Were they imagined images? Were they posed from life? Were the models known?\u201dIn one lecture when she was in school, a professor introduced a slide of \u201cOlympia.\u201d After he remarked on the work\u2019s naked white courtesan, Ms. Murrell was curious how he would address the figure of the black maid, Laure. But he merely moved on to the next slide.\u201cWait a minute,\u201d she said she remembered thinking, upset by the omission, which was later repeated by other professors. \u201cA person of color who is standing right there before you, and being ignored, is something that is part of the condition of being\u201d part of the African diaspora to begin with. Art historians play a significant role in shaping our understanding of the past. It bothered her that their narratives would rewrite, subjugate or exclude the history of black people.When Ms. Murrell decided on a career change, and was transitioning into art history, her mother mailed her a photocopy of a page from her high school yearbook. It reminded her that as a teenager in Gastonia, N.C., she had wanted to be a history professor. She studied economics instead, getting her M.B.A. from Harvard and moving up the ranks at high-profile finance companies, like Citicorp and Institutional Investor.Ms. Murrell approached one of her professors, Anne Higonnet, about looking deeper into Manet\u2019s portrayal of Laure. Ms. Higonnet was supportive, but Ms. Murrell encountered pushback from others.\u201cSexism and racism run very deep, in the Columbia art history department as elsewhere,\u201d Ms. Higonnet wrote in an email, \u201cand I was taken aback by how subtle the ways were in which Denise was underestimated.\u201dWhile she was on a fellowship in Paris, Ms. Murrell met Mickalene Thomas, and the two went to look at \u201cOlympia.\u201d In front of the painting, Ms. Thomas deconstructed Manet\u2019s methods, concluding that he was \u201cpresenting\u201d Laure to the viewer. Ms. Murrell agreed. She acknowledges that Manet was a man of his time, but is adamant, citing details she\u2019s excavated about interracial mingling in his social and artistic life, that he viewed Laure as a person of significance, just like the model for the white woman in the painting, Victorine Meurent.Ms. Murrell went on to reconsider Matisse\u2019s use of black models in light of his trips to New York during the Harlem Renaissance, and circled back to the question that triggered her entanglement with art to begin with: How have contemporary black and nonblack artists reflected on these black figures in their work?\u201cYou can\u2019t really understand African-American art and visual culture and artistic production without understanding a lot of what it is reacting to,\u201d said Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw, a professor specializing in African-American art at the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cNo one teaching a survey of art history responsibly can do what was happening before,\u201d Ms. Gamer said.Those shows, however, aren\u2019t easy to put together. Organizing \u201cPosing Modernity\u201d took persistence: When Ms. Murrell ran into roadblocks, she found funders and strong-armed institutions for loans.Ms. Murrell said that while curators, art historians, gallery owners and others in the art community are sincere when they talk about diversity, they are also reluctant to dismantle established norms, including those that work against people of color. Larger institutions want to play it safe, and often refrain from funding unconventional scholarship.\u201cThere\u2019s the concern that if you talk about race or any other kind of marginalized subject, how broad is the interest going to be?\u201d Ms. Murrell said. Leaning on a mentorship model borrowed from her time in the corporate world, Ms. Murrell said she wants to create an incubator for minorities with new ideas.In the end, she wants to ensure that they\u2019re as visible as she\u2019s helped make Manet\u2019s model.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Means to Dress in Lagos", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe lookIn Nigeria\u2019s largest city, boundary-breaking style pushes up against tradition and social conservatism.LAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 Charly Boy decided he would wear rouge. It was the 1970s, the height of the sexual revolution in the West, so it wasn\u2019t unusual for men to be seen in makeup. But for a young student in the United States coming from a small town in Nigeria, dressing in ways that drew attention to himself \u2014 painting his cheeks and lips in bright colors, lining his eyebrows in kohl, wearing studded leather, acrylic talons and plastic fangs \u2014 felt like an act of defiance.\u201cSometimes I would release pictures of me sleeping in a coffin and tell people I like to suck blood,\u201d said Charly Boy, a former musician and television personality, now 67. He returned to Nigeria in the \u201980s, at which point his appearance became a deliberately provocative performance. The country was going through a series of military juntas in which cultural and artistic expression were suppressed and heavily policed, and Charly Boy wanted to make himself seen and heard. Consequently, his music and videos were often censored.Since then, the government has returned to a democracy, but most of Nigeria remains politically, socially and religiously conservative. Men and women tend to dress accordingly, in loosefitting garments made from vivid traditional textiles (brocade, adire, ankara) and Western-style business professional attire. They wear their hair in gender-conventional fashions: long for women, short for men. Much of their clothing is stylish, but it is also meant to attract little attention.These sartorial norms are upheld by institutions and social groups. In some congregations deacons scold female churchgoers for keeping their hair short and suggest that they try weaves instead. Most universities, often considered places for self-discovery, value obedience above personal expression. Stylistic accouterments \u2014 tattoos, makeup anklets, too many waist beads or rings stacked atop one another \u2014 are seen as excessive and inappropriate.Still, some Nigerians continue to style themselves in the name of free expression. As Charly Boy said, \u201cWhen you do something long enough, even if you will have unbelievers in the beginning, they turn to converts.\u201dEzra Olubi had to contend with bans on jewelry, pants for women and jeans for everyone on campus when he was a university student. So it wasn\u2019t until after graduation that he found freedom in M.A.C. lipsticks and Deborah Lippmann nail polish.\u201cI got a lot of stares, but I also knew I looked good,\u201d said Mr. Olubi, 33, showing off his brilliant purple polish.Today Mr. Olubi attends investor meetings in San Francisco and Lagos with tousled dreadlocks, long nails painted in bright colors and lipstick. He is the co-founder and chief technical officer of a finance tech start-up, Paystack, that has raised $13 million in investor funding and was accepted into the Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator.Sometimes passers-by ask about his style, expressing concern and confusion.\u201cEverybody thinks the only reason that gives you the right to look like this is because you are an entertainer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows how much people don\u2019t think others are allowed to be individuals.\u201dThere are more pointed responses, too. On his way home from our conversation, for example, Mr. Olubi was pulled over by policemen. They wanted to know if his company, Paystack, sold cosmetics. They threatened that painting his nails and wearing makeup is illegal. (It is not.) \u201cYou don\u2019t owe anybody apologies for your appearance, but when people ask I tend to give them answers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a teachable moment.\u201dDenola Grey, 28, is also no stranger to the response that follows certain modes of dress in his home country.\u201cThat belt you used to tie your waist, we will tie it around your neck,\u201d one commenter said.Mr. Grey (whose given name is Denola Adepetun) had apparently overstepped, dressing in a way that was supposedly feminine. A few months later, at Lagos Fashion Week, the country\u2019s pre-eminent fashion event, a number of male guests showed up in a similar style.\u201cI embrace my masculine and feminine sides,\u201d Mr. Grey said over Smarties and a chicken pie at a cafe. \u201cI take the structure of feminine curves to celebrate the male form in what I wear.\u201dOf course, there\u2019s a big difference between personal expression and what sells.In 2015, Yegwa Ukpo set up Stranger Lagos, a concept store that stocked monastic, often gender nonconformist clothes inspired by the Japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto. Usually dark and loosefitting, the outfits deliberately lack the drama or extravagance with which some Nigerians present themselves; they are clothes that most would never wear.\u201cThe standard I was trying to counter was the idea of \u2018clothing as ornament\u2019 and \u2018clothing as sign of wealth,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ukpo said. \u201cThe alternative would be clothing as something with worth inherently due to conceptual underpinnings, design \u2014 fabric, pattern cutting and construction \u2014 exclusive of this idea of whether or not it beautified the wearer.\u201d In 2018, just three years after it opened, the store shut down.\u201cI never expected this approach to become mainstream,\u201d Mr. Ukpo said. \u201cI do think we had a definite impact when it comes to what people believed was possible in this space.\u201dAdebayo Oke-Lawal, 28, the creative director of Orange Culture, stocked his wares at Stranger Lagos while the store was in business.For his first collection in 2011, Mr. Oke-Lawal sent models down the runway wearing what he called \u201cskouzers\u201d: half-skirts draped over trousers at the waist. It was, he said, an attempt to play on the thin line between what is regarded as masculine or feminine. Most people attending the show, a private presentation, were confused. They advised him to stick to fashion styling, which he was also doing at the time.In subsequent collections, Mr. Oke-Lawal had more to inspire discomfort. There were collarless tunics with side zips that opened to the upper chest, a suit with a large hole intentionally cut into its upper back, overlapping layers of sheer satin. In 2014, his efforts were recognized: He was a finalist for the Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy Prize, a prestigious award for young designers.These days, his clients include Naomi Campbell, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Chimamanda Adichie. His clothes are in stores in global fashion capitals and across the country, a leap from Stranger Lagos, which was the first and only store to give him a platform early on. He has shown in fashion weeks and presentations in Florence, Italy; Paris; London; Accra, Ghana; New York; and Johannesburg.Mr. Oke-Lawal\u2019s journey started at home. Portraits of his very stylish parents, now in their 50s, inspired his looks. His father wore printed shirts and short shorts at a time when Nigeria was less conservative.\u201cGrowing up, I was really shy about my ideas and wanting to dress people up in a certain way,\u201d Mr. Oke-Lawal said. \u201cI would just draw.\u201d\u201cBut at 10,\u201d he said, \u201cI decided to wear what I wanted. Clashing colors. Camouflage. I figured people are going to think I\u2019m weird anyway, would still bully me anyway, so I might as well get bullied for being exactly who I wanted to be.\u201dThe hosts were referring to her style, which resists the sensuality that is often expected of popular female performers. Teni, 26, whose given name is Teni Apata, wears do-rags, sporty sunglasses, graphic shirts with humorous sayings on them, baggy pants in bright colors, sneakers \u2014 all of which she sometimes buys from thrift and dollar stores when traveling.She had heard the critique before. Before she was signed to her current label, music industry executives advised her to be more girlie, to wear weaves.\u201cFirst of all, weaves make me sweat,\u201d she said in her home office. \u201cIt is hot here. I will have rashes on my neck.\u201d The podcasters were also referring to her weight, which, for many, upsets the stereotypical image of a presumably slender singer who sells sex appeal.\u201cI like food. I don\u2019t want to be thin. I like the way clothes fit. I like the way I stand. I can challenge agberos,\u201d she said, referring to a troublesome and often violent street gang in Lagos.As a university student, she didn\u2019t like to be stressed by choosing what to wear to class, especially the morning ones. So she would roll out of bed half-asleep, trying to catch her 8 a.m. in a T-shirt, pajamas and flip-flops.In Nigeria, she\u2019d probably be thought homeless. But in America, she got invited to fashion shows, became popular with the football players and other cool kids. The relaxed, devil-may-care look stuck. She has been compared by her mother to Charly Boy.But what really shapes her self-presentation and her overall outlook on life is death.\u201cI always watch my father\u2019s funeral video because it gives me inspiration,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you see a man that\u2019s so vibrant and brave just lying there?\u201dWhen he was alive, she said, \u201cmy father did what he wanted to do. Years after he died, people still come up to me and tell me what he did.\u201d \u201cI want the same, when I die, I want people to say I did what I wanted to, not because they wanted me to.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Throwing Open the Schoolhouse Doors, Once and For All", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsIn 1848, republican revolts against European monarchies ended in failure and repression. The year was said to be a turning point at which history failed to turn.Almost certainly 2018 will mark a similar turning point. The year saw Donald Trump\u2019s protectionism, Chinese expansionism, a reborn nationalism in India and Japan, Iranian empire-building, and Russian opportunism all combine to undermine the international cooperation that has sustained the 70-year-old postwar global order.Among the casualties have been agreements on climate change, nuclear weapons and trade, as the world suddenly appears divided and leaderless.The fourth Sustainable Development Goal \u2014 equitable and inclusive quality education for all \u2014 commits us to make our generation, by 2030, the first in history to send every child to school.Today, the shameful reality is that 260 million children aren\u2019t going to class. Among those in school, a total of 400 million will leave before they turn 12, and more than 800 million, half the developing world\u2019s boys and girls, will end their secondary schooling with no recognizable qualifications for the modern work force.Despite the scholastic mountain we have to climb, international aid for education has fallen over the past decade from 13 percent of all aid to just 10 percent. At just $10 per child per year, that\u2019s not even enough money to cover the cost of a secondhand textbook.The much-vaunted public-private partnerships that were expected, in the words of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and United Nations, to turn \u201cbillions into trillions,\u201d have yet to materialize, and while global health and educational institutions in developed countries are blessed with outstanding private philanthropists, global education has yet to discover its latter-day Andrew Carnegie. Business investments in global education have been a fraction of the investments in global health or the environment.If they aren\u2019t on the streets, these millions of young people, denied educational and employment opportunities in their home countries, will be on the move. Unless some of the world\u2019s wealth moves to Africa, Africans will increasingly move to the world\u2019s wealth, as millions of would-be migrants convince themselves that being poor in a rich country is better than being rich in a poor country.The $10 billion International Finance Facility for Education can break through the aid stalemate. Proposed by the Education Commission, an international initiative I chair, the fund is focused on the more than 700 million children living in the world\u2019s lower-middle-income countries, which themselves contain the vast majority of refugees and displaced children.These 50 or so countries are too poor to finance the cost of universal education themselves, but too wealthy to qualify for substantive grants from multilateral development banks. The loans that are available carry a 4 percent interest rate. As a result, only $350 million, or 50 cents per child per year, is devoted to education in these nations.By offering developing countries affordable financing, the new fund will plug a yawning chasm in the architecture of international aid. It will be created from guarantees provided by donor countries: $2 billion leveraged up by borrowing in the marketplace into $8 billion worth of funding. And this will be supplemented by $2 billion of grant aid, allowing us to cut the interest charged on the loans. Converting a $2 billion grant into $8 billion of aid will make the funding we offer go four times as far as conventional aid.In return for this enhanced international financing, developing countries would be called upon to double their own investments in education, from the current 2 to 3 percent to a 4 to 5 percent share of national income.This would be enough to create the additional 200 million schools needed to finally get all children into the classroom.A global fund for education on a scale that matches the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria would help honor our long-delayed promise of education for all and bring one of the worst-funded Sustainable Development Goals within reach.It would also send a timely message to the world: that even in the most insular and protectionist of environments, we can advance international cooperation and prove that globalization can still work for those who have been left behind.Gordon Brown, the former prime minister of Britain, is the United Nations special envoy for global education and the author of \u201cGordon Brown: My Life, Our Times.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of Carlos Ghosn", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "Mr. Ghosn, the ousted Nissan executive, wasn\u2019t supposed to succeed in Japan, but he never expected to fail like this. He faces charges of financial wrongdoing at the company he helped save.Supported byCarlos Ghosn was tired. At 64 years old, the chairman of an auto empire that spanned several continents and included Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi wasn\u2019t bouncing back from jet lag the way he used to. Melatonin wasn\u2019t working anymore, and he had bouts of insomnia, phoning his children in the middle of the night or going on long walks around his Tokyo or Paris neighborhood. He planned to retire soon, stepping back from spending his life on an airplane, albeit a luxurious one paid for by Nissan.Last month, just before Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. Ghosn headed to Tokyo to meet his youngest daughter and her boyfriend and attend a board meeting. He was scheduled to land at Haneda Airport at 4 p.m.The daughter, Maya Ghosn, 26, had spent most of her childhood in Japan and wanted to introduce her boyfriend, Patrick, to her favorite places. Bringing a boyfriend home is a common rite of passage, but a particularly intimidating prospect when growing up Ghosn \u2014 a child of one of the most romanticized and ruthless chief executives the global business community has ever seen.Ms. Ghosn had made a 7:30 dinner reservation at Jiro, the Michelin-starred sushi counter hidden in a basement in the city\u2019s Ginza district.On the tarmac in Beirut, Lebanon, Mr. Ghosn opened WhatsApp and texted his four children on a group chain labeled \u201cGame of Ghosns,\u201d for his favorite TV show, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the bloody HBO drama about dynasties under siege. \u201cOn my way to Tokyo! Love you guys!\u201d Mr. Ghosn texted as his jet lifted off.He never made it to dinner.On Nov. 19, Japanese prosecutors surrounded Mr. Ghosn\u2019s Gulfstream after its arrival and arrested him on allegations that for years he had withheld millions of dollars in income from Nissan\u2019s financial filings.Ms. Ghosn was staying at her father\u2019s corporate apartment, and when he didn\u2019t show up she checked with his longtime driver at Nissan, who assured her his flight had probably been delayed. She texted: \u201cHey, just heard your flight got delayed. Please let me know when you land, worried about you.\u201dExhausted from jet lag, she took a nap. Patrick woke her when he saw a tweet about Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest. \u201cI was in shock,\u201d she said in an interview.Minutes later, the doorbell rang. Two Japanese men in black suits slipped off their shoes to enter the two-bedroom apartment and showed Ms. Ghosn a brief note in English.\u201cThere is a case against your father,\u201d it read, according to Ms. Ghosn\u2019s account. \u201cThe Tokyo judge has warranted us access to search the house. We need a witness. Thank you for cooperating.\u201dFifteen men, also in suits, followed. They locked the front door, told Ms. Ghosn that they were prosecutors, warned the couple not to use their phones and suggested that they might tap the apartment. They rummaged through Mr. Ghosn\u2019s drawers, studying family photos, Maya\u2019s 10th-grade report card, personal letters, her parents\u2019 divorce papers.\u201cI wanted my dad to know that in this situation I was polite and handled it maturely, and I didn\u2019t want to give them any reason to feel satisfied by an ounce of despair in my eyes,\u201d Ms. Ghosn said. \u201cBut inside, I was shaking. I couldn\u2019t stand up. I had to hold the wall.\u201dSix and a half hours later, at 11:30 p.m., the men left.Worried that anything they said was being recorded, Ms. Ghosn and her boyfriend went into the bathroom, climbed into the shower fully clothed, turned on the water and whispered about what to do next. She called her siblings to figure out how to tackle Japan\u2019s labyrinthine legal system.Told by the authorities that she was forbidden to contact her father, Ms. Ghosn waited at the apartment for nearly two days until an American lawyer working for her family called.\u201cWe got very clear instructions to leave as soon as possible for fear of being detained or interrogated to extort my dad,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we got on the first flight out.\u201dCarlos Ghosn wasn\u2019t supposed to succeed in Japan, but he wasn\u2019t supposed to fail like this. He first made headlines in 1999 when, in a nation known for its distrust of outsiders, Mr. Ghosn, a brash Brazilian-born and Lebanese- and French-educated engineer, showed up in sunglasses and a pinstripe suit with plans to carry out an American-style restructuring of a failing Nissan. The Japanese carmaker had $35 billion in debt, provided lifetime employment to a bloated work force and produced a fleet of the kind of cars you\u2019d dread getting at the rental counter.Mr. Ghosn, then 45 and a vice president at Renault, had helped oversee a turnaround at the middling French automaker, which had agreed to spend $5.4 billion to buy a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan Motors.John Casesa, then a top auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, advised Mr. Ghosn to rent a house in Tokyo rather than buy one.\u201cThe widely held consensus was that he would fail, that Nissan wasn\u2019t worth saving and it couldn\u2019t be done,\u201d Mr. Casesa said.But Mr. Ghosn, with his severe black eyebrows and puffed chest, was undeterred. He closed factories, slashed suppliers, laid off 14 percent of the work force and invested in design. Six years later, Nissan had surpassed Honda to become Japan\u2019s No. 2 automaker, its market capitalization had quintupled and its operating margin had risen tenfold. Altima sedans, Titan pickup trucks and Murano S.U.V.s made Nissan a major player in the United States market \u2014 an achievement that Wall Street once deemed impossible.By the early 2000s, Mr. Ghosn was head of the Renault-Nissan alliance and the first person to simultaneously serve as chief executive of two Fortune Global 500 companies, the type of chief executive who even if you didn\u2019t know how to pronounce his name (rhymes with phone), you\u2019d know his products.The enigmatic \u201cgaijin\u201d (as foreigners are called in Japan) had achieved a status bestowed on only a handful of chief executives, akin, at least in Japan, to Steve Jobs, Warren E. Buffett or Elon Musk. Paparazzi swarmed. Fans asked for autographs. Japanese businessmen, eager to emulate the Nissan chief, inquired where Mr. Ghosn had bought his rectangular sunglasses and custom suits.But even as many in Nissan celebrated the comeback, others scoffed at Mr. Ghosn\u2019s celebrity.From the start, he faced distrust from the Japanese policymaking and business establishment. The very idea of an outsider\u2019s bringing free-market capitalism to Japan\u2019s quasi-socialist corporate culture jabbed at historical wounds.\u201cHe was a person who was above the clouds,\u201d said Yuichi Ishino, who worked in Nissan\u2019s finance department from 2002 to 2005. \u201cNo one dared to say anything that would confront his opinions.\u201dThe stickiest issue was always Mr. Ghosn\u2019s pay.In 2008, the same year that Japanese law began requiring companies to disclose directors\u2019 pay in their annual reports, Nissan\u2019s shareholders voted to set an annual cap of about $27 million on compensation for all board directors combined.After that, Mr. Ghosn made the case to the public that he was underpaid \u2014 instructing Nissan to hand out background materials reminding investors and the news media that he made significantly less than his counterparts at other global automakers.Such brazenness rankled employees and the public in Japan.\u201cEven when a company is a global multinational company, it\u2019s still stamped by its country of origin and the place where it has its headquarters,\u201d said Sanford M. Jacoby, a professor of management at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied Japanese corporate culture. The Japanese, he said, put more weight \u201con egalitarian policies of government and pay and other things.\u201dIn France, where the government owns a 15 percent stake in Renault, shareholders have also taken issue with Mr. Ghosn\u2019s pay. \u201cWe believe that anyone making 240 times more than the minimum pay of his employees is out of control,\u201d said Pierre-Henri Leroy, the head of Proxinvest, a French shareholder advisory group.In October, a whistle-blower inside Nissan said he had evidence that Mr. Ghosn had been instructing Greg Kelly, a top aide and a board member, and a small group of confidants at Nissan to effectively create two salary pots for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation.One pot would be paid in the current year and reported in the company\u2019s annual report and securities filings. Another amount would be designated to be paid out after Mr. Ghosn left Nissan, according to a person familiar with Nissan\u2019s internal investigation. The whistle-blower\u2019s findings were sent to Hiroto Saikawa, the company\u2019s chief executive, and an internal auditor.Nissan went to prosecutors with allegations that Mr. Ghosn, working directly with Mr. Kelly, who was once the head of human resources at Nissan, had underreported his income from 2009 to 2017, according to a person with knowledge of the internal investigation. Nissan\u2019s investigation found that the underreporting had occurred when some of the compensation, though committed, was deferred and not reported in securities filings.Nissan also told prosecutors that it had evidence Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly developed plans to pay Mr. Ghosn a further $124 million in cash and other financial instruments, some as compensation for a future advisory position for Mr. Ghosn.Hari Nada, a Nissan executive and confidant of Mr. Kelly\u2019s, sent a private jet to fly him from Nashville to Tokyo for the same board meeting that Mr. Ghosn planned to attend. The two men were arrested hours apart. Mr. Kelly\u2019s family said Mr. Nada had assured him that he would be back in Nashville by Thanksgiving, in time for scheduled neck surgery.Nissan would not comment about the Kelly family\u2019s statements about Mr. Nada. Mr. Nada did not answer phone calls seeking comment.Mr. Kelly was released on Christmas after his family cited his ill health and posted bail of 70 million yen (about $640,000). His lawyer in Nashville, Aubrey Harwell Jr., said his client denied wrongdoing. Mr. Kelly and Mr. Ghosn \u201chad conversations regarding legal ways they could defer compensation,\u201d Mr. Harwell said.Mr. Ghosn, Mr. Kelly and Nissan itself all face charges they violated financial reporting laws. The company\u2019s board removed Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly as representative directors, positions with power to sign company documents.That Mr. Ghosn may have deceived regulators while enriching himself runs afoul of cultural norms in Japan, where the public is more likely to forgive corporate cover-ups when executives appear to be protecting the company.\u201cAlthough you don\u2019t see it written down, there is almost a social consensus that \u2018OK, you did your crime, but you did it for the company,\u2019\u201d said Seijiro Takeshita, dean and professor at the School of Management and Information at the University of Shizuoka.Or as Jesper Koll, who has worked in Japan for decades as an economist and is head of Japan for WisdomTree investments in Tokyo, said: \u201cThe one thing that Japan does not want and would never tolerate is personal greed.\u201dMr. Ghosn\u2019s longtime driver has been out of touch since shortly after the arrest. The driver told the Ghosn children the day after their father was detained that the Japanese authorities had found his car in Tokyo. They tore up the leather seats and found only cat food.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s chief of staff, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Le Greves, who arrived in Tokyo the same day as Mr. Ghosn, has not made any statement and returned to France after she learned of the arrest, a person close to the Ghosn family said.Their silence is one of many plot twists in the corporate saga. A person close to the family has started to call it \u201cAs the World Ghosns.\u201dUnder Japanese law, only Mr. Ghosn\u2019s Japanese lawyer and representatives from the French, Brazilian and Lebanese Embassies have been allowed to visit or talk to him.The frustration has led a few of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s longtime friends in France to some extreme and possibly culturally insensitive metaphors. Two of them compared the meticulously planned surprise arrest to the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which killed 2,400 Americans.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s children have learned from his visitors that he has lost weight, at least 20 pounds. Prosecutors question him daily. Several requests to the jail authorities for a mattress were denied, but a Lebanese diplomat succeeded in getting him a thin cot and vitamin C pills.The books that Mr. Ghosn is reading in jail \u2014 including \u201cWhen Things Fall Apart,\u201d by Pema Chodron; \u201cTeachings of the Buddha,\u201d by Jack Kornfield; and \u201cA Little Life,\u201d a dark novel by Hanya Yanagihara \u2014 speak to his state of mind. He has been denied other items, including family photos, a pen and paper, dental floss (\u201cHe is a big flosser,\u201d his daughter Maya said) and an iPod Nano loaded with music by his favorite, Phil Collins.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s defenders, largely in the business community, contend that he is being treated harshly because he is a foreigner. They claim that the latest charge, rooted in dealings from 2008, was beyond the statute of limitations for Japanese citizens. According to Japanese law, the statute is tied not to citizenship but to how much time the accused has spent outside Japan.\u201cIt seems really strategic. It\u2019s a political fight,\u201d said Ralph Jazzar, a banker in Paris and Mr. Ghosn\u2019s first cousin. He recited an expression in French and then translated it: \u201cHe who wants to get rid of a great dog pretends the dog has the plague.\u201dMr. Jazzar and Mr. Ghosn grew up together in a middle-class neighborhood in Beirut. Mr. Ghosn, who was born in Rio de Janeiro, was 6 when his Lebanese father moved the family to Beirut.His sister, Claudine Bichara de Oliveira, said he was fascinated by cars at an early age. She remembers him lying in the back seat of the family car, \u201cclosing his eyes and guessing the kind of car just by hearing its horn.\u201dFrom Lebanon, Mr. Ghosn went to Paris to attend France\u2019s most prestigious schools, Lycee Saint-Louis and the Ecole Polytechnique. And then he worked his way up Michelin.Whether in Lebanon or France, Mr. Ghosn always assumed the role of the ambitious outsider. In 1989, he perfected his English and added America to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, soon becoming the chief executive of Michelin\u2019s North American operations. Mr. Ghosn moved his young family to Greenville, S.C. He took a road trip to see the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, studying the world\u2019s largest tire market along the way.If there was any community in which Mr. Ghosn seemed to finally fit, it was the global elite, a coterie of chief executives and billionaire philanthropists who have yachts in the south of France and standing invitations to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (\u201cIf Davos Were a Person, It Would Be Carlos Ghosn\u201d was the headline of a Bloomberg profile last year.) Mr. Ghosn\u2019s new wife, Carole Nahas, persuaded him to take ski lessons at age 60.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s unabashed globalism clashed with the current era of inequality and off-with-their-heads isolationism. In 2015, Emmanuel Macron, then the French finance minister, criticized Mr. Ghosn, calling his $8 million salary at Renault \u201cexcessive.\u201d Early this year, an auditor at Nissan began investigating the homes that a company subsidiary had bought for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s personal use, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation.In an internal investigation, Nissan learned that a subsidiary set up in the Netherlands ostensibly to fund venture capital investments had been used to buy or rent corporate properties that Mr. Ghosn lived in when he traveled, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Nissan had invested 73 million euros (currently equivalent to about $83 million) in the venture, known as Zi-A, and Mr. Kelly was put in charge of it.In addition to a 5,400-square-foot flat in Paris\u2019s elegant 16th arrondissement, Zi-A bought an apartment in Rio in 2011 for $6 million. (The Ghosn family planned to spend Christmas there this year with his ailing mother.) In Beirut, there is a salmon-hued mansion on a tree-lined street that Zi-A paid $8.75 million for in 2012, followed by $6 million in renovations and furnishings, according to a person briefed on Nissan\u2019s investigation.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s family said Nissan had known about the homes. \u201cOver 19 years, the company put these things in place to maximize his productivity,\u201d his eldest child, Caroline Ghosn, 31, said in an interview.Mr. Ghosn hasn\u2019t been charged with any illegal activity related to his corporate residences. Caroline Ghosn said media accounts about the homes were part of Nissan\u2019s and Japanese prosecutors\u2019 efforts to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d in a public-relations campaign against her father.Nissan declined to comment, but a person familiar with its investigation said the fact that the Dutch subsidiary was buying homes rather than paying for car-related start-ups was among the red flags for internal auditors. The person also pointed out that Nissan did not have substantial operations in Beirut, the location of one of the disputed homes.\u201cDo not take this as a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d Mr. Saikawa, the current chief executive of Nissan, whom Mr. Ghosn had mentored, told reporters hours after the arrest.Mr. Saikawa said he felt \u201cstrong anger and despair\u201d over Nissan\u2019s findings, but analysts and investors closely watching the company believed that complicated interpersonal dynamics were at play.Critics inside and outside Nissan had started to question whether Mr. Ghosn\u2019s star had faded. In recent years, sales had slowed. The miraculous turnaround he orchestrated started to stall. One former executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, summed up the new sentiment spreading inside the company as \u201cWhat have you done for us lately?\u201dMidway through a plan known as Power 88, which Mr. Ghosn unveiled to much fanfare in 2011, it became clear that Nissan would fall short of the ambitious targets he had set. He wanted Nissan to reach 8 percent profit margins and 8 percent market share in the countries where it operated. Dealers complained that they were losing money and that Mr. Ghosn\u2019s big incentives to buyers to meet his targets were eating into their margins. They also grumbled that Nissan was selling too many vehicles to rental companies that then would flood the secondary buyers\u2019 market.\u201cThey would sell cars in any manner and in any way without any regard for what the long-term implications were,\u201d said Steve Kalafer, chief executive of a chain of auto dealerships in New Jersey. After 36 years of owning a Nissan dealership, Mr. Kalafer said, he sold it two years ago because he objected to Mr. Ghosn\u2019s policies.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s daughters said that in the past few years he had started on a succession plan to help cement his legacy and plan for his retirement. Mr. Ghosn explored what he called a \u201creimagining of the alliance\u201d that would permanently bind Nissan and Renault. And he picked Mr. Saikawa, his close confidant, to succeed him as chief executive.\u201cHe is like Carlos Ghosn in many ways,\u201d Patrick le Qu\u00e9ment, a former head of design at Renault, said of Mr. Saikawa. \u201cNot much feeling.\u201dBut as Mr. Ghosn sought to integrate Nissan\u2019s operations more closely with Renault, maybe connecting them permanently, the relationship was getting shaky. Some Nissan executives, engineers and marketing staff began to resent what they saw as Renault\u2019s unfairly piggybacking on Nissan\u2019s technology, research and brand strength, according to three former managerial employees.The French saw things another way, accusing Mr. Ghosn of favoring the Japanese and Nissan and blocking Renault\u2019s expansion into China, the world\u2019s largest car market, to clear the field for Nissan.\u201cWe felt he was escaping us,\u201d Mr. le Qu\u00e9ment said. \u201cA lot of decisions were being taken that were to the detriment of Renault.\u201dAs tensions grew, Mr. Ghosn mused about getting out. On his long walks around Tokyo when he couldn\u2019t sleep, he would pass an old man playing the shakuhachi, an end-blown bamboo flute that dates to seventh-century Japan. Mr. Ghosn told his children that in retirement he hoped to learn how to play it. A Byzantine Empire buff, he said he also might write history books or lecture M.B.A. students.Caroline and Maya Ghosn used to joke that Nissan was the \u201cvery demanding fifth child\u201d in their family. To them, Mr. Saikawa\u2019s statements (without an apologetic bow) the night of their father\u2019s arrest were proof that his fall was akin to a palace coup.What doesn\u2019t make sense to Mr. Ghosn\u2019s friends and family is how the man with a preternatural talent for seeing around every corner \u2014 whether maneuvering through Japanese bureaucracy, managing French ministers or designing a midsize S.U.V. \u2014 didn\u2019t see this coming. Maybe, they theorized, it was the jet lag and the 100 days a year he spent on an airplane, and that old man with the flute whom he saw himself becoming.Mr. Jazzar, his cousin, said Mr. Ghosn had failed, in the end, at the \u201cP.Y.A.\u201d approach to management: Protect Your Ass.\u201cGod only knows what is going on inside his head,\u201d Mr. Jazzar said.Liz Alderman and Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Plans to Redevelop R.F.K. Stadium Face Headwinds", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetWASHINGTON \u2014 In the middle of the nation\u2019s capital are 190 prime acres that include Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, once the home to a National Football League team, two Major League Baseball teams and a professional soccer team. The stadium sits idle, awaiting an uncertain future.Leaders in Washington, D.C., have ambitious plans to redevelop the site \u2014 including luring the Washington Redskins back from FedExField in Maryland \u2014 but they hinge on a renewal of a lease for the land from the National Park Service. Extension of the lease, which expires in 2038, would give the district substantial sway over how the project evolves.But the push to redevelop has met resistance from some local leaders who fear that residents could lose their voice in the decisions that reshape the property.The first piece of the $489.6 million redevelopment plan has already begun. Last month, bulldozers started to plow 27 acres of asphalt, known as Parking Lot 7, soon to become three multipurpose playing fields of artificial turf. The land will eventually include a 6,000-square-foot pavilion, a 65,000-square-foot food hall and a 350,000-square-foot sports and recreation complex. This first phase is expected to take five to seven years.The activity fields, which are expected to cost $32 million, are scheduled to be ready in March and will accommodate soccer, lacrosse, baseball and softball games and related amenities.District leaders would like to expand their vision, but are hampered by lease restrictions, which limit the city\u2019s semipublic sports and convention agency, Events DC, to oversee \u201cstadium uses\u201d and other \u201cpublic outdoor opportunities\u201d at the site.\u201cWe are pushing for long-term control of this land,\u201d Washington\u2019s mayor, Muriel E. Bowser, said at the fields\u2019 groundbreaking ceremony in August. She has also been lobbying for a return of the Redskins to the district.Any change that would make the site more than a local amenity would require congressional action. In 2017, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district\u2019s nonvoting delegate to the House, introduced legislation to extend the lease to 2088, but the bill never got out of committee.\u201cI am continuing to work on multiple legislative options for the redevelopment of the R.F.K. site,\u201d Ms. Norton said in a statement.Even moving forward with the next short-term projects involves private financing that hinges on a longer lease. Gregory O\u2019Dell, president and chief executive of Events DC, said formal requests for proposals would be made in the first half of 2019. But the lease amendment was intended to be included in the federal spending bill, and uncertainty over passage of the budget has put Mr. O\u2019Dell\u2019s timetable in doubt.Ms. Bowser and Ms. Norton declined to be interviewed for this article.In March 2017, the mayor wrote to President Trump, requesting that the federal government extend the lease or turn over parkland, including the R.F.K. campus, to the district. At the time, she envisioned not only a new sports facility but also \u201cmuch needed housing and retail.\u201d She received no response. On Dec. 4, her office said she was continuing to work \u201cboth sides of the aisle\u201d to accomplish this.Charles Allen, the district councilman who represents the stadium area, opposes using the site for the N.F.L. team, and would rather include housing for families as well as retailing. But he said he had heard speculation that pro-stadium efforts were accelerating. \u201cAnytime there is a sudden clamming up, and they\u2019ve all started saying they are not willing to talk, it\u2019s a pretty big signal that something\u2019s coming,\u201d he said.But talk of the team\u2019s return has filled newspaper columns and sports radio talk shows. Said Mr. O\u2019Dell: \u201cA lot of it frankly is atmospheric noise.\u201dThe property offers a lot of benefits to the community, said Brian T. Kenner, deputy mayor for economic development.The site is about four miles east of the National Capitol building and borders the Anacostia River. Plans also call for providing pedestrian bridges to the neighborhoods on the other side, which are economically and culturally removed from the rest of the city.The R.F.K. campus is right next to a stop for the Metro, the region\u2019s commuter rail system, Mr. Kenner said.\u201cIn New York and D.C. terms, this is a valuable piece of property,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also has great sight lines into Washington and is one of the gateways off East Capitol Street into the District of Columbia.\u201dBut the restrictions have also prevented the R.F.K. campus from being absorbed by nearby neighborhoods that have begun to be gentrified.\u201cIf not for existing land restrictions there now, that area would have been developed into a new, vibrant, mixed-use community,\u201d Mr. Kenner said. \u201cAbsent the restrictions, it would be a prime opportunity for us to think about adding affordable housing, additional grocery stores and additional residences.\u201dOpened in 1961 as D.C. Stadium, it received its current name in 1969 after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy a year earlier. The Kennedy family has been meeting with Events DC to come up with a design for an R.F.K. memorial on the site.\u201cThrough this memorial, it is my hope that together we can help capture his forever-burning spirit and commitment to service,\u201d his widow, Ethel Kennedy, said when the plan was unveiled two years ago.In recent years, the stadium and surrounding acres of parking have been used less frequently. The Redskins left in 1997 for a new facility, now called FedEx Field, in Landover, Md. The stadium was also once home to two M.L.B. franchises, the Washington Senators and the Washington Nationals, as well DC United, the city\u2019s professional soccer team.Since 2007, Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Redskins, has expressed interest in returning to the district. And last August, Ms. Bowser showed her support by saying that she hoped the team would come back to a new stadium built at the R.F.K. site. \u201cBring it home,\u201d she said.Whether the 58-year-old R.F.K. Stadium will be replaced with another stadium or its footprint put to other uses remains to be seen, but other cities have employed a range of approaches in similar circumstances.Houston\u2019s Astrodome, which harbored flood refugees during Hurricane Katrina, is due for a $108 million renovation, scheduled to begin early next year. Given its status as a historic landmark, the Astrodome was protected from demolition. The former Bush Stadium in Indianapolis, which hosted sports teams from 1931 to 1996, was partly torn down and converted into Stadium Lofts, a 100-unit apartment complex around the original ball field.Mr. O\u2019Dell of Events DC said planners were inspired by how other cities used such spaces, citing Chelsea Piers in Manhattan as a \u201cgreat example for a sports and recreation complex and what it\u2019s done for that neighborhood.\u201dOf the nearly $500 million earmarked for near-term projects, half are projected to come from the district\u2019s hotel and restaurant taxes, about $83 million from the district budget and $160 million from the private sector.For the longer term, Events DC, working with the international design firm OMA, has suggested three scenarios: a new N.F.L. stadium, a 20,000-seat indoor basketball and hockey arena, and other development with no single large anchor. \u201cWe are agnostic which option gets selected,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dell said.While all of this is being sorted out, Events DC has started a marketing campaign that includes a social media push and a local microbrew called RFK Untapped.\u201cThis is a once in a lifetime chance to reimagine a vision not only for this campus but for this part of city,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dell said. \u201cWe want to raise awareness of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Star Economist at Harvard Faces Sexual Harassment Complaints", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut his rapid ascent has taken a troubling turn as Harvard officials review a university investigator\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Fryer fostered a work environment hostile to women, one filled with sexual talk and bullying.The findings, reviewed by The New York Times, found that Dr. Fryer had engaged in \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\u201d toward four women who worked in the Harvard-affiliated research lab he created. In one case, his \u201cpersistent and pervasive\u201d conduct contributed to stress that resulted in the accuser\u2019s taking disability leave, the investigator found. The investigator could not substantiate some allegations, including one asserting retaliation by Dr. Fryer.Harvard is still investigating a similar complaint from a woman who worked in the lab a decade ago. That woman says Dr. Fryer made what she considered sexual overtures, then retaliated against her after she rebuffed him.Harvard is not expected to take action until officials have finished investigating all of the complaints against him, according to people familiar with the process. Possible outcomes include a reprimand, suspension or dismissal.As an African-American, Dr. Fryer has been a trailblazer in rising to the top tier of a field dominated by white men. He was, at 30, the youngest black professor to be granted tenure at Harvard.Dr. Fryer told a Harvard investigator that any sexual banter in his office was related to his research and \u201cin the spirit of academic freedom.\u201d He wrote in his response to the complaint that \u201ccertainly no one ever brought to my attention that I ever said anything that made any employee uncomfortable.\u201dBut in interviews with The New York Times and for Harvard\u2019s investigation, former employees described Dr. Fryer as a bully and the lab as a place where sexual jokes and comments were routine, and where employees were expected to laugh along with the group or risk being isolated. Documents and interviews suggest that Dr. Fryer was told repeatedly over the course of 10 years \u2014 by employees and by at least one university official \u2014 that his conduct was out of line.A former assistant reported to a Harvard human resources office in late 2008 that Dr. Fryer was sending her unwelcome and sexually suggestive nighttime text messages. Dr. Fryer agreed to change his behavior, apparently on the advice of a university official. But he directed another employee to compile examples of poor performance by the accuser. He refused to write recommendations for economics graduate programs she was applying to, according to her complaint, and all rejected her.Separately, Harvard is investigating Dr. Fryer\u2019s spending and the lab\u2019s finances, according to several former employees who have been asked about the issue by university officials. In a statement for this article, Dr. Fryer said he \u201chired a first-rate finance team to insure both transparency and full compliance with Harvard policy.\u201dLast spring, Harvard imposed \u201cinterim measures\u201d while conducting its investigations, including barring Dr. Fryer from entering the Education Innovation Laboratory, the off-campus space known as EdLabs where he has presided over a group of employees and research assistants.This account draws on documents related to the allegations against Dr. Fryer and interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees of his laboratory, as well as other colleagues and associates, many of whom supplied copies of electronic communications with him. Nearly all insisted on confidentiality, fearing retaliation.Dr. Fryer, in a statement, portrayed the EdLabs workplace in a different light. \u201cThe lab has always been an extraordinarily collegial place,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people commented on each others\u2019 lives outside of work including their dating and other relationships. Jokes and comments by both female and male lab workers of a sexual nature were occasionally part of such discussions. Not one person has ever complained to me or to any other manager or employee that I am aware of suggesting they felt uncomfortable about any of these interactions. That said, if any comments made in the past were found to be offensive or made anyone uncomfortable, that was certainly never my intent and I am deeply sorry.\u201dDr. Fryer also said that \u201cI have never and would not retaliate against any employee.\u201dRachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman, said the university was \u201caware of and take seriously concerns raised about the treatment of staff\u201d but would not discuss or confirm any unresolved case.June Daniel, a lawyer who as executive director oversaw the lab\u2019s administration for more than five years, recalled that Dr. Fryer complained when Harvard administrators pushed the Economics Department to find qualified female candidates for professorships. \u201cRoland said that no such candidates exist,\u201d Ms. Daniel wrote in response to questions from The New York Times. She left the lab last year.Asked to comment, Dr. Fryer said, \u201cI have been a tremendous champion for women and other underrepresented groups in economics,\u201d and noted that he had started a departmental committee to \u201cincrease diversity and inclusion.\u201dFormer employees said Dr. Fryer often reminded junior researchers that his recommendations could vault them to top graduate programs \u2014 or ground their careers. Several women said Dr. Fryer had written negative recommendations after they angered him in some way, or refused to write a recommendation at all.Ms. Daniel said Dr. Fryer\u2019s reputation for vindictiveness made it hard for researchers to speak out against what she called his routine \u201cinappropriate comments about women or their body parts, men\u2019s body parts, homosexuals, minorities or other groups.\u201dSome current and former employees defended Dr. Fryer as a demanding but fair boss who frequently hired and promoted women into senior roles. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I was ever judged on anything other than the quality of my work,\u201d said Rucha Vankudre, the lab\u2019s current research director. \u201cHe takes me and my ideas seriously.\u201dDr. Fryer\u2019s rise in the field was swift and celebrated. In 2011, he won the MacArthur grant, and in 2015 he received the John Bates Clark Medal, which honors an American under 40 for \u201ca significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.\u201dSome of those who have worked in his lab say they hoped the job would lead to a career in economics, but a few say Dr. Fryer instead drove them out of the field.\u201cI write papers that I think will help the world,\u201d Dr. Fryer wrote to one research assistant in a chat message, after she complained about his treatment of employees. \u201cI\u2019m far less interested in people\u2019s feelings. They can quit if they don\u2019t like it.\u201dThe earliest incidents to figure in the formal complaints involve a woman who landed a job with Dr. Fryer as an assistant a decade ago, at 23, barely a year after graduating from college.Dr. Fryer began sending her text messages that \u201cquickly veered into flirtatious and sexual overtures,\u201d according to her complaint, which has been reviewed by The Times, along with text messages that the two exchanged. He invited her to see him socially, and she initially agreed, but became uncomfortable as he pushed her to spend more time with him away from the lab.In her first month, she made visits to his apartment at night to play video games, and he sometimes complained that she left too early or did not drink enough while there. He invited her to weekend activities that he said needed to stay a secret from others in the lab, to avoid rumors. And he sent after-hours BlackBerry messages, including one telling her: \u201cUr lucky ur not here. I would either tackle, bite u or both.\u201dThe woman told friends she was upset by the messages and his conduct, according to documents in her complaint, and she stopped visiting his apartment.After that, Dr. Fryer began to criticize her work. She informed human resources, but was told that the university could not transfer her to a different researcher.Dr. Fryer apologized to the woman and said she had misinterpreted his \u201cfriendly nature,\u201d according to notes taken at the time by two managers in the lab. The apology, along with a pledge never to contact the woman outside of work hours, appears to have been suggested by a university official, the notes show.The woman\u2019s formal complaint, filed this year, includes an email sent by Dr. Fryer to a deputy soon after her visit to human resources. \u201cI will be sending you every complaint I have about her performance on a regular basis,\u201d Dr. Fryer told the deputy, Richard Hagey, who has since died.Seven months later, after what she described in her complaint as \u201ctirades\u201d by Dr. Fryer about her job performance, the woman resigned. She pursued a career in a different academic field.Another case was brought by a woman who began working for Dr. Fryer in 2015. Over the course of two years, she told the investigator, Dr. Fryer repeatedly engaged her in conversations of a sexual nature. She cited 32 examples of such behavior; the investigator substantiated six. In others, the investigator found insufficient evidence to confirm that an incident occurred or that the conduct was unwelcome.Some of the woman\u2019s allegations were supported by text messages, chat logs or other documents. On one occasion, Dr. Fryer texted the woman while she was out with friends that she was \u201cgonna get a \u2026 roofy,\u201d a reference to a date-rape drug. Later he texted her, while she was still out, \u201cBe safe tonight. Wear gloves if ur gonna have hand action.\u201dDr. Fryer told the investigator that the comments were an \u201cill-attempted joke.\u201d The investigator found they were sexual in nature and \u201cobjectively unwelcome\u201d for the woman.In early 2017, Dr. Fryer suffered a heart attack and subsequently began to spend more time in the lab and less time traveling. After that, the tone of his comments changed and \u201cbecame more public and derogatory,\u201d the woman told the investigator.According to the investigator\u2019s report, Dr. Fryer began commenting on the woman\u2019s sex life and suggesting that the woman was in a sexual relationship with a former manager in the lab. In June, she texted her roommate complaining that Dr. Fryer had spent 20 minutes talking about how she and the former manager were probably having sex, using a vulgarity. \u201cLike in detail,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBody parts.\u201dA few days later, the woman went to a human resources official to complain about Dr. Fryer\u2019s behavior. Later that month, her doctor called human resources to say her patient was in \u201ca crisis situation,\u201d and the woman began a disability leave. She never returned to work at the lab.The accuser has also filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.Other employees told similar stories about Dr. Fryer, both in interviews with The Times and in discussions with Harvard\u2019s investigator.One incident was raised in the complaint filed by the Title IX office: an episode in which a woman in the lab told a story about bending down to help an older faculty member tie his shoe. According to several witnesses cited in the investigator\u2019s report, Dr. Fryer launched into an extended monologue implying that the woman had performed fellatio. By at least two accounts, Dr. Fryer put his foot on her desk so that his crotch was in front of her face, in view of several employees, including two other women who told the investigator they were upset by the behavior.The investigator concluded that Dr. Fryer\u2019s \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature was sufficiently severe\u201d that it interfered with the three women\u2019s ability to work.Dr. Fryer told the Harvard investigator that \u201cthat riff\u201d was simply a joke and that the employee it involved was \u201claughing hysterically.\u201d He questioned whether he was being singled out for scrutiny because of his race.\u201cWhy am I the only one who violated policy when many others participated?\u201d he asked, according to the investigator\u2019s report. \u201cIs it because I am the only professor or because of my skin color?\u201dThe report responds directly to that point. The investigator, it said, was troubled that Dr. Fryer \u201cappeared to discount the significance of his roles as a senior faculty member at the university and faculty director of EdLabs.\u201dJim Tankersley reported from Cambridge, Mass., and Ben Casselman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Lord & Taylor, Everything Must Go. A Daughter\u2019s Guilt Will Remain.", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrace NotesThese are the less-than-elegant last days of what, in the days when department stores were destinations, was one of New York City\u2019s most elegant: Lord & Taylor, a fortress on Fifth Avenue.The everything-must-go signs have been up for weeks. They promise huge markdowns, but there is not much left to pick over. Whole floors have been emptied.The building opened when Woodrow Wilson was president. It is being sold to the office-sharing start-up WeWork.But this is not a requiem for the store. It is the story of a mother, a daughter and the daughter\u2019s guilt.The daughter is Jennifer Robinson. The guilt had to do with two plaques at Lord & Taylor and a promise to her mother that she did not keep.\u201cShe always zoomed in on those plaques,\u201d Ms. Robinson, 54, recalled, adding that she herself was struck that \u201cLord & Taylor took the time to put their names up there.\u201dShe said her mother, who was a child during World War II, respected those who had served in the military and felt that the plaques deserved more attention. \u201cShe was frustrated that there was no light on them on Memorial Day, no recognition, no banner, nothing,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.So in August 2015, her mother decided to send a letter about the plaques to Hudson\u2019s Bay, the Canadian retailer that had acquired Lord & Taylor in 2012.\u201cMy daughter and I had been shopping for hours, taking advantage of the sales,\u201d she began. \u201cIt was Memorial Day, and not even one flower was placed there to honor them. They were completely forgotten. The sale was the thing. It was shameful. I want these honor rolls moved to a prominent location, perhaps near the first floor elevator bank. If there is no wall space \u2014 then build one.\u201dMrs. Robinson told her daughter to print it and send it.\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said.By then, her mother was frail \u2014 she had cancer. Every so often, she would ask about the letter to Hudson\u2019s Bay. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Ms. Robinson explained. More than once, she simply said she had not received a reply.If Mrs. Robinson saw through her daughter\u2019s prevaricating, she did not let on.Just before Christmas, the daughter went through Lord & Taylor for a last look at the plaques. There was also some reminiscing about shopping trips with her mother and about how shopping has changed. Why go to stores these days, anyway?It did not help that Lord & Taylor had aged, maybe too gracefully. It lacked the trendsetting appeal of, say, Bloomingdale\u2019s in the 1970s and 1980s. Lord & Taylor \u201cwas the last of the stores that didn\u2019t have loud music,\u201d Ms. Robinson said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t blaring noise. It wasn\u2019t so hipster.\u201dLord & Taylor had long since dropped its everything-under-one-roof strategy, and departments like the cut-flower and plant section and the piano section disappeared. But some throwbacks remained. Ms. Robinson remembered Lord & Taylor\u2019s coat check, and she remembered checking more than a coat.\u201cI checked my guitar once,\u201d she said, mentioning playing in a band called Killdeer. \u201cIt was so nice to dump it and go buy something.\u201dThe coat-check room was way up on the eighth floor, in the same nook as gift wrapping, another department-store tradition. In its earliest days in the 19th century, when it was on the Lower East Side, Lord & Taylor had a rule about how it wrapped customer\u2019s purchases. Anything that cost more than $1 got fancy paper. Items that cost less went home in plain old newspaper.Lord & Taylor\u2019s own start is worthy of the frilly paper. Its beginnings read \u201clike an episode from a Victorian novel,\u201d John William Ferry wrote in his book \u201cA History of the Department Store.\u201d There was the man before the ampersand \u2014 Samuel Lord, the youngest of nine children and orphaned when he was 6, who went on to work in an iron foundry and married the boss\u2019s daughter.The boss was James Taylor. After Lord emigrated from England in 1825, $1,000 from a Taylor relative financed a store he opened near the Bowery. Soon Lord formed a partnership with yet another of his wife\u2019s relatives, and Lord & Taylor was born.As the city migrated uptown after the Civil War, Lord & Taylor followed, arriving in 1914 in the store Ms. Robinson knew so well. The light fixtures that hung from the ceiling on the first floor were originally old-fashioned gas lights, according to a sign in the store. \u201cConverted to electric!\u201d the sign said. The fixtures are being sold for $1,000 each.Lord & Taylor continued some decidedly American traditions after it was acquired by Hudson\u2019s Bay. Even as it conducted its store-closing sale, it played \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d over the public address system before allowing customers inside, as it has done since the 444-day Iran hostage crisis that began in 1979. The store\u2019s chairman at the time ordered the national anthem played \u201cbecause, with all its problems, this is still the greatest country in the world.\u201dBut when Ms. Robinson stepped into the elevator and pressed the button for the eighth floor, a passenger, Cynthia Williams, lamented another tradition that would end with the store\u2019s closing: the windows that were decorated for the holidays.\u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s over,\u201d Ms. Williams said, \u201ceven though there will be the other Lord & Taylors. They\u2019re not the same. This was part of the Christmas experience.\u201d Ms. Robinson nodded.The other stores in the Lord & Taylor chain are not closing. And Hudson\u2019s Bay, which originally said it would maintain a Lord & Taylor presence in the Fifth Avenue building, has decided not to, a spokeswoman said.If Ms. Robinson is still feeling guilt about her mother\u2019s unsent letter \u2014 her mother died in September 2016, at age 76 \u2014 at least there is this. The spokeswoman for Hudson\u2019s Bay, Tiffany Bourr\u00e9, said the plaques would be preserved and taken care of after the store closes for the last time on Wednesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bad Landlord? These Coders Are Here to Help", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Dan Kass moved to New York City in 2013 after graduating from college in Boston, his introduction to the city was one that many New Yorkers are all too familiar with: a bad landlord.Mr. Kass and two roommates rented a cramped basement apartment in Crown Heights in Brooklyn, which they soon found out was riddled with problems and had been rented illegally.\u201cIt was completely without heat in the winter time,\u201d Mr. Kass said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see it when you did the initial walk-through, but there was a huge cockroach infestation behind the walls.\u201dThat personal experience prompted Mr. Kass to join his neighborhood tenant group. He had a degree in computer science, so he used his coding skills to build software that could help tenants.\u201cIt was essentially coffee shop work,\u201d Mr. Kass said. \u201cI was messing around with this stuff in my spare time.\u201dSo were others across the city.Mr. Kass, now 28, is part of a new crop of hackers building easy-to-use, data-driven tools to empower tenants and take on notoriously bad landlords. The goal behind this wave of what coders call \u201ccivic technology\u201d is to create low cost solutions to some of New York City\u2019s most pressing civic problems, like affordable housing.Now, many of these civic coders are trying to band together and formalize a community.For more than a year, Mr. Kass and other housing-data wonks have met each month at a shared work space in Brooklyn to exchange ideas about projects and talk about data sets over beer and snacks. Some come from prominent housing advocacy groups; others work unrelated day jobs. They informally call themselves the Housing Data Coalition.\u201cThe real estate industry has many more programmers, many more developers, many more technical tools at their disposal,\u201d said Ziggy Mintz, 30, a computer programmer who is part of the coalition. \u201cIt never quite seems fair that the tenant side of the equation doesn\u2019t have the same tools.\u201d\u201cOur collaboration is a counteracting force to that,\u201d said Lucy Block, a research and policy associate at the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development, the group behind the Displacement Alert Project. \u201cWe are trying to build the capacity to fight the displacement of low-income people in the city.\u201dThis week, Mr. Kass and his team at JustFix.nyc, a nonprofit technology start-up, launched a new database for tenants that was built off ideas raised during those monthly meetings.Landlords often own numerous residential buildings, each under the guise of a limited liability company. Using separate L.L.C.s allows landlords to protect themselves legally and maintain anonymity.The web of shell companies with obscure names is a hurdle for tenants in different buildings \u2014 on the same block or in another borough \u2014 trying to organize against the same abusive landlord. They often don\u2019t know who their landlord is or what other buildings he or she might own.Who Owns What aims to change that by pulling information from disparate government databases and identifying patterns, like a shared business address among the L.L.C.s \u2014 laborious work that would typically take hours of combing through city finance and housing records.The tool also summarizes a landlord\u2019s history of correcting violations, deregulating apartments and evicting tenants.\u201cThe purpose is for organizers to get to track landlords,\u201d Mr. Kass said, \u201cand get to identify the landlords that are speculative or predatory in their neighborhood and to be able to organize around that.\u201dHe and two others, Ashley Treni and Georges Clement, started JustFix.nyc in 2015. Since its inception, they have built several digital services, including an app that helps tenants keep track of their dispute with a landlord and navigate housing court.Before the official launch of the database, Mr. Kass shared the tool with a handful of housing advocates and legal services providers in May. It quickly spread: More than 4,500 unique users have conducted more than 20,000 searches on the website.The tool has already allowed advocates to get a full grasp of a landlord\u2019s presence in the neighborhoods they work in. It also helps organizers identify and rally tenants living in different buildings owned by the same landlord.\u201cWe can tell them, \u2018There are buildings in other places owned by the same group that have the same conditions.\u2019\u201d said Gregory Louis, director of housing affirmative litigation at Brooklyn Legal Services Corp A. \u201cWithout repudiating canvassing and hustling, it allows us to provide information to folks and build up a force of tenants.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Having disrupted the television and music businesses, the internet is finally threatening the heart of Hollywood.Mr. Stuber\u2019s operation is set up to supply 55 original films a year, including some with budgets as high as $200 million. Add in documentaries and animated movies, handled by other divisions, and the number of annual Netflix film releases climbs to about 90. To compare, Universal, one of Hollywood\u2019s most prolific traditional studios, releases roughly 30 movies a year.\u201cGiven the marginal profitability of the theatrical business, if you lose 10 percent of the audience \u2014 some people stay home \u2014 some cinemas go out of business,\u201d said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, a group whose members believe big screens are part of the very definition of film.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a new studio that is exciting for artists,\u201d Mr. Stuber said. \u201cAs we do that, it\u2019s important to be open to criticism. When a great artist says, \u2018Hey, this doesn\u2019t work,\u2019 then we\u2019d better try to fix it. For some of our filmmakers, that means having a theatrical release and contending for awards.\u201dDon\u2019t expect Netflix to bend much further, however.\u201cIn a world where consumer choice is driving everything \u2014 how we shop, how we order groceries, how we are entertained \u2014 we\u2019re trying to get to a place where consumers have theatrical viewing as a choice,\u201d Mr. Stuber said. \u201cBut we also think it is critical that, if you don\u2019t have the means or the access or the time to go to a theater, you are still able to see movies without a long wait.\u201dMr. Fithian of the theater owners association called Mr. Stuber\u2019s comment about access \u201cabsolute hogwash.\u201d He added, \u201cFor filmmakers who want to go to Netflix, they are kind of selling their soul \u2014 the pot of money versus how they know a movie should be seen.\u201dMr. Scorsese disagrees.

He said the new rule was likely to make sugary drinks more prevalent and contribute to a further spike in the incidence of obesity and diabetes.Dr. Wijesuriya added that Mr. Sirisena, a former health minister, once backed the 50-cent tax and should have pushed back on any effort by his own cabinet to weaken it.\u201cIf he stood by his convictions, he should have avoided this issue by getting the prime minister not to do this kind of thing,\u201d Dr. Wijesuriya said in a telephone interview.Representatives for the offices of the Sri Lankan president and the prime minister did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.Samantha Mendis-Wedage, a spokeswoman for Nestl\u00e9 Lanka, declined to comment on the sweetened beverage tax. \u201cAs always, we will continue to comply with the rules and regulations of the country,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWe are committed to reduce sugar, salt and fat in our products and our work in that direction will continue.\u201dBut sales of sugar-sweetened beverages are increasing in many low- and middle-income countries even as they decrease in high-income countries, the report said.

{"Headline": "Cory Booker Isn\u2019t Yet Running for President. But a Supporter is Launching a Super PAC to Back Him.", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA prominent donor plans to raise $10 million in the coming months for a new super PAC to boost Senator Cory Booker\u2019s expected presidential campaign \u2014 marking the first infusion of big money into the Democratic primary and setting the stage for a reckoning within the party over the role of super PACs.Steve Phillips, an influential San Francisco-based Democratic donor and activist, said he would formally file paperwork on Thursday to create the pro-Booker super PAC, Dream United. Mr. Booker, who represents New Jersey, has yet to announce whether he is running, let alone whether he would welcome super PAC support.A first well-funded super PAC of 2020 could aid Mr. Booker in amplifying his message in what is expected to be a historically crowded field, and it speaks to the depth of his support from potential financiers. But such support could also backfire as the grass-roots base of the party is increasingly calling to curtail the political influence of the wealthy.Mr. Phillips said he had already collected $4 million in commitments. And he suggested he would continue collecting money regardless of whether Mr. Booker wanted his support.\u201cThis is actually bigger than Cory,\u201d Mr. Phillips, a civil rights lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cAnd so those of us who are enthusiastic about what he brings and what he offers the country will continue to work to try to have him become our next president and replace the current president.\u201dJeff Giertz, a spokesman for Mr. Booker, said Mr. Booker \u201ccontinues to weigh\u201d a run and that \u201cany effort to draft him into the race is outside of his control and will not affect his decision.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere has been no activity on his part or that of his team to organize or endorse the creation of a super PAC.\u201dOther candidates are more likely to have super PACs. An effort to draft Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio into the race would likely become a pro-Brown super PAC, if he runs. And talks have occurred about a potential super PAC that would be run by former advisers to Senator Kamala Harris of California \u2014 her team has said they have no plans to encourage or support the formation of one.Super PACs are appealing because direct donations to presidential primary campaigns are subject to strict limits ($2,700 in 2016). But no limits exist on the amount that can be contributed to super PACs. As a result, critics say such groups distort the democratic process by giving major donors too much sway.Mr. Phillips said his PAC will focus initially on increasing turnout among minorities and liberal white voters in Southern states, with a particular focus on South Carolina, which will host the first nominating contest in a state with a significant African-American population. His super PAC would skip the first two nominating contests \u2014 in the overwhelmingly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire.Mr. Phillips, who is African-American, is experienced in mounting early independent spending campaigns in Democratic primaries.Mr. Phillips\u2019s groups spent $11 million helping Mr. Obama\u2019s successful 2008 campaign, even as the future president never embraced his efforts.\u201cWhat we did in \u201908 is likely what we\u2019ll do this time around,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.Mr. Phillips compared Mr. Booker to former President Obama, saying both have \u201cthe ability to inspire people across the economic spectrum.\u201d He said he hoped that his new PAC \u201cwill be as synergistic as possible\u201d with a Booker campaign.Mr. Booker has not yet even formed a formal presidential exploratory committee, though he has flirted with running and said he would consider it over the coming holidays. He has traveled extensively in 2018, visiting two dozen states including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Mr. Phillips said he knew people who interviewed for Booker campaign jobs.Mr. Phillips named two early donors supportive of his pro-Booker 2020 effort: his wife Susan Sandler, a philanthropist who is the daughter of the billionaire Democratic donor, Herb Sandler, and Dr. Gary Michelson, a billionaire philanthropist and surgeon in Los Angeles.By announcing first, Mr. Phillips appears to be trying to corner the market on having the main pro-Booker super PAC.\u201cIt\u2019s more efficient for the donor world for there to be one point of contact so we\u2019re setting up to play that role,\u201d he said.Asked about concerns among some Democrats that a super PAC could backfire, Mr. Phillips said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a detriment in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Mississippi and Alabama,\u201d states where he could be involved.In 2018, other super PACs affiliated with Mr. Phillips spent more than $2 million on Mike Espy in his failed bid for Senate in Mississippi and millions more for Stacey Abrams in her losing bid for Georgia governor.\u201cNot enough people read it,\u201d Mr. Booker said of Mr. Phillips\u2019s book. \u201cI appreciated your championing of it,\u201d Mr. Phillips replied.Advertisement"}

It also set a precedent that could pave the way for similar actions in other states \u2014 even though courts have ruled that much of the North Carolina package violates the state constitution.In Wisconsin, the effort played out in a rancorous all-night debate on Wednesday at the Statehouse, where, as protesters chanted in anger, Republican lawmakers pushed through bills limiting the power of Tony Evers, the incoming Democratic governor, and Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul.Democrats there may follow the lead of those in North Carolina with lawsuits that could cast uncertainty over the exercise of power for several years.\u201cThe legislature gets to make the laws, but when the legislature starts to try and undermine the ability of the governor to effectuate and implement the laws, they\u2019re getting out of their lane,\u201d Ms. Riggs said. If, for example, \u201ccontrol of the Board of Elections is taken away from him and instead is more vested in the legislature,\u201d she added, \u201cthen the legislature becomes the one who\u2019s trying to implement the laws, and that\u2019s an executive duty.\u201dNorth Carolina\u2019s courts have almost universally agreed with that argument. But the legal battles are still dragging on, largely because the legislature has responded to many of the judicial rebukes by passing slightly different versions of the same measure, which are then litigated all over again. In the meantime, the state operates under many of the challenged rules, and a cloud of uncertainty.On Wednesday, just hours after Wisconsin legislators passed their bills, a Superior Court judge in North Carolina struck down another part of the legislative changes, which had limited Mr. Cooper\u2019s ability to appoint members of the state\u2019s unemployment compensation board.Rulings in Wisconsin might or might not be the same. \u201cMost litigation on this kind of stuff comes down to what the state constitutions may say about the ability of the legislatures to take powers away from the governor,\u201d said Gerry Cohen, a former lawyer for the North Carolina General Assembly. \u201cPartly it depends on how the constitution allocates the powers.\u201dThe cases in North Carolina have been litigated in state courts, under the North Carolina Constitution. When it comes to the separation of powers, most state constitutions contain similar language; the main difference in Wisconsin could be judges\u2019 interpretation of that language.Court rulings often depend on the composition of the court. The North Carolina Supreme Court, whose members are elected in statewide races, has a Democratic majority. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, while officially nonpartisan, has a 4-to-3 conservative majority.Still, the outcomes in North Carolina do not bode particularly well for Republicans elsewhere who want to replicate its model. The litigation has cost taxpayers millions of dollars, and Democrats in the state \u2014 many of them furious at the legislature\u2019s actions \u2014 have broken Republicans\u2019 supermajorities in the General Assembly and increased their own State Supreme Court majority.\u201cIt costs a ton of money, and it really distracts from doing anything effective for the people of the state,\u201d Ms. Riggs said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to me that folks in Wisconsin look at North Carolina and say: \u2018We should do that too. It ended so well.\u2019 It really didn\u2019t.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the day on which a North Carolina judge struck down part of a series of legislative changes.

{"Headline": "A Yacht, a Monet, a See-Through Piano: The U.S. Collects on a Fugitive\u2019s Shopping Spree", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe van Gogh and the Monet are safely in storage in Switzerland. The Oscar that once belonged to Marlon Brando is in a federal warehouse in Texas. Those were easy enough to corral.But when the $250 million yacht was finally captured in Bali, the United States government couldn\u2019t let it bob in the water unattended, so it had to pay for a crew. The $35 million Bombardier jet has been grounded, but it needed an engine test costing up to $25,000.And no one is quite sure what to do with the see-through grand piano now sitting in a supermodel\u2019s Malibu home. It won\u2019t fit through the door.It is so expansive that just tracking down, retrieving and maintaining the loot has become a complex multinational operation in itself.Court documents and interviews describe a recovery effort that involves half a dozen federal agencies, a bevy of contractors and investigators in countries including Switzerland, Luxembourg and Malaysia.The process has been slowed because of the pending criminal case, which itself is lagging because Mr. Low, 37, is a fugitive believed to be hiding in China. There are also thorny legal issues because Mr. Low and some of the other defendants have denied wrongdoing and are challenging the forfeitures.Several of the items are owned by trusts, and Mr. Low \u201cdoes not consider it proper for any government to seize property belonging to the trusts or himself,\u201d said Robin Rathmell, Mr. Low\u2019s lawyer.The fund at the center of the investigation, called the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund or 1MDB, was supposed to benefit ordinary Malaysians. It raised billions of dollars from banks and borrowed from investors, ostensibly to finance projects like a joint venture with a Saudi oil company and the purchase of power plants.But prosecutors say 1MDB became a \u201cmassive, brazen and blatant\u201d money-laundering scheme, in which billions were diverted into the bank accounts of senior officials, including the former prime minister Najib Razak, his family and associates and Mr. Low.Laundering the money, prosecutors say, involved a complex network of opaque bank accounts and shell companies registered in exotic locations like the British Virgin Islands.But the idea was simple: Use 1MDB as a vehicle to draw in big money.And then spend it.Some $200 million was used to buy artwork. There was a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth $27.3 million, said to have been given to Mr. Najib\u2019s wife. (Her lawyers say that while she saw the necklace, which has gone missing, she never actually received it.)Tens of millions of dollars went toward financing Hollywood films including \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and \u201cDaddy\u2019s Home\u201d through a production studio called Red Granite Pictures, which was owned by Riza Aziz, Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson. Red Granite has settled with the government for $60 million without admitting wrongdoing.A quarter billion was spent on a custom-built mega-yacht with a movie theater, helicopter pad and enough space for dozens of crew members. Indonesian authorities said the boat\u2019s transponder was turned off at times, making it difficult for the F.B.I. to track it, but the yacht, called the Equanimity, was finally seized in Bali this year. The United States then staffed it with a crew until it was turned over to Malaysia\u2019s custody.Mr. Low, who had a self-proclaimed taste for the very finest things, also used some of the money to lavish gifts on celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and the Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, prosecutors say.Mark Fabiani, a lawyer for Ms. Kerr, said she is happy to relinquish the piano. But it\u2019s not clear that it is worth the effort to get it out.\u201cIf you move it, you might damage it, and then you have to restore it,\u201d said Michael Case, the asset forfeiture coordinator for the United States Marshals Service in Manhattan, speaking generally about such operations.This extraction would be especially complicated.When Mr. Tol delivered the piano, he was horrified to learn it would be left on an outdoor deck, protected only by an overhang.\u201cThis was hurting my soul very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI strongly advised them to close that area.\u201dMs. Kerr followed his advice. But those new walls are a problem for the government, which believes it would have to do some demolition to get the piano out, according to two people with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorized to speak publicly. Then a very expensive house would have to be repaired.So for now, the piano stays. Other tokens of Mr. Low\u2019s esteem have been easier to retrieve. Ms. Kerr handed over a substantial amount of jewelry, including an 11.71-carat heart-shaped diamond and a pair of 11-carat diamond earrings.In Malaysia itself, the haul has been immense. Just days after Mr. Najib was voted out, the police raided six residences connected to him. They seized 35 bags of cash in 26 currencies, and it took 22 officers three days to determine their full value \u2014 about $30 million. There were bags of gold (25), Hermes handbags (272) and watches (423). Everything is being stored in Kuala Lumpur at the Malaysian central bank.\u201cThe numbers were just too huge for us to do the accounting on the premises,\u201d said Amar Singh, who led the asset seizures for the Royal Malaysian Police.Mr. Najib has denied wrongdoing, and Farhan Shafee, a member of his legal team, said, \u201cAs far as we can see and as far as the documents provided show, the assets that were seized have nothing to do with the charges that have been brought.\u201dAs for Mr. Tol, the piano maker, he said he felt terrible if he had unwittingly accepted money \u201cdestined for the normal people of Malaysia.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not my way of life.\u201dVickey Barron, a real estate broker who sold a $51 million penthouse in New York City\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood to another man later implicated in the 1MDB case, Khadem al-Qubaisi, recalled the transaction as a blur. (Mr. al-Qubaisi has been jailed in Abu Dhabi since 2016, making it difficult to defend himself, his lawyer said.)An entourage of about half a dozen people had zipped through a tour of the apartment, and within a day, a representative called to say they would take it.She called it one of the strangest deals she\u2019d ever done. \u201cI take longer to buy a pair of sneakers,\u201d she said, \u201cthan he took to buy the apartment.\u201dMuktita Suhartono contributed reporting from Bangkok.

{"Headline": "COP24, the New Round of Global Climate Talks, Has Begun. We Answer Three Key Questions.", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is going to be one of the most difficult negotiations we\u2019ve seen yet,\u201d said Andrew Light, a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under President Barack Obama. \u201cThere are so many moving parts.\u201d To understand the Katowice meeting, it\u2019s useful to recall that the Paris climate agreement was largely intended to work through peer pressure among nations. Under the Paris agreement, countries aren\u2019t required to submit legally binding plans for reducing emissions. Instead, each country submits a voluntary plan tailored to its own domestic situation. This structure, the architects of the Paris deal said, was the most realistic way to get every world leader to agree to participate.But those architects also realized that countries aren\u2019t doing nearly enough to keep the world below 2 degrees Celsius of warming. So, under Paris, countries are required to meet periodically, assess their collective progress and see where stronger action can be taken. World leaders could then push each other to ratchet up their ambitions over time. At least, that\u2019s the theory.But for this peer-pressure dynamic to have any chance of working, analysts say, countries will need to track and report their progress on curbing emissions in a transparent, standardized way. And they\u2019ll need to offer much more detail on how they intend to cut fossil-fuel emissions in the future, so that outside experts can scrutinize their plans and point out exactly where current climate policies are falling short.Right now, this is often difficult to do. For instance, many countries, like Indonesia, have pledged to reduce their emissions below a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d trajectory. But without a clearer sense of what counts as business as usual, it can be hard to track how much these countries are really doing.The rule book is expected to provoke fierce debate. Some developing countries have argued that they should be given much more leeway in how they report and track their progress, especially if they have limited technical capacity to measure their emissions. China, in particular, has long been wary of outside scrutiny.Other countries, like the United States and Europe, are leery of holding countries like China, India and others to a lower standard because developing nations account for 60 percent of global emissions today.Money is another perennial sticking point. India and African countries, for example, have long insisted that wealthy nations need to provide more financing to help poorer governments shift to clean energy or adapt to the impacts of global warming. They have pushed for much more detailed pledges on aid.Looming over all these debates is the uncertain role of the United States, which played a critical part in bringing countries together to finalize the initial Paris agreement in 2015.While the State Department is still sending a team to negotiate the rule book, the Trump administration has largely repudiated the Paris deal and has refused to send an additional $2 billion in climate aid that had been pledged by the Obama administration at Paris. It is still unclear how much influence the United States will have at this newest round of talks, or whether any other countries might step in to take a leadership role.\u201cThe global political environment is really challenging right now, with nationalism taking hold in many countries,\u201d said Samantha Gross, a fellow in the Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate, in a recent telephone call with reporters. The most important work on climate change policy will continue to be done by national and local governments around the world; by private businesses, investors and individuals; and by scientists and engineers developing clean-energy technologies.\u201cWhile this multilateral process is important, it is not the solution to climate change,\u201d said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. \u201cAt best, it can help facilitate climate action over time.\u201dOne big question is whether the negotiators will wrap up the talks with a strong rule book in hand. Under the Paris deal, countries have informally agreed to consider revising their near-term emissions pledges by 2020 to make them stronger. Analysts will be watching to see if countries emerge from Katowice with a clear intent to increase their ambitions,\u00a0or if the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to tackle climate change might persuade other leaders to slacken their own efforts.If negotiators at Katowice struggle to agree on a robust rule book, or the talks deadlock entirely, that could further sap global momentum for climate action.\u201cThe worst case is a complete collapse of talks, which would be seen as an unraveling of the Paris agreement,\u201d said Mr. Diringer. \u201cBut for that reason, I think that\u2019s an outcome most governments would like to avoid.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then a warship appeared, its guns pointed at the boat.Bullets thumped into the water around the boat, the Afaq, then rippled through its flimsy wooden hull. One fishermen was shot in the eye, another in the head. The engine caught fire. Crew members leapt overboard, including Bashar Qasim, 11.Moments earlier, the boy had been hauling nets from the stern. Now, he paddled for his life amid the flaming debris and floating corpses, with survivors clinging to empty water drums.

Both the Saudi-led coalition and its Houthi foes, who are backed by Iran, have carried out attacks at sea.But maritime experts, a former United States Navy officer, United Nations investigators and several Yemeni officials said there was little doubt that the Saudi-led coalition was responsible for some if not all of the violence against fishermen.Saudi and Emirati naval boats dominate the Red Sea waters where the shootings and bombings took place. Five involved attack helicopters, which the Houthis do not have. In one instance, Saudi officials made cash payments of nearly $500,000 to the families of fishermen killed in an attack.In another, coalition sailors detained 12 survivors and held them for three months in a Saudi prison, where the fishermen said they were interrogated and tortured. Eight of those detainees were recently released after receiving a payment of $1,300 each from their Saudi captors.\u201cA soldier posed with us in the prison for a photo and said, \u2018Sorry if we hurt you,\u2019\u201d Yaqoub Okad, 20, said in an interview after his return to Yemen.In a statement issued via the embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, a coalition spokesman, Col. Turki al-Malki, confirmed that a coalition vessel had opened fire on that boat, the Ansar, and captured 12 fishermen. He said the boat\u2019s crew had ignored warnings from a warship accompanying a Saudi oil tanker through the Red Sea. Three of the fishermen turned out to be \u201carmed Houthi terrorists,\u201d he said.Colonel Malki declined to answer questions about the other five attacks between Aug. 1 and Sept. 15, which he said had been referred to the coalition\u2019s internal investigations body.Although American military support for the Saudi-led coalition is not as extensive in the sea as in the air, there is tight cooperation in many areas. The United States Navy shares intelligence with the Saudi Navy and has bombed Houthi radar stations. The Saudi Navy uses American helicopters, and its officers have been trained by a Virginia-based contractor.And some coalition strikes at sea have been carried out by warplanes armed with American laser-guided bombs and, until last month, refueled in mid-air by American supertankers.Cmdr. Josh Frey, a spokesman for the Fifth Fleet, said the United States provided \u201climited, noncombat support to the Saudi-led maritime coalition, such as intelligence sharing against threats, to include attacks on Red Sea shipping.\u201dThe United States, he added, had no knowledge of the attacks on fishing vessels.The southern Red Sea is one of the planet\u2019s most congested, commercially important and perilous waterways.The attacks spiked over the summer as the coalition stepped up its assault on the key, Houthi-controlled port of Hudaydah. Coalition warships pummeled Houthi positions with naval barrages. The Houthis retaliated by launching speedboats rigged with explosives to hit Saudi oil tankers.One such strike in late July caused Saudi Arabia to temporarily halt oil shipments through the Red Sea. A week later, on Aug. 1, the first of the six fishing boats set out from the coalition-controlled port of Khokha.The Qaiser, a 40-foot wooden trawler, carried a fishing permit issued a day earlier by the local authorities, which are financed and supported by the coalition. About five hours into its journey, a helicopter circled overhead, followed by a warplane, which dropped a bomb on the boat.Nine of the 11 crew members were killed instantly. Ahmed Buhairi, 35, was flung into the water. \u201cThe fire was like a circle and I was in the middle of it,\u201d he said, lifting his clothes to show extensive burns to his limbs and torso.The other survivor, Faiz Abdullah, 24, swam around looking for survivors. \u201cAll I found was a headless body,\u201d he said.More attacks followed in quick succession.On Aug. 14, the Afaq, with 11-year-old Bashar Qasim on board, was sunk.On Aug. 18, a warship opened fire on the Amira, killing three fishermen. The boat limped back to port at 3 a.m., carrying a wounded man who died as it moored, said its captain, Abdo Thabet, who was shot in the ankle.The Amira, which lay under palm trees on a nearby beach, was scarred by at least 26 bullet holes. The diameter and shape of the holes were consistent with those made by heavy and medium machine guns, the kind typically found aboard navy frigates.The following day, an attack helicopter sank the Rannan, killing four of the 10 fishermen on board. Survivors described a gunner in military uniform in the bay door of the helicopter who ignored their pleas to stop shooting. \u201cWe held up fish to show we were not a threat,\u201d said Abdo Afdah, 30, who was shot in the hand as he clung to the upturned boat. \u201cHe kept firing.\u201dDays later came the attack on the Ansar, when a warship escorting a Saudi oil tanker killed seven men. This time, though, the warship did not sail away.The 12 survivors plucked from the sea were taken to the Saudi city of Jizan, where they were imprisoned for three months. Several said they were tortured. \u201cThey whipped us until we bled,\u201d said Tareq Moutairi. \u201cThey said we were Houthi spies.\u201dColonel Malki, the coalition spokesman, said three of the fishermen were armed Houthi militants who had been relaying details about military and civilian ships to Houthi leaders. They are still in detention in Saudi Arabia. Colonel Malki did not account for the seven men killed in the initial attack.The released fishermen, who returned to Yemen on Nov. 21, insisted that the detainees were innocent. \u201cI know those men since childhood,\u201d said Walid Hassani. \u201cThey are not Houthis.\u201dSitting with his children outside his simple beachfront home, Mr. Zayed recounted his struggle with hunger, thirst and hallucinations. \u201cI felt that someone was bringing me dates and water at night,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I survived.\u201dThe assessment team has not said when or whether it will examine the five fishing boat attacks referred to it by the coalition.It was not possible to independently confirm the assertions by survivors and local officials that none of the boats carried Houthi militants. However, experts said it was unlikely that Houthis would have been aboard boats sailing from ports controlled by the Saudi coalition.Michael Knights, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has visited coalition forces in Yemen, said the attacks could be the mistakes of young, inexperienced or poorly trained sailors.Houthi attacks on coalition oil tankers and military vessels, including one that killed four Emiratis in June, had set the Saudi-led forces on edge, he said, and they tended to open fire easily on potential threats.\u201cClearly there\u2019s an escalation-of-force issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recurring problem that needs to get fixed.\u201dA number of European countries have halted arms sales to Riyadh to protest its indiscriminate tactics in Yemen. The Trump administration, in an attempt to defuse growing congressional pressure, has halted in-flight refueling for coalition warplanes.Those measures are unlikely to affect the sea war.\u201cYemeni fishermen are being bombed in their boats, just as they were being bombed 18 months ago,\u201d said Kristine Beckerle, a Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cAnd nothing has changed.\u201dIn one instance, the Saudis tried to make amends.In late September, the families of the 18 fishermen who died on the Faris were summoned to the coalition\u2019s base in Khokha. There, a Saudi official gave each family an envelope containing 100,000 Saudi riyals\u201a about $27,000. Weeks later, more help arrived: new fishing boats, nets and outboard engines for each family.The Saudis called the money a humanitarian donation. The villagers saw it as blood money.\u201cIt isn\u2019t worth a single fingernail of my brother,\u201d said Munir Manubi, speaking in the nearby village of Kudah, where the Faris was based.Other grieving relatives gathered around him openly criticized the Saudi-led coalition. Families were left with no breadwinner. Many fishermen had stopped work, fearing that they too could be attacked.Ahmad Abdullah, whose son died in the attack on the Faris, said only one thing would satisfy him: \u201crevenge.\u201dHis voice trembled. Some men in the village had been warned by local officials to keep quiet about their trauma, he said. He didn\u2019t care.\u201cWe are speaking out,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause of the pain in our hearts.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshReporting was contributed by Saeed al-Batati from Mukalla, Yemen; Eric Schmitt from Washington; and C.J.

{"Headline": "Facebook Closes 5 Accounts Tied to Russia-Like Tactics in Alabama Senate Race", "Date": "2018-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an unusual move against Russian-style election deception inside the United States, Facebook said on Saturday it had removed five accounts of Americans who used its platform improperly in the hard-fought Alabama Senate election last year.Among those whose accounts were removed was a prominent social media researcher who worked on the Alabama operation, Jonathon Morgan, according to a person briefed on the company\u2019s action. Facebook did not name those whose accounts were closed, and it was not immediately possible to identify the others.Mr. Morgan has said the operation was an experiment to learn more about the kinds of methods Russia had used, and not to influence the outcome of the race. But the episode has sparked fears that the fraudulent Russian operations on social media could be imitated widely by American political operatives and further undermine voters\u2019 ability to sort truth from fakery as they choose candidates.The group that carried out the Alabama operation, composed of tech specialists who leaned Democratic, created a Facebook page on which they posed as conservative Alabamians. That page was shut down in 2017. They also used Twitter accounts that looked Russian \u2014 described as a \u201cfalse flag\u201d scheme in an internal report on the project \u2014 to create the impression that Russian accounts were following Mr. Moore.Elections experts have said there was little chance that the $100,000 project could have had a significant impact on a race in which more than $50 million was spent, including in the primaries.In a statement on Saturday, Facebook said it had shut down \u201cfive accounts run by multiple individuals for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook around the Alabama special election, and our investigation is ongoing. We take a strong stand against people or organizations that create networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are or what they\u2019re doing.\u201dFacebook said it shuts down more than 1 million accounts each month worldwide for violating its rules. But for a researcher like Mr. Morgan, the chief executive of a cyber security firm based in Austin, Tex., called New Knowledge, the move is bound to be a stinging embarrassment. He did not reply to a request for comment on Saturday.In interviews with The Times this week, Mr. Morgan acknowledged his role in the secret Alabama operation on Facebook and Twitter but described it as a small experiment designed to understand such techniques.The internal report on the project\u2019s results, evidently prepared for those who financed it, stated in strong language that it was in fact intended to help Mr. Jones and hurt Mr. Moore and that its operators believed it had succeeded in doing so. The project was funded by Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a supporter of Democratic candidates, though a colleague of his said he did not approve of the use of deception on social media.A Twitter spokeswoman citing users\u2019 privacy, declined to say whether it had taken any action in response to the reports on the Alabama project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Qatar Says It Will Leave OPEC and Focus on Natural Gas", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The tiny, wealthy Persian Gulf state of Qatar will withdraw from OPEC in January, the country\u2019s energy minister said on Monday, hinting that it wanted freedom from an oil cartel dominated by Saudi Arabia, one of its regional rivals.The minister, Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, said Qatar would focus on its gas industry and dismissed the idea that the withdrawal was connected to politics, but not without taking a jab at Saudi Arabia and its clout in the organization.But the decision by Qatar, whose citizens have the highest per capita income of any country thanks to its status as the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, to leave OPEC after nearly six decades of membership is nonetheless a blow to the group and a possible sign of tensions within it.\u201cWe are not saying we are going to get out of the oil business, but it is controlled by an organization managed by a country,\u201d Mr. Kaabi said, without naming which country he meant.Qatar, he said, was unwilling \u201cto put efforts and resources and time in an organization that we are a very small player in, and I don\u2019t have a say in what happens.\u201dNo other countries have joined the boycott, and the United States, which has a large military base in Qatar and counts Saudi Arabia as a crucial ally in the Middle East, has sought to end the feud.Qatar has increasingly gone its own way and seemingly given up its hopes of reconciliation with Riyadh, doubling down on its ties with Turkey and political Islamists across the Arab world, and increasing its coordination with Iran, with which it shares a large gas field.In his remarks to reporters on Monday, Mr. Kaabi said Qatar had communicated its decision to withdraw from OPEC to the organization that morning. Qatar still planned to attend a meeting in Vienna this week, he said.At 600,000 barrels a day, Qatar\u2019s oil output is about 2 percent of OPEC\u2019s total \u2014 compared with more than 10 million barrels produced by Saudi Arabia or the three million produced by the United Arab Emirates.\u201cIn terms of immediate oil market impact, it doesn\u2019t feel as if it makes much difference,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm.Saudi Arabia and Russia, which is not an OPEC member, have largely been dictating terms with regard to production since then, a circumstance that has irritated other OPEC members, especially Iran.Saudi Arabia and Russia \u201cdictate any cooperation to balance the market,\u201d said Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa for Eurasiagroup, a research firm. \u201cIt is not actually the other states.\u201dQatar\u2019s defection could raise questions about OPEC\u2019s ability to enforce future production cuts. And even as the country professes a heightened focus on natural gas, if it were to make new oil finds, it could increase production without OPEC constraints.Prices surged on Monday after it emerged at the Group of 20 meeting over the weekend that Russia and Saudi Arabia would continue to cooperate on managing the market. The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose above $63 a barrel.The country shares the world\u2019s largest gas field, the so-called North Field, with Iran, giving it reason to maintain a good working relationship with Tehran despite the continuing tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.Natural gas does not come under OPEC\u2019s purview and involves different players. Other top exporters of liquefied natural gas include Australia, Russia and, increasingly, the United States.There was little apparent reason for Qatar\u2019s natural gas activities to conflict with its membership in OPEC. The country has spent decades building its natural gas industry while belonging to the group. It has developed its resources in partnership with major oil companies including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell.\u201cThey have decided they just don\u2019t want to be involved in negotiations and cutting production,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consultancy. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to make the sacrifice.\u201dBut Mr. Lynch said Qatar\u2019s move did not necessarily have broader meaning for other OPEC members. \u201cThe smaller producers like Ecuador, if they don\u2019t cut, nobody seems to care,\u201d he added.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and Stanley Reed from London.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Central Bank Ends One of the Biggest Money-Printing Programs Ever", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrankfurt \u2014 One of the biggest money-printing programs of all time, a geyser of cash that may have prevented the collapse of the eurozone, will officially end in a few weeks in a slow-motion wrap-up that reflects lingering risks to the region.The European Central Bank said on Thursday that at the end of December it would stop adding to its stock of government and corporate bonds, the so-called quantitative easing program it has used to hold down interest rates and encourage lending.After a decade marked by recessions, financial crises and political turmoil that nearly tore the eurozone apart, the wind-down of the bond-buying program showed that the central bank was confident enough in the eurozone\u2019s health to begin taking the region off life support. It was also a vindication of sorts.Although not a surprise, the end to the stimulus program \u2014 or more precisely, the end of its expansion \u2014 was a milestone for the euro a few weeks before the currency marks its 20th birthday.The decision by the central bank\u2019s Governing Council in early 2015 to begin buying hundreds of billions of euros of government bonds was momentous at the time and also controversial. It generated legal challenges and friction within the council, which includes representatives from all 19 countries in the eurozone.The program survived and ultimately changed forever the way that the European Central Bank fights crises, while bolstering its credibility.Quantitative easing \u201cis part now of the toolbox; it\u2019s permanent,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said Thursday. Previously, the European Central Bank was seen as lacking the firepower of the Federal Reserve Board. But now, Mr. Draghi said, the bank is \u201clike other central banks in terms of the array of tools it can use.\u201dThe move to end the nearly four-year effort was expected. The bank signaled in June that the bond-buying program, which pumped 2.5 trillion newly created euros, or $2.8 trillion, into the eurozone economy, would probably end in December. The central bank\u2019s governing council affirmed the decision at a meeting on Thursday.The central bank nonetheless appeared to have some doubts about the eurozone\u2019s vitality. The sentiment is shared by many economists, and the central bank reassured investors on Thursday that the reduction to its bond holdings would be a calculated affair.The bank said in a statement that, even though it would not increase its total holdings of government bonds after December, it would reinvest the money it gets when the bonds mature. It also pledged to keep reinvesting the principal even after it starts to raise interest rates from their current record lows.That means an enormous stockpile of government bonds will remain in the central bank\u2019s possession for years. The central bank emphasized on Thursday that it was in no hurry to reduce its holdings, and reiterated that it would not begin to raise interest rates before the end of next summer.\u201cThe latest data and survey results have been weaker than expected,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference. \u201cThis may suggest some slower growth momentum ahead.\u201dThe eurozone is undoubtedly in better shape than it was when the central bank began the quantitative-easing program early in 2015 as some pundits were predicting the euro\u2019s demise.But in recent months, growth has slowed and risks have grown, including a rise in global trade tensions, tumult in Italy\u2019s politics and the continuing chaos surrounding Britain\u2019s plans to decouple from the European Union.In one particularly ominous sign, Germany\u2019s economy, which tends to set the pace for the eurozone, actually shrank slightly from July through September. Mr. Draghi highlighted some other risks Thursday, including jumpy financial markets and weakness in some emerging markets.By reinvesting money from maturing bonds, the central bank will still be keeping a lid on market interest rates, or yields, said Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y.\u201cYields will not go up because the E.C.B. has stopped buying new bonds, although downward pressure on interest rates will remain steady rather than increase every month,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said in an email. \u201cThe excess liquidity remains in the banking system as long as the E.C.B. keeps its bond holdings steady.\u201dBefore the program began, some experts had said that quantitative easing couldn\u2019t be done in the eurozone. The eurozone is not a government and does not issue bonds. There was no form of pan-regional debt comparable to the U.S. Treasury bonds that the Federal Reserve bought as part of its emergency stimulus program.The European Central Bank solved that problem by buying bonds issued by its 19 member countries roughly in proportion to the size of their economies. It also bought bonds issued by eurozone corporations.The program generated bitter criticism from some citizens and economists, particularly in Germany, who saw it as a de facto bailout of countries like Italy and Spain that, they said, should have been forced to solve their own problems. Critics also argued that the central bank was effectively providing financing to governments in violation of European Union law.But the program withstood legal challenges, making it easier for the central bank to use quantitative easing in the future.Mr. Draghi declined to specify what it would take for the European Central Bank to ramp up bond purchases again.A debate percolates among economists whether the bond-buying program did any good.Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German bank, said he believed the main effect was psychological.\u201cI think it was more the announcement of the program \u2014 that the E.C.B. was doing something \u2014 than the program itself,\u201d Mr. Schmieding said in Frankfurt this week. \u201cIt fueled a certain optimism.\u201dMr. Draghi said Thursday that the program had indeed achieved its goal of pushing down market interest rates, and also made the eurozone banking system safer by increasing the value of bonds that banks had in their portfolios. At times during the eurozone crisis, \u201cQ.E. has been the only driver of this recovery,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.But he acknowledged that its benefits were not spread evenly.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that not everybody participated in the benefits of the common currency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should find the reasons why.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The cabinet shake-up on Thursday was no exception, as many of those promoted were close associates of Prince Mohammed.New officials were named to lead the National Guard, the General Directorate of Public Security and the Information Ministry. King Salman also ordered the creation of a national space agency to be led by another of his sons, Prince Sultan bin Salman, who was the first Arab astronaut.Among those moved in the series of royal decrees announced on Saudi state television was Adel al-Jubeir, who had become one of the best-known Saudi officials in the West in his posts as foreign minister and, previously, as ambassador to the United States.Mr. Jubeir was removed from the position of foreign minister but was named minister of state for foreign affairs. It was not immediately clear how his duties would change.Ibrahim al-Assaf, a former finance minister, was appointed foreign minister.It was not immediately clear why Mr. Jubeir\u2019s role was changed. Despite coming from a nonroyal background, he had held some of the kingdom\u2019s leading positions for maintaining its relationship with the United States, its most important ally.Mr. Jubeir, who earned a master\u2019s degree in international relations from Georgetown University, has held a number of diplomatic posts. He rose to prominence by voicing the kingdom\u2019s perspective to the West, including during the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91 and after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Most of the perpetrators of those attacks were Saudis.He served as a translator for the previous monarch, King Abdullah, who named him ambassador to Washington. After King Salman ascended to the throne in 2015, he named Mr. Jubeir foreign minister, a job that many at the time did not expect him to hold for long because he was not a prince.After his release, he attended a cabinet meeting and then joined the Saudi delegation to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Neither he nor the Saudi government has ever publicly explained why he was detained.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Negotiators Reach an Overtime Deal to Keep Paris Pact Alive ", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKATOWICE, Poland \u2014 Diplomats from nearly 200 countries reached a deal on Saturday to keep the Paris climate agreement alive by adopting a detailed set of rules to implement the pact.The deal, struck after an all-night bargaining session, will ultimately require every country in the world to follow a uniform set of standards for measuring their planet-warming emissions and tracking their climate policies. And it calls on countries to step up their plans to cut emissions ahead of another round of talks in 2020.It also calls on richer countries to be clearer about the aid they intend to offer to help poorer nations install more clean energy or build resilience against natural disasters. And it builds a process in which countries that are struggling to meet their emissions goals can get help in getting back on track.The United States agreed to the deal despite President Trump\u2019s vow to abandon the Paris Agreement. Diplomats and climate change activists said they hoped that fact would make it easier for the administration to change its mind and stay in the Paris Agreement, or for a future president to embrace the accord once again. The United States cannot formally withdraw from the agreement until late 2020.\u201cThe U.S. got a clear methodology to make sure that China and India are meeting their targets,\u201d said Jake Schmidt, international policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThat creates the level playing field they have been asking for.\u201dThree years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, they are still far off-track from preventing severe global warming in the decades ahead, new data shows.But supporters of the deal reached Saturday said that they hoped the new rules would help build a virtuous cycle of trust and cooperation among countries, at a time when global politics seems increasingly fractured.\u201cParticularly given the broader geopolitical context, this is a pretty solid outcome,\u201d said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. \u201cIt delivers what we need to get the Paris Agreement off the ground.\u2019\u2019 \u201cThe fundamentals are in place,\u201d Mr. Diringer added. Not every country got what it wanted at the meeting, which had been scheduled to end on Friday. Developing nations were hoping for more robust promises on climate aid, but that issue has been postponed for future talks. The negotiations over the Paris rule book, often dense and technical, were frequently bogged down by sharp political disputes inside the saucer-shaped convention center here in Katowice, at the heart of Poland\u2019s coal country.Midway through the conference, a huge fight over climate science, with the Trump administration at the center, threatened to derail the negotiations altogether.But the United States and three other big oil producers \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia \u2014 tried to weaken the statement\u2019s language, enraging delegates from some of the most at-risk nations. By Friday, negotiators had crafted compromise language that expressed \u201cappreciation and gratitude\u201d for the report.When world leaders signed the Paris agreement in 2015, they said they would try to limit the rise in global temperatures to roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels to avoid climate-related disasters like widespread food shortages and mass coral die-offs.\u201cThe real test is what happens when countries go home,\u201d said Alden Meyer, director of policy and strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cAll the decision text in the world doesn\u2019t cut a molecule of carbon. You need action on the ground.\u201dFrom dire climate reports to ravenous urchins and vanishing heritage sites, here are the climate stories you shouldn\u2019t miss from this year.In some countries, political obstacles to climate action are mounting. For instance, at the Poland talks, several European Union officials pledged that the bloc would pursue stronger measures to cut emissions before 2020. But inside the union, discussions over a more ambitious climate target have dragged on, in part because Britain is distracted by Brexit; France is struggling with \u201cYellow Vests\u201d protests; and Germany is grappling with its own difficulties in phasing out coal.\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore that there are a lot of headwinds,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, France\u2019s former climate change envoy and a key architect of the Paris agreement.Some experts at the talks argued that the march of cheaper, cleaner energy technologies would do far more to break the deadlock around climate policy than any complicated treaties could. \u201cLook at countries like China and India that are going ahead with renewables for their own reasons,\u201d said Saleemul Huq, director of Bangladesh\u2019s International Center for Climate Change and Development. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need: for countries to move in that direction because it makes sense to them, not because they signed up for an agreement and they\u2019re supposed to.\u201dEven some of the exhausted politicians in the thick of this week\u2019s climate negotiations were ready to acknowledge the limits of diplomacy.\u201cOf course it\u2019s important to have these rules, but a lot of the real action is happening by entrepreneurs; it\u2019s happening by business people; it\u2019s happening by the finance sector; by the money flowing; it\u2019s happening at the city and state level,\u201d said Catherine McKenna, Canada\u2019s environment minister.\u201cClimate change is a complicated problem,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s not going to be solved by national governments alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Weekly Standard, Pugnacious to the End, Will Cease Publication", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Weekly Standard, a primary voice of conservative Washington that found itself out of step with the Trumpward turn in the Republican Party, is ceasing publication after 23 years, its owners announced on Friday.The cause of death was financial, ideological or personal, depending on who was doing the telling.Clarity Media, which is controlled by the billionaire conservative businessman Philip F. Anschutz, has devoted resources to The Washington Examiner, a publication that provides cozier coverage of the president. Talk of selling The Weekly Standard was floated, but the company decided against it.At an all-hands meeting on Friday, the chief executive of Clarity Media, Ryan McKibben, disputed reports that the shutdown was related to the tenor of Trump coverage, instead citing poor financial performance, according to an attendee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive conversations.The attendee said it remained the overwhelming view of The Standard\u2019s staff and leadership that Mr. Anschutz did not, in the end, want to own the leading Trump-skeptical publication in conservative media.The acrimonious end was perhaps in keeping with a publication that was proudly heterodox from the start, eager to buck the prevailing values of conservative dogma and forge its own provocative point of view.Started by Mr. Podhoretz and William Kristol, both scions of establishment conservative figures, The Weekly Standard offered an alternative to the National Review-led hegemony of right-wing publications. (The third founder, Fred Barnes, remains as executive editor; Rupert Murdoch initially provided financing.)It grew into the dominant organ of neoconservatism and a leading voice in favor of intervention in Iraq, helping to define politics in the George W. Bush era. Among its star alumni were Tucker Carlson, Matt Labash and David Brooks.Sold in 2009 to Mr. Anschutz, The Standard remained influential. But the Trump phenomenon posed a challenge. Originally denounced by Republican thought leaders like Mr. Kristol, who declared himself a supporter of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, the president has since been embraced by his party \u2014 and by right-wing news outlets that are thriving with a diet of pro-Trump coverage.The Weekly Standard took a different tack. The editors supported Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court picks and tax overhaul. But the magazine\u2019s free marketeers did not cheer trade tariffs, and its foreign interventionists lamented the president\u2019s retreat from a central role in global leadership. Criticism of a so-called deep state, a staple of Breitbart News and Fox News commentators like Sean Hannity, did not dominate its pages.Talk of a shutdown had coursed through the magazine\u2019s offices for days, and although a meeting with management had been scheduled for Friday, Mr. Hayes, the editor, emailed his staff beforehand to say he was still unsure of their fate.\u201cMany media outlets have responded to the challenges of the moment by prioritizing affirmation over information, giving into the pull of polarization and the lure of clickbait,\u201d Mr. Hayes wrote in a memo. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve remained both conservative and independent.\u201d\u201cThe Weekly Standard has been hampered by many of the same challenges that countless other magazines and newspapers across the country have been wrestling with,\u201d Mr. McKibben, the chief executive, wrote in a news release. \u201cAfter careful consideration of all possible options for its future, it became clear that this was the step we needed to take.\u201dSome members of the magazine\u2019s staff say they have heard that Mr. Kristol and Mr. Hayes are in touch with wealthy investors who could back a similar publication under a new banner. In the meantime, the final issue of The Weekly Standard is to be published on Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Negotiators Strike Deal to Tighten Sexual Harassment Rules on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After months of stalled negotiations, lawmakers in the House and Senate reached a compromise on legislation that would overhaul the arcane and often burdensome procedures for handling sexual harassment and discrimination claims in Congress.The compromise, reached more than a year after the #MeToo movement rattled Capitol Hill, would require members to personally reimburse misconduct settlements related to harassment or retaliation claims based on sex, ethnicity or race, rather than rely on a taxpayer-financed settlement fund.Under the new standards, all settlements or awards involving a member of Congress would be publicly disclosed, even if the lawmaker has left office, and all settlements would be referred to the House or Senate ethics committees for review.But members would not be financially liable for discrimination claims, as they would have in the harassment legislation that passed the House.The bill would also streamline the cumbersome claims-reporting process established in the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act; it would eliminate the current process of mandatory mediation and the \u201ccooling off period,\u201d where complainants have to wait a certain amount of time before submitting an official complaint, lawmakers and aides confirmed. The new standards would also protect interns, congressional fellows and employees in district offices.\u201cI just don\u2019t think you should leave the mess for the next group to clean up. I think it is on us,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, referring to the next Congress. \u201cIt really is an antiquated system,\u201d she added. \u201cIt feels like a process that was better designed to protect politicians rather than victims.\u201dFinal written language for the legislation has yet to be released, but lawmakers said they expected a vote in both chambers before the end of next week.The House, under a separate resolution that will be brought to a vote in that chamber, would also provide legal advisers to assist in filing claims, aides said. But Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, told reporters that compromise was necessary and that this first step should not be left for the next Congress to handle.\u201cThe bill that we wound up with does meet the objectives that we were trying to meet,\u201d Mr. Blunt said. \u201cThis is not going to be that complicated to implement.\u201dBoth senators said they hoped to see unanimous support for the compromise bill.The move toward tougher standards began this year after multiple lawmakers resigned amid accusations of sexual misconduct and taxpayer-funded settlements. Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, was driven from the Senate, and Representatives Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania, Trent Franks of Arizona and Blake Farenthold of Texas, all Republicans, and John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, were forced out of the House.But after both chambers passed their versions of legislation, negotiations stalled as lawmakers clashed over a number of differences, including the exact definition of harassment and how to handle the investigation process.The delay rankled victims\u2019 rights groups and former complainants, particularly as the Senate wrestled with allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing for a seat on the Supreme Court.Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California and a lead negotiator on the original House bill, said that she, along with Representative Bradley Byrne, Republican of Alabama, planned to introduce legislation in the next House that would further toughen how Congress responded to discrimination.The new compromise \u201cis providing the victims with some power that they never had before,\u201d Ms. Speier said in a brief interview. But she wants to go further.Ms. Speier said they would next turn to strengthening workplace training \u2014 incoming lawmakers had to undergo training during new member orientation last month \u2014 and address sexual harassment in federal agencies.\u201cIf I learned anything,\u201d she added, \u201cI think that sharing stories mattered.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump May Choose Critic of Fannie and Freddie to Lead Agency Overseeing Them", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is expected to nominate Mark Calabria, the chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, to run the government agency overseeing the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to two White House officials.Mr. Calabria, who is being eyed to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is a longtime critic of the government-backed housing finance companies, which have been under government control since the 2008 financial crisis. If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Calabria would replace Mel Watt, a holdover from the Obama administration whose term as director of the agency expires in January.The appointment would come at a sensitive moment for the United States housing market. Home prices have increased and sales have strengthened since the housing bust. But sales of new and existing homes have slumped this year, a phenomenon that analysts attribute to several factors, including prices that have climbed faster than incomes and the Federal Reserve\u2019s march toward higher interest rates, which raises borrowing costs.Fannie and Freddie are the primary sources of funding for mortgage loans in the United States. The companies do not make loans. Instead, they purchase loans from private mortgage lenders, providing those companies with cash to make more loans. The two companies financed 44 percent of new mortgage loans during the first six months of 2018, according to the Urban Institute.Mr. Calabria has criticized the current housing finance system, in which Fannie and Freddie purchase most mortgage loans and then repackage the loans for sale as securities. He argues that the combination of federal support and the securitization process has encouraged investors to take on larger risks, threatening the stability of the financial system.As director of the housing finance agency, Mr. Calabria would have some authority to reduce the role that Fannie and Freddie play. He could, for example, require the companies to raise the fees they charge on loans, or limit the maximum size of the loans that the companies can purchase.But David Berson, who worked as Fannie Mae\u2019s chief economist from 1987 to 2007 and is now the chief economist at Nationwide, said he did not expect big changes no matter whom the administration named to lead the agency.\u201cThings are working too well, and it would be too politically divisive,\u201d he said.The Trump administration released a report in June proposing to privatize Fannie and Freddie while continuing to subsidize mortgage loans for less affluent home buyers through an existing program operated by the Federal Housing Administration. Such a plan, however, would require congressional approval, an unlikely prospect given that the House will soon be controlled by Democrats who have long been more supportive of government involvement in the housing finance market.Mr. Calabria, along with many conservative economists, has long blamed government-sponsored enterprises including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for contributing to the 2008 crisis by offering low-interest loans to borrowers who could not afford them. He has also criticized the 30-year mortgage, saying the stability it provides to homeowners in the form of a fixed monthly payment comes at the expense of taxpayers, who are at risk of having to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if the housing market craters, as it did in 2008. Mr. Calabria has argued that there is no reason to subsidize such products instead of loans with shorter terms.Fannie and Freddie were created by the federal government to increase mortgage lending, and thus homeownership. Until the 2008 crisis, the companies operated with the implicit backing of the federal government while earning huge profits that were pocketed by their shareholders. In September 2008, the faltering companies were placed under federal conservatorship: Their operations are now backed explicitly by the government, and the government pockets the profits.Under Mr. Watt, the companies have expanded their loan purchases. Mr. Calabria, by contrast, has long argued that the government should stop backing Fannie and Freddie.In a 2016 speech, Mr. Calabria described the current system as unnecessarily risky, and said it had not produced significant gains in homeownership or affordability.Mr. Calabria rose to prominence in conservative circles during the housing crisis, arguing for market-based conservative solutions to the mass foreclosure crisis at a time when most Democrats, and some Republicans, were advocating a more hands-on federal approach.Federal lending entities, such as the Federal Housing Administration and government-sponsored enterprises, Mr. Calabria said, \u201cshould engage in aggressive recourse against delinquent borrowers who have the ability to pay, but simply choose not too.\u201d\u201cAll federal modification programs should also include strong recourse provisions,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe should make every effort to turn away from becoming a society where legally incurred debts are no longer obligations to be honored but simply options to be exercised.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Often he erupts. \u201cFreaking idiots!\u201d he calls his aides. Except he uses a more pungent word than \u201cfreaking.\u201dFor two years, Mr. Trump has waged war against his own government, convinced that people around him are fools. Angry that they resist his wishes, uninterested in the details of their briefings, he becomes especially agitated when they tell him he does not have the power to do what he wants, which makes him suspicious that they are secretly undermining him.At the midpoint of his term, Mr. Trump has grown more sure of his own judgment and more cut off from anyone else\u2019s than at any point since taking office. He spends ever more time in front of a television, often retreating to his residence out of concern that he is being watched too closely. As he sheds advisers at a head-spinning rate, he reaches out to old associates, complaining that few of the people around him were there at the beginning.\u201cCan you believe this?\u201d he has said as he scanned the torrent of headlines. \u201cI\u2019m doing great, but it\u2019s a war every day.\u201d\u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d he has asked aides, with no acknowledgment that he might have played a role. The aides, many of whom believe he has been treated unfairly by the news media, have replied that journalists are angry that he won and proved them wrong. He nods in agreement at such explanations.As the president vents, he constantly rattles off what he sees as underappreciated accomplishments. \u201cLook what I did for Mexico and Canada,\u201d he has told allies. \u201cLook what\u2019s happened with terrorism.\u201dThe portrait that emerges from interviews with about 30 current and former administration officials, personal friends, political allies, lawmakers and congressional aides suggests a president who revels in sharp swings in direction, feels free to disregard historic allies and presides over near constant turmoil within his own team as he follows his own instincts.White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. But as the president struggles to find a way forward, the path is about to become much more hazardous. As tumultuous as events have been so far, Mr. Trump\u2019s first two years may ultimately look calm compared to what lies ahead.In less than two weeks, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California will take the speaker\u2019s gavel held until now by Representative Paul D.

Mueller III, the special counsel, finds about campaign ties to Russia and obstruction of justice.\u201cNothing he\u2019s going to face in the next two years is going to be like the challenges of the previous two years,\u201d said Michael Steel, a longtime adviser to Republicans like Mr. Ryan and former Speaker John A. Boehner. \u201cGiven the staff turnover and the increasing feeling that the president is encircled or cornered by legal and political enemies, it\u2019s entirely possible it gets worse, not better.\u201dAs a result, a partisan war may be just what he wants. He has privately told associates that he is glad Democrats won the House in last month\u2019s midterm elections, saying he thinks that guarantees his re-election because they will serve as a useful antagonist. That may be bravado, but history provides some support. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, his Democratic predecessors, both endured even bigger midterm setbacks and went on to win re-election.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fair to say that it\u2019s better to have Nancy Pelosi as a foil than Paul Ryan as a foil,\u201d said Marc Short, the president\u2019s former legislative affairs director. \u201cIt\u2019s better for the party and it\u2019s better for unity.\u201d He added, \u201cThe reality is the Democrats could overplay their hand.\u201dBoth sides gamely talk about possible cooperation on issues like rebuilding the nation\u2019s tattered network of roads, bridges and other infrastructure. \u201cThe opportunity in the era of divided government is to work with both sides to get something done for the country,\u201d said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat from New Jersey and co-chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.House conservatives, meanwhile, revolted against Mr. Trump when he seemed to retreat on his demand for border wall funding to avert a government shutdown. At the same time, Senate Republicans, who had voted unanimously to keep the government open without the wall money Mr. Trump had demanded, were angry when he reversed course and refused to sign such a measure.Such conflict comes with a cost. Mr. Trump has a way of stepping on his own successes. The border wall fight overshadowed his signing of the criminal justice overhaul. The abrupt way he decided to withdraw from Syria overshadowed the military victories against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump\u2019s focus during the midterm campaign on a caravan of migrants overshadowed the positive economic story he had to tell before the latest stock market gyrations.\u201cWhen he\u2019s talking about the economy, he\u2019s gotten a much more positive reaction,\u201d said David Winston, a Republican pollster. \u201cObviously on other topics he hasn\u2019t been able to get it to the point where he\u2019s able to create an overall job approval. The question is, do you address weaknesses or do you play to your strengths?\u201dSome left in a cloud of corruption allegations, including his health and human services secretary, his Environmental Protection Agency chief and, most recently, his interior secretary. Others left after clashing with Mr. Trump. Mr. Mattis was the last of the so-called axis of adults seen by some as tempering a volatile president, following the ouster of Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state, H. R. McMaster as national security adviser and John F. Kelly as chief of staff.\u201cRex Tillerson and Jim Mattis are two of the finest people ever to serve in government,\u201d said Steve Goldstein, who was under secretary of state until he was fired along with Mr. Tillerson. \u201cThey were very close and worked hard at trying to do what was best for the country, and sometimes that meant being brutally honest with folks at the White House.\u201dBut Fred Fleitz, who worked for nearly six months this year as chief of staff for John R. Bolton, the current national security adviser, said the new team is more cohesive and better suited to Mr. Trump than one constantly undermining him.\u201cHe came in as the ultimate outsider and he brought in some unorthodox policies that worked and he tried some things that didn\u2019t work, and one of the things that didn\u2019t work was bringing in some staffers who didn\u2019t work, like McMaster and Tillerson,\u201d Mr. Fleitz said.In recent days, Mr. Trump has asked aides whether he can fire Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman he appointed, telling advisers that Mr. Powell will \u201cturn me into Hoover,\u201d a reference to the Great Depression-era president. During a meeting with German car executives this month, Mr. Trump threatened to impose higher fuel efficiency standards on their imported cars than required on American vehicles even though aides told him he could not do that.Mr. Trump has spent far less time lately with older friends. The sense of isolation was on display at this month\u2019s holiday parties when he appeared for a few minutes, took a few perfunctory photographs with preselected guests and then disappeared back upstairs rather than mingle. He spent part of this preholiday shutdown weekend alone until Melania could return from Florida.For election night in November, he insisted on throwing a lavish party in the East Room and originally wanted aides to be on display for his guests, a simulation of officials gathering election return information like aides did at Trump Tower in 2016. When White House officials warned that a party would look discordant given the likelihood of losing the House, he insisted on going forward anyway.By all accounts, Mr. Trump\u2019s consumption of cable television has actually increased in recent months as his first scheduled meetings of the day have slid back from the 9 or 9:30 a.m. set by Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff, to roughly 11 many mornings. During \u201cexecutive time,\u201d Mr. Trump watches television in the residence for hours, reacting to what he sees on Fox News. While in the West Wing, he leaves it on during most meetings in the dining room off the Oval Office, one ear attuned to what is being said.Still, for all the reports of a fuming president alarmed at possible impeachment, Mr. Trump rarely expresses such specific anxiety out loud, associates said. Instead he expresses frustration, anger, mania \u2014 all of which aides read like tea leaves to discern what lies beneath.\u201cIt will be a challenge not to be consumed by it,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cIt would only be human when it\u2019s the coverage leading the news every day to be distracted, but it will be important to have the internal discipline not to be.\u201dNo one outside of Mr. Mueller\u2019s office, of course, knows for sure what he will report, but so far he and other prosecutors have drawn a devastating picture of a president surrounded by people who have lied to the authorities, cheated on their taxes, skirted campaign finance laws and secretly worked for foreign interests. The question is what Mr. Mueller will say about Mr. Trump.\u201cMueller will decide whether there\u2019s collusion with the Russians on the election,\u201d said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former White House chief of staff to Mr. Obama. \u201cBut we can now say there\u2019s collusion with the Russians on foreign policy, and it\u2019s not to America\u2019s benefit.\u201dMore recently, Mr. Trump has taken to spending time reminiscing about the happier days of his candidacy and his 2016 victory. He spent the fall showing different groups of visitors what he calls his love letters from North Korea\u2019s iron-fisted dictator, Kim Jong-un, expressing admiration for Mr. Trump. And he still takes joy in aspects of the job, primarily those that demonstrate power. \u201cThe roads closed for me!\u201d he declared to friends this year after a motorcade ride.But those highs have been hard to recapture. The days are filled with conflict, much of it of his own making. More advisers are heading for the door. The divisions are widening, not closing. If it is a \u201cwar every day,\u201d there are no signs of peace.\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to figure out is where does it end,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. \u201cThe language gets coarser on all sides. The respect for the office of the presidency seems less to me than it was. How do we move people back? Or are we in the new reality?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Russian Biathletes Accused by Austria of Doping", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Five Russian biathletes and five officials with the Russian national team are the subject of an investigation into doping and corruption-related offenses, the Austrian authorities told the team on a visit to its hotel Wednesday.The case is related to a World Cup event in Hochfilzen, Austria, last year, and comes during a wider criminal investigation into doping and corruption involving the International Biathlon Union, which is based in Salzburg. The organization\u2019s longtime president, Anders Besseberg, resigned this year shortly after a raid on the union\u2019s headquarters after prosecutors claimed that up to $300,000 had been paid to cover up doping infringements they said were carried out by Russian athletes.The revelation that Austrian investigators are investigating the Russian athletes and officials comes at a sensitive time as a deadline for the Russian authorities to hand over critical laboratory data to the World Anti-Doping Agency draws near. WADA says the data is critical to identifying the athletes who participated in a yearslong state-supported cheating scheme unmasked more than two years ago.Doping is a criminal offense in Austria. The state attorney\u2019s office for the prosecution of economic offenses and corruption informed the \u201caccused persons\u201d of its investigation at their hotel in Hochfilzen, where they were staying for this week\u2019s World Cup event. None of the accused have been interviewed, it said.While the authorities did not provide the names of the individuals involved, a Russian news agency said the group included three athletes competing at this week\u2019s World Cup and a former Olympic gold medalist.Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, described the visit by the authorities to the athlete hotel on the eve of a major competition as \u201cwild.\u201dThe Russian news agency Tass, citing a Russian embassy spokesman in Austria, said government officials had been dispatched to Hochfilzen \u201cto provide necessary assistance on the spot.\u201dThe case highlights the continuing difficulty Russia has had in restoring its battered reputation in international sports. Anton Shipulin, a gold medalist in biathlon at the tainted Sochi Games, said he was \u201cangry and furious about the witch hunt that is going on\u201d and, after being named among the suspects, denied that he had ever cheated. Another athlete, Alexander Loginov, said he had been accused of a doping offense related to blood transfusions in 2017.April\u2019s raid on the biathlon organization that led to the fall of Besseberg and his deputy came after the antidoping agency had given details gleaned by its own investigation team to law enforcement officials in Norway \u2014 where a raid also took place \u2014 and Austria, as well as to the global police organization Interpol.Last month, nine biathletes from Kazakhstan \u2014 including the country\u2019s entire Olympic team \u2014 were suspended on suspicion of doping after criminal investigations in Austria and Italy.The full scope of the Russian doping program was revealed by Grigory Rodchenkov, a former director of the country\u2019s antidoping laboratory. Rodchenkov, who is in hiding in the United States, provided details of abuses in biathlon, according to his lawyer.Doping by Russian athletes infected biathlon for years, and even after the wider doping program was unmasked, the I.B.U. faced repeated criticism from many of its own members for what they perceived to be weak antidoping policies and a soft stance toward Russia. That prompted teams from the United States, Ukraine and the Czech Republic to withdraw from a season-ending event at the Russian resort Tyumen this year.In 2011, Jacques Rogge, then the I.O.C. president, was so concerned about Russia\u2019s biathlon federation that he urged the country\u2019s president at the time, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to take stronger action. Rodchenkov said in a sworn statement that the billionaire owner of the Nets, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, had played a role in obscuring the scheme when he led the Russian Biathlon Union. Prokhorov, who denies the claim, is helping to finance a New York defamation suit against Rodchenkov by three barred biathletes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disputed North Carolina Race May Hinge on a Shadowy Operative", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byELIZABETHTOWN, N.C. \u2014 L. McCrae Dowless Jr. should have been celebrating. It was 2016, and he had just been elected as a soil and water conservation district supervisor in rural Bladen County, N.C. But he instead came before the State Board of Elections to fan fears of fraud and to air a protest about a race in which he had been victorious.\u201cI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s any wrongdoing here,\u201d Mr. Dowless told the Raleigh-based board. \u201cI just want it investigated because it was a high volume of write-ins.\u201dOnly two years later, Mr. Dowless has gone from a Republican gadfly in North Carolina\u2019s incessant battles over voting rules and alleged fraud to being at the center of an escalating battle over disputed ballots that could overturn the House election in the Ninth Congressional District.Mr. Dowless, witnesses and party officials said, helped to oversee a voter turnout operation on behalf of the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, in which canvassers collected absentee ballots directly from residents \u2014 a violation of North Carolina law. Sworn statements from voters and unusual absentee voting statistics have stoked suspicions over whether ballots were fraudulently filled out for Mr. Harris or discarded if they were for his Democratic rival, Dan McCready.The dispute \u2014 and the identity of the Ninth District\u2019s next congressman \u2014 may not be settled for weeks. On Tuesday, Representative Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who is the incoming House majority leader, suggested that Democrats might refuse to seat Mr. Harris if concerns about the election remain.\u201cIf there is what appears to be a very substantial question on the integrity of the election, we would oppose Mr. Harris being seated until that is resolved,\u201d said Mr. Hoyer, whose chamber has the constitutional authority to be \u201cthe judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.\u201dThe House will likely take some of its cues from the findings of the sprawling inquiry that has begun in North Carolina, where elections regulators are poised to hold an evidentiary hearing this month.Investigators have prepared a batch of subpoenas, including one that they sought to serve Tuesday on the Charlotte-area consulting group that contracted with Mr. Dowless. They have questioned people about what Joshua Malcolm, who was named this week as the election board\u2019s chairman, described last week as \u201cclaims of numerous irregularities and concerted fraudulent activities.\u201dThe known claims are concentrated in Bladen County, which has about 33,000 residents, and neighboring, far larger Robeson County. Bladen County, where elections officials work in a simple brick-and-glass building on South Cypress Street, just behind a shopping center with a Dollar General and a furniture store, recorded the state\u2019s highest rate of absentee ballot requests: 7.5 percent of registered voters, compared with less than 3 percent in most of the other 99 counties.A strikingly large number of those ballots, 40 percent, were never returned. In Robeson County, 62 percent were not returned. No other county had a rate higher than 27 percent. Mr. Harris won 61 percent of submitted absentee ballots in Bladen County, even though registered Republicans accounted for only 19 percent of the ballots submitted.On Tuesday, the district attorney for the area, Jon David, said law enforcement officials were investigating allegations related to the 2016 elections and were in contact with each other \u201cto coordinate our efforts should a prosecution be warranted\u201d in the wake of this year\u2019s suspicions.Almost all the worries, for now, involve absentee ballots. In an affidavit, a Bladen County resident, Emma Shipman, wrote that she had recently handed over her ballot to a woman who told her that she was assigned to collect ballots in the district. Another voter wrote that she gave her incomplete ballot to a woman who promised she would finish it.State officials are also reviewing other claims. Mr. Malcolm, the elections board chairman, said Tuesday that the authorities would release documents on \u201ca rolling basis in a manner reasonably calculated to serve the public interest without compromising the investigation.\u201dPerhaps no figure is more central to that inquiry \u2014 or the subject of more rumors and speculation \u2014 than Mr. Dowless, who was assigned to get-out-the-vote efforts in the eastern part of the Ninth District, which runs from Charlotte to east of Fayetteville.Mr. Dowless, 62, could not be reached for comment, and Red Dome Group, which hired him for Mr. Harris\u2019s campaign, did not respond to messages. Mr. Harris has said he will \u201csupport any efforts to investigate allegations of irregularities and/or voter fraud, as long as it is fair and focuses on all political parties.\u201d And although Republicans have threatened litigation to try to compel the state to certify the election results immediately, they have yet to bring a lawsuit.In enlisting Mr. Dowless, the Harris campaign\u2019s consultants signed on a man with some political knowledge but a blemished personal history.He was deeply familiar with the get-out-the-vote efforts on which candidates at all levels rely: State records show that beginning in 2009, at least seven Democratic and Republican candidates paid him for work in local and state races, including campaigns for the Legislature, district attorney and county sheriff. Separately, campaign finance records in Mecklenburg County showed that Mr. Dowless worked for a City Council candidate in Charlotte, the state\u2019s largest city.\u201cHe was just a known figure,\u201d said former State Representative Ken Waddell, a Democrat who hired Mr. Dowless after receiving a recommendation. \u201cTo me, it appeared like he just liked politics.\u201dMr. Waddell had no complaints about Mr. Dowless\u2019s integrity during the campaign, but recalled disagreements about where to place signs in the district. Years earlier, though, Mr. Dowless\u2019s character had come into question after one of his employees died in an automobile accident.The Fayetteville Observer reported in 1991 that Mr. Dowless and the woman he eventually married had, after the employee\u2019s death, taken out a six-figure life insurance policy in the man\u2019s name by forging a signature and backdating a document. Mr. Dowless listed himself as the primary beneficiary and collected benefits.Mr. Dowless was eventually sentenced to a short prison term, and state records show convictions for, among other offenses, perjury and fraud.But after prison, Mr. Dowless pursued, at least in part, a life in politics. As a Democrat, he sought a seat on the local school board in 2014 and was defeated in a primary. He was unaffiliated when he ran for the soil and water conservation district board in 2016 and switched his party registration to Republican after the election.The election results, though, had raised concerns in and around Bladen County. Although Mr. Dowless was running unopposed, about a third of the vote went to write-in candidates. Encouraged and aided by the chairman of the county Republican Party at the time, he submitted a protest to the state and argued that there was \u201ca pattern of fraudulent ballots.\u201dBut Mr. Dowless did not appear to know all that much about it when the state elections board convened a hearing.Asked whether he knew how to obtain the financial disclosure reports of the political action committee that he, in his protest, had suggested was behind \u201ca massive scheme to run an absentee ballot mill,\u201d Mr. Dowless said he did not.At one point, a member of the board pointedly asked, \u201cAre you familiar with your protest?\u201d Mr. Dowless, who invoked the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against self-incrimination when he chose not to answer a question, said that he was.The board\u2019s questioning eventually raised concerns about Mr. Dowless\u2019s own efforts to pursue absentee ballots in 2016 and prompted the attention of law enforcement officials. The board dismissed the protest because of \u201ca lack of substantial evidence of a violation of election law or other irregularity or misconduct sufficient to cast doubt on the results of the election.\u201dThe same standard will apply now, as the state board, itself jolted and upended by political turbulence in recent years, decides how to referee North Carolina\u2019s latest electoral storm.Maggie Astor contributed reporting from New York, Nicholas Fandos from Washington, and Richard Fausset from Conway, S.C.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stung by Election Losses, Republicans in the States Seek a Way to Neutralize Democrats", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADISON, Wis. \u2014 When Democrats won the governor\u2019s office in Wisconsin, it was one of the party\u2019s most celebrated midterm successes in regaining power in the states. Now Republicans are striking back, moving to slash the power of the new governor even before he takes the oath of office.Democrats reacted with fury, crowding the halls of the State Capitol in Madison on Monday and accusing the Republicans of trying to undo an election they had lost. It was only the latest such Republican effort across the country to try to use legislative action to counter blows the party suffered at the polls. For Wisconsin, a state that both parties will urgently vie to win in 2020 elections, it was one more sign of the ferocious partisan split that has rippled through the state in recent years.\u201cIt\u2019s a power grab,\u201d said State Senator Jon Erpenbach, a Democrat, before a hearing on the package of bills that includes restrictions on the incoming governor\u2019s ability to shift how public benefits programs are run, and on his authority to set the rules that determine how state laws are carried out. \u201cThey lost and they\u2019re throwing a fit.\u201dSome local areas are seeing glimpses of similar battles. In Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County \u2014 with 4.3 million residents, the nation\u2019s fourth most populous \u2014 the Republican-dominated board of supervisors said last month that it was studying a takeover of some Election Day logistics now handled by the county recorder, a newly elected Democrat. The supervisors have said they have a nonpartisan interest in improving the county\u2019s elections.In Wisconsin on Monday, Democrats and liberal groups called the Republicans\u2019 proposals for curbing Mr. Evers\u2019s authority in advance of his swearing in next month a blatant power grab and a rejection of the election outcome. Some said they were considering legal action against any legislation the Republicans may try to push through this week.Republicans, who will retain their legislative majorities under the Democratic governor, have defended the hastily introduced package of bills as a necessary check on executive power.But as hundreds of angry residents gathered at the Capitol, the Republican leaders spoke bluntly of the ideological clash between their caucus and the incoming governor.\u201cI think that Governor-elect Evers is going to bring a liberal agenda to Wisconsin,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a divide between the legislative branch and the executive branch.\u201d\u201cWe want to ensure that the new administration doesn\u2019t try to work around the Legislature,\u201d Mr. Vos said, explaining the package of bills that Republicans say they hope will be taken up by the full Legislature on Tuesday. \u201cWe want both branches to have an equal seat at the table.\u201dWisconsin\u2019s capital city has regularly been the scene of political upheaval over the last decade.The 2010 election flipped Democratic control of the governor\u2019s office and both legislative chambers, and Governor Walker built a national reputation by swiftly moving to limit public sector unions\u2019 power, a push that sent thousands of union supporters and Democrats to Madison to protest for weeks and set off a series of recall elections against Republicans and Democrats.The state has long been purple; it voted for Barack Obama for president and also for Donald J. Trump. Wisconsin, which Democrats had carried in presidential races since 1988, played an unexpected role in helping to seal Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. But a longstanding tone of congenial relations between Wisconsin Democrats and Republicans vanished after the Republicans took over eight years ago.Mr. Evers, who has been Wisconsin\u2019s state schools superintendent, condemned the proposals and urged Wisconsin residents to speak up against them. He said Republicans were trying \u201cto take us back to Nov. 6\u201d and change the election results.\u201cWe\u2019re not going backwards in time to revote this election,\u201d Mr. Evers said. \u201cI won.\u201dMr. Evers said he hoped to persuade the legislative chambers \u2014 both of which are controlled by Republicans \u2014 to vote down the bills. If that fails, Mr. Evers said, a \u201cPlan B\u201d could include litigation.From a hearing room where the legislation was being weighed on Monday afternoon, protesters outside could be heard chanting \u201cRespect our vote\u201d and \u201cShame.\u201d Hundreds gathered in protest in the cold on the steps of the Capitol, a place where demonstrations by Democrats have been tense and frequent over the past eight years under Republican dominance.Among the package of measures being considered in Madison, Democrats were especially angered about one that would allow Republican leaders in the Legislature to hire their own lawyers to replace the Democratic attorney general on certain lawsuits, including on issues such as voter identification and legislative redistricting.

{"Headline": "Trump Threatens Shutdown in Combative Appearance With Democrats", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday transformed what was to be a private negotiating session with Democratic congressional leaders into a bitter televised altercation over his long-promised border wall, vowing to force a year-end government shutdown if they refused to fund his signature campaign promise.During an extraordinary public airing of hostilities that underscored a new, more confrontational dynamic in Washington, Mr. Trump vowed to block full funding for the government if Democrats refused to allocate money for the wall on the southwestern border, saying he was \u201cproud to shut down the government for border security.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders, seated on couches flanking Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, took issue with the president\u2019s position and his false assertions about the wall in front of a phalanx of news cameras, imploring him repeatedly to continue the tense conversation without reporters present. But Mr. Trump insisted on a conspicuous clash that undercut Republican congressional leaders and his own staff working to avoid a shutdown at all costs, or at least to ensure that Democrats would shoulder the blame for such a result.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have border security, we\u2019ll shut down the government \u2014 this country needs border security,\u201d Mr. Trump declared as the testy back and forth unfolded, and Mr. Schumer reminded the president repeatedly that he had called several times for a shutdown, appearing to goad him into taking responsibility.\u201cYou want to know something?\u201d Mr. Trump finally said, exasperated. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what: I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.\u201d\u201cI will take the mantle,\u201d Mr. Trump went on. \u201cI will be the one to shut it down \u2014 I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201dThe scene raised fresh questions about whether Mr. Trump and lawmakers could reach agreement by a Dec. 21 deadline to keep much of the government open, appearing to harden diametrically opposed positions on the wall.Aides say Mr. Trump respects what he sees as Ms. Pelosi\u2019s toughness in the political trenches, but he sought on Tuesday to undercut her position by raising questions about her job security. \u201cNancy\u2019s in a situation where it\u2019s not easy for her to talk right now,\u201d Mr. Trump said at one point, alluding to Ms. Pelosi\u2019s struggle to garner the votes to be elected speaker.\u201cPlease don\u2019t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,\u201d Ms. Pelosi shot back. She also challenged the president\u2019s strength within his own party, questioning his ability to get the wall funding he is demanding through the Republican-led House. When the president said he could win such a vote \u201cin two seconds,\u201d Ms. Pelosi dared the president: \u201cThen do it.\u201dLater at the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi spared little venom in privately describing the president\u2019s demeanor to a roomful of colleagues.\u201cThis wall thing\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s is \u201clike a manhood thing for him \u2014 as if manhood could ever be associated with him,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told fellow Democrats, according to an aide present for the remarks who insisted on anonymity to relay parts of the meeting.Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer also sparred with Mr. Trump about the financing of the wall, after the president insisted that Mexico would pay for it through money that would flow into the United States as part of a new North American trade agreement. The Democrats told Mr. Trump that that would never happen. Ms. Pelosi said she had told the president that any economic gains from the pact should go to American workers and businesses, not a border wall.\u201cWell, they\u2019re going to pay for it one way or the other,\u201d Mr. Trump insisted, in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s retelling.Outside the West Wing after the meeting, Mr. Schumer said Mr. Trump had thrown a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d over the wall, later telling reporters, \u201cYou heard the president: He wants a shutdown.\u201dIn a statement shortly afterward, Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi said it was up to Mr. Trump to avert the disaster he had promised, by embracing their proposals to essentially postpone the dispute for another year, either by passing the six noncontroversial spending measures that are outstanding and extending homeland security funding for one year at current levels, or by passing one-year extensions for all seven remaining bills.The president \u201csaid he would think about it,\u201d Mr. Schumer later told reporters.Despite the public meltdown, Mr. Trump appeared to be open to a way out of the impasse. He called Ms. Pelosi hours after the meeting, she said, and was still reviewing the options that the Democrats had presented. Mr. Trump even went into a lofty speech during the Oval Office session, once reporters had departed, in which he mused about the potential for him to work alongside Democratic leaders in the new Congress to strike great deals.Gesticulating grandly with Vice President Mike Pence looking on, Mr. Trump told Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi that the new Congress could be the \u201cgreatest Congress in the history of Congress,\u201d according to a person familiar with the discussion who described it on the condition of anonymity because it was private. And the president assured them that if they could strike deals that could get through the House, he would compel Republican senators to back them.On Tuesday, though, such compromises were not in evidence. Mr. Trump\u2019s outburst left Republican congressional leaders in a tricky spot, publicly rejecting a shutdown that their president had promised.\u201cI hope that\u2019s not where we end up,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told reporters. \u201cIt was a rather spirited meeting we all watched, but I\u2019d still like to see a smooth ending here.\u201dSenator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said, \u201cMy experience has been that shutdowns don\u2019t help anybody.\u201dEarlier, Mr. Pence \u2014 who sat silently through the Oval Office meeting and later traveled to the Capitol to brief Republicans \u2014 drew laughter from a roomful of senators when he described the meeting as \u201cmemorable\u201d and said, \u201cThere appears to be a disagreement.\u201dThe meeting \u2014 the first time in more than a year that the pair the president likes to call \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d traveled to the White House to negotiate with Mr. Trump \u2014 was to be a private session. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, later said that Mr. Trump had been \u201cgrateful for the opportunity\u201d to place his disagreement with Democrats on display.Mr. Trump appeared to taunt Mr. Schumer.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to shut down the government, Chuck,\u201d Mr. Trump told his fellow New Yorker, referring to a brief shutdown in January when Democrats insisted that protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children must be part of any funding measure. \u201cThe last time you shut it down, you got killed.\u201dVeteran legislators expressed outrage.\u201cThis is the only time I\u2019ve seen anything as irresponsible as a president who says he wants a government shutdown,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who has served for more than 40 years.The president has suggested, repeatedly, that a shutdown might be necessary to compel Democrats to swallow $5 billion in wall funding. But on Tuesday before the meeting, he had appeared to back off slightly.In a series of morning tweets, he falsely stated that substantial sections of the \u201cGreat Wall\u201d had already been completed, and he suggested that his administration could continue construction whether Democrats funded it or not.That would be illegal, but it suggested that he was looking for a way to keep the government funded past Dec. 21, even if Democrats balk at wall funding.It was not clear what Mr. Trump was referring to. American troops he dispatched to the border on the eve of the midterm congressional elections as part of what the president called an effort to head off a migrant \u201cinvasion\u201d have put up concertina wire along existing fences and barriers, but the administration has yet to spend much of the $1.3 billion Congress approved for border security last year. Under restrictions put in place by Congress, none of that money can be used to construct a new, concrete wall of the sort the president has said is vital.The president does not have the legal authority to spend money appropriated for one purpose on another task, such as wall-building.Michael Tackett and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unrest in France Hinders Macron\u2019s Push to Revive Economy", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The need to accelerate growth has long been visible in almost every corner of the French economy, from dreary unemployment offices packed with job seekers to businesses whose financially stretched customers struggle to make do.President Emmanuel Macron came into office pledging to change all that by improving the country\u2019s long-term prospects. But his halting response to a month of violent demonstrations by the so-called Yellow Vest movement over social inequality has clouded his efforts for a revival.The same day, the country\u2019s central bank trimmed its growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent, well off the sluggish pace expected for the year. Businesses have sustained more than 10 billion euros, about $11.4 billion, in damage and lost sales, a figure that will probably grow.\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for business,\u201d Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said Sunday as he toured Paris businesses smashed up by rioters. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for our economy,\u201d he added, a point he pressed again on Tuesday in a briefing with a small group of reporters.He pledged tax cuts and financial support for those having trouble getting by, urged businesses to give employees year-end bonuses and said the government would help minimum-wage earners with a \u20ac100 monthly supplement starting next year.Mr. Macron\u2019s speech, a recorded message just 13 minutes long, was also notable for what he left out.\u201cWe know how important it is for us to be as attractive as possible for foreign investors,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe key point is to make clear that we will remain strong on structural reforms.\u201dWhile foreign investment in France has risen since Mr. Macron came to office, \u201cthere will be a mark left by this episode,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a given that this will succeed in calming the dissatisfaction of a part of the population.\u201dMany of those protesting understand that improving the economy is a long-term project, but their concerns are focused on their monthly efforts to make ends meet. On social networks, some protesters said Mr. Macron\u2019s offer fell short.Mr. Macron has lectured leaders of other eurozone countries \u2014 especially Italy \u2014 about the need to balance their books. Now he must follow his own advice. French ministries have been ordered to find cuts in their budgets, and the government could delay some tax cuts for companies that had been scheduled to kick in next year, Mr. Le Maire said.Mr. Macron also refuses to end a tax break for wealthy citizens that he granted upon taking office. He says the measure was intended to lure money into France, where it can be invested in French companies. The move has drained more than \u20ac3 billion from France\u2019s coffers this year, but Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday that there was no data yet to show whether it was having the promised stimulus effect.Mr. Le Maire has suggested another way to make up the shortfall: pursuing the taxes that he said Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google had avoided paying in France for years. The European Union is considering a plan to impose such taxes. If the union does not reach an accord on doing so by March, Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday, France will move to collect $500 million in back taxes from the tech giants.Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis Bank, which is based in Paris, said that even if the tax cuts and spending increases Mr. Macron had proposed increased France\u2019s budget deficit, \u201cmarkets will accept that\u201d as a price for restoring social stability.Still, the slowdown in growth caused by a month of disruption will make it harder for Mr. Macron to address several major problems.Retailers, including supermarkets and sellers of luxury goods, have collectively lost more than \u20ac1 billion, while small and medium-size companies have lost at least \u20ac10 billion, according to France\u2019s main retail and business associations.The agriculture sector is facing over \u20ac13 billion in losses, said ANIA, the main industry group, citing four weekends of protests that blocked roads, causing delivery delays and often preventing groceries from reaching stores.Tourism has also been affected, with hotels recording cancellation rates as high as 25 percent since the protests started last month. American and Japanese tour operators have been advising customers not to travel to France, according to the National Federation of Tourist Offices.Some companies have paused hiring plans. Auchan, a large supermarket chain, said it might not hire 4,000 temporary workers it had planned to employ across France for the holiday season.Stores that need to make up for lost revenue will be allowed to open on Sundays, something that has been prohibited in most of France by decades-old laws requiring that Sunday be a day of rest.In the end, the main issue for France is not the short-term cost from the demonstrations, said Mr. Artus, the economist.\u201cIt\u2019s whether Macron will keep the reforms going,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to maintain the attractiveness of France.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the bank where Patrick Artus is the chief economist. It is Natixis Bank, not Natexis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Notre Dame, Football Tradition Makes Room for Financial Reality", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2014 In the beginning, there was Notre Dame Stadium, the House That Rockne Built, a concrete cathedral cradling a proud football program with seven national college football championships. Later, Touchdown Jesus appeared, watching over the Fighting Irish and their home field as Notre Dame went on to claim four more national titles.And for decades, those few acres on campus were, at least in the eyes of Notre Dame fans, sacred ground.But progress waits for no one, not even Notre Dame. In October, Garth Brooks performed a concert inside the House That Rockne Built, a first for the stadium. And next week, two N.H.L. teams will play an outdoor hockey game on a rink installed atop its famed field.Just as Knute Rockne\u2019s years as coach catapulted Notre Dame into the nation\u2019s consciousness and the \u201cWord of Life\u201d mural \u2014 Touchdown Jesus\u2019s formal name \u2014 offered the university a singular television backdrop, the Brooks concert and the hockey game have announced a new direction for an old-school athletic program.Having completed a nine-figure makeover of the stadium and its surrounding environs, and facing a financial landscape in college football that threatens to leave the Fighting Irish behind, Notre Dame is now ready to leverage, very carefully, one of its most valuable assets: a mystique it has spent more than a century cultivating.Will modernizing its athletic business plan help deliver a 12th national title? Not even Notre Dame can guarantee that. But a willingness to embrace a new financial strategy, university officials said, is vital in helping Notre Dame keep up in the increasingly rich world of college athletics.\u201cEverything we do here is threading that needle of: How can athletics do what it needs to do to compete, but also serve the broader community?\u201d Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting balance, and what dictates our ability to do any of it depends on those cultural underpinnings.\u201dThere was a time when Notre Dame\u2019s tradition produced structural advantages of its own. Notre Dame\u2019s contract with NBC Sports to televise its home games used to be the envy of college football, allowing the university to remain an independent and free from the constraints of a conference schedule. But the reported $16 million annually it received looks quaint amid today\u2019s economics.Now, the football program is Notre Dame\u2019s only sport that consistently makes money, but that revenue \u2014 a tiny part of an operating budget of more than $1.4 billion \u2014 goes to a general fund that nonathletic officials allocate.Embracing the financial realities of modern college football \u2014 multimillion-dollar salaries for assistant coaches, luxury suites for top donors and corporate sponsorships to pay for it all \u2014 has been part of Notre Dame\u2019s fiscal awakening. But it is also at the heart of its new push to monetize one of America\u2019s most iconic brands in ways that once might have been unthinkable.Among the upgrades at Notre Dame Stadium, for example, is a ballroom overlooking the field that can host events like weddings and banquets \u2014 except, of course, on game days, when the stadium retains its tradition-thick vibe, a throwback to college football\u2019s leather helmet era. On game day afternoons, only game highlights are allowed on the video board, and there are still no sponsor signs in sight.All that purity is great for aesthetics, but it can be tough on the bottom line.Inside Alabama\u2019s Bryant-Denny Stadium, by contrast, national sponsors pay $80,000 to have their logos rotate on the scoreboard during Crimson Tide football games and more than $100,000 to place their names on the tunnels and corner boards. Anywhere from $50,000 to $75,000 buys one minute of pregame advertising and two minutes of in-game ads on the LED scroll, a direct pitch to the crowds that regularly exceed 100,000.In Tuscaloosa, where dozens of companies are eager to be part of Alabama football, that Saturday-only revenue can surpass $5 million a game in a hurry.But Ryan Brewer, an assistant professor of finance at Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus, said the Fighting Irish\u2019s restraint and commitment to the past had paid off. Brewer analyzes a variety of factors to determine what college teams would be worth on the open market if they could be bought and sold like professional franchises.In his most recent valuations, Notre Dame\u2019s price tag was $856 million, good enough to be ranked No. 7. Ohio State topped his list, at $1.5 billion, trailed by Texas and two of the teams in this year\u2019s College Football Playoff, Alabama and Oklahoma.\u201cNotre Dame football has a mystique that they developed through success in the beginning and continues to inspire respect,\u201d Brewer said, \u201cand part of that is their fundamental alignment with the academic side of the house.\u201dFor much of its history, Notre Dame was considered a true national university and a prime destination for blue-chip football players. Today, enormous recruiting budgets, private planes and social media make it easy for Alabama, Oklahoma and Clemson to seek out prospects anywhere. Big media deals mean live telecasts and streams of nearly every game in tens of millions of households on network television, cable TV and conference-owned networks.The Rev. John I. Jenkins, Notre Dame\u2019s president, acknowledged that most people still view his university as a football powerhouse rather than academic one. But he has been among the most vocal opponents of proposals to abandon the amateur model in college athletics for a semiprofessional structure in which universities would pay their athletes. He said Notre Dame would leave the N.C.A.A. if that day came.\u201cOur relationship to these young people is to educate them, to help them grow,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cNot to be their agent for financial gain.\u201dStill, Notre Dame must compete in a college football marketplace in which universities from Oregon to Florida, all of them flush with television riches through their conferences, are erecting multimillion-dollar weight rooms, practice sites and academic centers to attract the finest players in the country.\u201cYou can look around the college landscape, and it\u2019s happening everywhere,\u201d said Bob Vecchione, the executive director of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics. \u201cEveryone is trying to raise the student-athlete experience. It is expensive, and it works. Just look at the facilities the four teams in the playoffs have. That\u2019s the bar.\u201dWhether or not another title is at hand, it is important for the Fighting Irish that they at least remain in the hunt \u2014 and do so without devaluing what the university holds most dear. For Swarbrick, all of those imperatives \u2014 on-field success, financial reality and high academic standards \u2014 can coexist without abandoning a culture that values tradition over revenue.\u201cFirst and most important, it offers a rebuttal a growing chorus of people who say we can\u2019t do things the way we do and be successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can and we will continue to do so.\u201dFollow Joe Drape on Twitter: @joedrape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Blink of an Eye, a Hunt for Oil Threatens Pristine Alaska", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "For decades, opposition to drilling has left the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge off limits. Now the Trump administration is hurriedly clearing the way for oil exploration.Supported byFAIRBANKS, Alaska \u2014 It is the last great stretch of nothingness in the United States, a vast landscape of mosses, sedges and shrubs that is home to migrating caribou and the winter dens of polar bears.Aside from a Native village at its northern tip, civilization has not dented its 19 million acres, an area the size of South Carolina. There are no roads and no visitors beyond the occasional hunter and backpacker.But the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 a federally protected place of austere beauty that during a recent flyover was painted white by heavy snowfall \u2014 is on the cusp of major change.The biggest untapped onshore trove of oil in North America is believed to lie beneath the refuge\u2019s coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea. For more than a generation, opposition to drilling has left the refuge largely unscathed, but now the Trump administration, working with Republicans in Congress and an influential and wealthy Alaska Native corporation, is clearing the way for oil exploration along the coast.Decades of protections are unwinding with extraordinary speed as Republicans move to lock in drilling opportunities before the 2020 presidential election, according to interviews with over three dozen people and a review of internal government deliberations and federal documents.To that end, the Trump administration is on pace to finish an environmental impact assessment in half the usual time. An even shorter evaluation of the consequences of seismic testing is nearing completion. Within months, trucks weighing up to 90,000 pounds could be conducting the tests across the tundra as they try to pinpoint oil reserves.While actual oil production would be a decade or more away, the turnaround represents a prized breakthrough in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to exploit fossil fuels and erase restrictive policies protecting the environment and addressing global warming.The Interior Department, which has jurisdiction over the Arctic refuge, has been central to the administration\u2019s regulatory rollback in Alaska and beyond, accommodating the wishes of big businesses to strip down rules on how federal lands can be used. The oil and gas industry has been among the biggest beneficiaries as the administration has relaxed or abandoned regulations meant to safeguard air quality, groundwater supplies and wildlife.Gas and oil infrastructureGas and oil fieldsWells in serviceWells under development or testingNationalPetroleumReserveBeaufort Sea1002 AreaTrans-AlaskaPipelineArctic NationalWildlife RefugeBoundary of oiland gas basinALASKA50 miles50 milesGas and oil infrastructureGas and oil fieldsWells in serviceWells under development or testingNationalPetroleumReserveBeaufort Sea1002 AreaTrans-AlaskaPipelineArctic NationalWildlife RefugeBoundary of oiland gas basinALASKA50 milesGas and oil infrastructureGas and oil fieldsWells in serviceWells under development or testingNationalPetroleumReserveBeaufort Sea1002 AreaTrans-AlaskaPipelineArctic NationalWildlife RefugeALASKABoundary of oiland gas basinGas and oil infrastructureChukchi SeaGas and oil fieldsWells in serviceWells under development or testingNationalPetroleumReserveBeaufort Sea1002 AreaTrans-AlaskaPipelineArctic NationalWildlife RefugeALASKABoundary of oil and gas basin50 milesSources:  United States Geological Survey; Alaska Department of Natural Resources; Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission | By Jin WuThe refuge is not the administration\u2019s only target for stepped-up oil development in Alaska. It is also pushing for more exploration and production offshore and in the National Petroleum Reserve, west of the refuge. All of this is coming despite a glut in domestic oil production that raises the question of whether more oil from the Arctic \u2014 which is costly to produce \u2014 is necessary or makes economic sense, especially given the need to eventually wean the world off fossil fuels.The fate of the refuge\u2019s coastal plain is in the hands of Ryan Zinke, the Interior secretary, who has appointed top deputies with deep professional and political ties to Alaska to oversee its development. In 2014, two of the appointees were involved in an unsuccessful court challenge to Obama-era policies that had helped keep the area off limits.Congressional approval to open the area to oil exploration was inserted in tax overhaul legislation last December under the guise of generating revenue for the federal government, and by next year, the Interior Department expects to begin selling the first drilling leases.The hurried timeline has created friction, with some specialists in the federal government concerned that environmental risks are being downplayed or ignored. And many outside scientists and environmentalists share the concerns, warning that plans for seismic testing and eventual drilling could harass, injure or kill polar bears and other wildlife.\u201cIt seems as though the administration is in a headlong rush to put the drill bit into the coastal plain,\u201d said David J. Hayes, a deputy Interior secretary in the Obama and Clinton administrations. \u201cGiven the virgin territory of the refuge, with the unique wildlife dependency issues, I don\u2019t know how you do this in an artificially fast and truncated fashion.\u201dMr. Zinke\u2019s Alaska-friendly appointees, who have long pushed for oil exploration in the coastal plain, say the fears are overstated. They point out that years ago, Congress left open the eventual possibility of allowing development there. Exploration is in the best interest of Alaskans, they say.\u201cI feel like there is a lot of expectations, hopes and dreams from people who I know and love that are riding on this,\u201d said Joe Balash, one of the appointees, who has worked in Alaskan political circles for two decades and now oversees the Bureau of Land Management.An Alaska Native company, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, has been a major force behind the push and stands to enjoy a windfall if drilling proceeds. The corporation, which has been awarded more than $7.5 billion in federal contracts in the past 10 years, expanded its lobbying under the Trump administration, records show, and Mr. Zinke appointed one of its executives to a top post.Known as A.S.R.C., it is among 13 regional businesses created in the 1970s to foster economic development among Alaska\u2019s indigenous population. It has myriad financial interests in the state\u2019s oil-rich North Slope region, which includes the refuge\u2019s coastal plain and Prudhoe Bay, home to one of the largest oil fields in North America. And it has been a key financial backer of Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, who has been the drilling plan\u2019s biggest champion in Congress.Many Natives on the North Slope \u2014 including Inupiat who live in Kaktovik, the village inside the refuge \u2014 support oil development. But another group that lives south of the refuge, the Gwich\u2019in, fears oil development would disturb the migration of porcupine caribou, animals it has hunted for centuries and still relies on for much of its food.Ms. Murkowski declined to comment, as did Alaska\u2019s other elected representatives in Washington. Mr. Zinke also declined to comment. But he told a Senate committee in March that he was \u201cvery bullish on the Arctic.\u201dThe struggle over oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has its roots 50 years ago in the discovery of petroleum reserves around Prudhoe Bay, west of the refuge.Congress in 1960 had set aside millions of acres in northeast Alaska for wildlife, lands that were largely off the beaten path, geographically and politically, and included the refuge\u2019s coastal plain.But with the Prudhoe Bay discovery in 1968, the calculus changed. Many thought the plain might hold riches too.In 1980, when Congress voted to conserve much of the federal land in Alaska, drilling advocates pushed for oil and gas development on the coastal plain. Then, as now, the move was supported by many Alaskans, who generally favor oil development, in part because some of the revenue is returned to them in the form of an annual dividend. Drilling has largely had bipartisan support among Alaskan lawmakers as well.The advocates were unsuccessful but had an opening: The 1980 bill allowed Congress to authorize oil and gas development at a later date. The 1.5-million-acre coastal plain, identified in Section 1002 of the legislation, has been known since as the 1002 Area.In 1995, with Republicans controlling both houses of Congress for the first time in decades, legislation was approved to allow development. But Democrats opposed the measure and President Bill Clinton vetoed it.When Republicans held on to Congress in the 2016 elections and President Trump won the White House, drilling proponents saw another opening.Ms. Murkowski told reporters within hours of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory that she would renew the push for legislation. That set in motion a furious effort to win congressional approval and position the Interior Department to carry a plan forward.A flight from Alaska\u2019s central Arctic coast to Fairbanks is a straight shot. But when Mr. Zinke and Ms. Murkowski flew the route in May last year, just a few months into the Interior secretary\u2019s tenure, the pilot made a wide detour to the east.Below them was the vast 1002 Area, extending between the Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea, still off limits to oil and gas exploration but now within their political sights.A few days later in Anchorage, Ms. Murkowski introduced Mr. Zinke at an oil and gas conference. \u201cThe only path for energy dominance is a path through the great state of Alaska,\u201d Mr. Zinke told the group.Seven months later, Congress voted to open the coastal plain to exploration.Getting approval in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives was not an issue. But in the Senate, Ms. Murkowski needed a bill that could survive a likely filibuster. The solution was to characterize oil exploration as a revenue raiser \u2014 with a target of $1 billion for the Treasury over 10 years \u2014 and insert it into Mr. Trump\u2019s tax overhaul legislation.The oil provision authorized two lease sales of drilling rights for at least 400,000 acres each, directing the \u201cSecretary of Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management,\u201d to oversee the development. The innocuous-sounding bureaucratic language was intended to fast-track the effort by marginalizing skeptics in another Interior agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service.At a hearing, current and former Alaska politicians spoke in favor of opening the refuge, as did representatives of two Native corporations, including A.S.R.C. Several A.S.R.C. executives stayed in Washington to press for the measure, part of a push that saw the corporation\u2019s lobbying expenditures nearly double to $590,000 in 2017 from $320,000 the previous year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group.The A.S.R.C. officials were joined by Natives from Kaktovik in the Senate gallery on Dec. 20, when the bill was approved on a straight party-line vote, and later that day on the South Lawn of the White House and in the Oval Office.Mr. Zinke had been preparing for this moment since he took office.As his confirmation hearing, he had promised a fresh approach to Alaska, and he went about delivering on that pledge by filling important jobs at the Interior Department with Alaska and Arctic exploration in mind.A Washington lobbyist, David Bernhardt, was appointed deputy secretary. Mr. Bernhardt had represented Alaska in litigation against the federal government, including an unsuccessful lawsuit in 2014 that sought a review of the state\u2019s plan for exploring oil and gas resources within the coastal plain of the refuge. Earlier, he served at the Interior Department under President George W. Bush.A campaign manager to Ms. Murkowski, Steve Wackowski, was named senior adviser for Alaskan affairs. He had also had a job as operations manager for a joint venture focused on remote sensing in North Slope oil fields, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 said. An owner of that venture is Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, a Native company that has surface rights in the refuge and a stake, along with A.S.R.C., in another partnership seeking to conduct seismic testing there.A third official with Alaska ties, Mr. Balash, now oversees the Bureau of Land Management, giving him direct oversight of Arctic exploration. His first day on the job was the day after the tax legislation passed.Mr. Balash grew up in Alaska and served as chief of staff to Senator Dan Sullivan, the Alaska Republican. In 2014, when the state sued the federal government, he was commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.\u201cGiven my background and work history,\u201d Mr. Balash said, \u201cI felt privileged to be able to work on this project. It has been something that, obviously, has been a subject of some debate.\u201dDrilling proponents cheered the appointments.\u201cWe had no friends under Obama,\u201d said Rebecca Logan, chief executive of the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, a trade group representing over 500 companies that provide oil field services. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got the Interior Department where there are great Alaskan friends.\u201dDespite the close ties, industry officials insist they are not getting a free pass.\u201cI\u2019m not expecting a rubber stamp,\u201d said Kara Moriarty, the chief executive of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, who has a framed photo with Mr. Zinke in her Anchorage office. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a very diligent and thorough process.\u201dBut those who oppose drilling in the refuge, including many Democrats in Washington, suspect the Department of Interior is not being so diligent. Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who will become chairman of the Natural Resources Committee next month, said he would probably call a hearing about the Arctic development with the goal of slowing it down.Scores of environmental organizations are also watching closely, ready to sue whenever an opportunity arises.\u201cThere are groups out there who will fight this tooth and nail, no matter what,\u201d Mr. Balash said. \u201cIt is fair to say I\u2019ve been lawyered up on this project from Day 1.\u201dOne time-consuming hurdle for big drilling projects is getting the environmental clearances. During the Obama administration, the environmental review of drilling prospects in another part of Alaska ran well over 1,000 pages and took two and a half years to complete.Not this time.A draft environmental impact statement on the coastal plain leasing plan is expected to be released soon, with the finished version to follow next spring, just a year after being ordered. And a separate assessment of seismic testing is also expected any day, that one just months in the making.The hurry-up follows a directive from Mr. Bernhardt, the deputy secretary, limiting all environmental impact statements to one year and 150 pages, or 300 pages for \u201cunusually complex\u201d projects. Mr. Bernhardt cited the need to reduce paperwork.Mr. Balash, of the Bureau of Land Management, said the shorter time frame was also possible in part because the bureau was relying on past scientific studies. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though we\u2019re starting from scratch,\u201d he said. Older studies may be less useful, however, because of changes in the Arctic related to warming.Completing the environmental impact statement by next spring should allow the department to sell leases in 2019, Mr. Balash said, even faster than in the language of the 2017 tax bill.In justifying the pace, Mr. Balash said many people had \u201cbeen waiting for this for a very long time.\u201dOpponents say that having leases in the hands of oil companies before the 2020 elections would make halting the drilling program more difficult should a Democrat win the White House. They also complain that the public has been sidelined in the interest of speed. Although the fate of the Arctic refuge is a federal issue of national interest, just one hearing has been held outside Alaska.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be damage, going to be long-lasting effects from what they do,\u201d said Geoffrey L. Haskett, president of the National Wildlife Refuge Association and a former Alaska regional director with the Fish and Wildlife Service, the managing agency of the refuge. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine that what we\u2019re going to see is going to be adequate,\u201d he added, referring to the environmental evaluations.The rushed schedule has led to rifts between the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service, which was forced into a secondary role by the language of the tax bill. Greta Burkart, an aquatic ecologist who resigned in June after more than seven years with the service in Alaska, said the accelerated process had further marginalized the agency.Dr. Burkart said that was one of the reasons she resigned. \u201cI felt there was little that Fish and Wildlife could do at that point,\u201d she said.She said that scientists were given less time than usual to provide expert comment on draft sections of the environmental reviews \u2014 just 48 hours in some cases \u2014 and that their comments were sometimes not acknowledged. Other current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, had similar complaints.The decision to conduct an environmental assessment of the seismic testing proposal, a less rigorous review than a full environmental impact statement, was especially troubling for many drilling opponents.The population of polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea has been declining for years as climate change has reduced the extent of sea ice in the Arctic. The population is now estimated at 800 to 900 animals.Pregnant bears dig winter dens in the snow on the coastal plain, and if those dens are not detected during the seismic work, the mothers and their newborn cubs could be disturbed or endangered by the heavy trucks.Steven C. Amstrup, chief scientist with Polar Bears International, a conservation group, said the coastal plain in the refuge \u201c \u201cis the most important maternal denning area\u201d for the southern Beaufort Sea population.Dr. Amstrup, a former United States Geological Survey zoologist who has studied the bears for three decades, said his research had shown that the heat-sensing technology used to detect dens would probably miss about half the dens, which would probably be disturbed during the seismic work.Jeff Hastings, chairman of SAExploration, part of the seismic-testing joint venture, said improved technology would prevent damage to the tundra this time around. He also said his company was working with the Interior Department on ways to protect the bears by holding off on testing in some areas until after the animals have left their dens, for example.When Mr. Zinke went in search of influential Alaskans to fill top posts in his Interior Department, he turned to people who had worked for elected officials in the state and for past Republican administrations in Washington.He also looked to A.S.R.C., a multibillion-dollar business that stands to gain the most financially if drilling commences in the 1002 Area. Tara Sweeney, its former executive vice president for external affairs, is now assistant secretary for Indian affairs. Her federal financial disclosure form, filed in February, showed that at A.S.R.C. she had been paid more than $1 million over the prior 13 months, including incentives from previous years.The cultural accents on the grounds of A.S.R.C.\u2019s corporate offices in Anchorage honor the traditions of its 13,000 Native shareholders, and feature Inupiaq sculptures and a diorama of a whaling festival. But inside the 10-story building, A.S.R.C. reveals itself as a powerful conglomerate poised to take full advantage of any oil and gas exploration to come.Its subsidiaries include an energy services outfit, a fuel-refining and marketing operation and a construction company, all at the ready to supply services to oil companies that acquire drilling rights. A.S.R.C. also has a stake in the seismic-testing partnership lined up to explore the 1002 Area, as well as rights to drill on 92,000 acres within 1002.More than 30 years ago, BP and Chevron drilled a single test hole in the 1002 Area on land leased from A.S.R.C. and Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation. The results of that test, which have been kept secret, may hold clues about the reserves that could help explain A.S.R.C.\u2019s enthusiasm for drilling.Bill Horn, a Reagan administration official who helped negotiate the deal that gave A.S.R.C. drilling rights in the 1002 Area, recalled how people involved in the drilling left that testing in 1986 \u201chot to trot\u201d about the potential reserves.\u201cWe like being under the radar,\u201d said Teresa Imm, the company\u2019s senior vice president for resource development, who was among the executives who traveled to Washington last year to press for the tax legislation. Over the past decade, the company has spent more than $3 million on lobbying, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.Some of the A.S.R.C. leaders, including Ms. Imm, are not Alaska Natives, but the company has had the ability to speak and act on behalf of Native communities. Ms. Imm said A.S.R.C. was simply trying to make good on promises to develop the land for its shareholders.But there are deep disagreements over A.S.R.C.\u2019s role in the drilling campaign, and whether its corporate interests align with those of Native families who have lived off the land for generations.Some, like Sam Alexander, a Gwich\u2019in formerly from Fort Yukon, say A.S.R.C. has gone too far.\u201cNative corporations are not tribes,\u201d said Mr. Alexander, who teaches at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. \u201cThe only thing Native about them is their name. They are just corporations.\u201dA.S.R.C. officials say that the company has never represented itself as a tribe, but that its shareholders are members of various Alaskan tribes.For decades, the Gwich\u2019in have led the Native opposition to drilling, arguing that opening the 1002 Area could affect the porcupine caribou, a major source of food and a spiritual touchstone.\u201cWe are asking to continue to live the way we always have,\u201d said Bernadette Demientieff, the executive director of the Gwich\u2019in Steering Committee, which opposes oil development in the refuge and recently joined with the Sierra Club to try to persuade banks to hold back financing for exploration. The steering committee has also worked with environmental groups to persuade politicians to defend the refuge from drilling.Matthew Rexford, the tribal administrator of Kaktovik and the president of Kaktovik Inupiat Group, said the drilling could be done responsibly and should go forward. Unlike the Gwich\u2019in, Mr. Rexford\u2019s village stands to benefit financially.\u201cI have given this a lot of thought, and our community has given this a lot of thought,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do feel it can be done in an environmentally safe and sound manner.\u201dBut some Inupiat have reservations. \u201cThink about what\u2019s going to happen to this land if there is an oil spill and the response that\u2019s going to come along with it,\u201d Adrienne Aakaluk Titus, a community organizer in Fairbanks, said at hearing in Kaktovik.The muscle of the Native corporations has not been lost on Alaskan politicians like Ms. Murkowski, who has supported their interests and been rewarded in return.Under federal law, the corporations are considered \u201cdisadvantaged,\u201d meaning they receive preference in contracting. A.S.R.C. and the other 12 regional corporations received $3.3 billion in contracts in the 2017 fiscal year, federal data show.Beginning in 2009, there was a move in Congress to curtail the preferential treatment. An investigation by a Senate subcommittee found that the corporations were among the largest federal contractors, often landing high-value contracts without having to bid. Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who led the subcommittee, complained that the corporations relied \u201cheavily on non-Native managers\u201d and employed \u201crelatively few of their shareholders\u201d as she pushed for changes to contracting practices, some of which went into effect in 2011.Ms. Murkowski helped limit the changes, defending the work of the Native corporations and arguing, along with other Alaskan officials, that her Senate colleagues should not use income alone to measure disadvantage. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a population many times without a road system or water supply system,\u201d she said in 2011.A year earlier, when Ms. Murkowski lost the Republican Senate primary, she took the unusual step of seeking re-election as a write-in candidate. It was a complicated feat that leaned heavily on her support among the Native corporations.The corporations set up a political action committee that spent $1.6 million to back her successful campaign. A.S.R.C. was one of the largest supporters, contributing $200,000.A year ago, after the tax bill passed, the A.S.R.C.\u2019s newsletter featured a photograph on its cover from an Oval Office celebration with Mr. Trump. Ms. Murkowski, beaming, appeared surrounded by Alaska Natives and A.S.R.C. officials.Katie Orlinsky contributed reporting from Coldfoot, Alaska, and Danielle Ivory from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Does the E.U. Think This Is Going to End?", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the standoff over Italy\u2019s debt, Brussels is playing a very dangerous game.Mr. Tooze is an economic historian and the author of \u201cCrashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World.\u201dThe European Union and Italy have been in a standoff over the Italian government\u2019s debt for weeks. Brussels \u2014 supported by the rest of the governments of Europe \u2014 seems to believe that Rome will soon back down, delivering another victory for European Union discipline. But that\u2019s far from certain. Moreover, even if the Italian government does fall into line, the political consequences may prove disastrous for Europe. However the drama ends, Europe is playing a dangerous game.Italy\u2019s real financial problem, however, is not the annual budget shortfall but the country\u2019s mountain of outstanding debt, running to a total of 2.6 trillion euros, most of which was piled up decades ago by political parties that no longer exist. Today the debt burden hovers around 133 percent of gross domestic product.Debts at this level can easily become unsustainable, growing faster than the income necessary to repay them. The debt is widely held by banks inside and outside Italy. A scenario in which Italy had difficulty meeting its financing needs would deal a shattering blow to Europe\u2019s fragile financial system. Given this delicate balance, there is little room for error. Every opportunity must be taken to lower the ratio of debt to G.D.P.With the eurozone\u2019s having experienced a modest recovery since 2013, and even Italy\u2019s economy growing again, the European Commission argues that Italy should tighten its belt. Rome demurs.Of course, no government wants to embrace cuts. But there is a more basic point here: For the commission to declare Italy fit to make budget cuts just because the country has seen some growth is in glaring contradiction to actual economic and political conditions.The two parties that make up the current Italian government, the League and the Five Star Movement, were elected in March to address this crisis. The League is xenophobic; Five Star is erratic and zany. But the economic programs on which they campaigned are hardly outlandish. The League wants tax cuts for its core constituency of small businesses. Five Star wants a minimum income guarantee for its voters in Italy\u2019s poorer southern regions. Both want to coddle Italy\u2019s pensioners. These proposals will increase the deficit. But at the same time, Rome argues, they will deliver a much-needed stimulus.How much stimulus is the key question.The Italian government\u2019s budget forecasts are optimistic. But others, including the Bank of Italy and the Peterson Institute of International Economics, warn that Italy is caught in a trap: Anxieties about debt sustainability mean that any stimulus has the perverse effect of driving up interest rates, squeezing bank lending and reducing growth.Currently, market confidence is still supported by European Central Bank bond purchases. In 2019 the E.C.B.\u2019s outgoing president, Mario Draghi, a longtime advocate of Italian discipline, is stopping the bank\u2019s bond buying. Tension is set to rise.The European Commission is, of course, bound to defend its rules. But how does the European Union expect the confrontation to play out?It will therefore have to be the markets that deliver the discipline. But that is a terrifying prospect: Not only is Italy\u2019s debt huge, but Italy\u2019s banks are not minnows, either. Italy is both too big to fail and too big to bail.So what is the game plan? If the commission is gambling that the budget crisis will force Italy\u2019s government to fold, what direction does it imagine the government folding in?The last time Italy\u2019s public debt was in the eurozone\u2019s spotlight was in the fall of 2011. Then, the resolution was political: Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was toppled in favor of the unelected technocrat Mario Monti. Mr. Monti was the darling of the markets. But back home, public outrage against the suspension of normal democratic procedures helped to trigger the upsurge of the Five Star Movement, which culminated with its taking 32 percent of the vote in March.The European Commission can hardly wish to repeat that cycle.On the back of its election victory, Five Star was the senior partner in the coalition formed in May. But the balance of power has shifted. While Five Star\u2019s popularity has slid, support for the League has doubled to 34 percent. The League is a party of northern Italian small business. It is far from keen on Five Star\u2019s plans to increase welfare for the south. A League-dominated reshuffle that dropped Five Star\u2019s expensive minimum-income guarantee would go a long way to meeting the financial demands of the European Commission. The new government might even find common ground with Brussels on issues of \u201csupply-side reform.\u201d That would no doubt reassure investors, but it would be a disastrous outcome for the European Union, handing a political victory to Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, who makes no secret of his desire to remake Europe as an arena of neo-nationalist, nativist politics.If strengthening the League is not the commission\u2019s intention, perhaps Brussels is hoping for a tactical withdrawal by Rome. A face-saving compromise may yet be arranged over the expensive pension proposals. If the government crumbles, perhaps a new election might yield a more compliant majority.But this is, to say the least, a high-risk and negative strategy. Above all it fails to address the deep sense of crisis in Italy. If the European Union is determined to hold the line on debt and deficits, it should offer something positive in exchange, such as a common European investment and growth strategy or a more cooperative approach to the refugee question, which has driven the upsurge in the League. If all Brussels has to offer is discipline, it is inviting the remaking of Italian politics along lines that are more nationalist and more hostile to Europe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "LinkedIn Co-Founder Apologizes for Deception in Alabama Senate Race", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Hoffman said he had no idea that political operatives whose work he had financed had used fakery on Facebook and Twitter in the special Senate election a year ago in Alabama. But he had an obligation to track how his money was spent, he said, and he promised to exercise more care in the future.The New York Times and The Washington Post reported last week that $100,000 from Mr. Hoffman was spent on a deceptive social media campaign to aid Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, who barely defeated the Republican, Roy Moore.The money went to a small group of social media experts that included Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, a cybersecurity firm.They created a Facebook page intended to look like the work of conservative Alabamians, and used it to try to split Republicans and promote a conservative write-in candidate to take votes from Mr. Moore.They also used thousands of Twitter accounts to make it appear as if automated Russian bot accounts were following and supporting Mr. Moore, according to an internal report on the project. The apparent Russian support for Mr. Moore drew broad news media coverage.Democratic political strategists say the small Alabama operation \u2014 which accounts for a minuscule share of the $51 million spent in the contest \u2014 was carried out as a debate about tactics intensified within the party.Democrats had been shocked to learn of Russia\u2019s stealth influence campaign to damage Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential race. But at least a few Democrats thought their party could not shun such tactics entirely if others were going to continue to use them.The Alabama operation is among the first examples to come to light of such underhanded methods on social media in American politics. But because such efforts are generally very easy to hide and very difficult to trace, it is possible that other instances have gone undetected.In 2017, through a fund called Investing in Us, Mr. Hoffman gave money to a small company, American Engagement Technologies. The company\u2019s leader, Mikey Dickerson, is a former Google employee who founded the United States Digital Service during the Obama administration to try to upgrade the federal government\u2019s use of technology. An associate of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s said that his total grant to American Engagement was $750,000, which also went toward other political races and social media research. Mr. Dickerson has declined to comment.American Engagement then passed $100,000 to Mr. Morgan and other researchers. Mr. Hoffman\u2019s statement says the money went to Mr. Morgan\u2019s company, New Knowledge, but Mr. Morgan said the Alabama project was carried out separately from the company.The revelations of and fallout from the operation are being closely watched. Some American political experts fear that the Russian influence campaign of 2016 could become a dangerous model for stateside politics, with dirty tricks on social media becoming common. Laws and regulations have not been updated to cope with such a threat.\u201cWe cannot permit dishonest campaign tactics to go unchecked in our democracy \u2014 no matter which side they purportedly help,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said in his statement.He has made no secret of his opposition to President Trump, and in 2016 he offered to donate $5 million to veterans\u2019 groups if Mr. Trump released his tax returns.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "These Men Are Waiting to Share Some Feelings With You", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn meetings and retreats, chastened menfolk are working stuff out.On a Monday night in a sparsely decorated room in Midtown Manhattan, a group of approximately 20 men including an endocrinologist, a sportscaster, a policeman and an employee of the United Nations were baring their souls.\u201cI\u2019m angry that my health is deteriorating. I\u2019m not ready to be an old man,\u201d said Jeff Nichols, 70, a former consultant. \u201cI\u2019m checking in with some anger. I didn\u2019t get accepted to the Ashtanga Institute, and I smashed two candles, which I know isn\u2019t very yogic,\u201d said another man, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional repercussions.The goal, according to many affiliated with MKP, is to break down patriarchal and hierarchical ideas of masculinity. And the place to start is where another man, Socrates, did centuries ago: with the mandate of \u201cknow thyself.\u201d MKP translates this as a process of cultivating awareness around one\u2019s emotions, so they aren\u2019t projected onto others in harmful and destructive ways. This is accomplished through a series of facilitated exercises, some of which involve props, aimed at bringing feelings to the surface and to hold a mirror to oneself.MKP helped him navigate becoming a father of two. \u201cThere is no way I could have done that without a brotherhood telling me all the bull I was projecting onto my wife but also hold me with compassion,\u201d he said.\u201cThe weekend is a little strange at first,\u201d recalled Zvika Krieger, 35, who attended one 11 years ago and now helps to facilitate the MKP retreats in the Bay Area, where he runs a technology policy organization. \u201cYou are pushed emotionally, but there is certainly nothing that happens you are ashamed of after.\u201dAfter completing the New Warrior Training Adventure, many men join Integration Groups, or I-Groups, where they continue, on a weekly basis with the guidance of a trained peer facilitator, the \u201cwork,\u201d as it is called in MKP, that was started during those 48 hours. I-Groups are attended not just by woke, liberal elites on the coasts. Kansas City, Mo.; the greater Carolinas; Atlanta; Indianapolis; Milwaukee; Memphis; and Louisville, Ky., all have sizable groups, according to the organization. Evryman has a half a dozen groups in Montana and over 20 in the Northern Rockies. In March, one of its retreats will take place in Logan, Ohio, the first in the Midwest.The Evryman weekend is called the Open Source Retreat ($475 to $975, depending on accommodations) and brings together 50 men and eight leaders who have completed something called Men\u2019s Emotional Leadership Training (MELT) \u201cto set aside cultural norms and be transparent, honest, and vulnerable with each other,\u201d to quote from the company\u2019s literature. The goal is to \u201cleave feeling like we shed 30 pounds of emotional baggage.\u201d Ebenezer Bond, 42, the founder of a marketing agency, said that until getting involved with Evryman he hadn\u2019t had a cathartic drag-it-out cry since he was 16. The retreat he attended in late 2016 opened the floodgates. \u201cI was skeptical at first \u2014 I even deleted an initial email with the invitation to the weekend,\u201d Mr. Bond said. \u201cBut it was the single most transformational experience I\u2019ve had as an adult male. I was able to express emotions in front of other men, something I\u2019d never done before.\u201dSimon Isaacs, who was invited by Mr. Bond to a later retreat, said he \u201cpanicked\u201d when he learned, five minutes before he arrived at Race Brook Lodge in Sheffield, Mass., that there would be no consumption of alcohol and minimal cellphone use. \u201cI thought, \u2018What am I supposed to do: express myself?\u2019\u201d he said. Now Mr. Isaacs, 38, a founder of the millennial parenting site Fatherly, attends a weekly Evryman group and calls it part of his \u201cemotional retraining.\u201d Perhaps the biggest endorsement is Mr. Isaacs\u2019s wife, who has told him to \u201ckeep going.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a work in progress,\u201d he said.Chimezie Uzodinma, 32, an information-technology professional in New York who has been involved with MKP for a decade, credited his weekly group for pulling him out of hopelessness and despair. \u201cThere was a moment when I thought I was going to die alone and I was very depressed,\u201d he said.But MKP and Evryman are very clear that they are not offering group therapy. \u201cWe don\u2019t pretend to be counselors or therapists, but sometimes people come at the suggestion of their individual psychotherapist,\u201d said Scott Fried, a motivational speaker who works with at-risk teenagers and often facilitates his I-Group on Monday nights in New York.At Evryman, Mr. Krump said he and other organizers \u201cintentionally didn\u2019t include spirituality\u201d in their approach. \u201cThe groups, which don\u2019t have specific leadership, start with a rather agnostic meditation. Then participants share how they are feeling and try to identify where those sensations are appearing in the body. Next is a more in-depth round in which the men are asked whether they have met \u201ctheir stretch\u201d: a commitment or goal for the next week based on what the person had worked on in the group. These can vary from making time to do restorative yoga every day, to connecting on a deeper level with family over the holidays \u2014 something Peter Nesbit, 34, a finance executive at a software company, said he was able to do over Thanksgiving weekend with his parents in South Dakota.Then each man is given around 10 minutes to talk more at length about what\u2019s going on with himself. Group members ask probing follow-up questions: \u201cHow do you feel? What do you need to let go of? What do you want? What do you need from the group?\u201d The prodding often elicits frustration, anger and sadness. Screaming into a pillow is not uncommon. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid to be with myself. I don\u2019t want to feel fragile and afraid,\u201d said Kevin Hermann, 27, an entrepreneur, at one Monday evening Evryman group at a Williamsburg loft.There is something undeniably powerful about a group of people, let alone men, sitting and listening intently \u2014 cross-talk, interrupting and giving advice are highly discouraged \u2014 without distraction or interruption. And eye contact is a must. This may sound like basic conversational etiquette, but \u201cholding space,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the personal development world, is, at a minimum, cathartic in era of constant distraction and always looking for the next best thing. In some cases, it can feel quite profound.Sex, sexuality and relationships are big topics. \u201cWe have millennials come to groups or training whose introduction to sex has been through porn, and no one talked to them about the link between sex, intimacy and love,\u201d Mr. Krieger said. Now in his 30s, Mr. Krieger, who also goes to therapy, says he feels lucky to have started the MKP when he was 24, before he was married or became a father. \u201cI can now see when I\u2019m shutting down, or I\u2019m really getting defensive,\u201d he said.And in the #MeToo era, issues of reconciling past sexual behavior come up, said Ben Fleisher, 40, who runs a men\u2019s group in Woodstock, N.Y. \u201cWe had one situation where someone talked about how they reached out to a woman because he felt like he may have crossed the line, but the woman didn\u2019t think it was sexual assault,\u201d said Mr. Fleisher, 40, an alumnus of Sterling\u2019s Men\u2019s Weekend who works as an acupuncturist. \u201cThis topic in general is an area where we need to dig deeper. Many men are struggling to come to terms with #MeToo and how they feel complicit in abuses, even if they aren\u2019t the perpetrators, by not taking a more active stand for a woman\u2019s sovereignty.\u201dLest this all comes off as self-indulgent, devotees of men\u2019s groups say blunt-force honesty is something that keeps them coming back. \u201cI\u2019m very verbose and have a lot of opinions,\u201d said Mr. Krieger, who has been training for almost seven years to be in a volunteer leadership position in the MKP. \u201cI started getting feedback that it was totally killing the energy in the circle and wasn\u2019t leaving room for other people. Since I\u2019m the boss at work, no one is going to tell me that to my face.\u201d Some are unflinching in requesting feedback. Instead of having a blowout party on his 50th birthday, Mr. Fried told his I-Group that he wanted each person to tell him something he needed to work on. Mr. Fried, now 55, said the experience made him realize that \u201cI come with a lot of victimhood because I got infected with H.I.V. But the group has called me on that and helped me recognize that I\u2019m a powerful man.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Electric Vehicles Are Gathering Speed in Latin America", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo fight global warming and air pollution, cities across the region are taking advantage of innovations in urban transportation. Ms. Viscidi and Mr. Edwards are specialist in energy and climate change.But several factors are impeding the progress of EVs in Latin America, including upfront costs that are hefty for developing countries, subsidized fossil fuels, a lack of vehicle fuel efficiency standards, insufficient charging infrastructure, and bidding processes to procure new buses, which prioritize least cost options disqualifying cleaner technologies with higher upfront costs. To overcome these barriers, governments need to strengthen financial incentives and standards favoring clean technologies, expand programs for electrifying high-use vehicles, develop electric mobility strategies and goals, and create public-private partnerships.Governments have attempted to counter high price tags with both financial and nonfinancial incentives. In 2017, the Colombian government eliminated import tariffs for up to 1,500 E.V.s per year through 2019. By 2023, the annual quota will increase to 3,000. In July, Colombia\u2019s stock of E.V.s surpassed 1000 units \u2014 in 2012, just 33 were sold.Local and national governments should also incorporate electric mobility into long-term energy and transportation planning. Electric mobility strategies can provide clarity to markets and direction for public policy. Building on the region\u2019s first law to incentivize E.V.s in Costa Rica, which entered into force in January, President Carlos Alvarado has announced that by 2021 his administration will launch a plan to establish a fossil fuel-free transportation system.Finally, partnerships involving city governments and private utilities, automakers, bus companies and local businesses have also accelerated the adoption of E.V.s across Latin America and should serve as models. Last year, Mexico had some 1,500 publicly accessible chargers, most of which were installed by Tesla through deals with shopping centers and hotels. Low-interest loans from multilateral development banks are also enabling cities to make the large upfront payments for electric buses.E.V.s alone are not a silver bullet. Addressing urban transportation challenges requires a multifaceted approach that should include improvements to public transportation, stricter fuel efficiency and fuel quality standards for all vehicles, and the expansion of nonmotorized transport including walking and biking. But as the only zero-emissions vehicles, E.V.s will play a vital role in meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.After decades in which the world\u2019s transportation system has scarcely changed, urban mobility appears on the cusp of rapid transformation. As the world embraces this transition, Latin America is also getting on board.Lisa Viscidi is director of the Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries Program at the Inter-American Dialogue.

{"Headline": "Risky Home Loans Are Making a Comeback. Are They Right for You?", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersInterest rates have started to rise, and the housing market is cooling off, a combination that is putting a squeeze on mortgage lenders. Now, some of them are turning to more complicated loans, a remnant of the last housing boom, to bolster their business.These risky offerings fall under the umbrella of non-qualifying loans, meaning they do not conform to standards set by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But lenders are starting to push the loans on borrowers, who are using them to get into homes that may be bigger and more expensive than what they could otherwise afford.One popular loan is the interest-only adjustable rate mortgage, with which a borrower pays only the interest for a period before the rate resets and principal becomes part of the payment. Another is the income verification or \u201cability to repay\u201d loan, tailored to a borrower who does not have regular wages but is paid in large chunks of money \u2014 for example, from an investment partnership.These types of loans may be a good strategy for a wealthy home buyer, but some say they still carry the taint of overeager and unscrupulous brokers who pushed them on borrowers unable to repay them, creating a bubble in the housing market that burst in 2008.\u201cAll of these types of loans make anyone who is in this business cringe,\u201d said Tom Millon, chief executive of Capital Markets Cooperative, a network of 550 small mortgage lenders and servicers.Still, lending standards are higher, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the no-asset, no-income, no-verification loans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about someone with a nontraditional income source that\u2019s verified six ways to Sunday.\u201dYet the slowdown in mortgage underwriting has pushed lenders to look at alternative loans, Mr. Millon said. \u201cWe all have time on our hands because business is so slow,\u201d he said.Banks and mortgage providers are careful to say they are marketing these products only to qualified borrowers. But the offerings can be hard to understand.Tonaus John, chief operating officer of DBC Real Estate Management, recently moved to Pittsburgh for work. He and his wife bought a 4,000-square-foot home in Franklin Park, a suburb where they felt they could put down roots for their twin first-grade daughters.\u201cI fell in love with the house,\u201d Mr. John said. \u201cWe saw it, put in an offer and closed in less than 30 days.\u201dHe used an interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage to buy the house, which cost about $1 million. He looked at traditional fixed-rate loans as well, but the interest-only loan was half a percentage point lower, with the rate locked in for 10 years.\u201cI calculated that I was going to save $25,000 on the adjustable-rate mortgage,\u201d he said. The possible increase in interest at the end of 10 years was capped at 5.25 percentage points. \u201cThe worst it could be was 8.75 percent, and saving $25,000, I could put that money somewhere else.\u201dThe family\u2019s plan, Mr. John said, is to make principal payments in addition to the interest, with the goal of reducing his mortgage faster than he would with a 30-year fixed-rate loan.\u201cWe don\u2019t like paying interest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur aim is to pay it off in 15 to 20 years.\u201dIn many ways, this is the ideal strategy for someone taking out an interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage. But even a conscientious borrower faces risks with these types of loans, said Susan M. Wachter, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.One is an unexpected downturn in pockets of the housing market. She said this was happening at the high end of the condominium market in New York, where demand for luxury residences is not keeping up with the supply.\u201cThe supply-demand imbalance leads not to small price changes but to large price changes, even if a market as a whole isn\u2019t showing stress,\u201d Dr. Wachter said. \u201cIf you do need to sell to move or get a better job, or your own financial circumstances change, having a mortgage that exceeds the value of the home will put you in a spot.\u201dOf course, this could happen with a traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but the monthly payments help pay down the principal, which increases the homeowner\u2019s equity.Another concern, Dr. Wachter said, is in hot markets like San Francisco, where home values are growing so quickly that an interest-only loan may be the only feasible way to buy a house. If, for example, a big chunk of the borrower\u2019s income comes from company stock or annual bonuses, then keeping the monthly payment low for the time being seems logical.But when the local economy slows or the housing market stalls, interest-only buyers could be hit harder if they weren\u2019t diligent in paying down the principal.\u201cIn markets like San Francisco, the correction is going to be more severe,\u201d Dr. Wachter said. \u201cThese are the properties that are going to be the most volatile and have the most price risk. The price falls will be higher because of the expectation that prices always go up.\u201dAnd not paying principal during the initial interest-only period just makes the amortization period of the loan shorter, said Richard K. Green, a professor of real estate at the University of Southern California.In other words, instead of paying off a mortgage over 30 years, the borrower is paying it down over 20 or 25 years, increasing the amount of the payments after the interest-only period ends.Both professors noted that interest-only loans could be smart choices depending on how the buyer thought about the house.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about independently wealthy households and they\u2019re thinking about cash management and they really do want more debt, this is a way to manage it with a view toward the entire portfolio,\u201d Dr. Wachter said.Peter Boomer, a mortgage executive at PNC Bank, which underwrote Mr. John\u2019s loan, said the interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage made sense for the right client and had benefits over a traditional mortgage.He offered three categories of borrowers for whom these loans work well: those who do not plan to stay in their homes for the full 30 years, those whose compensation includes a bonus that makes up the bulk of their earnings and those who look at the mortgage as another form of debt in their portfolio.Borrowers are evaluated to see if they can repay a 30-year fixed-rate loan for the same home, he said, and they are often asked to put down 25 percent or 30 percent of the purchase price if they chose one of the non-qualified mortgages.He added that PNC did a personal assessment of each borrower. \u201cIt\u2019s not to just get someone into a house,\u201d he said.The risk of a change in a person\u2019s financial circumstances could affect the ability to repay interest-only loans. But Dr. Green said a bigger problem was subprime borrowers, like the middle-class buyers who used them in the lead-up to the housing crash.\u201cIn the past, the one most likely to blow up was the loan to the couple making $40,000 a year who bought a house in Bakersfield for $500,000,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the payment shock that blew them up. These people were on the edge and couldn\u2019t buy a house with a standard loan. They were the first to lose their jobs.\u201dToday, though, even qualified borrowers need to be aware of the loans\u2019 risks. After the initial interest-only period resets, the payment can go up as high as 50 percent, and some people cannot afford that, Dr. Green said.Borrowers can refinance at a lower rate, but with interest rates rising, they need to be aware that may not be a possibility.\u201cI feel that you should have to be a qualified investor to get into the product, like you have to be for private equity,\u201d Dr. Green said. \u201cFor the first-time home buyer, I say stay away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wisconsin Is About to Make a Huge Mistake", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lame duck, heavily gerrymandered Republican Legislature plans to vote on Tuesday to limit the powers of the incoming governor and attorney general, who are \u2014 surprise \u2014 Democrats.Mr. Kaufman is a writer and musician who grew up in Wisconsin.Late Friday afternoon, less than a month after a Democrat, Tony Evers, defeated Scott Walker, the incumbent Republican governor, Robin Vos, the Republican Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, followed through on his threat to strip the new governor of some of his power.That day, an assembly committee released five bills that grant sweeping new authority to the Legislature at the expense of both Mr. Evers and Wisconsin\u2019s new attorney general, Josh Kaul, who also happens to be a Democrat. Drafted in secret, the legislation was rushed to the Joint Finance Committee on Monday for its only public hearing. Legislators and outraged citizens scrambled all weekend to parse more than forty serious changes to state law embedded in the 141 pages of text. The legislature is expected to vote on the bills on Tuesday and Mr. Walker has indicated an openness to signing legislation of this stripe.No one is really bothering to hide the purpose of this lame duck legislation: to continue the Republicans\u2019 hold on state government, even at the expense of core democratic principles like respect for the separation of powers and majority rule. The legislation would nullify the decision-making of Wisconsin\u2019s voters, who rejected Republicans for every statewide office in the November midterms.The lame duck legislation would, for example, prevent Mr. Evers from fulfilling a campaign promise to take Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act. It will also diminish the governor\u2019s control over the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, a scandal-ridden public-private agency created by Mr. Walker to foster job creation, by giving the legislature an equal number of appointees to the board as the governor and revoking the governor\u2019s power to appoint the board\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Evers campaigned on closing the agency, the subject of critical audits by the state\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau, which revealed that the economic development corporation had mismanaged millions of dollars in loans. The agency also attracted controversy after leading the effort to entice Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing contractor, to build its first American plant in Wisconsin, at a cost to taxpayers now reaching more than $4.5 billion dollars in subsidies.The lame duck legislation will also weaken the attorney general\u2019s office by eliminating the solicitor general\u2019s office in the state\u2019s Department of Justice. And it will take away the attorney general\u2019s power to determine how to spend settlement winnings and give that power to the Legislature. The bill also gives the Legislature the right to effectively act as its own attorney general by granting the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization the power to hire its own special counsel if it determines it is in the \u201cinterests of the state\u201d to do so. (Both Mr. Vos and Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate majority leader, who is collaborating closely with Mr. Vos, are members of the committee.)Apart from stripping powers from other branches of government, the legislation aims to decrease voter turnout by imposing a two-week limit on early voting, despite the fact that a federal judge struck down a similar Wisconsin law in 2016 on the ground that it was racially discriminatory. When Democrats swept statewide offices in November, it was mostly the result of record turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties, Wisconsin\u2019s two largest, both of which allow early voting to begin roughly six weeks before an election.\u201cThe legislature is the most representative branch in government,\u201d Mr. Vos and Mr. Fitzgerald wrote in a joint statement after the bills were released. It was meant to serve as a justification, but in Wisconsin, at least since 2011, that has not been true: That year, at a law office across the street from the state capitol, Republicans drew new redistricting maps, in secret and without input from a single Democrat or member of the public. In 2016, a federal court ruled the maps so excessively partisan as to be unconstitutional, the first time a court had made such a ruling on partisan grounds in thirty years. (Earlier this year, the United States Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue.)Nationally, Democrats won more than 300 state legislative seats in November, but the party gained only one seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly despite winning 54 percent of the aggregate statewide vote. That leaves Democrats with 36 out of 99 seats. (Since the 2011 redistricting, they have not held more than 39 of 99 seats.) In the State Senate, Democrats actually lost a seat, giving Republicans a 19-14 margin.The lame duck legislation also takes aim at lowering turnout for a State Supreme Court election scheduled for April 2020. One measure would move the primary to March in order to avoid its being held on the same day as what is likely to be a crucial Democratic presidential primary. The cost of adding this new election is nearly seven million dollars, and the proposed date would make for three elections in three consecutive months.Last week, Dane County\u2019s clerk announced on social media that 60 of the state\u2019s 72 county clerks opposed the move. Mr. Fitzgerald admitted to reporters that the rationale for moving the election was to give a \u201cbetter chance\u201d to Daniel Kelly, whom Mr. Walker appointed to fill a vacant seat. Judge Kelly\u2019s election to a full ten-year term is essential to preserving the 4-3 conservative advantage on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.Like many Republican policies adopted in Wisconsin over the past eight years, taking power from a Democratic executive is part of a national conservative strategy. In December 2016, a few weeks after the election of Democratic governor Roy Cooper in North Carolina, Republican legislative leaders significantly weakened the state\u2019s governorship. They went so far that at the beginning of this year\u2019s legislative session, a reporter asked Phil Berger, the Republican Senate President Pro Tempore, and Tim Moore, the speaker of the House, if they planned to take away any more of Governor Cooper\u2019s powers. \u201cDoes he still have any?\u201d Mr. Berger joked. \u201cIf you have any suggestions, let us know,\u201d Mr. Moore added.In Michigan, where Democrats also won the governor\u2019s and attorney general\u2019s offices last month, the Republican-controlled legislature is debating divesting powers from both offices, including the attorney general\u2019s oversight of state campaign finance law.Perhaps fortified by the Republicans\u2019 gerrymandered advantage, Mr. Vos has been notably defiant. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it that the voters across Wisconsin affirmed our record, the record of our party, and the agenda that we have put forward over the past eight years,\u201d he told the Assembly Republican Caucus a few days after the election despite Republicans losing all the statewide offices. \u201cWe are the ones that were given a mandate to govern.\u201dI spoke to Mr. Evers last Friday, just before the bills were released. \u201cI also have a mandate to govern,\u201d Mr. Evers told me, in response to Mr. Vos\u2019s comments. \u201cBut we have to work together and solve things for the people of Wisconsin. What Speaker Vos says in caucus, I understand that: he has to rally his troops.\u201dBut after learning about the scope of the bills, Mr. Evers was more assertive. \u201cI view this as a repudiation of the last election,\u201d he told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \u201cI will take any steps possible to assure the people of Wisconsin that I will not invalidate those votes. And frankly, I\u2019m encouraging citizens across the state of Wisconsin to help me in that effort.\u201dMr. Vos and Mr. Fitzgerald seem confident they can turn their self-proclaimed mandate into another chapter in their party\u2019s most enduring achievement: engineering its own dominance. Like their successful efforts to gut Wisconsin\u2019s campaign finance laws, decimate the labor movement and weaken voting rights by enacting one of the country\u2019s strictest voter ID laws, seizing powers from the state\u2019s newly elected governor and attorney general promises to further tilt the balance in the Republicans\u2019 favor.After eight years of relentless attacks on Wisconsin\u2019s progressive political traditions, its state government has been transformed into something that is hard to recognize as a democracy. If these new bills pass, it will become harder still.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Shutdown Looms. Can the G.O.P. Get Lawmakers to Show Up to Vote?", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Just days before a deadline to avert a partial government shutdown, President Trump, Democratic leaders and the Republican-controlled Congress are at a stalemate over the president\u2019s treasured border wall. But House Republican leaders are also confronting a more mundane and awkward problem: Their vanquished and retiring members are sick and tired of Washington and don\u2019t want to show up anymore to vote.Call it the revenge of the lame ducks. Many lawmakers, relegated to cubicles as incoming members take their offices, have been skipping votes in the weeks since House Republicans were swept from power in the midterm elections, and Republican leaders are unsure whether they will ever return.It is perhaps a fitting end to a Congress that has showcased the untidy politics of the Trump era: Even if the president ultimately embraces a solution that avoids a shutdown, House Republican leaders do not know whether they will have the votes to pass it.The uncertainty does not end there. With funding for parts of the government like the Department of Homeland Security set to lapse at midnight on Friday, Mr. Trump and top Republicans appear to have no definite plan to keep the doors open. It is clear that as Democrats uniformly oppose the president\u2019s demand for $5 billion for his border wall, any bill that includes that funding cannot pass the Senate, and might face defeat in the House, too.\u201cThat\u2019s me with my hands up in the air,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters last week, in case there was any confusion about the meaning of the exaggerated shrug he offered when asked how the logjam might be broken. \u201cThere is no discernible plan \u2014 none that\u2019s been disclosed.\u201dIn the final moments of complete Republican control of government before Democrats assume the House majority in January, Republicans find themselves once again trapped between Mr. Trump\u2019s messaging and their own political reality.\u201cThey just have to have the guts to tell President Trump he\u2019s off on the deep end here,\u201d Mr. Schumer said of Republican leaders, \u201cand all he is going to get with his temper tantrum is a shutdown. He will not get a wall.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump insisted that he had the votes to push $5 billion in wall spending through the House, Republican leaders in the chamber are keenly aware that their rank-and-file members are in no mood to return to Washington days before Christmas to battle over his long-unfulfilled signature campaign promise.In the absence of any road map, House leaders shuttered the chamber Thursday for a six-day weekend, putting lawmakers in standby mode and scheduling the next votes for Wednesday evening, two days before the shutdown deadline. (Aides cautioned that the schedule could change.)\u201cNo one has any idea what the play call is \u2014 we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Representative Ryan A. Costello, Republican of Pennsylvania, who, because he is retiring, has already surrendered his office suite for a cramped cubicle.\u201cYou don\u2019t have an office,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re in wind-down mode, saying goodbye to people and wrapping up, and just putting your voting card in the machine and pressing red or green. It\u2019s going through the motions.\u201dMr. Trump himself is scheduled to leave on Friday for a 16-day vacation at his Florida estate.But even those who have no pressing commitments have grown weary of trekking to the Capitol as Congress grinds to a close. One senior Republican aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said some lawmakers no longer even wanted to see one another\u2019s faces.\u201cThere\u2019s a temper to the House, and it starts to get dark by the end of the year,\u201d said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was a top aide to the former Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. \u201cMembers start out very, very eager to legislate, to make progress, to refresh from the holidays, and by the end of the year, there\u2019s a great deal of friction and tension and just built-up frustration.\u201dThat dynamic is all the more potent for Republican leaders who have spent the last two years trying, with mixed success, to govern while skirting the unfiltered remarks and tweets of a president who cares little about the finer points of legislating, and whose agenda often diverges from their own. Now they find themselves trying to cope with the no-win situation Mr. Trump has created as he insists on building a wall supported by a minority of Americans.\u201cThere is a great disjunction between their motives and his, and this has been a theme of this Congress,\u201d said Norman J. Ornstein, a scholar on Congress at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cTrump does these things without thinking about what his allies in Congress would want or need; he does it with this bluster and this narcissism; and then we end up with this farce.\u201dMr. Ornstein, a sharp critic of Mr. Trump, said the president may be spoiling for a shutdown to draw attention away from his legal exposure, both in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties with Russia and in his former lawyer\u2019s conviction for campaign finance crimes he said were directed by Mr. Trump.\u201cThe closer it gets to him, the more he wants a distraction and the more he wants to gin up his base, but from the perspective of Republicans, doing a shutdown while they\u2019re still running everything just makes them look like idiots,\u201d Mr. Ornstein said.Lawmakers appeared resigned last week to the fact that the outcome of the impasse was up to Mr. Trump. \u201cI think the president does a lot of his own negotiating, and his own thinking, and you can tell that,\u201d said Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.But the odd lull with a shutdown looming was disturbing to some senators. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t come to work and work all the way through December when the taxpayers are paying them,\u201d said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, who is a former House member. \u201cI mean, finish your job.\u201dAfter the Oval Office meeting last week between Mr. Trump and the top House and Senate Democrats, staff members for House Democrats began working on legislation that would reopen the government on Jan. 3, when they are in control, without allocating any wall spending. The measure most likely would fund the government in full for the rest of the fiscal year, according to an aide familiar with the work.At the White House last week, after the news cameras had departed, Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the top House Democrat, raised the prospect that Ms. Pelosi could pass such legislation \u2014 and force Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to choose between accepting a bill without wall funding and reopening the government, or keeping it closed.\u201cWhat do you think Mitch will do?\u201d Mr. Schumer pointedly asked the president, according to a person briefed on the exchange. \u201cKeep it shut down another month? Another week?\u201dMr. Trump did not respond.\u201cWe have worked too hard,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this done.\u201dSheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Firms Drop Support for Cluster Bombs, but \u2018Global Problem Is Much Worse\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 Ten years after an international treaty banned cluster munitions, several financial institutions are slashing investment in companies that produce the weapon, according to a European organization that campaigns for a global ban.The Netherlands-based group PAX said in a report released on Monday that financial institutions it monitors had cut investment in companies that produce cluster munitions from $31 billion in 2017 to $8.7 billion in 2018 \u2014 a 72 percent decrease.Michel Uiterwaal, a co-author of the report, called the downturn a \u201ctestament to the growing global awareness that support for this weapon is unacceptable.\u201d But he also said that many companies not covered by the report were continuing to produce and invest in cluster munitions.\u201cThe global problem is much worse than we describe,\u201d Mr. Uiterwaal said, \u201cbecause there are more producers and there\u2019s more money involved.\u201dThe stigma attached to cluster munitions rose sharply with an international campaign that led to a 2008 treaty banning production, stockpiling and transfer of the weapon. The United States vigorously opposed the treaty, but 120 countries, including most NATO members, have joined the accord.The organization attributed the financial drop mostly to the decision by two major American arms manufacturers \u2014 Textron Inc. and Orbital ATK \u2014 to halt production of the weapon.Mr. Uiterwaal said those decisions at least partly reflected pressure from financial institutions that are turning their backs on funding companies that produce cluster munitions.The $8.7 billion of investment tracked by PAX went to seven companies: Avibras of Brazil, Bharat Dynamics in India, the Chinese companies China Aerospace Science and Industry and Norinco, and the South Korean companies Hanwha, LigNex1 and Poongsan.That list of producers is not exhaustive and no information is available on financing available to many other arms manufacturers producing cluster munitions, Mr. Uiterwaal said.The United States\u2019 last known use of the weapon was in 2009. A directive issued by the George W. Bush administration the previous year said it would not use cluster bombs after 2018 unless they achieved a performance standard not met by existing stocks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Deep Blue New York Is \u2018Voter Suppression Land\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn each case, the state in question was New York. Deep blue, liberal-ideal New York.\u201cNew Yorkers would be aghast if anyone accused New York of voter suppression,\u201d said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. But, she said, \u201cthe antiquated nature of our laws and the failure to enact any common-sense reforms for years puts us kind of in voter suppression land.\u201dOn Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo unveiled a lengthy list of election reforms, promising to make them his priorities for the first 100 days of the new year. The list included early voting, automatic voter registration, vote-by-mail and a merging of the dates of the federal and state primary elections.The governor also threw his support behind an overhaul of campaign finance laws, including banning all corporate contributions and closing the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows real estate moguls and others to donate unlimited amounts to candidates.Democrats have promised that their long-stalled initiatives will finally become law.\u201cOur priorities will involve many of the bills that the Assembly has passed time and again,\u201d said Assemblyman Charles Lavine, who chairs the chamber\u2019s elections committee.But even the most ardent backers acknowledged political and logistical obstacles.Not only Republicans are to blame for the inertia of voting reform in New York, according to Wendy Weiser, the director of the Democracy Program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. Machine politics and the advantages of incumbency make many politicians wary of changing the system.\u201cElected officials often oppose changes to the electoral system in which they were elected,\u201d Ms. Weiser said. \u201cIt\u2019s the incumbency protection agency: \u2018It worked for me, it must be a good system.\u2019\u201dMr. Lavine said he expected early voting and merging primaries to pass immediately, but he was more reserved on the prospects of public financing of campaigns or a ban on corporate money; he said the Assembly would give those ideas \u201cgreat consideration.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I anticipate blowback in the classic sense,\u201d he said of the corporate money proposal. \u201cBut this is something that is going to require a lot of discussion. And both Democratic conferences, in the Senate and the Assembly, have to listen to the concerns of each of their members.\u201dThere may be administrative tangles as well. Two popular proposed reforms \u2014 Election Day voter registration and mail-in voting \u2014 would require a constitutional amendment, which would have to be passed in two consecutive legislative sessions and then ratified by voters, Ms. Weiser said. Rolling out early voting and automatic voter registration, while they could become law immediately, would require money and infrastructure.But Ms. Weiser added that studies have indicated that automatic registration would pay for itself within one or two election cycles, and that early voting would provide immeasurable convenience, allowing officials to avert the kind of Election Day snafus that paralyzed much of New York City this year.Still, advocates acknowledged that legislators\u2019 whims were unpredictable, and that the political obstacles could loom far larger than the logistical ones. But they also said that the visibility of many officials\u2019 prior statements would make it politically dangerous for them to backtrack.\u201cNothing is 100 percent guaranteed in Albany,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government reform group. But she added: \u201cI think it would be very very difficult for people who were elected on the promise that they were going to heed the voice of the voter, to then turn around and just have it be old-fashioned Albany business as usual.\u201dOf course, that is the argument of many other advocates, on many other issues, all of whom are counting on the newly remade government to unleash their own long-stymied legislation. And Albany has disappointed many a lobbyist and activist before.But Ms. Weiser suggested that the dashing of these hopes \u2014 so long-held and in many ways so common-sense \u2014 would have special resonance.\u201cI do think it would be a travesty if New York is unable to get this done,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just a missed opportunity, but I think it would be a setback, at a point when the public is so clearly demanding it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Before the 1980s, funding disagreements didn\u2019t lead to such stalemates even if budgets weren\u2019t passed on time.Still, Professor Meyers said, there\u2019s a common thread: \u201cThey\u2019re all games of chicken.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at how shutdowns came about and have evolved over the years.\u201cThe executive department, especially the military, would make contracts and then Congress would have to find the money to pay for them or else default on them,\u201d Mr. Broussard said.According to Professor Meyers, the first continuing resolution, essentially a stopgap funding bill when the annual appropriation wasn\u2019t approved, was passed in 1876.The roots of modern-day stalemates can be traced to a 1974 law that reorganized the budgeting process, Professor Bilmes said. It shifted more power to Congress from the executive branch and spread it over several congressional committees.Tense disagreements emerged.For years it was common for the government to continue to operate, even if funding bills hadn\u2019t been passed, with the understanding it would eventually get the money approved.But in 1980 and 1981, the United States attorney general, Benjamin R. Civiletti, issued two opinions that emphasized that approach was illegal and the government could not spend money without congressional appropriations.What resulted was a tightening of the budget process, Professor Meyers said. That, in turn, prompted an increased frequency of small shutdowns as politicians struggled with deadlines.The biggest shutdown came in 1995.Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

Located in an office and hotel complex downtown, the Capital Factory has helped a number of Austinites quit their day jobs to become tech entrepreneurs.

Supplies for middle-income families are also increasingly strained.\u201dI think in the last 10 years, it\u2019s been a real struggle for Austin to keep its identity and keep its soul, as downtown is being razed and converted into condos and high-rises, and you have people like Google and Facebook and Apple taking over the town with these buildings,\u201d said Omar Gallaga, who covered the city\u2019s tech culture for The Austin American-Statesman for more than 20 years. \u201cIf you have all the artists and the creative people that make it interesting move away because they can\u2019t afford to live there, then it becomes a different place.\u201dFew dispute that tech has turned Austin into one of the most vibrant and distinctive capital cities in America. Its other varied cultures \u2014 music, military, higher-ed, food, politics, journalism, real estate \u2014 are inseparable from its tech culture.Joseph Kopser, an Austinite who founded and sold a start-up called RideScout, made an unsuccessful but attention-grabbing run this year for a seat in Congress. A longtime venture capitalist, John Thornton, was the founder of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, Austin-based digital news organization that has helped transform Texas journalism. The nonprofit Austin Tech Alliance has launched get-out-the-vote efforts and helped city government shift to paperless permitting. One of the city\u2019s biggest annual cultural attractions, the South By Southwest festival, is now as much a celebration of tech as it is music and film.On any given day, some of the state\u2019s far-right lawmakers may be rubbing elbows downtown with 20-something entrepreneurs headed to work on motorized scooters \u2014 or perhaps, not long ago, passing by Professor Dumpster, otherwise known as Jeff Wilson, the co-founder of the start-up Kasita, who lived in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year as part of an experiment in minimalist living.Austin is still weird. It\u2019s just more wired now, too.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to become Silicon Valley \u2014 we want to be Austin,\u201d said Joshua Baer, the founder and chief executive of the Capital Factory, launched in 2009 to mentor, finance and support start-ups and entrepreneurs. \u201cWhat makes Austin really different, to me, is the culture clash. But it\u2019s not a clash. It\u2019s the culture collaboration.\u201dThere are now more than 138,000 tech-related jobs in the Austin metropolitan region, about 14 percent of the total jobs in the area. Ray Perryman, an economist in Waco, estimated that the tech sector pumps about $31 billion into the area\u2019s overall economy, about 35 percent of the total. It is far from the biggest tech community in the country. In a ranking of the top tech-talent markets by CBRE, a commercial real estate company, Austin came up sixth, behind San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, Toronto and New York. But Austin\u2019s brand as a tech hub rivals that of some of its rivals, including other cities that have a larger tech presence.\u201cWe punch way above our weight class,\u201d said Barbary Brunner, the former chief executive of the Austin Technology Council, which was founded in the early 1990s and functions as the tech community\u2019s chamber of commerce. \u201cIf you\u2019re from outside Austin, you think the tech industry here is huge, super sophisticated, super mature. We don\u2019t have the innovation leaders here. We have executors here.\u201dThe buzz lately does not revolve solely around Apple. A different older global behemoth rarely embraced by hipster tech has become a major player \u2014 the United States Army. Months before Apple\u2019s announcement, the Army opened a new center in downtown Austin to help modernize its weapons and equipment and to identify, acquire and develop innovative technology.The Army Futures Command is the only so-called four-star command that is based not on a military installation but in a civilian building, in this case in the heart of the city in a satellite of the University of Texas. The soldiers mostly shun camouflage for button-down shirts and khakis. They have embedded in Austin\u2019s tech culture, military officials say, to help make the Army smarter and more cutting-edge. The leader of the Army Futures Command, Gen. John M. Murray, a four-star general who also wears casual business attire to work, has been meeting tech entrepreneurs, hanging out at the Capital Factory and recently attended his first Austin hackathon.\u201cOne of the things that we are working on \u2014 and we have not solidified yet, this is just still a concept \u2014 is can the Army work with venture capitalists?\u201d General Murray said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve probably had, in the last couple months, a dozen or a dozen and a half conversations with VCs. For me, it\u2019s more about understanding, because this is all new to me. So, understanding the world they live in, what their requirements are, how they can help us and how we can help them.\u201dOne of the first outcomes of the Army\u2019s new venture was a mixed success. General Murray wanted the Army to work with an Austin-based start-up, Senseye, to help reduce the amount of time a pilot spends in training. It did not work out as planned, but the Army found another application for the company\u2019s technology.The Futures Command will be fully operational in the summer of 2019, and a staff of about 500 will take over two floors of the UT System building. Until then, a subset of the Futures Command called the Army Applications Lab has a team that works out of the Capital Factory.The day after the VR holiday party, Mr. Baer and the rest of Capital Factory hosted a visit from one of the Army\u2019s top officials, Ryan D. McCarthy, the Army under secretary. Mr. McCarthy told reporters that he felt \u201cpretty good\u201d about Apple\u2019s planned expansion, and the Army\u2019s expanding role in Austin. \u201cI think it just shows the wealth of talent and opportunity that exists here in this city and this state.\u201dDavid Montgomery contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tabloid Publisher\u2019s Deal in Hush-Money Inquiry Adds to Trump\u2019s Danger", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the revelation by prosecutors on Wednesday that a tabloid publisher admitted to paying off a Playboy model, key participants in two hush-money schemes say the transactions were intended to protect Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign for president.That leaves Mr. Trump in an increasingly isolated and legally precarious position, according to election law experts. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments made in 2016 to keep two women silent about alleged affairs are now firmly framed as illegal campaign contributions.Mr. Cohen said the transactions were an effort to cover up the president\u2019s \u201cdirty deeds,\u201d a claim that was buttressed when federal prosecutors announced that the tabloid publisher, American Media Inc., said it had bought one of the women\u2019s stories to ensure she \u201cdid not publicize damaging allegations about the candidate.\u201d\u201cA.M.I. further admitted that its principal purpose in making the payment was to suppress the woman\u2019s story so as to prevent it from influencing the election,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement announcing they had struck a deal not to charge the company in exchange for its cooperation. As part of the deal, dated in September but previously kept private, the company also agreed to train employees in election law standards and appoint a qualified lawyer to vet future deals that may involve paying for stories about political candidates.The cascading disclosures marked a turning point in the multiple investigations related to Mr. Trump and the campaign he led. Until recently, the inquiries had produced numerous guilty pleas and indictments but no direct accusations of illegality by the president. That changed with Mr. Cohen\u2019s assertions, outlined in detail by prosecutors, that his own crimes were done \u201cin coordination with and at the direction\u201d of Mr. Trump.Where the investigations go from here is not clear. The prevailing view at the Justice Department is that a sitting president cannot be indicted, though prosecutors in Manhattan could consider charging him after leaving office.Investigators have continued to scrutinize what others in the Trump Organization may have known about the crimes described by Mr. Cohen, including its chief financial officer, according to people briefed on the matter. Prosecutors have met with campaign officials and asked how the campaign interacted with Mr. Trump\u2019s company, which shared office space and employees.Establishing a nexus between Mr. Cohen\u2019s efforts to silence the women and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign is central to making a criminal case of election law violations. That is why A.M.I.\u2019s admission carries so much weight, said Richard L. Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\u201cIt\u2019s looking a lot like an illegal and unreported in-kind corporate contribution to help the campaign, exposing the Trump campaign and Trump himself to possible criminal liability,\u201d Mr. Hasen said.Prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen had intended to reimburse A.M.I. for its payment to Ms. McDougal by arranging a bogus $125,000 fee to an A.M.I. affiliate for \u201cadvisory services.\u201d Although Mr. Pecker signed off on the deal, he later contacted Mr. Cohen and called it off. He also instructed Mr. Cohen to tear up the paperwork, prosecutors said.In addition to McDougal, Mr. Cohen said he arranged a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress, to squelch her story of an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. He said that he used his own money, but that Mr. Trump had agreed to pay him back, with the reimbursement eventually being couched as legal fees billed to the Trump Organization.A.M.I. was also involved in the early stages of Mr. Cohen\u2019s dealings with Ms. Daniels. Rather than pay her, as it did with Ms. McDougal, the company notified Mr. Cohen that she was trying to sell her story.Until this week, it was largely Mr. Cohen\u2019s word against the president\u2019s denials. That is why the admission by A.M.I. is \u201chighly significant, because it goes to corroborate\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony, said Jeff Tsai, part of the prosecution team that accused Senator John Edwards of campaign finance violations when he arranged for payoffs to a pregnant mistress during his 2008 presidential campaign.\u201cIn any future prosecution, Mr. Cohen\u2019s credibility is squarely at issue \u2014 as it should be \u2014 and that is where you see the nature of corroboration, either in the form of witnesses or documents, become such a pivotal factor in a prosecution,\u201d Mr. Tsai said.The Edwards case \u2014 which ended in an acquittal and mistrial \u2014 has been invoked by Trump allies as an example of prosecutorial overreach. Central to Mr. Edwards\u2019s defense was that the payments were intended not to help his campaign but to hide the affair from his wife \u2014 that they were personal, not political.Roger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.Mr. Trump seemed to hint at this strategy in a tweet responding to Mr. Cohen\u2019s admissions, in which he made an oblique reference to a \u201csimple personal transaction\u201d that was being wrongly called \u201ca campaign contribution.\u201dGiven the president\u2019s stance, the disclosure of A.M.I.\u2019s understanding that the efforts were campaign-related \u2014 and its promise of future cooperation \u2014 shows that potential witnesses against Mr. Trump go beyond Mr. Cohen.Indeed, the A.M.I. agreement with prosecutors said there was at least one other person associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign involved in an initial discussion in August 2015, attended by Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pecker, in which they agreed that the publisher would help the campaign by identifying negative stories about Mr. Trump\u2019s relationships with women \u201cso they could be purchased and their publication avoided.\u201dBut many details remain hidden. Among them, the statement did not say whether the other campaign member was Mr. Trump himself \u2014 identified by prosecutors last week as attending a similar meeting \u2014 or some other person. A.M.I. had no comment on Wednesday.In admitting to the scheme, Mr. Pecker, his lieutenant Dylan Howard and A.M.I. are now protected from criminal prosecution.Ben Protess and Rebecca R.

{"Headline": "The Oil Industry\u2019s Covert Campaign to Rewrite American Car Emissions Rules", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it turns out that there was a hidden beneficiary of the plan that was pushing for the changes all along: the nation\u2019s oil industry.The campaign\u2019s main argument for significantly easing fuel efficiency standards \u2014 that the United States is so awash in oil it no longer needs to worry about energy conservation \u2014 clashed with decades of federal energy and environmental policy.The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world\u2019s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales.Gary R. Heminger, Marathon\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the company supported \u201csound fuel economy standards\u201d and wanted to \u201chelp ensure they are achievable and based on existing technology.\u201d He added, \u201cWe appreciate the administration\u2019s willingness to conduct a thorough review in order to ensure future standards are achievable and will actually benefit American consumers.\u201dA spokesman for Koch Industries, the energy conglomerate led by Mr. Koch, said the company had \u201ca long, consistent track record of opposing all forms of corporate welfare, including all subsidies, mandates and other handouts that rig the system.\u201dThe standards that the Trump administration seeks to weaken required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of new cars, SUVs and pickup trucks by 2025. Instead, the Trump plan would freeze the standards at 2020 levels. Carmakers, for their part, had sought more flexibility in meeting the original 2025 standards, not a categorical rollback.The energy industry\u2019s efforts also help explain the Trump administration\u2019s confrontational stance toward California, which, under federal law, has a unique authority to write its own clean-air rules and to mandate more zero-emissions vehicles.California has pledged to stick to the stricter standards, together with 13 other states that follow its lead. But President Trump\u2019s plan challenges California\u2019s rule-writing power, setting up a legal battle that threatens to split the American auto market in two. \u201cHowever, you have another side who doesn\u2019t want to pivot away\u201d from the stricter rules, Mr. Heminger said. \u201cSo we have a lot of work to do to keep this momentum going.\u201d\u201cOur CEO, Gary Heminger, would be very glad for an opportunity to visit with the Administrator,\u201d a Marathon lobbyist wrote in an email to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team on May 8, 2017. \u201cI believe this would be a constructive dialogue.\u201d The E.P.A. helps oversee fuel economy rules along with the Transportation Department.A Marathon spokesman, Chuck Rice, said Mr. Heminger did not discuss auto-efficiency rollbacks with Mr. Pruitt. An E.P.A. official did not respond to a question about whether the auto rules were discussed.Mr. Rice of Marathon said the company did not write the letter, and the company declined to say who did. It did not offer an explanation for Mr. Birsic\u2019s digital fingerprint on the document file.Representatives from the three state delegations either declined to comment or did not respond to requests. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, criticized the industry\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt appears as though oil interests are cynically trying to gin up support in Congress for the weakest possible standards to ensure that cars and SUVs have to rely on even more oil,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this attempt is successful, the outcome will be a blow to the auto industry, consumers, and our environment.\u201dMore than 3,300 of the 12,000 public comments that D.O.T. has made public contain language identical to that petition, an analysis of the files showed.Derrick Morgan, a senior vice president at AFPM, said the group \u201cregularly works with policymakers, coalition groups and individuals to promote shared goals,\u201d and also will \u201clead and join groups like Energy4US.\u201dThe Department of Transportation said it was \u201cgenerally aware\u201d that there were groups urging the public to make comments through online campaigns, but said it does not regulate them.In Dearborn, Mich., at a September meeting on the Trump fuel-efficiency rollbacks, Annie Patnaude of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-funded group, spoke in favor. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction to protect consumers and workers against government mandates that would limit choice,\u201d she said. But Americans for Prosperity said fights like these get to the heart of its free-market philosophy. \u201cWe believe in a level playing field so all Americans have the equal opportunity to succeed,\u201d said Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the group, in a statement. The organization will keep fighting \u201cmandates that unfairly pick winners and losers in any industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a relic,\u201d the memo said, particularly at a time when the United States was \u201cpoised to become the largest oil producer in the world.\u201d Emails obtained by the Times show that Marathon has been working with members of the legislative exchange council to build support for the Trump fuel-efficiency rollback in state legislatures and to denounce California\u2019s power to write its own rules for cars. The emails were made public under Wisconsin\u2019s open records law to Documented, a watchdog group that tracks corporate influence in public policy. California\u2019s special authority could effectively split the American auto market in two, since 13 other states \u2014 representing roughly 35 percent of nationwide car sales \u2014 have agreed to follow California\u2019s stricter rules. That means automakers might find themselves making cars to two competing standards.\u201cWho should decide what cars and trucks consumers should buy, consumers themselves or unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento, California or Washington, D.C.?\u201d the memo sent by Marathon said.In a statement, Bill Meierling of the legislative exchange council said that mandating fuel economy was a rule that \u201cmany state legislators believe doesn\u2019t make sense for working Americans.\u201d Just days after the emails between Marathon and the Wisconsin lawmaker, some 1,500 state legislators and other officials from across the country gathered in New Orleans to cheer on Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation, at the legislative exchange council\u2019s annual convention. Marathon sponsored the event.Advertisement"}

Japan\u2019s closely watched Nikkei 225 stock index fell 5 percent on Tuesday and entered bear market territory, meaning it has fallen 20 percent from its high. Shares in China fell by a much smaller amount in thin trading around the region, thanks to holiday-related market closures around the world.\u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on with the administration and all those data points in conjunction with a market that\u2019s already so negative, it\u2019s just pushing everything down,\u201d said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis.The idea that the Treasury secretary was calling banks to ensure the financial system was functioning properly, Mr. Gibbs said, \u201cjust added to the negative feeling and gave investors another excuse to sell.Stock trading ended earlier than usual on Monday, at 1 p.m., and markets were set to be closed Tuesday for the Christmas holiday.On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq entered bear-market territory. It is now down almost 25 percent from its August high after falling 2.2 percent more on Monday.Energy stocks were among the day\u2019s worst performers, with crude oil futures in the United States falling below $45 a barrel.The meltdown in the markets could hurt the broader economy if it begins to limit spending by companies and consumers or lending by banks.Borrowing in the corporate bond markets has already slowed as nervous investors demand higher interest rates on risky debt. The plunge in stocks could discourage investments, acquisitions or other types of corporate spending by executives unwilling to gamble on uncertainty.But there has been no evidence so far that the financial system is not functioning properly, corporate profits continue to grow at a rapid clip and the economy has remained robust.\u201cWhile stocks, in my opinion, have gone in the past couple of months from very richly valued to merely the high end of fair value, they\u2019re not cheap by any measure \u2014 much less insanely cheap like they were a decade ago,\u201d Whitney Tilson, founder of the investment fund Kase Capital Management, said in a note to investors.Markets ended lower in Europe following a mixed day in Asia.Alexandra Stevenson and Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legalized Pot Isn\u2019t Going to Save Us", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityEarlier this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that he would push to make pot smoking \u2014 for fun \u2014 legal in New York State. It was quite a statement for a governor who had repeatedly questioned the wisdom before, calling it an enabler of more pernicious habits.The governor made his argument deploying the progressive rhetoric he has turned to increasingly as his neoliberal leanings have become less politically expedient. That rhetoric rightly maintains that legalization of the drug is essential to redressing injustices in a criminal justice system that has overwhelmingly penalized young men of color for carrying or smoking pot.Two days after Mr. Cuomo made his commitments known, in fact, Brooklyn\u2019s district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, asked a judge to obliterate more than two dozen past marijuana convictions; his office vacated open warrants for more than 1,400 people who had missed court dates for possession cases. In the absence of such erasures on a broad scale, merely legalizing the drug would do nothing to remediate the damage inflicted on thousands of people ensnared in a legal universe that so severely handicaps them for doing what white people pull off with impunity. This is why mayor Bill de Blasio followed the governor\u2019s announcement with his own endorsements of legalization \u2014 this too a reversal \u2014 recommending that convictions for marijuana-related crimes be expunged automatically.In previous eras, decriminalization had been championed largely by libertarians, who saw a lot of government waste in a system that needlessly locked people up, and by hippies, who just wanted to be left alone to get stoned.Of course, lawmakers in New York are not primarily motivated by the desire to make our daily chores less of a drag. They quickly suggested that taxing marijuana could fix the transit system, in need of $60 billion worth of repairs. They invited us to envision a world in which pot really was a gateway \u2014 to more efficient infrastructure!The enthusiasm for revising the legal status of pot around the country has for the most part obscured any debate about consequences to public health. That pot is regarded as relatively harmless is troubling, because much of what we know about it is based on studies conducted nearly 50 years ago at a time when what was consumed was much less potent than it is now.Mr. Caulkins\u2019s research also shows us who is likely to bear these health burdens to a disproportionate degree \u2014 and it is not snowboarders in Vail. Looking at a decade\u2019s worth of federal surveys on drug use, he and a partner determined that Americans with a household income of less than $20,000 accounted for close to 30 percent of all marijuana use, even though they make up less than 20 percent of the population.One fantasy that advocates of legalization have is that changes in the law will energize a redistribution of wealth, not only because tax revenue from pot sales can be funneled to various worthy causes but also because the poor will reap new entrepreneurial opportunities \u2014 in every neighborhood a Stringer Bell.Mr. de Blasio has made a big point of saying that a legalized pot industry should not be overly corporate, and that retailers in parts of the city that have been so adversely affected by punishing drug laws get licenses and the chance to make money. But this is the same mayor, who during five years of presiding over the city, has been wholly unable to stop the onslaught of chain stores in New York, wholly unable to preserve the fortunes of a longstanding local merchant class.I asked Mark Kleiman, of the Marron Institute at New York University and one of the most sought-after experts on drug policy in the country, what the future looked like. He foresaw a world in which pot, legal in ever more states and eventually at the national level, will get cheaper and cheaper. The expected tax windfalls would become less likely, unless pot is taxed at the level of potency rather than sale price. The trend toward vaping means there will be greater demand for oil, and if you can melt everything down for oil, pot will be less expensive to produce, because at that point you can grow it like corn.\u201cYou can produce all the intoxicant used in a year on 40,000 acres,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Kleiman said. \u201cThat\u2019s 20 family farms in Iowa.\u201d Eventually a joint could cost a nickel; Nabisco will take over edibles. \u201cYou will have pot grown in Iowa, processed by Cargill and sold by Amazon,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said. \u201cNo one will make money except Jeff Bezos, who always makes money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Flynn Case Winds Down, Investigation of Turkish Lobbying Persists", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a secret Turkish lobbying effort that once involved Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, even as Mr. Flynn\u2019s role in the special counsel\u2019s investigation winds down, according to people familiar with the inquiry.Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, had been handling the case and at some point referred it back to prosecutors in Alexandria, Va., who had originally opened the investigation, the people said. A veteran national security prosecutor is overseeing the case, and a grand jury has been empaneled to hear evidence.Investigators later learned the op-ed was part of a larger effort by Mr. Flynn on behalf of Turkey. Mr. Flynn\u2019s company was ultimately paid $530,000 to investigate Mr. Gulen by a company run by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.As part of his work for Turkey, Mr. Flynn\u2019s company sought to persuade members of Congress that Mr. Gulen ought to be extradited. Mr. Flynn also commissioned a lengthy dossier titled \u201cFethullah Gulen: A Primer for Investigators,\u201d which was written by Thomas Neer, a former F.B.I. agent.Mr. Mueller took over that aspect of the inquiry in 2017.A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment. A spokesman for federal prosecutors in Virginia did not respond to a message seeking comment.Many specifics of the Virginia investigation are unclear, but it could involve whether anyone associated with Mr. Flynn or his company failed to comply with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the law requiring disclosures to the Justice Department about lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.Mr. Flynn admitted to prosecutors last year that he had repeatedly violated that law. He had said he wrote the op-ed at his own initiative, concealing that he did so at the direction of Turkey. On Tuesday, prosecutors on Mr. Mueller\u2019s team wrote that Mr. Flynn\u2019s op-ed \u201cwas valuable to the Republic of Turkey\u2019s efforts to shape public opinion.\u201dIn 2017, Mr. Flynn and his business partner, Bijan Kian, filed additional lobbying disclosures acknowledging that the Gulen project \u201ccould be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\u201d They detailed payments to roughly a dozen other people and firms associated with the Gulen project.Prosecutors could also be investigating reports that Mr. Flynn discussed kidnapping the cleric as part of a plan to forcibly return him to Turkey. Mr. Flynn\u2019s lawyer has denied his client considered kidnapping Mr. Gulen.\u201cYou need independent work; you need research that is done by Americans,\u201d Mr. Alptekin said in an interview.Mr. Kian\u2019s lawyer declined to comment.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Corporate Donors Behind a Republican Power Grab", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalgreens and other major companies are key supporters of the Wisconsin legislators now trying to undermine democracy.Opinion ColumnistWalgreens portrays itself as the friendly neighborhood drugstore. It gives flu shots to children, helps communities after storms, donates to charity \u2014 and makes feel-good advertisements trumpeting its various good deeds.But Walgreens also has a tougher side, one you won\u2019t see in those ads. To protect a tax break, the company has allied itself with Wisconsin\u2019s brutally partisan Republican Party. That party is now in the midst of a power grab, stripping authority from Wisconsin\u2019s governor and attorney general solely because Republicans lost those offices last month. The power grab comes after years of extreme gerrymandering, which lets Republicans dominate the legislature despite Wisconsin being a closely divided state.The story of Walgreens and Wisconsin has its roots in a decade-old court case.In 2008, the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of an aggressive tax strategy by the company, in a case known as Walgreens v. City of Madison. When calculating the property taxes it owed, Walgreens used an artificially low valuation of its stores. It did not pay taxes based on the actual value of those stores, as reflected by their purchase price and rent. Instead, it took into account the value of vacant stores nearby.A few weeks later, Walgreens donated $1,000 to Vos. Over the summer, it donated another $6,000 to the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate. A couple of weeks before Election Day, the company gave $1,000 to Fitzgerald. These donations weren\u2019t simply a matter of spreading money around. Walgreens did not donate to state-level Democrats this year, as it has in the past.\u201cIt would be healthier for companies to spend a little more time thinking about the meaning of these donations,\u201d as Judd Legum, author of the political newsletter Popular Information, told me. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s all transactional.\u201d In recent months, Legum\u2019s reporting has caused Facebook, Google, Walmart, Major League Baseball and others to ask for the return of donations to politicians whose values the companies were not comfortable defending.So far, Walgreens has not been willing to do the same in Wisconsin. I asked the company last week what it thought about the recent events in Wisconsin, and it ducked the question. But Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman, told me the company was \u201cin the process of evaluating\u201d the situation.The silence of major companies is disappointing because they could actually make a difference. Republican politicians care about the opinions of their corporate backers.I realize that being able to operate in a well-functioning democracy doesn\u2019t bring the same obvious bottom-line benefits as, say, a tax break. But our corporate leaders are making a big mistake if they decide that democracy doesn\u2019t matter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Citizens United, a Vicious Cycle of Corruption", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnconstrained outside spending on elections is corrosive to our democracy.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.So how did they conduct this delicate transaction?First, Ryan, Coleman and others \u201claid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House,\u201d according to Politico\u2019s report. Then Ryan \u201cleft the room, Coleman made the \u2018ask\u2019 and secured the $30 million contribution.\u201dThe crucial section of Citizens United reads as follows:The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse \u201cto take part in democratic governance\u201d because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker.The surge in outside spending unconstrained by contribution limits is a central element of current campaign finance practice.Four decades later, there\u2019s little need for furtive fund-raising or secret handoffs of cash. Many of the corporate executives convicted of campaign-finance crimes during Watergate could now simply write a check to their favorite super PAC or, if they want to keep it secret, to a compliant nonprofit group. Corporations can spend as much as they want to help their favored candidates, no longer prohibited by law from spending company cash on elections. The political world has, in many respects, come full circle since a botched burglary funded by illicit campaign cash brought down an administration. In fact, there are scholars on both the left and right who agree with Citizens United because they think restricting campaign spending by businesses constitutes an incursion on First Amendment rights that could lead to censorship, for example, of books and newspapers.Allowing government to control who can spend enough to get heard on a grander scale would render freedom of speech illusory.implausibly downplaying, and at times all but denying, the baleful corruption of American politics by means short of criminal bribery \u2014 by means that are lamentable precisely because they are lawful.The key changes in campaign finance practices over the past eight years stem from the ruling in Citizens United and Speech Now that contributions to independent expenditure committees, including super PACs, pose no threat of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d political corruption. There is no corruption, Justice Kennedy wrote in Citizens United, because \u201can independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\u201dThe supposed barrier between candidates and unrestricted super PACs is flimsier than ever. As midterm elections approach, complaints are rolling into the F.E.C. from both parties about super PACs that share vendors, fund-raisers and video footage with the politicians they support.Candidate assistance with super PAC fund-raising efforts has pushed at the boundaries of this legally mandated independence, allowing a level of coordination that many observers believe creates a real threat of quid pro quo corruption.Although these groups may not coordinate their expenditures with those of an official campaign, their managers often understand that their job is to attack an opponent while the candidate they support takes a higher road. Super PACs have been called \u201cthe attack dogs and provocateurs of modern politics.\u201d The advertisements they produce contribute to the nation\u2019s cynicism about politics, a cynicism that runs especially deep among young people. The candidates they support need not take responsibility for what they say, and the groups usually disappear once an election is over.A strong critic of the Supreme Court decision, Sanford Levinson, a member of the law school faculty and the department of government at the University of Texas, argued in an email to me that:Citizens United reveals the importance of having a Supreme Court completely devoid of a single individual who has ever participated in electoral politics. This helps to reinforce, I believe, the tendency of the Justices to think in terms of arid formalistic abstractions \u2014 including Kennedy\u2019s views about corporations and the First Amendment \u2014 rather than address the actual realities of our political system.It is the height of hubris for the Court, by a vote of five justices on a bench of nine, simply to dismiss concerns for electoral integrity on the ground that electoral integrity is a question of law rather than of social fact.In one section of a detailed critique he sent me, Wertheimer wrote:The Court in Citizens United stated, \u201cLimits on independent expenditures, such as (the ban on corporate expenditures) have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government\u2019s interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.\u201d This is a remarkably misguided statement in that the Court is asserting that the foundational need of our nation to be able to protect itself from the corruption of our government is outweighed by the constitutional right of a corporation to make unlimited expenditures to influence elections.The court, Wertheimer continued, was \u201cmisguided and na\u00efve\u201d in making theassertion in Citizens United without citing a single piece of evidence for this finding that \u201cthe appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy.\u201dIn the face of all this criticism, does Justice Kennedy, the now-retired author of Citizens United, have any second thoughts?intervention in the political process has been defined by a lack of prescience or success. What the majority in Citizens United had to say about corporate independent expenditures and the risk of corruption seemed entirely divorced from reality.The court has createda world in which both the parties and candidates can indirectly but effectively raise and benefit from unlimited donations purportedly expended on an \u201cindependent basis.\u201dJustice Kennedy, Bauer continued,Because Buckley prohibited the state from regulating independent expenditures while allowing it to regulate contributions, it \u201cproduced a system in which candidates face an unlimited demand for campaign funds (because expenditures generally cannot be capped) but a constricted supply (because there is often a ceiling on the amount each contributor can give) \u2026 The result is an unceasing preoccupation with fund-raising.\u201dCitizens United has turned campaign finance into a system universally disdained by the public, a system even more ethically unmoored than the one obtained before Watergate in the days when, to quote Eggen again:The money poured into Richard M. Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign from all corners: Six-figure checks flown by corporate jet from Texas; bundles of payments handed over at an Illinois game preserve; a battered brown attach\u00e9 case stuffed with $200,000 in cash from a New Jersey investor hoping to fend off a fraud investigation.The difference now is that the checks are bigger.How did this come about? Essentially, by legal fiat: a declaration by five Supreme Court justices that what looks, smells and feels like corruption is not in fact corruption.Tribe has summed up the decision succinctly:The Supreme Court\u2019s sin in Citizens United is not that it has been wrong to recognize and embrace the libertarian values that inhere in the First Amendment. But the libertarian campaign finance law the Court has developed fails in the broader project vital to First Amendment jurisprudence: the sensitive accommodation of competing constitutional values. The Court has not only underemphasized the egalitarian strain in First Amendment law \u2014 it has rejected that strain outright. And it has failed to recognize the range of plainly legitimate conceptions of democracy that Americans hold, instead privileging one view, democracy-by-financial-contributions, above all others.The likelihood that the current conservative majority would take into account the \u201cegalitarian strain in First Amendment law,\u201d as described by Tribe, is zero.state-created advantages not only allow corporations to play a dominant role in the Nation\u2019s economy, but also permit them to use \u201cresources amassed in the economic marketplace\u201d to obtain \u201can unfair advantage in the political marketplace.\u201dThe American system of campaign finance, undergirded by a Supreme Court whose conservative members feign innocence, has become the enabler of corrosive processes of economic and political inequality. Surely the justices are not benighted enough to believe that Paul Ryan and his ilk have no idea what they are doing.The Citizens United Court took the narrowest possible view of corruption, maintaining that the only legitimate government interest in this field is the prevention of quid pro quo corruption. But, as many have argued in response, quid pro quo corruption is far too narrow a governmental interest to identify as constitutionally relevant. It is an interest that does not begin to reflect the full stakes at issue in the campaign finance realm: the health of American democracy itself. Unless the notion of interests sufficiently compelling to count in the First Amendment calculus is strangely truncated to exclude interests this fundamental simply because they appear imprecise or diffuse, courts must recognize a compelling interest in combating corruption broadly defined as a distortion in the political process, understood to include a deviation from the ideal of equal representation embodied in Federalist 57.As resources flow toward the already most advantaged Americans, their ability to use those resources to shape policy increases. Of course rich Americans hold diverse preferences, just as the poor and the middle class. But despite some prominent liberal counterexamples, rich Americans tend to support the economic policies from which they have so greatly benefited. This raises the disturbing prospect of a vicious cycle in which growing economic and political inequality are mutually reinforcing.We are seeing that vicious cycle in operation today, with a Supreme Court incapable of applying either reason or common sense to stop the madness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s New President Promised a Revolution. Has It Begun?", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 In barely three weeks in office, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico has been on a relentless gallop to upset the status quo.He has championed a new law to cut the highest government salaries and raise the lowest ones, and proposed the expansion of social programs benefiting the poor and marginalized, whom he has declared to be his primary concern.He has aggressively moved forward on a plan to cancel construction of an expensive, partially completed airport.And in a move replete with symbolism, on the day of his inauguration, he turned the official presidential residence into a cultural center and opened it to the public \u2014 producing images of ordinary people, once sealed off from the site by a fierce perimeter of security, freely wandering its grounds in amazement and joy.His message was immensely popular with Mexican voters, who handed him a landslide victory in July and gave his party, Morena \u2014 which didn\u2019t even exist in the last presidential election \u2014 a majority in both chambers of Congress.These are early days yet in Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s six-year term. But the alacrity with which he has burst out of the gates, measured against the supremely high expectations he cultivated has led some to ask: Is Mexico on the cusp of a historic turning point \u2014 or a historic disappointment?He seems to know full well that this is the query on everyone\u2019s lips, and that the skeptics and critics are circling, vigilant for the first hints of hypocrisy and failure.\u201cStarting now, a transformation is underway, peaceful and orderly, but at the same time profound and radical,\u201d he said during his inauguration speech on Dec. 1. \u201cBecause the corruption and impunity that impede Mexico\u2019s rebirth will end.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador spent some of his early political career as an organizer for poor indigenous populations in his home state, Tabasco. Since then, he has sought to keep at least one foot, if not both, firmly planted among the nation\u2019s marginalized.In doing so, he has struck a sharp contrast with his predecessor, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.Where Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, a member of a politically well-connected family, was viewed by many as remote and elitist, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has sought to be accessible, a commoner among commoners.Where Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was polished, with television-ready good looks and sleek suits, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is rumpled, his face often bent in a rictus of annoyance, like a guy who just walked in off the street and isn\u2019t having a great day.When Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador invited the public into the presidential residence, for generations the most exclusive domain of Mexican political power, he was fulfilling a popular campaign promise.He has said he will continue to live in his home in southern Mexico City until his youngest son finishes primary school and then will look for what he calls \u201ca modest house\u201d near the National Palace, his office in the city center.He continues to get around Mexico City in his old Volkswagen, eschewing a presidential limousine. He disbanded the presidential secret service, surrounding himself with a security detail of 20 unarmed citizens representing a cross-section of Mexico society.\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my close relationship with citizens, with the people,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be fenced off.\u201dWhere Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto rarely met with the press and even more rarely took questions, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has held daily televised news conferences.For Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador these sessions, which begin at 7 a.m., not only reinforce the culture of accessibility but have also allowed him to set the day\u2019s news agenda.One of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s boldest executive moves came before he even took office.In late October, he announced that he intended to cancel construction of a new airport after an informal referendum organized by his own party and involving fewer than 2 percent of the nation\u2019s eligible voters. He said the $13 billion project was wasteful and plagued by corruption.The move to cancel the project, which is one-third complete, sank the peso and the Mexican markets and spread uncertainty among investors and business leaders, who feared Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador would take an arbitrary approach to managing the economy.The effort to shut down the project is now on hold while the government wrestles with investors over the terms of a construction bond buyback.But it was an initial salvo in Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s declared war on wasteful government spending.Under the proposed new law to cut the highest government salaries and raise the lowest ones, no bureaucrat can earn more than the president. And since Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has set his salary at about $5,350 per month \u2014 less than half of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s salary \u2014 that meant sharp cuts in the wages of more than 30,000 public officials.The law also slashed the pensions of the last five presidents.\u201cWe can\u2019t have a rich government and poor people,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said at a news conference last week.The legislation was met with a blizzard of lawsuits, and the Supreme Court has suspended the law pending a final ruling.A budget submitted by Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s finance minister over the weekend, expected to be approved by Congress in the coming days, was applauded by analysts for its sobriety and fiscal prudence.On the campaign trail, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador attacked a longstanding policy of using the military to fight the drug war. He emphasized reconciliation, even raising the possibility of amnesties for low-level criminals.But on his first full day in office this month, he backpedaled, lauding a bill that would keep the military on the streets as part of a newly created National Guard that would also integrate civilian police.\u201cThe people of Mexico need their armed forces to address this grave problem of insecurity and violence right now,\u201d he said during a speech, flanked by generals. \u201cWe trust the armed forces.\u201dCritics have pounced on the proposal as evidence that at least some of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s campaign promises were hollow showmanship. The plan has also worried human rights advocates, who say it will amount to the same heavy-handed and ultimately unsuccessful approach advocated by his two most recent predecessors.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has said he plans to put the issue to a public referendum in the coming months.In June, a federal court in Mexico ordered the government to form a \u201ctruth and justice commission\u201d consisting of federal officials and victims\u2019 representatives. On Dec. 3, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador created that body.\u201cWe are not going to wash our hands of this,\u201d he declared.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has repeatedly vowed to look out for all citizens, with special attention given to the poor.His administration\u2019s proposed budget seemed to deliver in part on this promise, and includes increases in social security spending for the elderly, an expansion of scholarship initiatives for students, and billions of dollars to fund job-training and other programs for unemployed youth.This was followed by the announcement of a 16 percent minimum wage increase across the country.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has also promised to focus attention on the impoverished southern states of Mexico, proposing to step up development in the region, including an ambitious train project connecting the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula to the state of Chiapas that he says will spur employment and tourism.\u201cI said during the campaign: Look after everyone, listen to everyone, respect everyone, but give special attention to the humble,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said at a news conference. \u201cFor the good of all, the poor first.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "George Bush\u2019s Life in 13 Objects", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItems from family, friends, college and the White House that influenced the 41st president.George Bush played baseball at Yale, as his father had, and he became captain of the university\u2019s team in 1948. Poppy, as he was known in his years as a student, was a popular player, and he was known for his sense of humor.The sport brought Mr. Bush great pleasure. He and his wife, Barbara, often invited Houston Astros players for lunch in Texas, and he once brought President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to a Baltimore Orioles game. Even after vascular disease began to limit Mr. Bush\u2019s movements, sports and the outdoors were still important to him. He still spent summers in Maine and enjoyed time on his speedboat, the Fidelity. \u201cNobody asks me to be on the team anymore,\u201d he said in the HBO documentary \u201c41.\u201d But with boats, \u201cI\u2019m still in the game.\u201dFor Mr. Bush, the elite network was like an extended family. Bonesmen helped him get his first job in the oil industry, and several invested in his oil ventures. Others offered financial support for his election campaigns, and some served under him as advisers, speechwriters, ambassadors and cabinet members.But being a member of an elite and secretive society also presented a challenge for Mr. Bush, who struggled to shake off an image of being out of touch with ordinary Americans. In the 1992 presidential campaign, the candidate Patrick J. Buchanan criticized Mr. Bush for having run a Skull and Bones presidency. Rumors about the society\u2019s rituals, and theories about its influence on the American government, deeply frustrated Mr. Bush and his family.One day in 1953, Barbara Bush found that her normally active 3-year-old daughter, Robin, was pale, sluggish and covered in bruises. That afternoon, the Bushes learned that their daughter had advanced leukemia. Over the next few months, Mrs. Bush traveled repeatedly between Texas and New York, where Robin was treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. After roughly six months, the hospital performed surgery after it found that Robin\u2019s treatments had caused internal bleeding. She died two months before her fourth birthday.Mr. Bush struggled with Robin\u2019s illness, admitting later that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the guts\u201d to comfort and care for her. But Mrs. Bush never left Robin\u2019s side. After the child\u2019s death, Mr. Bush helped his grieving wife keep busy with volunteer work and social functions. Their 7-year-old son, George, tried to distract his mother by making her laugh. The Bushes were determined to move forward.After the births of two more boys, Mr. and Mrs. Bush had another daughter, in August 1959. That daughter, Dorothy, was \u201ca wild, dark version of Robin,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote.After graduating from Yale in 1948, Mr. Bush moved to West Texas to work at an oil-equipment company run by a close friend of his father\u2019s and financed by his father\u2019s employer, the investment firm Brown Brothers.In the late 1950s, the company began operations in the Gulf of Mexico and the Persian Gulf. Although the company faltered at the time, it highlighted the potential of offshore drilling. Mr. Bush and his partners split up Zapata, and he took the helm of the Zapata Off-Shore Company.During his travels for that company, Mr. Bush made important political connections: He befriended King Hussein of Jordan and built Kuwait\u2019s first offshore oil well with the approval of the ruling al-Sabah family, which the United States restored to power after the Persian Gulf war of 1991. As he increasingly focused his attention on politics, he sold his stake in the company, netting about $1 million, or more than $8 million in today\u2019s dollars.In the mid-1960s, Mr. Bush moved his family to the wealthy suburbs of Houston to expand Zapata Off-Shore and to begin his political career. Around the same time, his son, George W. Bush, confided in friends at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., that his father\u2019s ambition was to reach the White House.Mr. Bush joined the Houston Country Club, the Ramada Club and the Bayou Club, and he and Mrs. Bush had an active social life. He became known for writing thank-you notes to almost anyone whose path crossed his, and Mrs. Bush kept notecards to keep track of their growing social network. (The cards reportedly numbered in the tens of thousands by the time the Bushes reached the White House).Mr. Baker became an important ally in Mr. Bush\u2019s political life, overseeing his Senate campaign in 1970 (which was unsuccessful) and his run for the presidential nomination in 1980 (he became vice president to Ronald Reagan). He then became secretary of state in the Bush administration in 1989, and chief of staff in 1992.In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford asked Mr. Bush to serve as director of the C.I.A. Mr. Bush viewed the position as a detour, one that would prevent him from being named vice president and would keep him away from the Oval Office. But moved by a sense of duty, he accepted.Mr. Bush became director in 1976, not long after the Watergate scandal and the end of the Vietnam War. Stories of domestic spying on antiwar protesters and of plots to assassinate international leaders dominated the headlines, and the public was skeptical of intelligence services. In 12 months as director of the agency, Mr. Bush appeared 51 times on Capitol Hill to defend the C.I.A.\u2019s activities.Mr. Bush faced long odds as he entered the 1980 Republican primary. He had served in government for more than a decade but was still unknown to most Americans, having been elected only twice, representing the Seventh District of Texas in the House of Representatives.Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, the two leading Republican candidates, agreed to face off in a debate before the New Hampshire primary. The Federal Election Commission required that all candidates be present, however, so Mr. Reagan offered to finance a two-candidate debate with his own campaign money. To Mr. Bush\u2019s surprise, Mr. Reagan ended up inviting all of the candidates to participate in the debate. Mr. Reagan had an angry exchange with the moderator, who demanded that the candidate\u2019s microphone be turned off. \u201cI\u2019m paying for this microphone, Mr. Green,\u201d Mr. Reagan said, a line that Spencer Tracy had used in the 1948 film \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The crowd cheered, and Mr. Reagan beat Mr. Bush by nearly two to one in the state.By the middle of the year, Mr. Reagan had the support of enough delegates for the Republican nomination, but Mr. Bush had enough support to persuade Mr. Reagan to take him on as a running mate. They beat Jimmy Carter and Walter F. Mondale in a landslide, with 489 electoral votes to 49.Four years later, they beat Mr. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro by an even larger margin, setting up Mr. Bush for his own successful presidential run.When questioned by the news media about his past, Mr. Quayle came across as shaky and inexperienced. He ultimately got more attention from the television networks than did Mr. Bush, who acknowledged in his diaries: \u201cIt was my decision, and I blew it, but I\u2019m not about to say that I blew it.\u201dMr. Bush\u2019s sons and his campaign chairman, Mr. Baker, did not support the choice of Mr. Quayle as running mate. It seemed so unusual that some family members and the news media speculated that it was part of a strategy to prevent impeachment proceedings against Mr. Bush, as Congress was investigating the Iran-contra scandal at the time, and Mr. Bush\u2019s involvement in it.Mr. Quayle became known for his public gaffes. At a spelling bee in Trenton in 1992, he encouraged a 12-year-old to add an \u201ce\u201d to the end of \u201cpotato.\u201d Although many thought that these sorts of missteps were a liability for the Bush administration, Mr. Bush kept his No. 2 on the ticket in 1992.Even after Mr. Bush left the White House, his family maintained close ties with members of the Saudi royal family. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and his wife said that the Bushes were \u201calmost family.\u201d Mrs. Bush said she felt the same way, and she affectionately called the prince Bandar Bush.Friendships between the two families have extended beyond the diplomatic and the social. King Fahd contributed $1 million to Mrs. Bush\u2019s campaign against illiteracy in 1989; Prince Bandar gave $1 million to the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in 1997; and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal gave $500,000 to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., in 2002 to fund a scholarship in Mr. Bush\u2019s name.Mr. Bush has also used the close ties to foster business opportunities. In 2000, for example, he visited the crown prince at a luxurious compound in Saudi Arabia, in the capacity of senior adviser for the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.By the time Mr. Bush became president in 1989, his wife \u2014 \u201cBar,\u201d as he affectionately called her \u2014 was so well liked that her approval ratings were higher than his own.Known in the family as the \u201csilver fox\u201d and the \u201cenforcer,\u201d Mrs. Bush fiercely defended her husband\u2019s reputation and was said to have had a strong influence on his opinions of people. But even when her views differed from those of her husband \u2014 she once admitted that she was an abortion rights advocate \u2014 she did not try to change Mr. Bush\u2019s opinion. \u201cI\u2019m not a wave maker,\u201d she once said. \u201cI do not agree with my husband on everything, and I\u2019m not going to tell you if I don\u2019t agree. Because I\u2019m going to tell George Bush how I feel. Upstairs.\u201dMrs. Bush\u2019s influence on her husband\u2019s professional life was not immediate. She spent the first decades of her marriage as a housewife, caring for six children and nurturing the couple\u2019s social ties, often staying at home alone while Mr. Bush traveled for his work or for his political ambitions. The arrangement took a toll, and Mrs. Bush sometimes grappled with depression during her husband\u2019s long absences.Mrs. Bush died on April 17 at age 92.In his 1989 campaign for the presidency, Mr. Bush, a former oil executive, promised to be the \u201cenvironmental president.\u201d He vowed to strengthen the Clean Air Act and to find common ground between economic and environmental interests. After taking office, he appointed a professional conservationist to head the Environmental Protection Agency.Exxon was held responsible for the disaster, and Mr. Bush was mostly spared criticism. While Congress was initially critical of the administration\u2019s slow response, the president subsequently sent many high-level officials to Alaska, including the head of the E.P.A., the transportation secretary, the commander of the Coast Guard, the interior secretary and the vice president. Ultimately, the spill is thought to have worked in his favor, as it is credited with encouraging lawmakers and the public to support amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990.But for some who were hit directly by the effects of the spill, the federal government\u2019s response was lacking. \u201cThe Bush legacy in Prince William Sound is oiled beaches, sick wildlife, sick former cleanup workers, and a lot of hardships that the towns survived \u2014 all costs of America\u2019s oil dependency that have been swept under the carpet,\u201d said Riki Ott, a local resident and marine toxicologist.In 1988, Mr. Bush campaigned with the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, and many have thought of him as a supporter of gun rights. During his presidency, he stalled the passing of the federal Brady bill that would have required a five-day waiting period to buy handguns, to allow for background checks.That language offended a \u201csense of decency and honor,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote. \u201cIt indirectly slanders a wide array of government law enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us.\u201dCritics of Mr. Bush\u2019s change in position said that he had long been a supporter of gun control, but that he had joined the rifle association only to appeal to voters in the 1988 election. Mr. Bush had supported gun control during his failed Senate campaign in 1970, and as president, he favored a ban on the import of some semiautomatic weapons. Because of this, and because he did not vigorously oppose the Brady Bill, the N.R.A. declined to endorse him during his 1992 re-election campaign.Mr. Bush moved his family roughly three dozen times, and he traveled the world for business and politics, but he has spent nearly every summer at his family\u2019s retreat in Kennebunkport, Me. There, family members said he could truly relax and be himself. For all of Mr. Bush\u2019s attempts to portray himself as a lover of Texas barbecue and pork rinds, and despite its being a symbol of his affluent New England upbringing, he never let go of his Kennebunkport home.Mrs. Bush noted in her memoirs that her husband was happy only when all of the beds at the home, which sleeps 34 people, were full. Guests included Bill Clinton and the CBS sportscaster Jim Nantz. \u201cYour mother and I sit out here like a couple of really old poops,\u201d Mr. Bush once wrote to his children, \u201cbut we are at total peace.\u201dSources: George Bush Presidential Library and Museum; news reports; Bush family biographies and autobiographies including those by the authors Pamela Kilian, Herbert S.

{"Headline": "\u2018Exhibit A\u2019: How McKinsey Got Entangled in a Bribery Case", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "The consultancy\u2019s report became key evidence in a battle over the extradition of a powerful Ukrainian oligarch charged in a scheme to help Boeing.Supported byVIENNA \u2014 Boeing was in a tight spot. Just as it was preparing to roll out its innovative 787 Dreamliner \u2014 the plane that was supposed to lead the aircraft manufacturer into the future \u2014 a shortage of strong but lightweight titanium parts threatened production.With titanium prices rising and delivery dates looming, Boeing knew it needed help, so in 2006 it did what many companies do when faced with vexing problems: It turned to McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm with the golden pedigree, purveyor of \u201cbest practices\u201d advice to businesses and governments around the world.Boeing asked McKinsey to evaluate a proposal, potentially worth $500 million annually, to mine titanium in India through a foreign partnership financed by an influential Ukrainian oligarch.McKinsey says it advised Boeing of the risks of working with the oligarch and recommended \u201ccharacter due diligence.\u201d Attached to its evaluation was a single PowerPoint slide in which McKinsey described what it said was the potential partner\u2019s strategy for winning mining permits. It included bribing Indian officials.The partner\u2019s plan, McKinsey noted, was to \u201crespect traditional bureaucratic process including use of bribes.\u201d McKinsey also wrote that the partner had identified eight \u201ckey Indian officials\u201d \u2014 named in the PowerPoint slide \u2014 whose influence was needed for the deal to go through. Nowhere in the slide did McKinsey advise that such a scheme would be illegal or unwise.McKinsey declined to provide The New York Times with its full report or any evidence that it had objected to the paying of bribes. But the consultancy denied recommending \u201cbribery or other illegal acts.\u201d For his part, the Ukrainian oligarch, Dmitry V. Firtash, denies that he paid or recommended bribes, or had any dealings with McKinsey or knowledge of the document.The story of McKinsey\u2019s role in the episode has remained hidden from public view for 12 years. Even today the firm\u2019s ultimate recommendation and how its client, Boeing, responded remain something of a mystery, cloaked in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. But McKinsey\u2019s reference to illegal acts has thrust the firm into a tangled international battle over the extradition of Mr. Firtash, who has been charged in the United States with bribing Indian officials in anticipation of getting titanium for Boeing.Should he be brought to trial, McKinsey, and the document it produced, stand to play a major role in the outcome \u2014 a well of potential embarrassment that underscores the risks that McKinsey and other American consulting firms face as they, and clients like Boeing, do business in countries where ethical standards and practices diverge from those at home.McKinsey initially refused to confirm that the report even existed. But after learning that The Times had obtained a copy, the firm issued a statement acknowledging that McKinsey employees had indeed written it. Neither McKinsey nor Boeing agreed to an interview.This account is based on an examination of public and confidential records, as well as interviews in the United States and Europe.When Boeing went looking for titanium in 2006, it tentatively agreed to buy the metal through a company controlled by Mr. Firtash, who had made billions of dollars brokering gas sales to Ukraine from Russia and former Soviet republics.The deal did not end well.The mining venture never materialized, but Mr. Firtash was indicted on charges of directing $18.5 million in bribes to Indian officials for mining permits.Mr. Firtash was a big catch for the Americans, who saw him as close to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, capable of leading a wavering Ukraine away from a Western economic alliance and into the Kremlin\u2019s camp. In Vienna, where Mr. Firtash was arrested and remains free on a $174 million cash bond, an extradition judge accused American officials of using the prosecution in service of its geopolitical interests.Neither McKinsey nor Boeing was charged in the case, and Boeing has not been accused of paying bribes. But several employees of the two companies are believed to have testified before a grand jury. Boeing continued to pursue the venture even after being advised that its partner\u2019s plans included paying bribes, records show.In a recent interview in Vienna, Mr. Firtash said that neither he nor any of his representatives had any connection to the McKinsey document.\u201cWe never worked with McKinsey,\u201d he said. He said he had been unfairly singled out by prosecutors because of false media reports tying him to Mr. Putin, and an unconsummated business deal with Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman recently convicted of tax violations related to his work in Ukraine.For Boeing, the early 2000s were a time to roll the dice. As its chief competitor, the European consortium Airbus, moved toward bigger planes, Boeing countered with a design that promised better fuel efficiency and easier maintenance: the 787 Dreamliner, a lighter, more durable aircraft with a higher percentage of titanium and composite materials.As orders flooded in, Boeing executives knew well what was at stake. In an article about the Dreamliner, The M.I.T. Technology Review quoted a manager saying, \u201cIf we get it wrong, it\u2019s the end.\u201dThen Boeing hit a crosswind: an industrywide shortage of fasteners \u2014 the seemingly mundane items like nuts, bolts, rivets and washers that literally hold planes together. Thousands were needed for each aircraft, and for the lighter Dreamliner, they had to contain more titanium.Desperate for new supplies, Boeing latched onto a promising lead. A group of six international businessmen with plentiful financing had offered to mine and process five million to 12 million pounds of the metal annually, much of it for sale to Boeing. The group, Bothli Trade A.G., had already signed a memorandum of understanding for a joint mining venture with the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.Environmental concerns arose, and when a land survey was conducted on the proposed mining site, residents \u201creacted violently,\u201d according to government records.But Boeing faced a more basic question: Should it even be doing business with this group \u2014 largely little-known figures from India, Sri Lanka and Hungary? The exception was the leader and leading financier, Mr. Firtash, who had expertise as the owner of titanium processing plants in Ukraine.This was the business plan that McKinsey was brought in to assess, the plan that its report described as including the paying of bribes.Ultimately, the deal fell apart. Boeing found other sources of titanium and McKinsey continued to advise the company on the supply chain. But McKinsey\u2019s report on India would remain buried until it came to light years later in a legal storm.In June 2013, a federal grand jury in Chicago secretly indicted Mr. Firtash and five others, including an Indian official, on bribery charges. Still, it would be nine months before Mr. Firtash was taken into custody, where he remained for a little more than a week until a Russian billionaire, Vasily Anisimov, posted his $174 million bond. Mr. Anisimov is an associate of Mr. Putin\u2019s friend Arkady Rotenberg.So began a highly unusual four-year tug of war between two allies \u2014 the United States and Austria. Extradition requests between the United States and other Western nations are almost never rejected, said Lanny J. Davis, one of Mr. Firtash\u2019s lawyers and a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton.This extradition case would play out differently.In August 2014, five months after Mr. Firtash\u2019s arrest, a document unexpectedly arrived via email and Federal Express at the Austrian Ministry of Justice in Vienna. It would raise profound questions about the direction of the case.To American prosecutors, it was known simply as \u201cExhibit A.\u201d A single PowerPoint slide, written in 2006 and attached to a much longer evaluation of the India mining venture, it laid out the alleged bribery scheme.The slide stated that Mr. Firtash\u2019s group, Bothli Trade, \u201chas identified key Indian officials and has crafted a strategy to gain their influences.\u201d That strategy included investing in infrastructure and jobs and respecting the traditional use of bribes. Those key officials were named, along with their positions. A footnote attributed this information to Bothli\u2019s business plan and interviews with unidentified individuals.Exhibit A couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for the prosecutors. Their extradition case appeared to be falling short, dependent largely on unidentified witnesses, records that purportedly showed bribe money disguised as legitimate business transactions and meetings between Boeing officials and members of Mr. Firtash\u2019s group. The Austrian judge wasn\u2019t buying it.If American officials wanted to try Mr. Firtash in Chicago, the judge said, more evidence of criminal conduct was needed, including the names of cooperating witnesses and what they were expected to say. The Americans refused, saying that to identify them would put their lives at risk, since Mr. Firtash was \u201cassociated with an upper-echelon member of the Russian mafia, Semion Mogilevich.\u201d Mr. Firtash adamantly denies having had any business relationship with Mr. Mogilevich.That was when prosecutors discovered Exhibit A in Boeing\u2019s files. Rarely does someone put in writing the need for bribes. Yet now, more than a year after the indictment, prosecutors had a document that they called \u201cvery clear proof\u201d that Mr. Firtash\u2019s enterprise had advised Boeing \u201cof the plan to bribe Indian public officials, which was already underway.\u201dThe Austrian judge, Christoph Bauer, had more questions.Why, he wondered, had prosecutors waited so long after the indictment to arrest Mr. Firtash? He was not hiding, the judge said, adding that American officials should have known that Mr. Firtash had visited France, Germany and Switzerland and made a very public appearance when he ceremoniously opened the London Stock Exchange one day in October 2013.And then there was the curious timing of the Americans\u2019 pursuit of Mr. Firtash, which the judge suspected was linked to his influence in Ukrainian politics, especially his help in electing the president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, in 2010.Three years later, Mr. Yanukovych was wavering over whether to sign an economic agreement with the European Union or to align with Russia. He also faced re-election.As soon as it became clear that Mr. Yanukovych, under pressure from Russia, was reconsidering signing the European Union agreement, the judge pointed out, an American delegation traveled to Kiev to bring him in line.Facing the prospect that Mr. Firtash might sway Mr. Yanukovych and use his connections to help him remain in power, the United States asked Austria to arrest the oligarch, the judge said.Indeed, documents show that in the fall of 2013, Austrian authorities had received an \u201curgent message\u201d from American prosecutors: Mr. Firtash was expected in Vienna on Nov. 4. Arrest him.Then, a few days before the planned arrest, the documents show, came another urgent message: \u201cAs part of a larger strategy, U.S. authorities have determined we need to pass up this opportunity.\u201d No arrest. No explanation of the larger strategy.According to Judge Bauer, though, that was when Mr. Yanukovych appeared to be rejecting Russia. But when the president turned back toward Russia five months later, the Americans renewed the request and Mr. Firtash was taken into custody.Mr. Yanukovych was ousted in February 2014 amid violent protests. He now lives in Russia.To the surprise of American officials, the judge denied extradition on the grounds that the request was politically motivated, whether or not Mr. Firtash was \u201csufficiently suspected\u201d of breaking the law.The United States appealed, and last year a higher Austrian court overturned Judge Bauer\u2019s ruling. That decision is now under final review.But, Mr. Firtash\u2019s lawyers point out, the Americans did not share a vital piece of information with the Austrian courts: After the prosecutors spent months insisting that Exhibit A proved that the oligarch had recommended bribes, it emerged in the United States that the document had in fact been written by consultants from McKinsey.In response to questions from The Times, Dan Webb, one of Mr. Firtash\u2019s lawyers and a former United States attorney in Chicago, said his client had nothing to do \u201cwith the creation or presentation of the PowerPoint slide proposing bribery and used by U.S. prosecutors to support extradition of Firtash.\u201d He accused prosecutors of falsely telling Austrian officials that the slide constituted \u201cclear proof\u201d that Mr. Firtash was behind the bribery scheme, adding that \u201cU.S. prosecutors never withdrew their false statement.\u201dThe United States attorney\u2019s office in Chicago did not respond to messages seeking comment.While McKinsey declined to provide its full report to The Times, it said it contained a section \u201cnoting unique risks that an association with Firtash would pose.\u201d The firm said it was cooperating with the Justice Department and was not the focus of the investigation.For its part, Boeing said in a statement that it had cooperated with the Justice Department and was \u201cnot accused of any wrongdoing.\u201dBridget Hickey contributed reporting, and Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Have Nowhere to Hide as Stocks, Bonds and Commodities All Tumble", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks? Messy. Bonds? Meh. Commodities? Not pretty.Most years, financial markets are a mixed bag. A bad year for risky investments, like stocks, might be a great one for safe bets like government bonds. Or, if worries about inflation are hurting bond investments, commodities like gold tend to do well.Not this year.If this persists, or grows worse, it could create a damaging feedback loop, with doubts about the economy hurting the markets, and trouble in the markets undermining growth.Pessimism emanating from the stock market could leave consumers and businesses scared to spend. The rout in junk bonds makes it more expensive for financially fragile businesses to borrow. The collapse in crude oil prices discourages new investment and hiring in the oil patch, which has been a source of job growth.In that sense, the markets are both a gauge of what investors expect to happen in the economy, and a potential catalyst for their decisions. The mood in the financial markets ultimately feeds into spending by companies and consumers, and if they pull back, based on panicky ups and downs, growth could suffer.\u201cPeople look to the financial markets as a source of information, as a signal, about what\u2019s going to happen and what\u2019s going to come,\u201d said Itay Goldstein, finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd when they see markets going down, they start thinking pessimistically about the outlook for the real economy.\u201dThere\u2019s scant evidence that the worst-case scenario will play out. The American economy remains strong: Unemployment is near 50-year lows, and growth is steady. And it wasn\u2019t that long ago that financial markets were feeling good about the global economy, shrugging off troublesome issues like the trade war, Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and the debt levels of developing nations.On Sept. 20, stock investors in the United States were sitting on a nearly 10 percent gain for the year. Benchmark American crude oil prices were up more than 20 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 15 percent.But those profits are gone.Since October, an index of commodities that includes oil and copper has swung from gains of 20 percent to losses for the year. A similar move took place in risky corporate bonds. So far this year, after another steep drop on Friday, the S&P 500-stock index is down about 2.8 percent.\u201cIn a typical year there\u2019s going to be some winners and losers,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at the equity market research firm Ned Davis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you get nothing working.\u201dHis firm recently looked at eight types of investments going back to 1972. In every year, at least one of these categories generated a return of 5 percent or more. A separate study by JPMorgan Chase analysts found that \u201c2018 has delivered losses on almost every asset class and investing style.\u201dThe widespread market jitters have accompanied a tectonic shift in the investing world, as central banks have begun to withdraw the extraordinary support provided to the global economy in response to the financial crisis a decade ago.For nearly seven years, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero and bought trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of government bonds, which pushed interest rates \u2014 that move in the opposite direction of prices \u2014 sharply lower. Money in the bank earned next to nothing, so investors eagerly bought anything they expected to generate some kind of return: risky debt, real estate, stocks, technology start-ups.The Fed\u2019s support, bolstered by similar efforts from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, proved to be a huge tailwind for global financial markets. Everything seemingly moved up in tandem.\u201cWhat was once a tailwind is now a headwind for markets,\u201d said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pimco, a bond investment firm with $1.7 trillion under management, in Newport Beach, Calif.At least on the margins, the turmoil in the financial markets is already reverberating in the real economy.For instance, as Treasury bond prices have declined this year, interest rates \u2014 which move in the opposite direction \u2014 have risen.In recent weeks, the broad investment declines have worsened while anxiety grows over the trade war between the United States and China. This fight, between the world\u2019s two largest economies, may already be dragging on global growth.The experience of 2015 could be a useful road map for investors. That year was uncomfortable as the Federal Reserve planned to raise interest rates against a backdrop of soft global growth. Stocks, corporate bonds and commodities all fell, while Treasury bonds eked out a minuscule gain.In the midst of the market turmoil, the Federal Reserve slowed down the pace of its interest rate increases. And the pause from the central bank reinvigorated risk-taking among investors, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5 percent the next year, and the economy continuing to grow.That\u2019s all to say, investors can be quick to jump to conclusions. But they can also be wrong.\u201cThey\u2019re like people reading a book,\u201d said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at the asset manager Fidelity Investments in Boston. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to skip five chapters to see how the book ends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Is Willing to Make a Deal", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIts leaders are talking tough, but privately, many Chinese officials are worried about their economy and eager to end the trade war.Professor Prasad is an economist at Cornell University.The official word is that everything is fine. China\u2019s economy, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, continues to grow at a robust pace and follow a steady path of \u201creform and opening up.\u201dIn private, Chinese officials admit they are worried. During a trip to Beijing last week, I encountered varying degrees of concern about the economy among bureaucrats, academics and business executives. Most of them agreed that the Chinese economy is slowing down, although some view this as better than the breakneck growth of the past.Against this backdrop, there is a real opportunity for a deal to end the damaging trade war with the United States.The trade war comes at a delicate time. It hurts foreign and domestic investor sentiment: investor nervousness has pulled China\u2019s stock market down by about 25 percent this year. Domestic investors are taking their money out, and foreign investors are no longer keen on China, which in turn puts downward pressure on the currency. This reduces the government\u2019s room to maneuver, by forcing it to spend foreign exchange reserves to prop up the currency and making it harder to cut interest rates.The economy has relied for far too long on such investment, mainly by state-owned enterprises, fueled by a surge in corporate debt. The \u201cdeleveraging\u201d campaign, which makes it harder for corporations to borrow from banks, will prevent more bad loans piling up in the banking system. To avoid shifting these risks to the \u201cshadow banking\u201d system of non-bank lenders, Chinese regulatory authorities have tightened the screws on informal financial institutions. This has starved the private sector of credit, which has also dampened growth.The Chinese government faces some important decisions. It should stick with financial deleveraging, improve the functioning of corporate debt and stock markets as alternative sources of finance, and cut corporate and household taxes to support growth. Another challenge is how to deal with the Trump administration\u2019s demands.Remarkably, some reform-minded officials now actually speak about President Trump as a positive force. Many reforms have been stalled, but under American pressure the opening up of China\u2019s economy that Mr. Xi proclaims might actually be translated into action, bringing greater access for foreign firms, better protections for intellectual property rights and an increased ability for foreign investors to participate in financial markets.China sees some of these moves as in its interest, but it wants to pursue these changes in its own way and at its own pace. American pressure could give added momentum to the movement for reform.With significant support inside China, the prospect of a trade deal early in the new year is real. The United States won\u2019t get all it asks for. China is not about to abandon its state-owned enterprises, although it may be willing to subject them to greater market discipline. The best outcome for negotiations is that tariffs imposed by the United States won\u2019t get higher and broader. So the expectation is that any deal will lead to a cessation of further hostilities but not a rollback of trade sanctions.Such an agreement would give the United States and Mr. Trump a major victory. But if American negotiators refuse to settle for anything less than total capitulation by China, his administration will squander an opportunity to help the United States and the world\u2019s economy.Eswar Prasad is a professor at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and the author of \u201cGaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Her gallery has been active at the Art Basel fairs in Switzerland and Hong Kong in the last few years.)Born in Tunisia, she has become a global leader in the promotion of contemporary artists from the Middle East and North Africa, not only by participating in fairs like FIAC and the Armory Show, but also by working with institutions on shows with artists that she represents (one of them, Isma\u00efl Bahri, just had a one-man show at the Herm\u00e8s Foundation in Brussels).\u201cI like artists who actually work on historic moments, coming up with things that we are hiding, we are not allowed to talk about,\u201d Ms. Feriani said. \u201cArtists are able to put these subjects in front of the public and give them the opportunity to discuss it, criticize it and give their opinion.\u201dThat programming was something that collectors like Adel Hamida, a Tunis dentist, were drawn to. What made him \u201cstick with her as a gallerist is her special approach to the triangular relationship between the gallery, the artist and the collector,\u201d he wrote in an email. Ms. Feriani, he said, \u201calways tries to make me understand the artists\u2019 way of thinking and the different techniques artists uses to reach their idea.\u201dMs. Feriani also wants to create a stronger arts infrastructure in her country. Without a contemporary art museum in Tunisia, and with many collectors interested only in more commercial decorative art, she said, she understands the importance of working closely with collectors and art enthusiasts on education and engagement. She has also worked to build the community, offering artist residencies and free studio spaces where they can work on projects.And though she does not work exclusively with female artists, Ms. Feriani has been eager to promote them. \u201cFemale artists have less chance to show their work versus male artists in collections and in museum and gallery shows,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen artists come up with this critical but poetic interpretation of things. They have their own twists in presenting things and engaging, but also translating a situation into an artwork.\u201dThat was something Ms. Malluh said she was drawn to in working with Ms. Feriani. \u201cShe is a very capable and experienced gallerist with a strong sense of knowing which type of art will appeal to her clients,\u201d Ms. Malluh wrote in an email. \u201cI am fortunate to work with her.\u201dMs. Malluh\u2019s dish tower, also from the \u201cFood for Thought\u201d series.Alia al-Senussi, a Libyan-American academic and consultant and an Art Basel representative, said Ms. Feriani was a pioneer when it came to promoting art from the Middle East.

But she soon understood that the artists that she had grown up seeing in exhibitions and getting to know in their studios were not very well represented outside the region. \u201cI looked around and realized very few galleries were showing artists from the Middle East and North Africa,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Why not do it?\u2019\u201dSo in 2009 she set up her gallery in London, though she had few contacts outside the world of banking and finance. \u201cIt was very difficult to bring an artist to show here from the Middle East,\u201d she reflected, saying there was a lack of interest and money.\u201cEven if you went to the big art fairs around 2010, you would not find that many artists from the region,\u201d she said. In the spring of 2013 she moved back to Tunisia and decided to open a gallery on the outskirts of Tunis (her London gallery for the last few years has served as more of an administrative space, though she will be moving it to West London and reopening it in the spring). \u201cThe idea for me to open the space in Tunisia was to follow the artists, so I can take their practice forward and make the work universal,\u201d she said.\u201cI want to be a reference there for promoting artists from our region and together take the art scene in Tunis to another level.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Sentenced to 3 Years After Implicating Trump in Hush-Money Scandal", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael D. Cohen, a former lawyer for President Trump, was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday after denouncing Mr. Trump and explaining that \u201cI felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds.\u201dMr. Cohen gave an emotional apology to the court for his involvement in a hush-money scandal that could threaten the Trump presidency \u2014 a scheme to buy the silence of two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump to protect his chances before the 2016 election. Mr. Cohen said his blind loyalty to Mr. Trump led him to ignore \u201cmy own inner voice and my moral compass.\u201dThe sentencing in federal court in Manhattan capped a startling fall for Mr. Cohen, 52, who had once hoped to work by Mr. Trump\u2019s side in the White House but ended up a central figure in the inquiry into payments to an adult-film star and a former Playboy model before the 2016 election.Judge William H. Pauley III called Mr. Cohen\u2019s crimes a \u201cveritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct\u201d and added, \u201cEach of the crimes involved deception and each appears to have been motivated by personal greed and ambition.\u201dHe added that Mr. Cohen\u2019s particular crimes \u2014 breaking campaign finance laws, tax evasion and lying to Congress \u2014 \u201cimplicate a far more insidious harm to our democratic institutions.\u201d\u201cAs a lawyer, Mr. Cohen should have known better,\u201d the judge said.Mr. Cohen had pleaded guilty in two separate cases, one brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, the other by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.Before he was sentenced, a solemn Mr. Cohen, standing at a lectern, sounded emotional, but resolved, as he told the judge he had been tormented by the anguish and embarrassment he had caused his family.\u201cI blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man\u201d \u2014 a reference to Mr. Trump \u2014 \u201cthat led me to choose a path of darkness over light.\u201dMr. Cohen then apologized to the public: \u201cYou deserve to know the truth and lying to you was unjust.\u201dRudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, called Mr. Cohen\u2019s assertion he had acted out of loyalty to Mr. Trump \u201ca complete lie.\u201d\u201cI feel sorry for him,\u201d Mr. Giuliani added. \u201cHe\u2019s a pathetic serial liar.\u201dHe also maintained that even if the hush-money payments were campaign transactions in violation of election law, that should be considered only a civil offense, not a criminal one.Since Mr. Cohen came under investigation, Mr. Trump has mocked him as a \u201cweak person\u201d who was giving information to prosecutors in an effort to obtain leniency when he is sentenced.In fact, Mr. Cohen did not sign a formal cooperation agreement with the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan or with Mr. Mueller. In addition to the campaign-finance violations, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to charges of tax evasion, making false statements to a bank and lying to Congress.He took a calculated gamble in pleading guilty to this litany of federal crimes without first entering into a cooperation agreement with the government. He offered to help prosecutors, but only on his terms, and there were some subjects he declined to discuss.His lawyers argued he should not serve time in prison. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said he deserved around four years.Judge Pauley had the final say. The judge said Mr. Cohen\u2019s assistance to the special counsel\u2019s office, though useful, did not \u201cwipe the slate clean,\u201d and a \u201csignificant term\u201d of prison was justified.Roger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.In the end, the judge gave Mr. Cohen three years for the crimes he committed in New York and two months for lying to Congress, to be served at the same time. He was also asked to pay nearly $2 million in fines, forfeitures and restitution. The judge ordered Mr. Cohen to begin serving his sentence on March 6.Mr. Cohen\u2019s sentencing was unusual because it involved guilty pleas he had made in cases brought by the two separate prosecutors.Mr. Cohen revealed that Mr. Trump was more involved in discussions over the potential deal during the election campaign than previously known.Mr. Cohen\u2019s three-year sentence is the first substantial prison term in a case stemming from Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry. The special counsel had referred the case to the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, where it was overseen by Robert S. Khuzami, the No. 2 official there, who attended the hearing on Wednesday.The investigation of Mr. Cohen by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan burst into public view in April when the F.B.I. raided his office, apartment and hotel room. Agents hauled off eight boxes of documents, about 30 cellphones, iPads and computers, even the contents of a shredder.Mr. Cohen admitted in court that he had arranged the payments \u201cfor the principal purpose of influencing the election\u201d for president in 2016.The payments included $130,000 to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, which the government considers an illegal donation to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign since it was intended to improve Mr. Trump\u2019s election chances. (The legal limit for individual contributions is $2,700 in a general election.)Mr. Cohen also admitted he had arranged for an illegal corporate donation to be made to Mr. Trump when he orchestrated a $150,000 payment by American Media Inc. to a former Playboy playmate, Karen McDougal, in late summer 2016.On Nov. 29, charged by Mr. Mueller\u2019s office with lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty again.The two prosecuting offices each wrote to Judge Pauley, offering sharply contrasting portrayals of Mr. Cohen. The Southern District depicted him as deceitful and greedy and unwilling to fully cooperate with its investigation. Mr. Mueller, on the other hand, said Mr. Cohen had \u201cgone to significant lengths to assist\u201d the Russia investigation and recommended that he receive some credit for his help.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Guy Petrillo, made an impassioned plea for leniency, citing his client\u2019s courage in cooperating with the Russia inquiry, which he said was \u201cof the utmost national significance,\u201d comparing it to Watergate.He added: \u201cHe came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in our country,\u201d without knowing what the result would be, how the politics would play out, or whether \u201cthe special counsel would even survive.\u201dJeannie Rhee, a prosecutor from Mr. Mueller\u2019s office, with which Mr. Cohen met seven times, told the judge that Mr. Cohen had accepted responsibility for the lies he told Congress and had provided \u201ccredible and reliable information about core Russia-related issues.\u201dBut a Manhattan prosecutor, Nicholas Roos, said of Mr. Cohen\u2019s cooperation that as much as he \u201cclaims he\u2019s done for the republic, the same can be true in the way in which he\u2019s undermined it.\u201dIn the end, Judge Pauley seemed to side with the defense. He said that \u201ccooperation, even when it is not the product of a formal agreement, should be encouraged\u201d when it advances a criminal investigation. \u201cOur system of justice would be less robust without the use of cooperating witnesses to assist law enforcement,\u201d the judge said.Shortly before Mr. Cohen and his family and friends walked out of the courtroom, roughly 20 minutes after the sentencing had ended, he briefly addressed a cluster of reporters who were waiting in an anteroom between the courtroom and the hallway.\u201cThis is my last time talking to you guys,\u201d he said abruptly, then said nothing more.He and his lawyers waited briefly in the courthouse lobby while his wife, son and daughter, left the building, passed through a huge gantlet of television crews and photographers outside, and climbed into a waiting black Infiniti QX60.Cohen then walked out of the building with a hangdog expression and made a silent beeline to the car.Nate Schweber and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2020 Democrats Face a Vexing Issue: Big Money From the Rich", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is one of the most potent and feared weapons in the arsenal of modern American politics: the super PAC.But as three dozen Democrats ponder presidential runs in 2020 and begin to design their campaign infrastructures, some leading names beyond Senator Bernie Sanders are expected to forgo or disavow these fund-raising committees that allow allies to haul unlimited sums from wealthy backers. The hope of these potential candidates is that grass-roots donors and progressive activists would reward them more handsomely in the primary for rejecting such funds.If she runs, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is likely to reject the assistance of a super PAC, according to two people familiar with her thinking. And the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. revealed in a little-noticed passage in his 2017 book that he would have gone without one if he had run in 2016, making it more difficult for him to backtrack now.The question is a politically vexing one. The financial firepower would be alluring to those with a ready network of financiers, such as Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is seen as likely to have a super PAC, according to donors, strategists and people close to him. Some allies are already discussing possible super PACs for Senators Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the two most Democratic donor-rich states in the nation. But aides to both of them say they are not currently seeking these fund-raising vehicles.The choice will represent one of the earliest and potentially more consequential crossroads of the nascent primary, and has been the subject of fierce debate within the inner circles of some candidates. Is it worth giving up possible seven-figure checks for the chance to campaign more effectively as the candidate of the little guy? Or, put another way, can a Democrat risk embracing millionaires and billionaires in an era when small donors and the party\u2019s seemingly ascendant left wing may pummel PAC-backed candidates as allies of the rich?\u201cEvery Democrat should approach the idea of a super PAC in the primary with caution,\u201d said Robby Mook, who served as the 2016 campaign manager for Hillary Clinton. \u201cThey are a liability as much as a strength.\u201dIt\u2019s no secret why these political action committees can be so appealing. Federal law currently caps contributions for presidential primary campaigns at $2,700. Campaign cash in 2020 is expected to be tight in what could be a historically crowded field. In contrast, donors face no limits with super PACs.But opposition to big money has become a galvanizing force in Democratic politics. Democrats such as Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, the failed Texas Senate candidate now mulling a 2020 run, have turned their rejection of corporate and PAC funds into a tidal wave of small-dollar donations. Mr. Sanders inveighed against the influence of big money and raised more than $230 million in 2016.The risk for any 2020 Democrat is that reliance on a billionaire-backed super PAC becomes a litmus test of liberal credibility as a reformer.\u201cIf you\u2019re depending on a super PAC to succeed in the primary,\u201d Mr. Mook warned, \u201cyou\u2019re probably losing.\u201dThough super PACs aligned with particular candidates played major roles in the 2012 and 2016 Republican nomination fights, Democrats have not held a wide-open presidential primary featuring multiple, big, candidate-specific super PACs since the Supreme Court unshackled such spending in 2010.Strategists inside multiple potential 2020 operations described active discussions on the big money conundrum. Some call the notion of skipping out on one foolish. Others, even within the orbit of the same candidate, disagree sharply on the risks and rewards. What if one of the billionaire candidates \u2014 the financier Tom Steyer, Howard Schultz of Starbucks or the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg \u2014 gets in? What if your candidate wins an early state but fund-raising doesn\u2019t pick up fast enough to buy the ads needed by Super Tuesday or in a state like California that has jumped earlier on the primary calendar?\u201cYou have to know you have the big donors ready to write those checks,\u201d Julianna Smoot, a former top fund-raiser and deputy campaign manager for Barack Obama, said of the decision to bless a super PAC.Mr. Biden wrote in his 2017 book that he thought through the super PAC question carefully as he considered a 2016 run, saying it was \u201ctempting to play the game.\u201d\u201cFor the first time in all my years of campaigning, I knew there was big money out there for me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I also knew people were sick of it all.\u201dPerhaps no potential Democratic candidate counts more billionaire potential financiers as friends or allies than Mr. Booker, who attended Stanford and wooed investments from Silicon Valley when he was Newark mayor, including a $100 million donation for schools from Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.Mr. Booker\u2019s team declined to comment, though people close to him said no steps had been taken to create a super PAC.Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the Vermont senator would disavow any super PAC support if he runs, as he did in 2016. Mr. Longabaugh also cautioned that super PACs could \u201cboomerang\u201d against those who have them: \u201cIt will be an issue in the campaign.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t on one hand oppose Citizens United and the corrupting influence of corrupting money,\u201d Mr. Longabaugh said of the court decision that helped pave the way for super PACs, \u201cand on the other hand take that money.\u201dThose candidates had something else in common: They all lost.The calculation can be complicated. Both Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. Harris, for instance, have deep relationships with home-state donors who could finance them. But both have also invested heavily in creating a digital network of small donors ahead of a possible run.\u201cAt this point, Kirsten hasn\u2019t made a decision on whether she will be a candidate for president, nor is she looking to create any outside spending if she does,\u201d said Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand.Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, said much the same: \u201cShe has not decided whether she is running for president, but there are no plans for a super PAC for a prospective candidacy.\u201dThere is ample gray area for politicians to explore or exploit, as super PACs, by definition, are formed independently, providing candidates some plausible deniability if and after they emerge.For Ms. Harris, there have been discussions in California of a super PAC that would include two former top advisers to her past campaigns, Brian Brokaw and Dan Newman, according to people familiar with the matter.For Ms. Gillibrand, Ross Offinger, a former fund-raiser for the New York senator, has quietly been reaching out to donors to feel out interest in a pro-Gillibrand super PAC, floating the name of Bill Hyers, who ran Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s first campaign for the House in 2006 and served as Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign manager in 2016, according to a person familiar with the calls.\u201cWe would discourage any activity of this type at this point,\u201d Mr. Caplin said.In some cases, strategists have floated the idea of delaying the creation of super PACs until deeper in the race to minimize blowback; of course, that risks donors deciding not to cut checks later.In Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke broadly denounced super PACs throughout his Senate bid, but some still got involved late to attack his Republican opponent. The outside spending did not seem to smudge the reputation of Mr. O\u2019Rourke, who raised record sums online.In 2012, Ms. Warren struck a deal with her Republican opponent to denounce super PACs and give away money to charity if they got involved. People close to her said that she is unlikely to seek super PAC assistance in 2020 and that she is unlikely to endorse any candidate who would if she does not run.Almost every would-be campaign has been quietly gauging donors on their level of commitment.Like so many donors, Mr. Saperstein is not ready to commit in 2020 \u2014 yet.\u201cI\u2019ll probably give to Bernie and Elizabeth to start out the primaries,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll sit back and wait to see how things develop.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bad Faith, Pathos and G.O.P. Economics", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn professionals who sold their integrity, and got nothing in return.Opinion ColumnistAs 2018 draws to an end, we\u2019re seeing many articles about the state of the economy. What I\u2019d like to do, however, is talk about something different \u2014 the state of economics, at least as it relates to the political situation. And that state is not good: The bad faith that dominates conservative politics at every level is infecting right-leaning economists, too.This is sad, but it\u2019s also pathetic. For even as once-respected economists abase themselves in the face of Trumpism, the G.O.P. is making it ever clearer that their services aren\u2019t wanted, that only hacks need apply.What you need to know when talking about economics and politics is that there are three kinds of economist in modern America: liberal professional economists, conservative professional economists and professional conservative economists.By \u201cliberal professional economists\u201d I mean researchers who try to understand the economy as best they can, but who, being human, also have political preferences, which in their case puts them on the left side of the U.S. political spectrum, although usually only modestly left of center. Conservative professional economists are their counterparts on the center right.But let me leave the pure hacks on one side for a moment, and talk about the people who at least used to seem to be trying to do real economics.Do economists\u2019 political preferences shape their research? They surely affect the choice of subject: Liberals are more likely to be interested in rising inequality or the economics of climate change than conservatives. And human nature being what it is, some of them \u2014 O.K., of us \u2014 occasionally engage in motivated reasoning, reaching conclusions that cater to their politics.I used to believe, however, that such lapses were the exception, not the rule, and the liberal economists I know try hard to avoid falling into that trap, and apologize when they do.But do conservative economists do the same? Increasingly, the answer seems to be no, at least for those who play a prominent role in public discourse.Even during the Obama years, it was striking how many well-known Republican-leaning economists followed the party line on economic policy, even when that party line was in conflict with the nonpolitical professional consensus.But the real test came after 2016. A complete cynic might have expected economists who denounced budget deficits and easy money under a Democrat to suddenly reverse position under a Republican president.What explains this epidemic of bad faith? Some of it is clearly ambition on the part of conservative economists still hoping for high-profile appointments. Some of it, I suspect, may be just the desire to stay on the inside with powerful people.But there\u2019s something pathetic about this professional self-abasement, because the rewards center-right economists long for haven\u2019t come, and never will.So what we\u2019ve learned about economics these past two years is that many conservative economists were, in fact, willing to compromise their professional ethics for political ends \u2014 and that they sold their integrity for nothing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democrats\u2019 Best Response to Republican Power Grabs", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe best option goes beyond retaliation or restraint. Mr. Levy is a professor of political theory at McGill University. Democrats are exploring the possibility of legal challenges to those maneuvers. But party leaders face a more difficult, and perhaps more consequential, problem: Should they go tit-for-tat and escalate procedural shenanigans, rules-stretching and rules-breaking? Or should they strive, leading by good example, to maintain a system of norms that have provided political stability in the hopes that a more moderate, reasonable Republican Party will re-emerge?Both strategies come with serious risks: Retaliating in kind could aggravate already deep polarization and wreck what\u2019s left of our political norms. Restraint, on the other hand, would establish new norms that establish electoral disadvantages for Democrats and embolden Republicans.Normally voters don\u2019t care about procedural questions. One state and complaint at a time, they\u2019re unlikely to remember or understand sharp dealing from two years before. If one party goes to the electorate complaining about the other\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s usually met with a shrug that all politicians cheat.But a very clear narrative or popular revulsion \u2014 or both \u2014 can change that. Examples are found in the Progressive Era around the turn of the 20th century and again in the immediate aftermath of Watergate, when procedural reform gained traction, for better or for worse, and both term limits and campaign finance reform had moments of widespread popular enthusiasm. There\u2019s good reason to think that the next two years offer the opportunity to create such a corruption narrative and to take advantage of what\u2019s likely to be growing revulsion.President Trump\u2019s administration has made this job easier: The midterm election results showed that its scandals and disgrace have already focused voters\u2019 attention. That\u2019s not the time for retaliation and escalation. It\u2019s the time offer prescriptions for rebuilding the rules that accompany a diagnosis that helps voters make sense of how badly wrong things have gone. Democrats can try to punish Republicans at the ballot box by trying to strengthen rather than weaken democratic norms.The obvious place to begin is with the White House itself. Proposals to require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, give teeth to the Emoluments Clause, strengthen anti-nepotism rules that should keep unqualified family members out of sensitive offices, extend conflict-of-interest rules to include the president, and turn blind trust norms into binding rules won\u2019t be hard to understand under Mr. Trump. They will reinforce voters\u2019 distrust of the president while also offering ways to prevent his abuses from becoming standard practice.Republican procedural abuses at the state level precede the Trump administration, but they can fairly be connected to it. Most important is disenfranchisement. Democrats should emphasize the sustained nationwide Republican effort to limit access to the ballot and offer proposals to restore the Voting Rights Act, end felon disenfranchisement, undo restrictive voter identification rules, ease registration, protect early voting and ensure that voting places are more widely and evenly distributed. Not only has Mr. Trump been on the wrong side of those issues, encouraging state crackdowns on imagined millions of noncitizen voters; but voting restrictions in narrowly won Midwestern states got him closer to the White House in the first place. The package of reforms that the incoming House Democratic majority intends to introduce as its symbolic first bill, H.R. 1, contains some of these ideas mixed in with others that I think will muddy the message, but it's the right kind of beginning. Other proposals, from statehood for the District of Columbia to gerrymandering reform, then make sense as part of the same effort to strengthen representation and fair democratic practice.This is also the best approach for Democrats in the short term because they\u2019re not in a strong position to retaliate even if an angry activist base wants them to. Despite some losses last month, Republicans remain in control of more governor\u2019s seats and more state legislatures. More important, making things worse right now really is the wrong thing to do. If Democrats follow a course of unrestrained but legal tactics, we could find ourselves embroiled in even more severe dysfunction and a constitutional crisis. Tit for tat is sometimes necessary to enforce norms, but escalation in an already seriously polarized environment is dangerous.If Democrats can offer a unifying indictment tying Republican attacks on democratic norms to Trump administration abuses, along with a coherent package of serious proposals to restore procedural fairness, voters will have a way of making sense of new examples of Republican sharp dealing. Proposals to shorten lame duck legislative sessions and to constrain their authority, for example, would reinforce the idea that Republicans have been the party of procedural abuses and unfairness while still setting forth a good neutral rule.This is the alternative to doing nothing or making things worse: seek to punish Republicans in 2020 by offering a vision of how to make things better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tawdry Tabloid Sagas Reveal Weightier Themes", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorAudiences gravitated to the scores of articles and cable news segments about Donald J. Trump, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal for an undeniable reason: Sex sells.But there was something more important lurking beneath the salacious surface of the stories about the president\u2019s alleged past encounters with a porn star and a former Playboy model.People who followed the sagas quickly learned that they were in for more than lurid details. Like one of those prestige television series on Netflix, FX, HBO or Showtime, the tale started off sleazy but ventured into weightier thematic territory as it unfolded.Enriching the narrative was Michael D. Cohen, who worked for Mr. Trump as factotum and fixer. He was part villain, part flunky.Now in the role of converted truth-teller for an audience of federal prosecutors, Mr. Cohen admits he was given a very big job: shut those two women up on the eve of the 2016 presidential election.He pulled it off \u2014 for a time, at least \u2014 with hush-money payments involving a hastily created Delaware shell company and the Trump-friendly tabloid news company that owns The National Enquirer, American Media Inc.The stories were tawdry, and the news coverage sometimes veered toward clickbait, but there were important questions hiding beneath the sheets.Has the presidential election process become so cynical that players in a campaign can surreptitiously blow through legal limits on spending to deceive the public?Are they free to coordinate with a media organization that behaved in a manner antithetical to the role the founders envisioned for a free press by paying to hide information about a presidential candidate, rather than share it with the public?On Friday, federal prosecutors in New York answered those questions with a resounding No.In making their stand against Mr. Cohen, they were arguing for the legitimacy of United States campaign finance law \u2014 which, for all its loopholes, may have some teeth, after all \u2014 and for the value of truth and transparency in campaigns.Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to two sets of criminal campaign violations. By secretly paying Ms. Daniels $130,000 for her silence in October 2016, he was flouting the law that limits individual campaign contributions to $2,700 in a general election.And by arranging for The Enquirer\u2019s parent company to squelch Ms. McDougal\u2019s affair accusation by buying the exclusive rights to her story for $150,000 and then sitting on it \u2014 a practice known in the tabloid trade as \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen was inducing A.M.I. to violate a law that prohibits corporations from spending any money in campaigns in coordination with candidates or their agents.\u201cCohen\u2019s commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for president of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,\u201d the prosecutors wrote in the sentencing memo. \u201cWhile many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows.\u201dPeople following the yarn may not have expected that a story centered on a porn star and a onetime Playboy model would end up with prosecutorial paeans to American ideals. But here we are.The prosecutors suggested Mr. Cohen was taking the rap for a crime that included others in higher places. They asserted that Mr. Trump \u2014 called \u201cIndividual-1\u201d in legal filings \u2014 had directed him to engage in the cover-ups, implicating the president in felony campaign finance violations.The prosecutors\u2019 memo also indicated that others in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle may have been involved in the payments. So the plot could thicken if the prosecutors \u2014 led by the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Robert S. Khuzami \u2014 pursue more charges.And then there\u2019s American Media Inc.Still, the investigators have made a powerful statement about what was a twisted use of journalism in an election.Generations of journalists have felt called to the profession, seeing a high mission in finding out all there is to know about the men and women who ask to be voted into the nation\u2019s highest office.For those who wonder why any of this might apply to The Enquirer, I would direct them to the supermarket tabloid\u2019s recent history of presidential muckraking.That dirt-digging was fully in keeping with the tabloid media tradition of going all-out to give the powerless a glimpse of what the powerful are hiding. And it led to a landmark campaign finance case against Mr. Edwards that, while ultimately unsuccessful, set the template for the one that has implicated Individual-1.By 2016, things had changed. During the campaign cycle, The Enquirer functioned more like a protection racket. According to prosecutors, the tabloid became part of the very sort of scheme it had once reveled in exposing, and it crossed the line into illegality when it spent money, allegedly in coordination with Mr. Trump, to protect his reputation.The Enquirer\u2019s behavior was part of a broader trend, in which various branches of the news media were used to distort the public debate \u2014 a corruption of mission that turned parts of the political arena into information junkyards.Beneath their words was a world-weary knowingness. Wasn\u2019t this how the game was played?On Friday, the law answered back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Powerful Than a Russian Troll Army: The National Enquirer", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorThe most powerful print publication in America might just be The National Enquirer. It functioned as a dirty-tricks shop for Donald J. Trump in 2016, which would have been the stuff of farce \u2014 the ultimate tabloid backs the ultimate tabloid candidate \u2014 if it hadn\u2019t accomplished its goal.The Enquirer\u2019s power was fueled by its covers. For the better part of the campaign season, Enquirer front pages blared sensational headlines about Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals from eye-level racks at supermarket checkout lanes across America. This stroke-of-genius distribution apparatus was dreamed up by the man who made The Enquirer the nation\u2019s biggest gossip rag: its previous owner, Generoso Pope Jr.Wondering what The Enquirer\u2019s covers were worth to the Trump campaign, I called Regis Maher, a co-founder of Do It Outdoors, the national mobile and digital billboard company. He said a campaign with that level of national prominence would cost $2.5 million to $3 million a month.\u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful placement,\u201d Mr. Maher said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s gotta go to the grocery store.\u201dWith the news last week that The Enquirer had admitted to federal prosecutors that it made the catch-and-kill payment to influence the election, it\u2019s worth stepping back and appreciating the unlikely role played by the supermarket tabloid and its parent company, American Media Inc., in electing the 45th president of the United States.Now that federal prosecutors have cleared away some of the fog that shrouded the 2016 campaign, it\u2019s easy to see that The Enquirer was more than just a publication that puffed up Mr. Trump while going after his rivals.It was the real-world embodiment of the fantasy online world of trolls, Russian and domestic, who polluted the political discourse. From its perches at Publix and Safeway, it was often doing the same job as Alex Jones, of the conspiracy site Infowars, and the more strident Trump campaign surrogates on Twitter and Facebook.The Enquirer spread false stories about Hillary Clinton \u2014 illnesses concealed, child prostitution, bribery, treason. Each cover trumpeting these tales was arguably more powerful than a tweet from an account with millions of followers.It\u2019s a shame it went this route, because The Enquirer was built to cover Mr. Trump\u2019s wild ride. If it had only stuck with its original mission \u2014 digging up dirt on the rich and famous, without a care for the rules of traditional journalism \u2014 it would have had the tabloid story of a lifetime.With its online cohorts, American Media Inc. helped build a distortion machine that so polluted election news cycles that, for its more receptive audiences, Mrs. Clinton not only deserved to lose the White House, she deserved time in the big house.Before making her its main target, the machine chewed up Senator Ted Cruz. It ran unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs against him at a time when he was proving himself Mr. Trump\u2019s most stubborn Republican challenger.The only person quoted by name in the affairs piece was Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, who was quoted as saying, \u201cWhere there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire.\u201d (Mr. Stone, who communicated with top campaign officials through the election, is under investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.)One passage in the Cruz story caught my eye. Citing a report in Radar Online \u2014 a gossip outlet also owned by A.M.I. \u2014 The Enquirer claimed that \u201can individual purporting to be a representative of the hacker group Anonymous posted a disturbing Twitter video that threatens to expose \u2018very dirty secrets,\u2019 including information about Ted \u2018visiting prostitutes.\u2019\u201dHere\u2019s an odd thing. Radar attributed the provenance of this supposed Anonymous video to an obscure Twitter handle with only a few thousand followers that has since gone dormant. A review of the account\u2019s activity found tweets and retweets of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant messages relating to Europe, as well as a critique of the United States policy on Libya linked to a video from RT, the Russian state-financed cable network.It makes you wonder if the inquiring mind of Mr. Mueller would like to know more about The Enquirer than he has let on. (Federal prosecutors in New York have led the investigation of A.M.I.)Once Mr. Cruz was out of the way, two people familiar with A.M.I.\u2019s operation told me, the company pulled up files on the Clintons that it had collected over decades \u2014 some two dozen cardboard boxes filled with promising material.A.M.I. began a painstaking effort to sort through the old clips and tips concerning \u201cpay-for-play\u201d deals, rumors of affairs and Vince Foster conspiracy theories. But as the campaign wore on, The Enquirer\u2019s covers favored stories similar to those coursing through Infowars, Russian trolldom and, increasingly, your uncle\u2019s Facebook feed.According to one headline, Hillary was \u201cCorrupt! Racist! Criminal!\u201d In another, she was \u201cEating Herself To Death!\u201dThe Enquirer also reported \u2014 make that \u201creported\u201d \u2014 that she had suffered \u201cthree strokes,\u201d had \u201cliver damage from booze,\u201d and was prone to \u201cviolent rages.\u201dThe false narratives built to a frenzy that included an appearance by the A.M.I. chief content officer Dylan Howard on Infowars and a cover promising that Mrs. Clinton and her aide Huma Abedin were \u201cGoing to Jail\u201d for \u201cTreason! Influence Peddling! Bribery!\u201dFor those who were seeing the same bilge online, The Enquirer\u2019s headlines and stories may have increased their doubts about the Democratic nominee. For those seeing such stuff for the first time, right next to the gum and candy, the false coverage may have been revelatory.Placement on nationwide checkout lines was perhaps Mr. Pecker\u2019s greatest gift to Mr. Trump, and it\u2019s something that he inherited from Mr. Pope.Watching his circulation plateau as his readers moved to the suburbs in the 1960s, Mr. Pope struck a deal with major grocery chains: He would build new racks to put magazines at eye level near the cash registers, arguing that more sales for him meant more profit for them, too.\u201cIt gave us complete exposure, saturation, whatever you want to call it,\u201d his son Paul David Pope told me on Friday.\u201cI am sure my father\u2019s intention with his media empire was not to be used after his passing as an outlet for fake news,\u201d the younger Mr. Pope said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1MDB Case in Malaysia Deepens Goldman\u2019s Crisis", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince becoming a symbol of Wall Street greed during the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs has tried to recast its image as an investment bank that cares as much about ethics as it does its bottom line.Now, that makeover is being undone by the bank\u2019s work for an obscure investment fund in Malaysia, which has entangled it in civil and criminal investigations around the world. Goldman recently received subpoenas from New York regulators, held talks with federal prosecutors and is likely to incur billions of dollars in penalties. It is one of the most serious crises in the bank\u2019s 149-year history.And that is just the start of the bank\u2019s troubles.Lawyers for Goldman met this fall with federal prosecutors in what appeared to be an early step in settlement negotiations, according to three people familiar with those talks. Two of its senior employees have already been charged.The bank and some of its employees recently received subpoenas from regulators in New York, who are investigating the circumstances in which Goldman netted about $600 million in fees through its no-bid work for the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, according to two people with knowledge of the subpoenas.1MDB was supposed to finance infrastructure and other development projects to benefit the Malaysian public.Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said the bank would fight the Malaysian charges, which he said \u201cdo not affect our ability to conduct our current business globally.\u201d He said that officials with 1MDB and the Malaysian government lied to Goldman about how they planned to use the money that the bank raised.Goldman has previously said it was cooperating with law enforcement and that it might incur \u201csignificant fines\u201d from investigations into 1MDB in the United States and elsewhere.While the charges filed by Malaysia\u2019s attorney general on Monday represent the first time the bank itself has been criminally charged, the biggest threat to Goldman comes from the United States, where multiple law-enforcement and regulatory agencies are building cases.The United States Justice Department is leading the investigation. In court filings, prosecutors have described an elaborate scheme by Goldman employees to cover up kickbacks and fees to secure business that involved shell companies in different jurisdictions. Each of the three times that Goldman issued bonds for 1MDB, the financier accused of directing the fraud, Jho Low, provided directions on whom to bribe in order to secure contracts, according to filings.In internal emails disclosed by prosecutors, Goldman bankers referred to their 1MDB work under the code name Project Tiara. When Malaysian authorities seized assets that they said had been bought with stolen 1MDB money, they found 14 diamond tiaras. They also tracked down a $250 million yacht, a $35 million Bombardier jet and a see-through grand piano that is in the living room of the supermodel Miranda Kerr.A few days after those charges were announced on Nov. 1, Goldman\u2019s legal team met with prosecutors from the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, according to the people familiar with the talks. Goldman\u2019s lawyers outlined their defense against possible charges \u2014 apparently an early step toward a potential legal settlement.Then, at a Dec. 11 meeting in Washington, prosecutors met with the former New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and other representatives for Mr. Low, who has been criminally charged in the United States and Malaysia.At that meeting, Mr. Low\u2019s lawyers wanted to discuss the federal government\u2019s efforts to seize their client\u2019s assets, and they noted that Mr. Low could offer the prosecutors information about Goldman\u2019s role in the scandal. The prosecutors rebuffed that idea, noting that their investigation of Goldman was largely complete, according to three people familiar with that meeting.A final settlement is still months away. It is unclear whether Goldman itself will face criminal charges in the United States. Any settlement is likely to include a penalty stretching into the billions of dollars, likely making it one of the biggest corporate penalties imposed so far during the Trump administration.Investors are paying attention. The bank\u2019s shares fell 2.7 percent on Monday, after news of the charges broke. Its shares are down by more than one-third since last year, reflecting both its troubles and the overall souring sentiment on Wall Street.In a sign of how seriously Goldman is taking the investigation, the bank has retained lawyers from firms including Akin Gump to represent employees who have been questioned by federal authorities, according to people with knowledge of the hirings.The Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York State Department of Financial Services are also moving forward with separate investigations of Goldman\u2019s role in the 1MDB fraud.The New York regulator, which oversees Goldman\u2019s state-chartered banking unit, recently sent subpoenas to Goldman and a number of its employees asking them to appear for interviews early in 2019, according to the two people familiar with the subpoenas. The regulator plans to interview about eight Goldman employees who sit on the bank\u2019s so-called capital committee.In those interviews, the regulators will likely focus on the decision by the capital committee to temporarily take on $300 million in debt from the 1MDB bond offerings and to charge the fund fees that were unusually high, the two people said.Mr. Blankfein, who is currently Goldman\u2019s chairman, told The New York Times last month that the scheme was the work of rogue employees who \u201cevaded our safeguards and lie.\u201dIn Malaysia, Attorney General Tommy Thomas filed criminal charges on Monday against three subsidiaries of Goldman, including Goldman Sachs International, the London-based unit that houses much of the bank\u2019s international operations.Mr. Thomas said the government would seek more than $2.7 billion in penalties against Goldman.Malaysia also charged Mr. Leissner and Mr. Low. Mr. Low\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that he was innocent. \u201cIt is clear that Mr. Low cannot get a fair trial in Malaysia, where the regime has proven numerous times that they have no interest in the rule of law,\u201d the statement said. Mr. Low is believed to be in China, though his exact location is not known.Mr. Thomas said on Monday that Goldman misled potential investors in the marketing materials it provided as it prepared to sell bonds for 1MDB, in violation of Malaysian securities laws. Goldman received fees from the government fund that were \u201cseveral times higher than the prevailing market rates,\u201d he added. Those fees in turn led to fat bonuses for Goldman bankers and increased the bank\u2019s prominence in Asia.Goldman has \u201cfallen far short of any standard,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThey have to be held accountable.\u201dEmily Flitter, Sharon Tan and Carlos Tejada contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steve Bannon and a Fugitive Billionaire Target a Common Enemy: China", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust months after being pushed out of the White House, Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, met with a fugitive Chinese billionaire at a suite in the luxurious Hays-Adams Hotel in Washington.The billionaire, Guo Wengui, who is also known as Miles Kwok, was living in New York City and had landed on China\u2019s most-wanted list, accused of bribery, fraud and money laundering. He was also a dissident and fierce critic of Beijing, seeking political asylum in the United States. And Mr. Bannon \u2014 increasingly obsessed with the emerging China threat \u2014 was eager to talk about the Communist Party, corruption and American naval operations in the South China Sea.Since their first discussion in October 2017, they have met dozens of times \u2014 in Dallas, on Mr. Guo\u2019s yacht and, more often, at the billionaire\u2019s $67.5 million apartment in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park. The two shared a stage two weeks ago in Manhattan, at a news conference they organized to announce plans to set up a $100 million fund to investigate corruption and aid people they deem victims of Chinese government persecution.\u201cWe both naturally despise the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Mr. Guo said in an interview last week, referring to Mr. Bannon. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve become partners.\u201dIt\u2019s an unusual partnership between two political gadflies with a common, if overly grand, objective: bringing about the demise of the Chinese Communist Party.One is an exiled businessman who claims to have evidence of corruption at the highest levels of government in China. The other is a former Goldman Sachs banker who delights in lobbing political grenades at what he calls the \u201cparty of Davos,\u201d a band of global elites that he says has undermined America\u2019s interests at home and abroad.Mr. Bannon is, in effect, reprising the role of political provocateur he played before joining the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016. Back then, he was running the conservative news site Breitbart, and helping promote conspiracy theories through the publication of books like \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d which aimed to destroy Hillary Clinton\u2019s White House bid.In an interview in his hotel room two weeks ago, Mr. Bannon, 65, said the new China-related fund he will head, without pay, will gather evidence, share it with authorities \u2014 in the United States and elsewhere \u2014 and publish it in the media. The fund also targets Wall Street banks and law firms, which he says are complicit in China\u2019s misdeeds.The project, he says, is consistent with his populist and nationalist agenda. China\u2019s reckless behavior, he contended, is endangering the global economy, and sapping America\u2019s strength.\u201cAs a populist, this is outrageous,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, noting that American financial institutions have helped back the worrisome global buying sprees of Chinese companies, with cash raised from ordinary people, including government pension funds. \u201cThe elites in this country have to be held accountable. We have to get the facts on the table.\u201dMr. Guo, 50, insists that the fund offers a way to strike back at Beijing. China has pressed the Trump administration to extradite him so that he can face a raft of charges in China \u2014 allegations he strongly denies. Billions of dollars in assets he controlled have been frozen by Beijing. And Interpol, the global police organization, has issued a warrant seeking his arrest. He now travels with a phalanx of security guards, saying he fears for his life.The Chinese Embassy could not be reached for comment. But the Guo-Bannon alliance has alarmed some analysts, who view the two men as purveyors of conspiracy theories fueling anti-China sentiment.\u201cThe problem with these types of reckless, loose-cannon accusations is that they undermine the ability of responsible analysts and policymakers to identify the genuine cases of Chinese wrongdoing and fashion realistic and effective policy responses,\u201d said Michael D. Swaine, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.For Mr. Bannon, the new effort plays to a longstanding and complicated interest in China. As a young naval officer in the 1970s, he patrolled the South China Sea. He also lived for a time in Shanghai, where he ran a small online gaming company. In recent years, he has come to view China as a military threat to the United States, and a fierce economic rival that refuses to play by the rules.It was during his time at the White House, Mr. Bannon says, that he first heard about Mr. Guo. The Chinese billionaire was living in New York, broadcasting allegations of high-level government corruption in China on Twitter and YouTube \u2014 some credible, some outlandish and still unproved. By then, he had also applied for political asylum.Inside the White House, there were disagreements over how to deal with Mr. Guo. Several Western businessmen, apparently eager to cozy up to Beijing, lobbied President Trump to accede to China\u2019s demands, according to people familiar with the talks.Mr. Bannon said he sided with those in the administration who opposed any handover, viewing Mr. Guo as a potentially valuable \u201cintelligence asset.\u201dThey met only after Mr. Bannon was forced out of the White House. Mr. Bannon says he received a call from Bill Gertz, a Washington journalist who has long been critical of China. Mr. Gertz told him that Mr. Guo was scheduled to give a talk in Washington at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. The talk was canceled at the last minute.Over lunch, Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon discussed China\u2019s military capabilities, as well as the financial implications of Beijing\u2019s rule, including what impact the country\u2019s mounting corporate debt might have on its economy. A friendship emerged.\u201cIt was fantastic. He really impressed me,\u201d Mr. Bannon said of his first meeting with Mr. Guo. \u201cWe talked about President Trump\u2019s approach to China, and he went into corruption in the Chinese Communist Party.\u201dMr. Bannon later introduced Mr. Guo to people in the hedge fund community, including J. Kyle Bass, who has soured on China and sought to profit by short-selling the Chinese currency.As Mr. Bannon sharpened his critique of China\u2019s rise, he also began meeting privately with some of America\u2019s leading experts on China, to seek their counsel and outline his agenda. Few welcomed his strident remarks, according to people who attended some of the sessions. But more recently, analysts say, his positions have gotten a warmer reception.\u201cThe tectonic plates are shifting,\u201d says Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cMany analysts would have totally rejected him two years ago. But people are more sympathetic now that engagement with China has been defrocked.\u201dMr. Schell adds, \u201cOn the China question, he\u2019s no longer the skunk at the party.\u201dBut Mr. Bannon is getting blowback from some of Beijing\u2019s friends. On a trip abroad this year to drum up support for nationalist and populist leaders in Eastern and Central Europe, Mr. Bannon says, he was scolded for his positions on China by Milos Zeman, president of the Czech Republic and one of Beijing\u2019s closest allies in the region.\u201cHe threw down on me hard,\u201d Mr. Bannon says. \u201cHe said: \u2018Tell Trump you didn\u2019t learn from Hitler. You can\u2019t fight on two fronts. You can\u2019t take on radical Islam and China. You will end up in the bunker, like Hitler.\u201dA spokesman for President Zeman said that he had challenged Mr. Bannon on American tariffs against China, and that the two men had parted ways in a very \u201ccold atmosphere.\u201dMr. Bannon is unbowed. He has agreed to serve as chairman of the so-called Rule of Law Fund, the $100 million effort that Mr. Guo is financing. The fund plans to publicize its findings and offer financial support to businessmen, government officials and others who run afoul of the Chinese authorities \u2014 including those who flee overseas, like Mr. Guo himself.Mr. Bannon has also joined Mr. Guo in targeting the HNA Group, the huge Chinese conglomerate that borrowed heavily and spent billions around the world, before debt and regulatory pressures forced the company to curb its global ambitions.At their joint news conference last week, Mr. Bannon took the stage at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to say, \u201cLiterally hundreds, if not thousands, of the best and brightest\u201d in China have disappeared, been imprisoned or committed suicide under unusual circumstances and without due process.\u201cToday is about recklessness and accountability,\u201d he added, noting that American financial institutions have close ties to political elites in Beijing. \u201cWho profited off this? Who looked the other way?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cleaning the Congressional Stables", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe House Democratic class of \u201919 is planning a major push on voting, ethics and campaign finance reform. All that stands in the way is the Senate. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.From petty grifting to allegations of treason, the early Trump era has offered a survey course in how to diminish public faith in democratic institutions. All signs are that the coming years will prove even more instructive.Which is why it\u2019s crucial for Democratic lawmakers to stay focused on and fired up about their emerging, much-hyped crusade to clean up Washington.Inspired by the rolling spectacle of Trumpian corruption, Democrats ran hard on a midterm message of reform. They pitched an overhaul of the nation\u2019s political system built around a trio of broad aims: improving access to and the integrity of the voting system, strengthening ethics laws and slashing the influence of big money.Enter H.R. 1, a comprehensive package of revisions to current political practice that House Democrats are looking to introduce in the opening weeks of the next Congress. While the details are still being hashed out, H.R. 1 will attempt to: establish nationwide automatic voter registration; promote online voter registration; end partisan gerrymandering; expand conflict-of-interest laws; increase oversight of lobbyists; require the disclosure of presidential tax returns; strengthen disclosure of campaign donations; set up a system of small-donor matching funds for congressional candidates; and revive the moribund matching-fund system for presidential campaigns. A plan for repairing the Voting Rights Act will move along a separate track.The package is, by design, ambitious. Now is not the time to piddle with closing this loophole and improving that reporting rule, say reformers. Such a change wouldn\u2019t stem the flood of outside money deforming the political system, but it would give candidates an alternative way to run \u2014 and provide not-so-rich Americans a greater sense that their voices can be heard. It is the foundation on which other anti-corruption efforts rest, reformers say, with a warning that if lawmakers don\u2019t address this problem, their credibility will remain in the toilet.At this point, the hunger for reform is so fierce among the Democratic base that the caucus will need to work to temper expectations. While H.R. 1 is near the top of the to-do list of the incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the package will take a while to make its way to a floor vote. At least five committees have oversight of pieces of it, and even among Democrats there are competing visions for various provisions that must be worked through. Democratic House leaders are hoping to get a bill passed early in the year. And then it is likely to go nowhere fast.Realistically speaking, enacting even pieces of a bill like H.R. 1 is more of a medium- to longish-term legislative goal. But this does not diminish the urgency of passing the package in the House as a declaration of Democrats\u2019 commitment. Its champions seem to grasp this. Mr. Sarbanes expressed optimism that serious revisions could be achieved within a couple of election cycles \u2014 but only if Democrats move quickly to get people fired up and then \u201ckeep the pressure on.\u201dEven the most ethically bankrupt politician can spout drivel about \u201cdraining the swamp.\u201d For the next couple of years, Democrats\u2019 challenge is to keep this issue hot enough to make life uncomfortable for reform foes like Mr. McConnell \u2014 and to make clear to voters what must be done if they want to take this crusade beyond one chamber of Congress.An earlier version of this editorial referred incorrectly to one of the proposals. It would promote online voter registration, not early and online voting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Google Campus Accelerates Tech\u2019s March Into New York", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle said on Monday that it planned to create a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. The internet company\u2019s push into one of Manhattan\u2019s most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of New York\u2019s biggest occupants of office space, allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than 14,000 over the next decade.\u201cLaw, medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at New York University who studies the city\u2019s economy.The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John\u2019s Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet.Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.Other big tech companies quickly followed. Amazon and Facebook each now have more than 2,000 employees in New York, while Apple and Salesforce each employ more than 1,000. LinkedIn has a large office in the Empire State Building, and IBM chose New York as the base for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Since 2009, jobs in tech and advertising in New York have increased 31 percent to 360,600, while financial-services jobs in the city increased about 12 percent to 475,500, according to an analysis of federal data by Ken McCarthy, principal economist at the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. By contrast, the education and health sectors employ about one million people in New York, while the hospitality industry employs 465,800, according to his analysis.Mr. McCarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer, meaning any bank employee is counted as finance. But New York\u2019s traditional industries \u2014 banking, retailing and consulting \u2014 have also added thousands of tech jobs. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers, including many in new fields like data science, blockchain and machine learning.And New York\u2019s tech sector is accelerating. Over the past year, the share of New York postings on the job site Indeed increased nearly 13 percent for tech jobs and just 2 percent for finance and accounting jobs. About 5 percent of all New York jobs posted on Indeed are now tech related, the site said, compared with 3 percent for finance and accounting.That growth has made San Francisco, which is a gateway to Silicon Valley, a sort of sister city to New York. As a result, the air route between them is one of the nation\u2019s most competitive and heavily trafficked.\u201cThere is more economic connectivity between New York and San Francisco than between New York and any of the declining upstate cities,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Google has expanded quietly and has not asked for public subsidies. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government,\u201d William Floyd, Google\u2019s head of external affairs in New York said this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it by the dint our own work.\u201dAnd some in Manhattan are wary that Google and other businesses will begin to spread into historic neighborhoods.\u201cMy concern is that with Google\u2019s concentration in that area, it\u2019s going to pull in even more intense pressure for office development, particularly tech office development, in adjacent neighborhoods like the Village and East Village, where we are seeing it happen already,\u201d said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.Mr. Berman said he did not oppose Google\u2019s expansion in Hudson Square, which in the past decade has transformed into a commercial district, with many of its lofts and factories converted to offices for more than 1,000 companies, many in technology, advertising and media. Today, more than 50,000 people work in the neighborhood, and thousands more have made their home there following a 2013 city rezoning that allowed residential development.But Mr. Berman said the growing demand for offices has led to the demolition of historic buildings, pushed out longtime businesses and residents, and resulted in modern office towers that are out of character with the rest of the neighborhood.Chelsea has also witnessed rapid development over the past decade as it has mostly shed its working class roots and identity as a hub of gay night life. It still maintains large public housing projects, but is dotted with art galleries, new condominiums and expensive restaurants.In response, Google invested in local nonprofit organizations and said it would pay for a ferry stop at Pier 57, where it is renting office space, earning some plaudits from local elected officials.\u201cIn terms of buying the new buildings, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not chasing anyone out,\u201d said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been awfully good neighbors in Chelsea.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting from New York, and Ed Shanahan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Democrats Will Soon Have the Power to Investigate the White House. How Far Will They Go?", "Date": "2018-12-17", "News": "FeatureIn two weeks, congressional Democrats will return to Washington with the authority to investigate a White House that is suspected of foreign collusion, conflicts of interest and mismanagement of the federal government.Supported byOne letter will have been jointly addressed to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, demanding the age, gender, country of origin and current location of every child who was separated from his or her parents under the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy. Another will have gone to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, asking for the identities of any senior White House officials who have used \u2014 as Hillary Clinton once did \u2014 nongovernment email accounts to conduct official business.The White House chief of staff will have received a letter, also addressed to the heads of multiple federal agencies, requesting information and documents about the use of government-owned aircraft for personal travel and private aircraft for official travel. Outside the government, the Trump Organization will have received one asking for a complete accounting of all the payments it has received from foreign governments or foreign-government-owned entities since Donald Trump\u2019s election. Each letter will have been written on stationery bearing the seal of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and signed with Cummings\u2019s looping signature over the word: \u201cChairman-designate.\u201dElected to the House in 1996, Cummings, 67, represents a majority-African-American district anchored in Baltimore. He is a son of two former sharecroppers turned Pentecostal ministers; his bald head and booming baritone project a ministerial \u2014 and authoritative \u2014 presence. Until now, Cummings\u2019s greatest national renown came in 2015: During the riots that followed Freddie Gray\u2019s death from injuries he sustained in a Baltimore police van, Fox News broadcast live coverage of the congressman walking through the city\u2019s streets, bullhorn in hand, urging calm and shouting at protesters to go home.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to do anything extraordinary,\u201d Cummings told me of the letters. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do what the Constitution says I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d It was election night, and he was at a small party in Baltimore, where he had just been informed by a colleague, Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland, that the networks were declaring that Democrats would have a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2011. \u201cMr. Chairman!\u201d Sarbanes said in breaking the news.The midterm results effectively brought an end to Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, or at least the parts of it that Democrats find objectionable. But the victory gives Democrats little legislative power of their own. If by some miracle any Democrat-authored House bill makes it through the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump\u2019s veto pen awaits.What the House Democrats will have, however, is oversight authority: the ability to hold hearings and request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas to uncover and expose all the incompetence and misconduct and outright corruption that they suspect permeates the executive branch under the current occupant of the White House. \u201cMake no mistake, Democrats will honor our constitutional responsibility to exercise oversight of the Trump administration and get the American people the answers they deserve,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cVoters delivered a check and balance on the president that will hold him and his administration accountable for the abuses of power and culture of corruption that have consumed Washington.\u201d Trump is already besieged by the investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and by multiple probes by the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York into his family business. In January, he will face a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives that suddenly has the power to open a third investigative front against him \u2014 power that will reside, in large part, in Cummings\u2019s office.That power is both broad and subtle. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee\u2019s mandate is investigation, across the whole range of federal government operations \u2014 and even into the private sector. (The three-year congressional investigation into the use of steroids in Major League Baseball in the 2000s was a House Oversight production.) Other committees have the power to investigate, too, but none have so expansive a remit. \u201cOversight,\u201d says former Representative Henry Waxman of California, the Democratic chairman of the committee from 2007 to 2009, \u201chas jurisdiction over the world.\u201dThis has given Cummings\u2019s predecessors a unique ability to shape the public perception of recent presidencies \u2014 particularly when, as will be the case in January, it is a president of the other party. Many of the familiar details of the George W. Bush administration\u2019s outing of the covert C.I.A. agent Valerie Plame, emergency-response failures during Hurricane Katrina and disastrous reconstruction of Iraq were ferreted out by Waxman, who led the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for the last two years of Bush\u2019s second term. The congressional investigations of the Obama administration \u2014 into claims that the Internal Revenue Service targeted Tea Party groups and that the Justice Department allowed guns to be illegally trafficked across the Mexican border \u2014 that dominated Fox News chyrons after Republicans took back the House in 2011 were started by Waxman\u2019s Republican successor, Darrell Issa.As a rule, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee is a sleepy place when the same party controls Congress and the White House. But even by these standards, the committee\u2019s performance during the first two years of the Trump administration has been unusual. Under the chairmanship of Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah and then, after Chaffetz resigned in June 2017 and took a job at Fox News, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee essentially turned a blind eye toward the executive branch. On matters big (like the firing of the F.B.I. director, James Comey, or the administration\u2019s botched response to Hurricane Maria) and comparatively small (like Trump\u2019s decision to revoke the security clearance of the former C.I.A. director John Brennan), the Oversight Committee did not seem interested in doing much real oversight.\u201cIf the president\u2019s party on Capitol Hill becomes subservient to the executive branch and just becomes an appendage of that, then Congress basically loses its meaning,\u201d Tom Davis, the Virginia Republican who was chairman of the committee during part of Bush\u2019s presidency, from 2003 to 2007, told me. \u201cWe turn into a parliamentary operation.\u201d Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, puts it even more bluntly. \u201cLooking back over the first two years of the administration,\u201d he says, \u201cI can\u2019t point to a single example, House or Senate, where any committee or subcommittee actually fulfilled its role of doing oversight.\u201dOver the past two years, as the committee\u2019s ranking member, Cummings issued 64 subpoena requests; they were requests because the minority party can\u2019t issue subpoenas without the majority\u2019s approval. Chaffetz and Gowdy rejected them all. And even when Chaffetz or Gowdy did ask the Trump administration for information, they didn\u2019t push very hard. \u201cI was able to get them to jointly request documents that we needed to do our job,\u201d Cummings told me, \u201cbut when the administration basically said, \u2018Screw you\u2019 \u2014 and the administration basically said that to every request \u2014 they refused to back it up with a subpoena.\u201d Indeed, the first requests Cummings will send out as the incoming Oversight chairman \u2014 the letters about family separation, nongovernment emails and government-owned aircraft for personal travel \u2014 will be those that Chaffetz and Gowdy jointly sent with him over the past two years and that the administration largely ignored.At the time, Cummings counseled his Republican colleagues to put aside the politics of the moment and to think long-term. \u201cI get in these guys\u2019 ears, and I talk to them heart to heart,\u201d Cummings says. \u201cI told them, \u2018Trump is 72. I\u2019m 67. You all are still young guys. Why are you trying to carry this guy\u2019s water? After he\u2019s dead, you\u2019re going to be living with this [expletive].\u2019\u2009\u201dIn the 226 years since the committee investigated \u2014 and ultimately absolved \u2014 St. Clair, Congress has performed its oversight and investigative functions with varying degrees of enthusiasm, competence and responsibility. For every Senate investigation into the Teapot Dome scandal \u2014 which brought down Albert Fall, Warren Harding\u2019s secretary of the interior, in 1923 for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from oil barons \u2014 there\u2019s Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s use of his chairmanship of the Committee on Government Operations in the 1950s to search for Communists in the government.In the decades after Watergate, both the Senate and the House conducted rigorous, and bipartisan, investigations into topics including intelligence-agency abuses and military-procurement fraud, producing meaningful reforms in the process. That heyday came to an end, however, when Republicans took back the House in 1995, giving them control of it for the first time in 40 years. Once Newt Gingrich was installed as House speaker, he merged several House committees with responsibilities to monitor government agencies into a single panel, naming it the Government Reform and Oversight Committee.The new committee had the broadest oversight jurisdiction of any in Congress \u2014 a power Gingrich quickly weaponized against the Clinton administration. He filled over half the G.O.P.\u2019s committee seats with freshmen who arrived on the wave of his Republican revolution, and in 1997 made Representative Dan Burton of Indiana its chairman. An ardent Clinton foe, Burton had already proposed investigating the suicide of the deputy White House counsel Vince Foster \u2014 Burton infamously conducted amateur forensics tests, reportedly by shooting melons in his backyard \u2014 and how much money the White House was spending on postage to respond to letters that children had written to the Clintons\u2019 pet cat, Socks.In his six years as chairman, Burton issued more than 1,000 unilateral subpoenas and demanded everything down to the White House holiday-card list. But his Javert act ultimately became too much even for Republicans. For all his exertions, Burton proved unable to find concrete evidence of serious wrongdoing on the part of the Clinton administration. He repeatedly undermined himself, as in 1998 when one of his top aides \u2014 Trump\u2019s future deputy campaign manager David Bossie \u2014 released transcripts of the jailhouse phone conversations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s old law partner and former Associate Attorney General Webb Hubbell, who was convicted of fraud for overbilling clients, that seemed to implicate Clinton in the overbilling. Democrats later showed that the transcripts had been misleadingly edited, and Bossie was pressured to resign. \u201cWe\u2019d just put our foot out,\u201d recalls Henry Waxman, who was the top Democrat on the committee during Burton\u2019s chairmanship, \u201cand he\u2019d trip over it.\u201d Gingrich eventually stopped giving sensitive investigative assignments to Burton\u2019s Oversight Committee.In 2003, Tom Davis took over as the Oversight Committee chairman and established what became the standard mode of low-key defense when the chairman\u2019s own party is in the White House. \u201cI had to show the party flag,\u201d Davis says of fighting off some Democratic demands for investigations of the Bush administration. But when it came to big issues \u2014 like the Bush administration\u2019s slow and poorly executed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff\u2019s contacts with President Bush and other White House officials \u2014 Davis, much to the consternation of some of his fellow Republicans, led rigorous investigations. \u201cHe had a concern about oversight,\u201d Waxman says, \u201cand he thought the questions we wanted to pursue were legitimate and worthwhile.\u201dAfter Democrats took back the House in the 2006 midterms, Waxman became Oversight Committee chairman. He was an aggressive but careful investigator; unlike Burton, he didn\u2019t initiate an inquiry at the first whiff of scandal, nor did he succumb to some of his Democratic constituents\u2019 blood lust. \u201cI\u2019d go to some of the Democratic clubs back home, and people would say, \u2018Why haven\u2019t you imprisoned George W. Bush?\u2019\u2009\u201d Waxman recalls. \u201cI had to tell them we don\u2019t have the power to imprison people. There was a widespread belief that there\u2019s a prison right there in the Capitol.\u201dBut Waxman\u2019s investigations into the failures of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, profiteering by the military contractor Blackwater and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s dangerous policy of housing families displaced by Hurricane Katrina in trailers with unhealthful levels of formaldehyde, among others, harked back to the heyday of post-Watergate oversight. His hearings calling executives from A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers to testify about their role in the 2008 financial crisis helped lay the groundwork for Congress\u2019s most substantial attempt in decades to rein in the financial sector, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.One of Waxman\u2019s most trusted lieutenants on the Oversight Committee was Cummings, who proved so adept at political theater that Waxman and his staff often relied on him to ask the most crucial questions of hostile witnesses testifying before the committee. Even today, Oversight veterans speak in awed tones about a 2007 hearing when Cummings questioned the State Department\u2019s inspector general, Howard Krongard, about claims that he impeded a federal investigation into Blackwater. During testimony, Cummings informed Krongard that committee staff had discovered that Krongard\u2019s brother was at a Blackwater advisory board meeting in Williamsburg, Va.: \u201cThis meeting is taking place right now,\u201d Cummings said, \u201cas we speak.\u201d Krongard resigned from the State Department a few weeks later. \u201cIt was like a Perry Mason moment,\u201d Waxman says.During their years in the minority, Cummings and his roughly 35-person committee staff, led by its director, David Rapallo, became skilled at conducting investigations without much political or legal leverage. In 2017, a Democratic investigator for the Oversight Committee, scrutinizing Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national-security adviser, reviewed Flynn\u2019s 2016 security clearance renewal application and noticed that Flynn took a trip to Saudi Arabia in 2015 \u2014 during which he claimed to stay at a hotel that did not exist and to attend a conference that did not occur. Robert Mueller went on to investigate Flynn\u2019s suspected efforts to broker a $100 billion energy deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia\u2019s nuclear-power agency.Combing through the unpublished supporting evidence of an inspector general\u2019s report, Democratic committee staff found emails that appeared to show that Trump, in spite of his own denials, had ordered the reversal of plans to move the F.B.I. headquarters to a suburban location and off Pennsylvania Avenue, where it currently sits across from the Trump Hotel \u2014 a reversal that would benefit his hotel by preventing commercial developers from building a competing property across the street. \u201cThe Cummings people did a lot of great investigative work without formal tools,\u201d says Phil Barnett, who was the staff director of the Oversight Committee under Waxman. \u201cNow they will have formal tools.\u201dLike Cummings, Nadler and Schiff chafed at their committees\u2019 Republican chairmen\u2019s lack of interest and outright interference during the Trump presidency. Mueller\u2019s investigators have spent months building an increasingly sweeping case about Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, implicating and indicting several of Trump\u2019s closest associates to date. But under the chairmanship of the Republican Devin Nunes of California, the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 which has a clear constitutional authority to conduct some of the same investigatory work as Mueller \u2014 produced a report that breezily concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government and that, contrary to the official consensus of the American intelligence community, the Russian government was not even seeking to help elect Trump. Committee Democrats said they were shut out of the drafting process and publicly condemned the report.Nunes also initiated parallel investigations of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for what he claimed was \u201ccriminal activity and fraudulent behavior\u201d in an effort to hurt Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 investigations that Schiff contends actively sought to thwart exactly the kind of oversight the committee was supposed to be doing. \u201cI think that the mission for the chairman has been protecting the White House, protecting the president and furthering a political narrative which is completely at odds with the facts,\u201d Schiff told me.When Immigration and Customs Enforcement, following a new and unprecedented Trump administration policy, separated more than 2,300 immigrant children from their families at the Southern border this spring, the Republican-led Judiciary Committee did not hold a single oversight hearing for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whose agency falls under the committee\u2019s oversight jurisdiction. Other committees, too, had their own lists of Trump-administration oversight oversights: the Natural Resources Committee\u2019s lack of interest in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s suspected ethical and managerial misdeeds, which have been the subject of at least 17 federal investigations, for instance; or the Veterans Affairs Committee\u2019s refusal to look into whether three Trump friends, all Mar-a-Lago members, improperly influenced a $10 billion contract to modernize veterans\u2019 health care records. \u201cThe oversight job, after two years of Donald Trump,\u201d says Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who serves on both the Oversight and Judiciary Committees, \u201cis like coming upon a 73-car pileup on the highway.\u201dWith so many targets, and so many hungry Democrats, \u201cthere\u2019s the potential for oversight fratricide next year,\u201d says a senior Democratic official on the Intelligence Committee, noting the overlapping jurisdictions of the various committees. There\u2019s also the potential for distraction. \u201cThe question is, do you want to be the Breaking News Committee that just investigates the issue of the day?\u201d asks Swalwell, who sits on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. \u201cOr do you want to look at broader, longstanding core issues?\u201d At that September meeting and at multiple gatherings of members and their staffs over the subsequent weeks and months, an initial strategy \u2014 and a division of labor \u2014 began to take shape.Schiff, the incoming Intelligence Committee chairman, will play a major role. One of his top priorities will be protecting \u2014 and assisting \u2014 Mueller\u2019s investigation, and one of his first acts in the new Congress will be trying to get to the bottom of one of the more tantalizing mysteries of the whole Russia affair: Whom did Donald Trump Jr. speak to on his phone in between calls setting up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians peddling dirt on Hillary Clinton? Trump Jr. claims he can\u2019t remember, and the call appears as a blocked number on his phone records. Nunes refused to ask Trump Jr.\u2019s cellular provider for the blocked number. \u201cThat phone call may lead to a place the Republicans didn\u2019t want to go,\u201d Schiff says, \u201cand so they were unwilling to get the answer.\u201d Schiff wants the answer and will press the provider for it.Nunes\u2019s investigation may not have produced much, but under his leadership, the committee did conduct hundreds of hours of interviews: with Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Roger Stone and other key figures in the Russia matter. On Nunes\u2019s orders, almost all the transcripts have remained in the sole possession of the committee, which has, among other things, kept them out of the hands of Mueller\u2019s investigators. Schiff plans to publicly release the remaining transcripts when the new Congress convenes in January.In November, Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project Trump pursued. Cohen was caught by Mueller\u2019s investigators only because he publicly released his opening statement to the Intelligence Committee. Referring to the unreleased transcripts, Swalwell told me: \u201cI just wonder how many more crimes are just sitting in the basement of the House Intelligence Committee that Mueller doesn\u2019t know about because he hasn\u2019t seen that they lied to us.\u201dSchiff is also interested in examining Trump\u2019s business dealings \u2014 including whether Russians laundered money through the Trump Organization \u2014 from a counterintelligence perspective. \u201cWhat would be most compromising to our nation and our national security is if a hostile foreign power has leverage over the president of the United States,\u201d Schiff told me. Or as the senior Democratic Intelligence Committee official says: \u201cWhenever Putin is alone in a room with Trump with just the two of them and their translators, like they were in Helsinki, is Putin reminding him that he has an Excel spreadsheet of how many rubles are parked in Trump Tower?\u201dThe congressman from the Upper West Side became the top Democrat on the committee in December 2017 after John Conyers, the long-serving Michigan representative, resigned from Congress over sexual-harassment claims. Nadler has been a Trump b\u00eate noire since the 1980s, when, as an assemblyman, he fought to prevent Trump from building a proposed 150-story building in his district, where Trump hoped to live in an apartment on the top floor. After his election to Congress in 1992, Nadler made sure Trump didn\u2019t receive federal mortgage guarantees for the project. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to be the tallest man in the world there,\u201d Nadler told me. Trump described Nadler in his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d as \u201cone of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.\u201dThe Judiciary Committee is endowed with the authority to start impeachment proceedings against a president, as committee Republicans did against Bill Clinton in 1998, and as committee Democrats did against Nixon in 1973. Nadler is thus probably the committee chairman most likely to find himself caught between the expectations of the Democratic base and the political and institutional realities their representatives are now subject to.\u201cIf they\u2019re successful at doing their jobs, then they\u2019ll bring forth more information about Trump\u2019s wrongdoing, and the logical conclusion will be impeachment,\u201d says Kevin Mack, lead strategist for the liberal billionaire Tom Steyer\u2019s group Need to Impeach, which has gathered nearly 6.5 million signatures supporting Trump\u2019s impeachment. And if Democrats don\u2019t impeach Trump? \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying by not attempting to stand up for the rule of law is that the rule of law is not the most important thing to you,\u201d Steyer told me. \u201cComplaining about something is not doing something about it.\u201dWhen Nadler ran to succeed Conyers as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, his pitch included a leaflet he wrote and distributed to his fellow Democrats, which said that he was \u201cour strongest member to lead a potential impeachment.\u201d Since clinching the chairmanship, however, Nadler has become much more circumspect, at least publicly, about impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s too early,\u201d he told me in November. \u201cIt\u2019s a very momentous step. It has real consequences.\u201d Even if Robert Mueller or congressional Democrats uncover what he concludes are impeachable offenses, Nadler told me, he would want to begin impeachment proceedings only if he believes that, by the end of the process, there would be an \u201cappreciable fraction of the Trump voters\u201d who support Trump\u2019s impeachment.Still, as he sat in his emptying office, Nadler did not sound like someone eager to lead a potential impeachment. \u201cThe fact that you find impeachable offenses and the fact that you think you can prove impeachable offenses,\u201d he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily mean the offenses rise to the level of importance where you should impeach.\u201d When I spoke to Nadler a couple of weeks later, after federal prosecutors said that Trump directed Michael Cohen to make payments in violation of campaign-finance laws to squelch a sex scandal, he still sounded cautious. \u201cI don\u2019t think things have changed, really,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cWe know a little more, but there\u2019s a lot more to know.\u201dIn the days after the election, Nadler began firing off \u201cpreservation letters\u201d to the White House, the Justice Department and other agencies warning them that \u201cconcealing, removing or destroying\u201d any documents related to Jeff Sessions\u2019s firing or Mueller\u2019s investigation \u201cmay constitute a crime.\u201d In January, the committee\u2019s first order of business, Nadler said, will be to call Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, to testify; Whitaker, who has a thin legal r\u00e9sum\u00e9, was tapped by Trump to replace Sessions and will hold the job until the official nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is confirmed by the Senate. From the moment Whitaker was appointed, Nadler told me, \u201cIt was clear that Trump wanted him to be his hatchet man.\u201d When Whitaker comes before the committee, Nadler said, he will ask him: \u201cHave you told Mueller not to follow some line of inquiry? Have you told him not to indict somebody? What instructions have you given to him, if any? Have you communicated with the White House about these matters in any way or with the president\u2019s lawyers in any way? What have you told them? Those kinds of questions.\u201dNadler\u2019s to-do list goes far beyond Whitaker. There is the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general; the Trump administration\u2019s family-separation policy; whether the White House improperly interfered with the F.B.I.\u2019s background check into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\u201cIn the last two years, the Republicans in Congress, their basic idea has been: Let the Trump administration do what it wants, let there be no oversight,\u201d Nadler said. In a normal presidency, this would have been problematic, but with Trump in the White House, Nadler argued, \u201cthere are real challenges to the democratic norms that we haven\u2019t seen the likes of since the Civil War.\u201d The result, he said, is that \u201cwe have a real crisis now.\u201d\u201cOur Republican colleagues have promised to accommodate us, and I appreciate it,\u201d Cummings said when it was his turn to speak, \u201cbut they would not move the hearing to a different day, and they would not even move up the start time by 30 minutes so we could ask Administrator Long our questions.\u201d He was referring to the head of FEMA, Brock Long, who was testifying that day. He lit into Gowdy. \u201cI greatly respect the chairman, as a person, as an attorney and as a friend, but this is not transparency, this is not accountability and this is certainly not oversight.\u201dIf Cummings is perceptive of the tactics being used against him to defend a president, it\u2019s because, not so long ago, he was the one doing the protecting. He became the top Democrat on the committee when Republicans took back the House in the 2010 midterms, and the new chairman, Darrell Issa, promised to hold hundreds of hearings into the Obama administration. Cummings was the first line of defense against the coming investigative onslaught. \u201cMr. Cummings was very smart and deliberate and methodical, and was a perfect foil to Darrell,\u201d says Kurt Bardella, Issa\u2019s former spokesman and later a spokesman for Breitbart, who last year renounced the G.O.P. and became a Democrat. Cummings batted back Republicans\u2019 most incendiary charges against Obama by pointing to the lack of any real evidence, and repeatedly provoked Issa into own goals, like the time Issa received negative coverage for ordering Cummings\u2019s microphone cut off when Cummings tried to make a statement at the end of a hearing.Cummings proved a similarly effective opponent to Gowdy on the special committee investigating the 2012 attack on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya \u2014 which Gowdy led and on which Cummings was the top Democrat \u2014 and then to Chaffetz, who succeeded Issa as Oversight Committee chairman. Cummings\u2019s friends are quick to point out that Issa, Chaffetz and Gowdy will not be serving in the next Congress. \u201cThey all quit after having to deal with Elijah!\u201d Waxman says.And yet, those Obama-era investigations made an indelible mark on politics. Congressional Republicans may never have been able to prove that Obama\u2019s I.R.S. unfairly singled out Tea Party groups for scrutiny; or that Eric Holder tried to hide the facts about a failed Justice Department investigation into gunrunning along the Mexican border, called Fast and Furious, that resulted in the death of a Border Patrol agent; or that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, tried to cover up a bungled response to the Benghazi attack \u2014 but you might not know this if you spend much time on conservative media or the Trump rally circuit.Burton\u2019s probing of the Clinton administration occurred in the old-media landscape of the 1990s, when the expectations of the press \u2014 and of the public \u2014 were that for a congressional investigation to be considered successful, it needed to produce the factual goods. But Issa and his successors, by virtue of right-wing-media megaphones like Fox News (which was in its infancy during the Clinton years) and Breitbart, were able to conduct investigations as a kind of post-truth theater, where proving charges was less important than making them, loudly and repeatedly. By the time of the 2016 presidential campaign, a Fairleigh Dickinson University survey found that 44 percent of Republicans and a full half of Trump supporters believed it was \u201cdefinitely true\u201d that \u201cas secretary of state, Hillary Clinton knew the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi was going to be attacked and did nothing to protect it.\u201dThe challenge of conducting oversight in this post-truth political environment is not lost on Cummings and other Democrats. \u201cI watch Fox News every now and then,\u201d Cummings told me, \u201cand the reason why I watch Fox News is, I\u2019m trying to see how they can twist things around and make them sound so like the Democrats have some conspiracy against the president \u2014 and they do a good job of it.\u201d Democrats worry about what will happen if they turn up concrete evidence of presidential wrongdoing in their investigations and a sizable portion of the electorate simply refuses to believe it.It\u2019s also very likely that Trump, having already broken so many other norms, will have few qualms about breaking the norm of cooperating, or even feigning cooperation, with congressional investigations. \u201cIf the president treats the Congress the way he has Bob Mueller, we can expect the administration to respond to many of our requests with stonewalling and invective,\u201d Schiff says. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible the administration will decide they\u2019re not going to compromise on anything, and litigate everything.\u201d David Bossie, the Dan Burton aide who stepped down for misleadingly editing and releasing the Hubbell transcripts, remains an informal adviser to Trump; he has gone so far as to suggest in a recent interview with Jacqueline Alemany of The Washington Post that the White House should encourage people subpoenaed by House Democrats to plead the fifth or even flee the country. Congressional Republicans have also sent a message by picking Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, perhaps Trump\u2019s most staunch and outspoken defender on Capitol Hill, to serve as the top Republican on the Oversight Committee. \u201cWhen the caucus picked Jordan,\u201d Tom Davis says, \u201cthey really picked confrontation.\u201dThe most disheartening prospect for Democrats is what that confrontation could ultimately reveal: just how little leverage \u2014 political and legal \u2014 a divided Congress has in a fight with a president like Trump. If Trump administration officials refuse to comply with subpoenas, Democrats could vote to hold them in contempt of Congress. But that\u2019s a largely toothless gesture. Even if the House does succumb to the Democratic base\u2019s desire and impeaches Trump, the G.O.P.-controlled Senate would almost certainly never convict. What\u2019s more, impeachment could backfire. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to reward an offender like the president with martyrdom,\u201d Eric Swalwell, who\u2019s currently exploring his own presidential run in 2020, told me. \u201cThat would be the worst outcome \u2014 that he gets more popular, that his base grows because of it.\u201dSurveying the task ahead of him, Cummings says, \u201cThis will be one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d On a recent afternoon, he sat in his congressional office and contemplated the possibility that he\u2019d fall short. In the past year and a half, Cummings was hospitalized for nearly five months because of a serious knee infection and complications from a heart-valve replacement. \u201cMy saddest thought,\u201d he said, \u201cis that there will be damage done which will not be corrected during my lifetime and perhaps for a long time.\u201dDemocrats realize that they\u2019ll have to wage their battle in the court of public opinion \u2014 and Cummings believes that will require eventually winning over at least some of his Republican colleagues to his side. \u201cThere is one incentive for them: love of country and democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to try to help them get there. We have to try to help their constituents see what they\u2019re doing and what they\u2019re not doing and try to bring them back to some sense of normalcy.\u201dSeated at the top of the dais in the Oversight Committee hearing room at the sparsely attended hearings into Hurricane Maria last month, Cummings tried to get a head start on doing just that. He noted how FEMA hadn\u2019t been responsive to his entreaties for information over the last two years. He told Long, the FEMA head, that his attitude would have to change and that he expected answers to a new a batch of questions before the end of the year \u2014 after which Cummings would be the one holding the gavel.\u201cI guarantee you, Administrator Long,\u201d Cummings said, raising his hand and pointing a long, knobby finger, \u201cthis hearing will not be your last before this committee.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making a Difference in 2018", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesEven during a year of division and fear of the future in many corners of America, the Fixes column found people trying to make things better \u2014 and succeeding. What difference can one ordinary person make?Here are six people Fixes wrote about in the last year who show what the answer can be: a lot.Last month, Michigan voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that changed the state Constitution. It created a commission of independent citizens to draw the lines of congressional districts, taking the job away from politicians.Ms. Fahey kept waiting for someone who knew what they were doing to come along and tell her to run along now, but no one did. In the last few months, Voters Not Politicians became more professional. By then, its citizen army had made its message of citizen power even more persuasive.But being amateurs also had drawbacks. \u201cThe system wasn\u2019t built for civilians,\u201d Ms. Fahey said. Most campaigns, for example, have experts file the required reports to the state. Voters Not Politicians had to learn to do it itself.Voters Not Politicians now gets calls from people all over who want to fight gerrymandering or want to organize around other issues. \u201cWho\u2019s helping the regular person who wants a dog park in their community?\u201d Ms. Fahey asked. \u201cWe challenged the assumption you have to wait for someone else, or look to a politician to fix a problem. Some 27-year-old can get a lot of people excited about gerrymandering and amend the constitution.\u201dAmazon\u2019s move to Queens will make New York\u2019s shortage of software developers far worse. At the same time, lots of low-income New Yorkers would love those jobs \u2014 but don\u2019t have the skills.Is there a way to solve both problems at once?Pursuit starts with a 10-month intensive boot camp where students learn coding, professional skills and how to navigate the tech industry. Then, for the next three years, they get coaching and support while working.That\u2019s expensive, but, Mr. Hsu says, good job training is. \u201cMost job training doesn\u2019t really have results,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to do this well.\u201dThere are lots of coding boot camps. Pursuit is different because it aims at students who can\u2019t pay. Such projects often get their money from charity or grants, but that would have kept Pursuit too small.Mr. Hsu has come up with new ways to pay for the work. Pursuit\u2019s students do pay tuition \u2014 but only after they graduate and get a job paying at least $60,000. Then they pay 12 percent of their salary for three years.Pursuit raises the upfront money in two ways. One is to issue a bond, as public infrastructure projects do. Pursuit found investors to put up $750,000 for the first bond. If enough students graduate, get high-paying jobs and pay tuition, the investors will profit. Mr. Hsu is now seeking multiple millions for the organization\u2019s next bond.The other way is to charge companies. Companies already pay recruiters to find software developers. Now, instead, they can pay Pursuit to retrain their own blue-collar workers.So far, only two companies, Blue Apron and Managed by Q, are doing this. But another company is about to start: Pursuit will run a training center inside Amazon.Ms. Joseph believes that treating patients with dignity protects them from stress.She designed her clinic to help patients feel respected, valued and in control of their pregnancies, starting with a welcoming, no-drama front desk that doesn\u2019t ask about ability to pay. \u201cOur receptionist is probably the most important person on the team,\u201d said Ms. Joseph. \u201cGreet, be nice, wipe the tears.\u201d Ms. Joseph can barely keep her own doors open. \u201cWe bill, and when people can pay, they do, and when they can\u2019t, we don\u2019t charge. There\u2019s not a business model here.\u201dThat means showing them how to clear anything flammable within 30 to 50 feet of a house. \u201cFire moves through a landscape throwing embers two to three miles ahead,\u201d said Ms. Green. \u201cIf they find flammable materials, they smolder and ignite.\u201d\u201cThe science behind defensible space has been around since the late 1990s,\u201d she said. \u201cI translate that science to residents. These are really simple changes, but not something a lot of folks think about.\u201dHer biggest challenge: Twenty people move to Deschutes County every day. They all need to learn how to protect their homes \u2014 and put in the work to do so.In August, three houses burned \u2014 the first home casualties since 2003. It was a high-wind day, and there had been no rain for more than two months. \u201cThese folks hadn\u2019t found the time to put in defensible space correctly,\u201d Ms. Green said. \u201cIt was devastating, but the way that fire was burning, it could have been 3,000 home losses.\u201dThe next year, Ms. Tracy and five or so colleagues went to the sex crimes unit\u2019s headquarters and spent three days reading through the files, flagging questionable practices. That review still happens every spring.Over time, police practices have greatly improved, Ms. Tracy said. And now the advocate reviews are starting to spread \u2014 for example, to the New York Police Department.While reading the files, Ms. Tracy noticed that the F.B.I. defined rape as \u201ccarnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.\u201d If that sounds archaic, it\u2019s because it was written in 1929. \u201cThat came as news to all of us,\u201d she said.Few women around the world can get a mammogram. They are far from a clinic, or lack the money, or just don\u2019t know about breast cancer. But now there\u2019s another kind of breast exam that could reach women that mammograms don\u2019t.That was, however, far less than half the battle \u2014 and it\u2019s the second part that trips up most entrepreneurs, especially those making products for poor countries. \u201cThere are so many great technologies out there,\u201d said Matthew Campisi, a co-founder. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make them a successful product.\u201dSo far, iBreastExam has been cleared by regulatory bodies in 10 countries. One is the United States. Mr. Shah said that 70 percent of uninsured women don\u2019t get routine mammograms. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying it\u2019s a replacement for a mammogram,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying there are areas where it can help.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified on second reference the organization that asked Robert Mueller, director of the F.B.I. at the time, to amend the definition of rape. It was the Women's Law Project, not Women's Law Center. The article also misidentified the place where members of the project reviewed Police Department files. It was the headquarters of the department's sex crimes unit, not the Police Department's headquarters.Advertisement"}

Such worries have been adding to troubles in stock markets around the world, including the United States, with investors absorbing the likelihood of leaner times.Last year, global investors delivered $315 billion in fresh capital to the stock and bond markets of emerging economies, not counting China, according to an analysis by Oxford Economics in London. This year, the flow dropped to $105 billion through October. Many economies have seen outright reversals, with Turkey, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Africa all seeing overall declines.\u201cYou have the perfect cocktail of risks for emerging markets,\u201d said Nafez Zouk, Oxford\u2019s lead emerging markets economist.Currencies in emerging economies120MexicoChina100S.

Given that India imports more goods than it exports, the effects are potent. Any increase in cost, any factor discouraging companies from hiring, strains a country in which one in five people survive on no more than $1.90 per day, according to the World Bank.\u201cIndia is a country that is very vulnerable to the fallout to the readjustment of global interest rates,\u201d said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist at Columbia University, and a former chief economist at the World Bank.Concerns are mounting about rising debt levels as the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashes spending aimed at winning popular support ahead of next year\u2019s elections. Worries fester over bad loans choking a banking system still dominated by the government.All of this has combined to prompt investors to yank their money out of India, pushing the rupee down.In Gujarat, Mr. Modi\u2019s home state, and a center of business, many local industries require imports to make their wares \u2014 especially petroleum products. Gujarat\u2019s largest city, Ahmedabad, a dusty, traffic-choked metropolis of six million people, is home to factories that produce plastics, from packaging materials to the film covering greenhouses.Many of the necessary petroleum products have risen in price by as much as 35 percent. At the same time, a glut of plastics factories worldwide has prevented producers from raising prices, hurting profit margins.\u201cWe are very much affected,\u201d said Jigish Doshi, president of the Plastindia Foundation, an alliance of plastic industry trade groups that collectively represent more than 50,000 plastics companies across India.Mr. Doshi\u2019s own company, the Vishakha Group, makes plastic pipes used for irrigation. The fall in the rupee has lifted the cost of the raw materials by 15 percent over the last year. \u201cWe are slowing our production,\u201d he said.Gujarat is also a major source of dyes used for coloring textiles and plastic household goods. The fall in the rupee has supplied Indian exporters a competitive advantage, reducing the price of their wares in dollar terms.So has the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods. Indian companies are gaining orders from American manufacturers seeking alternatives to Chinese suppliers, said Bipin Patel, a director at Jay Chemical Industries Ltd., which operates four dye-making factories in Ahmedabad and exports to some 75 countries.But the raw materials used to make dyes have risen in price, cutting Jay Chemical\u2019s profit margin in half. That trend may still be unfolding.\u201cThe rupee is unsustainable,\u201d said Sebastian Morris, an economist at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. \u201cIt can fall quite a bit more.\u201dAt a Mercedes dealership in the center of Ahmedabad, where the most expensive model, the Maybach S 650 sedan, sells for 35 million rupees (more than $486,000), sales staff fret that the weaker rupee has inflated the costs of the vehicles. The top models are imported from factories in Germany.Two blocks away, on a patch of garbage-strewn dirt within view of the dealership\u2019s spinning Mercedes logo, some 600 people live without electricity in shacks fashioned with boards, plastic tarps and sheets of corrugated aluminum. Women scrub pots using water delivered once a day by a municipal tanker. Children pound sticks in the dirt for lack of toys.Most of the families are migrants from villages who survive as so-called ragpickers, earning less than $3 a day as they scour city streets for discarded materials they can sell \u2014 plastic bottles, scraps of paper, pieces of metal.Laxman Gohel, a 38-year-old father of two, saved enough from ragpicking to open a tea shop. He boils water over a charcoal fire, making sales of about 1,500 rupees a day (about $21). But the price of charcoal has more than doubled over the last year, leaving him with perhaps 300 rupees in daily profit. He cannot pass on the costs.\u201cThese poor people cannot pay me more,\u201d he said.Across an alleyway, Shahbaz Ansari, 17, works part time repairing truck tires at his father\u2019s roadside stall. He is in his final year of high school. After graduation, he imagines a job inside an air-conditioned office.Mr. Gohel scoffed. \u201cDo you have money to pay a bribe to get a job?\u201d he said. \u201cNobody gets a job after 12th grade.\u201dEven the children of middle-class homes worry about declining opportunities.As they sipped fresh juice procured from a sidewalk stand, four students enrolled in a three-year college program in business administration expressed fears that the program may not deliver them to their desired management jobs.\u201cThe rupee is falling day by day,\u201d said Vatsal Thakkar, 18. \u201cWages are falling, so I\u2019m thinking about going to Canada.\u201dThirty miles northwest of Ahmedabad in the town of Kadi, the Singh family\u2019s fortunes are firmly tethered to their land.Last year, torrential rains destroyed their cotton cop. This year, an insect infestation has cut it by half.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Singh\u2019s wife, Sonal Ben, stood in the 95-degree heat, pulling puffs of cotton from the plants that have flowered, and depositing them into plastic bags. Mr. Singh will use his tractor to haul the crop to a trader in town.The diesel that fuels his vehicle has increased in price by one-fifth. Yet when he brings his crop to market, he cannot recoup the additional costs.\u201cThe traders decide on the price,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t decide.\u201dThe traders themselves insist they are themselves at the mercy of global forces, accepting whatever price is dictated by commodity pits from New York to S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cNow, we are losing money,\u201d said Prahlad Bhai Patel, owner of a cotton mill in Kadi.Ordinarily, Mr. Patel\u2019s company sells half the product to domestic factories that spin cotton, and exports the other half to China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Pakistan.Lately, he just piles up bales at a loading dock, waiting for better days. The price for his exports is now too low to cover his costs, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Roberts, Leader of Supreme Court\u2019s Conservative Majority, Fights Perception That It Is Partisan", "Date": "2018-12-23", "News": "\u201cWe don\u2019t work as Democrats or Republicans,\u201d he has said, a theme he has returned to while trying to strike a delicate balance as the chief justice.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In his first 13 years on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\u2019s main challenge was trying to assemble five votes to move the court to the right, though there were only four reliably conservative justices.Now he faces a very different problem. With the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and his replacement by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, the chief justice has the votes he needs on issues like abortion, racial discrimination, religion and voting. At the same time, he has taken Justice Kennedy\u2019s place as the swing vote at the court\u2019s ideological center, making him the most powerful chief justice in 80 years.But all of that new power comes at a dangerous time for the court, whose legitimacy depends on the public perception that it is not a partisan institution. \u201cWe don\u2019t work as Democrats or Republicans,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said in 2016, and he reiterated that position in an extraordinary rebuke of President Trump last month.The Trump administration has tested the chief justice with a series of applications and petitions asking the court to ignore its ordinary procedures in cases on issues like the census and climate change. After what has often appeared to be intense behind-the-scenes negotiations, Chief Justice Roberts has so far assembled coalitions that mostly denied the requests, often over the dissents of two or three of his most conservative colleagues.The court\u2019s newest member, Justice Kavanaugh, did not note a dissent in any of those cases, suggesting that he was following Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s lead. That changed on Friday in the asylum case, casting the new dynamic at the court into sharp relief.\u201cIf he\u2019s smart, and he is, what he\u2019s probably thinking is, \u2018I do have a substantive agenda of things I want to accomplish. But it\u2019s a lot easier to do that when the court retains its legitimacy. Let\u2019s do as much as we can get away with, but maybe that\u2019s a little less than some of my colleagues to my right think we can get away with,\u2019\u201d Professor Epps said.Leading the court through an ideological minefield at a time of intense political partisanship will tax the leadership of Chief Justice Roberts, who has earned the respect if not affection of his colleagues during his time as the court\u2019s leader. He is a skilled administrator with a light wit and exceptional legal skills. But some justices say they miss the \u201cold chief\u201d \u2014 Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, his predecessor, who had a knack for not taking himself too seriously.\u201cThey\u2019re probably looking down at me with either bemusement or amazement,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts told C-Span in 2010. \u201cFrom time to time, I find it a useful reminder of the role of the court and the role of the chief justice.\u201dHe has spoken admiringly of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and his deft management of a clash with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It arose in 1937, when Roosevelt, unhappy with Supreme Court decisions striking down his New Deal programs, announced a plan to add justices to the court.\u201cOne of the greatest crises facing the Supreme Court since Marbury v. Madison was F.D.R.\u2019s court-packing plan,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said in 2015 at New York University, \u201cand it fell to Hughes to guide a very unpopular Supreme Court through that high-noon showdown against America\u2019s most popular president since George Washington.\u201d\u201cThere are things to learn from it,\u201d he said, and he has seemed to apply those lessons to a series of clashes with Mr. Trump, who has attacked the very idea of judicial independence.The president seems determined, moreover, to confront and antagonize Chief Justice Roberts, a surprising tactic in light of the chief justice\u2019s conservative roots and respect for executive authority.In response, Chief Justice Roberts has become increasingly more assertive.A week after Justice Kavanaugh took his seat on the court, Chief Justice Roberts made rare public comments on \u201cthe contentious events in Washington of recent weeks,\u201d referring to his new colleague\u2019s brutal confirmation hearings, and then last month publicly tangled with Mr. Trump.After the president responded to an administration loss in a lower court by criticizing the judge who issued it, calling him an \u201cObama judge,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts issued a sharp public statement. He insisted, against the weight of substantial evidence, that \u201cwe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.\u201dPolitical science data refute that assertion, as do the fights over judicial confirmations. Indeed, the most recent battle, over Justice Kavanaugh, damaged the court\u2019s reputation precisely because the court was portrayed as a political prize.Chief Justice Roberts is too smart and too steeped in history to believe that politics plays no role in judicial decision making. But he must view the idea that judging is wholly separate from politics as a useful fiction, a worthy aspiration and, most important, crucial to the court\u2019s standing.He certainly returns to the theme often.\u201cWe do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle,\u201d he said of his colleagues in a speech at the University of Minnesota in October. \u201cWe do not caucus in separate rooms. We do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation.\u201dThe court\u2019s other four Republican appointees \u2014 Justices Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 sent a different message not long after, all attending the annual gala dinner of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group.Enthusiasm among conservatives for the chief justice has tempered since President George W. Bush nominated him in 2005. They point to his two votes to uphold President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and a leftward drift documented by political scientists.In the term that ended in June, for instance, Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s voting record was almost indistinguishable from that of Justice Kennedy.There is no question, however, that Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s voting record has been generally conservative. On issues of racial discrimination, religion, voting and campaign finance, his views are squarely in the mainstream of conservative legal thinking.\u201cI\u2019m not sure why we are there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering while the court, according to the requirements of protocol, has to sit there expressionless, I think, is very troubling.\u201dIt is not as if the Roberts court has not handed the president some victories. In June, Mr. Trump won the biggest case of his presidency so far, when Chief Justice Roberts wrote the majority opinion sustaining the administration\u2019s order limiting travel from several predominantly Muslim countries.But other administration initiatives will soon reach the court, and Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s legacy will be shaped by how he addresses them.He is only 63, but he has already led the Supreme Court for more than a dozen years. His last three predecessors had tenures of between 16 and 19 years, but Chief Justice Roberts is likely to stay in office much longer and to leave a correspondingly larger mark. But he has shown that he is prepared to be patient.\u201cModeration, not just in terms of ideological moderation but also humility, is kind of his thing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe seems to write limited opinions. He doesn\u2019t reach any further than he has to. He clearly distinguishes between what he is doing as a judge and what he might believe in terms of policy.\u201dThe court will have to soon decide whether to hear two sets of cases concerning Trump administration initiatives to revoke protections for unauthorized immigrants brought to the United States as children and to bar transgender people from military service.If the justices decide to hear one or both of the cases, what has so far been a sleepy term would become much more significant. While Chief Justice Roberts may be inclined to avoid politically charged issues and quietly rebuild his court\u2019s authority, it takes only four votes to add a case to its docket.Even if he wants to avoid major controversies for now, his more conservative colleagues may not let him.Advertisement"}

And the government offers subsidies for others to reduce travel costs.But the governing coalition said it planned to overhaul tax breaks for commuters, a benefit that has been available based on the distance traveled and not the mode of transport.This year, Luxembourg budgeted nearly \u20ac900 million in public money for its mass transit system, but recovered around \u20ac30 million in ticket sales, the prime minister\u2019s Democratic Party said in its manifesto. The savings made on selling and controlling tickets could finance some of the cost of free travel, the document added.Free mass transit will be available from the beginning of 2020, said Dany Frank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Mobility.Others pointed out that Luxembourg operated a relatively small network and that the country could be crossed in less than an hour.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Egypt Acquits Democracy Workers in Case That Strained U.S. Ties", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 An Egyptian court acquitted 41 American, European and Egyptian employees of groups that promoted democracy and media freedom on Thursday, bringing an end to a seven-year case that was a thorn in relations with the United States and had become emblematic of the official backlash against civil society following the Arab Spring protests of 2011.\u201cAfter six years of interrogations, court cases, cages, lawyers, and looking over my shoulder I can finally say: it\u2019s over,\u201d Hafsa Halawa, one of those acquitted, wrote on Twitter.Lawyers for the defendants said that 41 of the 43 people convicted in the case were acquitted on Thursday. The other two names appeared to have been overlooked, they said.The acquittal drew attention to the wider crackdown on civil society in Egypt under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has imprisoned journalists and rights activists, muzzled the free press, and introduced harsh laws regulating nongovernmental organizations.The crackdown stems from the events of 2011, when the wave of street protests that ousted President Hosni Mubarak was soon followed by restrictions on civil society. The prosecution late in that year of the American and European democracy groups, as well as the International Center for Journalists, was an early sign of the backlash.By then, many of the accused had already fled Egypt, and the case became a source of tension between Washington and Cairo.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who died in August, campaigned vociferously to have the verdict overturned. The case resurfaced in August 2017 when Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson froze $290 million in aid to Egypt, citing a range of concerns that included rights abuses and the crackdown on civil society.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany also exerted pressure on Mr. Sisi as part an effort to lift a ban on the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Egypt.In December 2017, four months after American aid was suspended, an Egyptian court reopened Case 173, as it is officially known, and in April it was referred to a retrial. Welcoming Thursday\u2019s verdict, Sam LaHood said he hoped it would be \u201cthe first step reversing the damage done by Case 173 to Egypt and her great people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Already an Exception\u2019: Merkel\u2019s Legacy Is Shaped by Migration and Austerity", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOutside, 2,500 protesters shouted: \u201cMerkel must go!\u201d Inside, 120 people \u2014 more polite but scarcely less hostile \u2014 had come to challenge the chancellor on her legacy, which on this November afternoon was mostly reduced to one thing: her 2015 decision to welcome more than a million migrants into Germany.\u201cYou said we would manage,\u201d one man said, quoting Ms. Merkel\u2019s now famous mantra back at her. \u201cBut we\u2019re not managing.\u201dAs Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic Party gathers this week to choose her successor as party leader \u2014 and the likely future chancellor of Germany \u2014 the values she embodied through 13 years in power are in danger. Some now ask whether her leadership, in particular on migration and economic austerity, helped plant the seeds of the forces now tearing Europe apart.Ms. Merkel has pledged to finish out her term, which ends in 2021. But even if she defies the political obituary writers, the time in between is likely to be less than a victory lap for a chancellor who has been the face of stability in Germany and Europe, for better or worse.\u201cI know my face is polarizing,\u201d Ms. Merkel conceded in Chemnitz. That is true in Athens, Budapest and Rome as well.Ms. Merkel has been both chancellor of Germany and the leader of Europe. She steered her country and the continent through successive crises as she helped Germany become Europe\u2019s leading power for the first time since two world wars.Ms. Merkel allowed Germans to be proud again, but on her watch the old demons of nationalism stirred back to life, too. The European Union she fought so hard to preserve is assailed by populist leaders.Those contradictions rest at the core of the Merkel legacy. As German chancellor, Ms. Merkel oversaw a golden decade for Europe\u2019s largest economy, which expanded by more than a fifth, pushing unemployment to the lowest levels since the early 1980s.As the United States was distracted by multiple wars, Britain gambled its future on a referendum to leave the European Union and France failed to reform itself, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Germany was mostly a haven of stability.But her decision to embrace more than a million asylum seekers unsettled that cozy status quo. Outside Germany, the austerity she and her longtime finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble imposed on debtor countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and, especially, Greece sowed misery and resentment that fester to this day.Some, like the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, compare Ms. Merkel\u2019s austerity politics to the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed punitive economic measures on Germany after World War I, humiliated the country and fanned the flames of populism.\u201cThis is now what is feeding the political beasts,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said.Ms. Merkel\u2019s legacy is more fragile.She gave power a female face, and some say she softened politics and made it easier for her country to resume its historic dominance in Europe. She was careful never to boast about what had been regained. But she also failed to instill in her people a sense of responsibility and solidarity for fellow Europeans.Her modest and moderate governance style, absent ideology and vanity, is the polar opposite of that of the strongmen now strutting the world stage. Her Germany \u2014 that \u201cvulnerable hegemon,\u201d as the intellectual Herfried M\u00fcnkler calls it \u2014 became a beacon of liberalism.But like her friend and ally President Barack Obama \u2014 America\u2019s first black president, who was succeeded by President Trump \u2014 Ms. Merkel will be judged by what comes next.\u201cAngela Merkel personifies the best Germany we\u2019ve ever known,\u201d said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European Studies at Oxford University. \u201cShe managed Germany\u2019s rise to once again become Europe\u2019s leading power. But she failed to prepare Germans sufficiently for what that means.\u201dOn a sunny afternoon in June 2006, Ms. Merkel was standing at the window of the chancellery in Berlin, waving to the crowd of soccer fans below who were making their way to a gigantic outdoor screen.An avid soccer fan herself, she had been chancellor for only seven months when Germany hosted the men\u2019s soccer World Cup \u2014 and when, across the country, German flags began fluttering proudly from car mirrors and apartment windows.The German team came third that year. But the tournament soon entered folk memory as \u201cthe summer fairy tale\u201d \u2014 the rebirth of a liberal German patriotism in a country where national pride had long been taboo.\u201cThat fledgling national pride that had been kept down for so long was allowed to come out, because at the very top was someone who was incredibly sensitive,\u201d said Evelyn Roll, one of Ms. Merkel\u2019s biographers.Or as Ines Pohl, the editor in chief of the public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, put it: \u201cAngela Merkel allowed Germans to be proud again.\u201dMs. Merkel has never been one for rousing speeches. (\u201cWe had those kinds of speeches 70 years ago,\u201d Ms. Roll said. \u201cHer lack of talent and interest in this department was a good thing.\u201d)She never boasted that Germany got what it wanted after summit meetings (though it mostly did). But as exports and domestic demand boomed, Germany prospered and so did Ms. Merkel\u2019s popularity ratings.Some say her status as a double outsider \u2014 a woman who had grown up in the East succeeding in a world of Western, mostly male politicians \u2014 ultimately changed Germany.Gregor Gysi, a fellow Easterner and political opponent from the Left party, said that spending half her life under Communism gave her a visceral thirst for freedom \u2014 but also made her more socially conscious than other Western conservatives.Over the decade that followed, she nudged her country and her conservative party to the left: New parents obtained generous new benefits, nuclear power was abandoned and same-sex marriage became legal.\u201cMerkel knows a different form of social and societal equality,\u201d Mr. Gysi said, adding of her former center-left rivals: \u201cThat made her so much more open to adopting ideas from the Social Democrats.\u201dIt helped that she could be an incredibly skilled, even ruthless, tactician.\u201cI know something about coalition politics,\u201d an aide to David Cameron recalled her telling Britain\u2019s then prime minister in 2010, when he entered a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, but your junior partner will be destroyed.\u201dIndeed, now in the third so-called grand coalition with the Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel\u2019s habit of taking inspiration from (and credit for) their ideas has left the party a shadow of itself.It has also opened her own party to challenges on its right flank, leaving room for the emergence of the nationalist Alternative for Germany, which capitalized on her decision on asylum seekers.Nine years after the 2006 World Cup, Germany\u2019s summer fairy tale had a short-lived sequel.Ms. Merkel\u2019s own image as the austerity chancellor had troubled her, she told her biographer Stefan Kornelius. In the throes of the migrant crisis, she showed neighboring countries a more generous Germany. It was a moment of redemption for her nation.The French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and his British counterpart Margaret Thatcher had both worried about a resurgence of \u201cbad Germans.\u201d Ms. Merkel\u2019s greatest achievement, Ms. Roll said, was that \u201cshe came to represent the good Germans.\u201dHer 2015 decision won her admiration from far beyond her own political camp.\u201cIn this world where more and more walls are being built, literally, she did the right thing,\u201d said Claudia Roth, vice president of the German parliament and a member of the Greens. \u2018\u2018She had principles.\u201d\u201cIt won Germany incredible respect \u2014 this image of a friendly humanitarian Germany, a Germany that protects,\u201d Ms. Roth said. \u201cShe marked that image.\u201dThree years later, the party is the third largest in the federal parliament and sits in all regional parliaments, too.\u201cGerman populism is perhaps not her child,\u201d said Henrik Enderlein, the dean of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. \u201cBut it is a child of the Merkel era.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s decision on migration was the most defining moment of her chancellorship. It softened her image. But in her immediate neighborhood, coming deep in a lost economic decade, it did not quite have the healing effect she intended.To some, it cemented her reputation as dictating terms to the rest of a reluctant Europe, particularly in a south that had borne the brunt of the continent\u2019s dual economic and migration crises.Even before the migration crisis arrived, the debt crisis provided a pivotal test for a chancellor at the helm of a newly dominant Germany.And it led to criticism that Ms. Merkel, while leading humbly, was no less the hegemon \u2014 prioritizing German interests; manipulating European Union institutions to Germany\u2019s abiding benefit; turning southern countries into captive export markets; tightening the hold of German banks.Was hers a European Germany, one that saw Europe\u2019s interests as its own? Or a Germany that ultimately wanted a German Europe?Many economists, and even Mr. Obama, called for looser policies, but Ms. Merkel held firm. The debate still rages over whether greater flexibility would have restored growth faster, as her critics contend, or whether fiscal restraint was needed to safeguard the euro currency, as Ms. Merkel and her supporters argued.The real missed opportunity, observers say, was to use the crisis to propel a more far-reaching build-out of European Union institutions, which remain unprepared for the next financial meltdown.If there was ever a time to make a bold push to complete the institutions of the eurozone, this was it, said Joschka Fischer, a former German foreign minister.\u201cAn Adenauer or a Kohl would have done it,\u201d Mr. Fischer said. But Merkel, who had grown up behind the Iron Curtain and without the Western pro-European mind-set, \u201cwasn\u2019t there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cHer European conscience was not fully formed yet.\u201dThe absence of vision at that time is \u201cthe biggest minus on her record,\u201d said Mr. Garton Ash, of Oxford.But if Ms. Merkel\u2019s upbringing meant that her European consciousness took longer to form, it perhaps made her bolder in other areas, like standing up to Russia and Mr. Trump, as well as her decision not to close Germany\u2019s borders to migrants.\u201cOf course you can build walls,\u2019\u2019 said Gerald Knaus, the founding chairman of the European Stability Initiative, who has advised Ms. Merkel on migration for over a decade.\u201cBut she always made clear: \u2018I don\u2019t build deadly walls,\u2019 \u201d he recalled her saying. \u201cShe grew up behind one.\u201dOne early verdict on Ms. Merkel\u2019s legacy will be pronounced on Friday, when delegates of her Christian Democrats gather at a party congress in Hamburg and vote for a new party leader.\u201cIf A.K.K. succeeds Merkel, it would be her masterpiece \u2014 another woman, confident, unpretentious, who continues her liberal course,\u201d Mr. Knaus said.In Germany, too, politics has become noisier and nastier. Open sexism has entered the chamber with Alternative for Germany, said Ms. Roth, the vice president of the parliament.\u201cMerkel has been the target of countless attacks, gendered attacks, sexualized dirt,\u201d Ms. Roth said.\u201cShe is the enemy, and the way she has been personally attacked as a woman is awful,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would not happen to a white man. And still, she remains upright, chin raised, and keeps working.\u201dSome have begun to referring to Merkelism, a modest but steadfast liberalism built on consensus rather than confrontation, as a recipe for democratic governance in the 21st century. Others fear that Merkelism will disappear with her.\u201cShe is so unvain that she does not overly care about leaving behind a blueprint for the West 4.0,\u201d said Mr. Kornelius, her biographer. \u201cShe primarily wants to preserve what she can.\u201dShe has prevented crises rather than carried out visions, Mr. Kornelius said, and has been reactive rather than proactive. \u201cBut that is incredibly valuable at a time when we are dealing with questions of our liberal order in an unraveling world \u2014 and with leaders like Donald Trump.\u201dTo her fans she is a reminder of a time when liberal democracy was expanding across the world.Today, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Germany can feel like a liberal island in a growing sea of illiberal forces. She has not changed \u2014 the world around her has.\u201cShe is already an exception today,\u201d Mr. Knaus said. \u201cI hope she is not a relic of an era that is coming to an end.\u201dEven some of her fiercest enemies look with trepidation to a future without her.\u201cShe was a catastrophe,\u201d said Mr. Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, \u201cand she will be missed, because who comes next will certainly be worse.\u201dChristopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting from Berlin, and Jason Horowitz from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bush and McCain Were Linked by a Fading Concept: Duty and Honor", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 In the aftermath of his 1992 defeat to Bill Clinton, then-President George Bush complained bitterly in a letter to his brother Jonathan about how he had been portrayed in the campaign that ended his long career in politics.\u201cI guess what I hate the most is the charge by the liberals in the media that I never stood for anything,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote, citing \u201ceducation, home ownership, points of light, less regulation, less taxes, etc.\u201dYet Mr. Bush\u2019s passing reference to policy issues, which he put in parentheses, was quickly followed by a more convincing summation of what drew him to public office. \u201cWhat I want to have people know I stood for were \u2018Duty, Honor, Country,\u2019 and, yes, as Dad taught us, \u2018service.\u2019\u201dThe deaths this year of Mr. Bush and Senator John McCain have been described as the passing of an era, the demise of pragmatic Republicanism. But neither of the two onetime naval aviators was anchored in ideology, veering between moderation and conservatism depending on the political needs of the moment.What has seemingly been lost with Mr. Bush\u2019s burial Thursday in College Station, Tex., and Mr. McCain\u2019s in Annapolis, Md., in September is what could be called the \u201cDuty, Honor, Country\u201d Party.Service itself, not any sweeping agenda, was the aim of this class of officeholders. And accommodations on issues were often made (and as often regretted) in order to win or stay in office.Born before the baby boom generation, these lawmakers were forged by the Great Depression, World War II and a Cold War consensus politics underpinned by the idea that there were far greater threats than the opposing party. They also came of age at a time when military service was common; wartime bonds and shared cultural touchstones often trumped partisan differences; and zeal was not required for elected office.\u201cThat\u2019s what the voters wanted at the time,\u201d said David Boren, the former Oklahoma governor and senator who was first elected to office the same year as Mr. Bush: 1966. \u201cThey wanted moderate people who\u2019d reach across the aisle and find the best solution.\u201dOf course, the driving force propelling these politicians was not only a high-minded ethos of public spiritedness: Ambition, ego and paternalism were also at work.But while Mr. Bush was rooted in the Eastern elite and Mr. McCain hailed from a storied military family, this era of leaders was not all to the manner born. Former Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Bob Dole \u2014 the former a son of a Japanese immigrant and the latter a son of the Kansas plains, who first met in a military hospital after being wounded in World War II \u2014 were both archetypes of this period and were hardly imbued with noblesse oblige.They were stewards of the country, and that was the point.\u201cThey both believed that when you were elected to public office, your first responsibility was to solve the problems that come in your inbox,\u201d Mark Salter, Mr. McCain\u2019s longtime chief of staff, said of the senator and the 41st president, citing their principles but \u201clack of ideological rigidity.\u201dWhile both were committed internationalists, Mr. McCain more hawkish than Mr. Bush, the two demonstrated more flexibility on issues at home.Mr. Bush first ran to the right as an unsuccessful Senate candidate in 1964, but regretted his pandering on race and returned to the center in his winning House bid two years later. And while he dismissed what he called \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d as a presidential candidate in 1980, he eagerly signed on to supply-side economics as Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice president \u2014 before raising taxes when he was president himself.He also signed the Americans With Disabilities Act, which made life easier for millions but created a new regulatory regime.Mr. McCain was elected to the House in 1982 as a self-declared Reagan conservative and largely remained in that mold until a brush with the savings and loan scandal in the late 1980s inspired him to become a champion of campaign finance reform. That crusade led him toward a greater willingness to confront his own party, and he ran to the left of George W. Bush in the 2000 primary before occupying a similar place on domestic issues during the younger Mr. Bush\u2019s presidency.But Mr. McCain softened his support for an immigration overhaul in the 2008 presidential primary and then ratcheted up his rhetoric on border security to survive a 2010 Senate primary. And like the elder Mr. Bush, he regretted some of the concessions he made in the service of politics, notably his refusal to condemn the flying of the Confederate flag over the South Carolina Capitol and his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, rather than his close friend Joseph I. Lieberman.Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain would ultimately leave little doubt about their contempt for the interest-group politics that would come to dominate their party, even after bowing to it at times.\u201cThey both had an understanding that politics was something that\u2019s imperfect but the idea was that you do the best you can and the most important thing is that you govern and work things out,\u201d said former Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican who served with Mr. McCain while Mr. Bush was vice president and president.Mr. Danforth invoked the comity (and bonhomie) of this era by recalling that, immediately after Mr. Bush was inaugurated, he offered an impromptu nod toward his old colleague Dan Rostenkowski, the legendary former chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means.\u201cHe was saying, \u2018I was your friend in the House, I\u2019m still your friend and we\u2019re going to do stuff together,\u2019\u201d Mr. Danforth said.Similarly, Mr. McCain entered the Senate in 1987 enjoying deep friendships that he had formed as Navy liaison to the chamber a decade earlier. His Democratic colleagues Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Gary Hart both participated in his funeral services this year.But these are different times.\u201cWe rolled up the Soviets and didn\u2019t have World War III,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a onetime adviser to Mr. McCain. \u201cSo without scary Russians, Sputnik and proxy wars, the big work was done and all the energy turned to domestic squabbles. The baby boom generation never had to land on Anzio Beach.\u201dThose domestic squabbles \u2014 over issues like abortion, gay rights and gun control \u2014 are not all incidental. And there is broader representation now than in a period dominated by white men.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t turn back time,\u201d said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who twice sought the presidency in the same era that the political careers of Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush took flight.Mr. Jackson noted that there were no black senators and fewer than 20 African-Americans in the House in that era. \u201cThis is the best America has ever been, today,\u201d he said.Or as Kate Bolz, a social worker and state legislator from Nebraska put it, \u201cYes, there\u2019s polarization, but we are starting to see more people of more diverse viewpoints speaking up, engaging and talking about things.\u201dThe question is whether there will again be a generation of ambitious, if more diverse, politicians bonded by common purpose and the sense of duty that military and other forms of service can inspire. All the World War II veterans are gone from the Senate, and there is only a single Vietnam veteran left.Some in the capital take hope in the swelling ranks in Congress of those who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, a bipartisan group that includes 16 new lawmakers and which may feel devotion to a more unified cause \u2014 and may be more willing to resist the temptations of today\u2019s partisan wars.These lawmakers are the ones who are the most likely to live by the credo of their forebears, said former Senator John Warner of Virginia, a veteran of World War II and Korea whose voice remains strong at nearly 92.\u201cThe day we pull off civilian clothes and put on the uniform, they tattoo on our hearts three words: duty, honor, country,\u201d said Mr. Warner.Advertisement"}

Two hundred miles apart, the cities anchored metropolitan areas of just under one million people each and had a similar number of jobs paying similar wages.Not anymore. The population of the Nashville area has roughly doubled, and young people have flocked there, drawn by high-paying jobs as much as its hip \u201cMusic City\u201d reputation. Last month, the city won an important consolation prize in the competition for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters: an operations center that will eventually employ 5,000 people at salaries averaging $150,000 a year.Birmingham, by comparison, has steadily lost population, and while its suburbs have expanded, their growth has lagged the Nashville area\u2019s. Once-narrow gaps in education and income have widened, and important employers like SouthTrust and Saks have moved their headquarters. Birmingham tried to lure Amazon, too, but all it is getting from the online retail giant is a warehouse and a distribution center where many jobs will pay about $15 an hour.Nashville and the other Amazon also-rans, like Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis, are thriving because of a combination of luck, astute political choices and well-timed investments. At the same time, Birmingham and cities like it, including Providence, R.I., and Rochester, are falling further behind.Last week, for example, Apple said it would invest $1 billion in Austin, Tex., and could eventually employ 15,000 people in the area, up from 6,000 now. Like Nashville, Austin is a booming state capital with a prominent university and it has a lively music scene.Nashville started with advantages. But local leaders also made some smart decisions like merging the city and county government in the 1960s, allowing Nashville and its suburbs to work together rather than at cross-purposes. And in the 1990s, when many downtowns across the county were struggling, the city built a convention center, a hockey arena and a new home for the Country Music Hall of Fame.By contrast, economic misfortune and poor choices have hobbled Birmingham. Once a center of steel production, the city suffered when that industry declined in the 1980s because of foreign competition and corporate bankruptcies. Local leaders tried to pivot by luring banks and insurers, but that bet soured during the financial crisis, and the city hasn\u2019t recovered the jobs it lost then.\u201cA place like Birmingham hasn\u2019t fallen off the map, but it\u2019s been bypassed by these places that have moved into this more clearly defined second tier,\u201d said Adam Kamins, an economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s treading water, and treading water tends to not be enough.\u201dAsk Ralph Schulz, president of Nashville\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, why this city has done so well and he begins with the Civil War. Nashville surrendered early, allowing it to avoid the destruction that befell many Southern cities. Union troops used the city as a logistics hub, which laid the groundwork for its postwar economy.Nashville stood apart in other ways, too. The city was less dependent on manufacturing, in part because being Tennessee\u2019s capital brought lucrative \u2014 and relatively recession-proof \u2014 public investments. Its colleges and universities, anchored by Vanderbilt University, earned it a reputation as the \u201cAthens of the South.\u201dThe music business, which grew out of a 19th-century publishing industry, gave the city an international reputation, while the growth of Hospital Corporation of America in the 20th century turned the city into a health care hub.As a result, Nashville had a diversified economy and an educated work force that left it well positioned for the 21st century. But success wasn\u2019t inevitable. As recently as the 1990s, the city was portrayed as a backwater on the variety show \u201cHee Haw.\u201dRonald L. Samuels, a local banker and civic leader, recalled being asked about Graceland \u2014 which is in Memphis \u2014 when visiting New York with the Chamber of Commerce in the 1980s.\u201cWe had to answer the \u2018Where\u2019s Nashville?\u2019 question many times,\u201d Mr. Samuels said.Beginning in the early 1990s, though, political, business and nonprofit leaders tried to promote Nashville. State and local leaders adopted a regional approach to economic development to recruit companies such as Bridgestone, Nissan and UBS. Tennessee overhauled its community college system and work force development efforts to align better with the jobs being created.Starting under Mayor Phil Bredesen, who later became Tennessee\u2019s governor, the city invested in big projects that helped revive downtown, a key part of the city\u2019s success.Economists disagree about what policies are most effective at helping cities grow \u2014 or if policies matter much. Some, such as Michael Porter of Harvard and Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, have emphasized the importance of cultivating a \u201ccreative class\u201d of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. Others, such as Jan Rivkin of Harvard, stress the importance of civic leadership. Pretty much everyone agrees that having an elite university is a big advantage.Whatever the exact ingredients, Nashville hit on a winning recipe. The urban renewal that began under Mr. Bredesen turned into a boom after the Great Recession, which, thanks to Nashville\u2019s diverse mix of industries, was comparatively mild here. The Gulch, a former rail yard and industrial district, was transformed into a vibrant neighborhood full of hip bars, luxury condominiums and boutique hotels.Tourism took off, thanks in part to the ABC television country-music drama \u201cNashville.\u201d Some of those tourists stuck around: The number of college graduates younger than 35 nearly doubled over a decade, to 155,000 by 2017.Employers soon followed. Among them are Eventbrite, a San Francisco tech company, and EY, the accounting firm, which last month announced plans to open an office downtown for 600 workers. AllianceBernstein, an investment company, decided in May to move its headquarters to Nashville, from New York, in part because of the big-city-worthy cultural amenities and the small-city cost of living.The company has been flooded with calls from finance industry workers interested in moving to Nashville, said Karl Sprules, an AllianceBernstein executive who is helping lead the transition.In recent decades, the most successful cities have achieved a kind of economic gravity drawing the best jobs and most talented workers. That\u2019s why few economists were surprised when Amazon chose New York and the Washington area for its big expansion.But the effect isn\u2019t limited to a few urban giants. Mark Muro, who researches cities for the Brookings Institution, likened it to a fractal pattern: Look past the top cities and there is another layer of inequality. \u201cNashville is not a superstar, but it\u2019s at the top end of this next echelon,\u201d Mr. Muro said.The success of the superstars and the substars like Nashville has come at the expense of Birmingham and other smaller cities.Birmingham\u2019s great boom arrived a century before Nashville\u2019s, when the region\u2019s iron and mineral deposits helped it become one of the nation\u2019s largest steel producers. But as the steel industry declined across the country, Birmingham struggled to find a replacement.But Birmingham also has some significant assets. It has a research university, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with a top-flight medical school and hospital. Research conducted at the university has helped fuel a budding start-up scene, and an affiliated incubator in a former Sears store, Innovation Depot, is home to more than 100 new companies.Last year, the city elected a young mayor, Randall Woodfin, who has put economic development at the center of his agenda. He has created a Neighborhood Revitalization Fund to fix up homes and demolish dilapidated structures, and wants to use business tax incentives to help lift wages, not just create jobs.\u201cAs a midsize city, we have to be very intentional about diversifying our economy,\u201d Mr. Woodfin said. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting on Amazon or some other company to come in and save Birmingham.\u201dThe question for city leaders is whether they can overcome the economic forces driving inequality among cities.Birmingham\u2019s work force is also less educated than the work forces in other cities of comparable size, and its schools aren\u2019t training workers with the skills they need, the report concluded.Mr. Woodfin faces another challenge: Instead of collaborating, cities and towns in the area often compete against one another. Birmingham proper accounts for just a third of the population of Jefferson County, with cities frequently offering multimillion-dollar tax incentives to lure businesses across town lines.Mr. Sher would like Birmingham to follow Nashville in merging the city and county governments. He noted that Louisville, Ky., saw substantial growth after it did that in 2003.But even as some look to Nashville as an example, they want to avoid repeating its mistakes. Nashville\u2019s boom has brought congestion and soaring housing costs, making the city unaffordable for many longtime residents, particularly African-Americans.\u201cWhat is the policy, other than growth?\u201d asked Paulette Coleman, a local affordable-housing activist. \u201cIf economic growth is only benefiting a small percentage, you just keep getting these widening disparities.\u201dThose concerns raise questions about Nashville\u2019s future. The city has thrived in part by being an affordable alternative to New York and Atlanta. It may soon have to compete with them directly by trying to become a superstar in its own right.In Birmingham, Mayor Woodfin said the city must follow a different path.\u201cI am 100 percent convinced we do not have to be the next Nashville or the next Austin or the next Charlotte,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be the best Birmingham.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conglomerates Will Never Die", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsMarkets can be a costly business. Ronald Coase won a Nobel Prize in economics in 1991 for pointing that out. He said that companies are created to save on transaction costs, and, according to one interpretation, the savings are often large enough to justify pulling together quite diverse businesses.Problems at General Electric and the breakup of United Technologies show why that analysis is only partly right.If the best deal were always the one available in the market right now, the world would look rather different. Companies would rent labor and working space every day. In reality, the cost of constantly negotiating contracts often exceeds the gains from getting the best price on demand. Businesses scale up because they can spread their research, legal and management skills more widely. Bigger firms also save by bulk borrowing and through better tax management.Mr. Coase, like most economists, purposely oversimplified human nature. Normal people could simply say that bigger teams that do many things often work better than smaller, specialized ones. They might call it a cooperation benefit or, being a little more technical, economies of multiple scales.The gains are often subtle. It is hard to measure the value added by the cross-fertilization of ideas, the deepening of a long-term employee\u2019s professional skills, the ready availability of loyal experts and the flexibility on opening and closing businesses. It is even harder to count up the losses sidestepped by having to deal with fewer untrustworthy outsiders and of not being deprived of credit in tough times.Still, those gains are big enough that many have pursued them successfully. The different enterprises of the Japanese zaibatsu, the Korean chaebol and Turkish and Indian groups such as Koc and Tata have profited by working together both formally and informally. The gains of staying close are often especially large in developing economies, where credit, trust, expertise and good government relations are all very costly, if they can be purchased at all.It can work in developed economies too. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway and many private equity groups claim that excellence is spreadable across many product lines. Consumer goods giants like Unilever and Procter & Gamble are essentially built on Mr. Coase\u2019s premise: Paper towels and toothpaste, two product lines at P&G, may seem to have little in common, but there can be synergies in marketing, distribution and competence.Then there are times when Coase-advantages go stale. The American conglomerate United Technologies said on Nov. 26 that it was breaking into three parts after considerable pressure from activist investors, and would spin off its elevator and building parts divisions to shareholders.G.E. provides another example. In the company\u2019s early decades, it gained greatly from spreading its electric expertise over everything from light bulbs and radios to power plants and locomotives. Managers also kept finding synergies in building up related businesses, eventually including health care, plastics and financing.But by the 1980s, the product synergies were fading. Jack Welch, then the chief executive, decided that G.E.\u2019s main Coase-advantage was management expertise. He thought that brilliant buying and selling of companies, regular culls of weak executives and a shared focus on perfection in design and execution would allow the company to expand simultaneously in many businesses, including finance.Mr. Welch was lauded at the time, but he was deeply wrong, especially about finance. The failures of G.E. Capital have deeply wounded the enterprise. G.E.\u2019s market capitalization was well over $500 billion in 2000 \u2014 now, after multiple losses, write downs and divestments, it is less than $70 billion.At least Mr. Welch has company. Efforts to profit from lower frictional financial costs \u2014 whether from raising money, managing risks or pleasing investors \u2014 have poisoned many companies, including a collection of conglomerates. For example, back in the 1970s the quest for savings from buying companies with expensive stock and cheap debt first fueled and then felled such enterprises as ITT and Gulf & Western. More recently, Enron and Tyco suffered because aggressive financing multiplied the damage from vastly overestimating the gains from low-friction management.Stories of conglomerate failure can give the wrong impression. While dreams of financial riches seem to deprive many managers of their common sense, the Coase-effect is crucial to the success of modern economies. Without the ability to bring disparate businesses and skills together, costs in most firms would be higher, revenues lower and many new and improved products would never have been created.All big companies have something of the conglomerate about them, because they do many things. Corporate fashions come and go, and managers of companies like G.E. may fall prey to stultifying complexity and financial overreach. But Mr. Coase was right enough about costs. Diversified enterprises, by one name or another, will play a big role in the business world for a long time.Advertisement"}

Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch. Neither of the court\u2019s other conservatives \u2014 Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 proved willing to supply a fourth vote.That split on the right side of the court is evidence that Chief Justice Roberts is trying to keep the court out of major controversies and that Justice Kavanaugh, who joined the court in October after a fierce confirmation battle, is, for now at least, following his lead.\u201cWhat explains the court\u2019s refusal to do its job here?\u201d Justice Thomas wrote. \u201cI suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named \u2018Planned Parenthood.\u2019\u201dBut, he said, the cases are not about abortion rights, but only about whether individuals may sue to challenge decisions by states to withdraw funding from Planned Parenthood clinics.\u201cResolving the question presented here would not even affect Planned Parenthood\u2019s ability to challenge the states\u2019 decisions; it concerns only the rights of individual Medicaid patients to bring their own suits,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote.That issue warranted the court\u2019s attention, Justice Thomas wrote.\u201cThis question is important and recurring,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAround 70 million Americans are on Medicaid, and the question presented directly affects their rights. If the majority of the courts of appeals are correct, then Medicaid patients could sue when, for example, a state removes their doctor as a Medicaid provider or inadequately reimburses their provider.\u201dThough the general legal question of who may challenge funding decisions has no particular political implications, recent cases have involved efforts by state officials opposed to abortion to cut off payments to Planned Parenthood clinics.In letting stand two decisions allowing patients to challenge state funding determinations, the Supreme Court effectively sided with Planned Parenthood.\u201cStates may not terminate providers from their Medicaid program for any reason they see fit, especially when that reason is unrelated to the provider\u2019s competence and the quality of the health care it provides,\u201d Judge Gregory A. Phillips wrote for a divided three-judge panel.Lawyers for Kansas had urged the justices to resolve the dispute.\u201cIt would be wrong to assume that Medicaid recipients \u2014 some of the poorest members of our society \u2014 are enthusiastic about the prospect of bringing lawsuits against states,\u201d their brief said. \u201cThey would much prefer that states just follow the rules and allow them to obtain health care from qualified and willing providers.\u201dThe Supreme Court also declined to hear a companion case from Louisiana, Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, No. 17-1492.The law says burglaries are violent felonies that can require longer sentences. But it does not specify what qualifies as a burglary.The Supreme Court has said the crime requires invasion of \u201ca building or structure.\u201d But the defendants in the two cases \u2014 Victor Stitt of Tennessee and Jason Sims of Arkansas \u2014 were convicted under state laws that allow prosecutions of burglaries of mobile homes and other vehicles in which people sleep.That same rationale, Justice Breyer wrote, applies to mobile structures. \u201cAn offender who breaks into a mobile home, an RV, a camping tent, a vehicle or another structure that is adapted for or customarily used for lodging runs a similar or greater risk of violent confrontation,\u201d he wrote.It did not matter, Justice Breyer added, that some structures are occupied only occasionally. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca burglary is no less a burglary because it took place at a summer home during the winter, or a commercial building during a holiday.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And, he said, Mr. Trump knew it was wrong at the time, too.\u201cOf course,\u201d Mr. Cohen, the president\u2019s former personal lawyer, said when asked by the ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos whether the president was fully aware of what he was doing when Mr. Cohen made the payments.\u201cI am angry at myself because I knew what I was doing was wrong,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, his eyes swollen and purple, but he said he had come to terms with the value of telling the truth.\u201cI am done with the lying,\u201d he said. \u201cI am done being loyal to President Trump.\u201dWhile Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal troubles may have reached a resolution, he could continue to cause problems for Mr. Trump.At one point in the interview, Mr. Stephanopoulos asked if Mr. Trump\u2019s denial that he had ordered him to make the payments was true.\u201cIt is absolutely not true,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in the ABC interview. \u201cUnder no circumstances do I want to embarrass the president.\u201dMr. Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump, said he had been loyal \u201cto someone who truthfully does not deserve loyalty.\u201d\u201cOne of the hopes that I have out of the punishment that I\u2019ve received,\u201d he added, \u201cas well as the cooperation that I have given, I will be remembered in history as helping to bring this country back together.\u201dMr. Cohen, who began working for the Trump Organization in 2007, said that the Donald Trump of today was not the same person he once knew.\u201cIt was just a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI will tell you that the gentleman that is sitting now in the Oval Office \u2014 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 is not the Donald Trump that I remember from Trump Tower.\u201dOne possible reason, he added, is that the pressure of the job is much more than what he thought it was going to be.Mr. Cohen said that he now saw himself as the person tasked by fate with helping the country.\u201cIt\u2019s never good to be on the wrong side of the president of the United States of America, but somehow or another this task has now fallen onto my shoulders,\u201d he said, then added, \u201cI will spend the rest of my life in order to fix the mistake that I made.\u201dAsked about Mr. Cohen\u2019s remarks on Friday, Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said the news media was \u201cgiving credence to someone who\u2019s a convicted, self-admitted liar.\u201dJim Rutenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Which Will Win Out in 2019?", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoves like Mnuchin\u2019s phone calls to bank C.E.O.s could create a broader crisis of confidence.Sometime in the last couple of months, predictions of a major economic downturn or recession in 2019 went from being a crank view to the conventional wisdom.The real risk is not that insurmountable challenges knock the economy off course. It is that poor leadership converts moderate economic shocks into a crisis.It was the kind of disclosure that risked causing more damage than it was intended to prevent. If a top health official announced that he had convened conversations with top pharmaceutical C.E.O.s and was pleased to learn there were no drug shortages, your first response would not be relief but to ask, \u201cWait, we need to worry about drug shortages?\u201dIt all raises the possibility that if things do get worse, the United States government will be an agent of chaos rather than the source of steadiness and calm it is normally known for during crises.It is a lack of confidence in global leadership that explains this paradox: an economy that is doing this well and yet widespread conviction that things are about to turn bad.The most concrete warning signal is coming from financial markets. But the bond market is generally more closely tethered to economic ups and downs than the stock market, and while it is suggesting slower growth ahead, it is not at recessionary levels.At this point in December 2007, which we now know was the beginning of the Great Recession, the Fed\u2019s target interest rate was 4.25 percent. But the bond market was already pricing in more cuts in the years ahead, with the two-year yield ending the year at 3.12 percent.Most economic and financial indicators are not pointing toward some economic collapse in 2019, but rather to a return to the kind of moderate economic growth that was completely normal from 2010 to 2017.In this story, 2018 has been the aberration \u2014 fueled by a commodity boom and the temporary effects of tax cuts. To the degree there is a market correction and adjustment in business sentiment, it is about realizing that we\u2019re returning to the old new normal.There are some rumblings of things that could go wrong in the financial system. Companies that loaded up during the era of ultralow interest rates are facing high debt burdens. Some may find themselves in bankruptcy. Oil prices have fallen enough that it seems it will be a tough 2019 in energy-producing areas. But the biggest worry for 2019 is not so much that any of these disruptions proves so large as to cause a recession. The real fear is that shaky policy allows small shocks to create a broader crisis of confidence.Beyond the attacks on the Fed and odd communication from the Treasury, there are other risks from Washington. Further escalation of the trade war \u2014 including into the economically consequential automobile industry \u2014 remains a distinct possibility. Divided government could lead to paralysis.It is quite a contrast with the 2008 crisis, when the United States government was stocked with highly experienced economic policymakers and a president who trusted their judgment, when no one had heard of Brexit, and when a trade war seemed unfathomable.It was a key moment in ending the 2008 crisis. Given geopolitical developments since, it is hard to imagine that harmony happening today. It\u2019s easier to imagine conflicting signals and an every-nation-for-itself breakdown of communication.But we\u2019re not there yet. And throughout the expansion of the last nine-plus years, the United States economy has proved stubbornly resilient to challenges, whether the chaos of the eurozone crisis in 2010 or a commodity collapse in 2015.The question is which will prove more important, the economic fundamentals or leadership. And to be an economic optimist means counting on the fundamentals to prevail.Advertisement"}

The final product does explore the plight of the country\u2019s First Nations, but it does so through the defensive gaze of a white artist who can\u2019t resist telling us that he, too, has been victimized.The characters allow Mr. Lepage to touch on several issues that have affected Canada\u2019s Indigenous people: the large number of missing and murdered Indigenous women; the prevalence of substance abuse; and the forcible removal of Indigenous children from their communities, a practice that continued until the 1980s. The production isn\u2019t especially subtle in addressing those issues, however. The murderer is a brooding caricature, and the scene in which he kills Tanya in his van is both predictable and over the top, with bloodcurdling screams and blood splattered on the window.Until that point, \u201cKanata \u2014 Episode 1 \u2014 The Controversy\u201d is merely a passable play, with practically none of Mr. Lepage\u2019s usual inventiveness. The transitions are clunky, with multiple set changes, all handled in full view by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil\u2019s large troupe. The dialogue has little flow to it, and the acting often felt artificial on opening night. (Ms. Mnouchkine came out for a preshow speech, in which she asked the audience to think of it as \u201ca final rehearsal\u201d for the cast.)After Tanya\u2019s death, however, Mr. Lepage tacks on overt meta-references to the \u201cKanata\u201d uproar that divert attention from the Indigenous story lines. Miranda decides to paint the murdered women and to exhibit her work at a local community center. At the last minute, managers realize Miranda hasn\u2019t asked the families of the victims for permission and \u2014 wait for it \u2014 they cancel the exhibition.\u201cOur history has been stolen from us for 400 years,\u201d one Indigenous character says. \u201cExpect some strong reactions.\u201d One can hear Mr. Lepage reply through Miranda: \u201cI\u2019m an artist! These women moved me as human beings, not Indigenous people.\u201dAt one point, the painter laments: \u201cNowadays, to understand a black person, you have to be black! To understand a Jewish person, you have to be Jewish!\u201dThe French director\u2019s stance isn\u2019t unusual in her country, where the notion of cultural appropriation isn\u2019t widely recognized. (Unsurprisingly, there were no protests at Saturday\u2019s premiere.) It\u2019s also in keeping with the universalist ethos of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil, a utopian collective founded in 1964. It employs actors from diverse backgrounds, and its productions have often taken inspiration from foreign cultures.The company\u2019s brand of humanism was shaped at a time when oppressed minorities had few opportunities to make their voices heard, however. The times have changed, and it\u2019s disheartening to see Mr. Lepage and Ms. Mnouchkine, both celebrated directors with an international following and significant power, dig their heels in and cry censorship instead of engaging with a community.\u201cKanata \u2014 Episode 1 \u2014 The Controversy\u201d ends with Miranda alone in her studio.

{"Headline": "As Trump Signals Retreat on Shutdown Threat, Senators Mostly Shrug", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House signaled on Tuesday that President Trump might be ready to capitulate on his demand for $5 billion for a wall on the southwestern border, but negotiations on a spending deal remained murky as lawmakers awaited a White House strategy to avert a Christmastime government shutdown.\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday about the chances of avoiding a shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say.\u201d\u201cWe are disappointed in the fact that they have yet to vote on something or pass something,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters.Minutes later, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told reporters at the Capitol that he was still trying to determine what Mr. Trump would accept.\u201cI\u2019m in consultations with the White House about the way forward,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, adding that he hoped to have more information later \u201cabout what the president is willing to sign.\u201dRepublicans worked to create a package that would allow Mr. Trump to declare victory in retreat, but they came up empty, unable to forge a plan that would satisfy a president intent on fulfilling a signature campaign promise and Democrats emboldened by an impending takeover of the House. Instead, on Tuesday evening, Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who leads the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters that Senate Republicans were preparing a short-term bill that would keep the government funded through February.A stopgap bill would essentially push the government spending fight into the new year, when Democrats will assume control of the House and Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiating leverage \u2014 already on the wane \u2014 will be considerably weakened.Mr. McConnell said a stopgap measure would \u201cend up, in effect, punting this year\u2019s business into next year.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s not a very desirable outcome,\u201d he said.But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said his party would be open to the idea. \u201cWe\u2019d certainly very seriously look at it,\u201d he told reporters.After days of eerie quiet with a partial shutdown looming, the burst of activity suggested that all sides might be preparing for a brief holiday reprieve from their stalemate.\u201cThe president has asked every agency to look and see if they have money that could be used for that purpose,\u201d she told reporters later.Still, that would require approval from Congress, which Democrats said they would not grant.\u201cWe are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cIt will be beautiful and, at the same time, give our Country the security that our citizens deserve.\u201dMr. McConnell had suggested a plan that would have provided $1.6 billion for border security but prohibited spending it on a wall, while allowing Mr. Trump to spend as much as $1 billion in unspent funds from other agencies on his immigration priorities. Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the presumptive incoming speaker, quickly rejected it.\u201cLeader Schumer and I have said that we cannot accept the offer they made of a billion-dollar slush fund for the president to implement his very wrong immigration policies, so that won\u2019t happen,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters.Mr. Schumer noted that Democrats had already proposed two ways of extending funding for the Department of Homeland Security without spending for the wall, and that Mr. Trump had yet to offer an alternative and appeared to be out of options.\u201cThey need congressional approval \u2014 they\u2019re not getting it \u2014 for the wall,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThe ball remains in the president\u2019s and Republicans\u2019 court to accept one of our common-sense proposals.\u201dA week ago, Mr. Trump publicly confronted Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi in a televised Oval Office meeting where he vowed to shut down the government if Democrats refused to allocate money for the wall and suggested a shutdown over his demand was to his political advantage. The scene robbed congressional Republicans of their ability to blame a potential impasse on Democrats, and they have spent the days since casting about for ways to choreograph a compromise that would protect Mr. Trump\u2019s ego and still be broadly acceptable.Ms. Sanders appeared to embrace one such possibility on Tuesday, when she said the White House might accept the $1.6 billion proposal. But it was unclear if Mr. Trump would follow suit, particularly after Democrats ruled out allowing him to spend additional money from other accounts on the border wall.Senator Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the committee that negotiated the spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security, rebuffed Ms. Sanders\u2019s claim that other funds could be used to reach the $5 billion mark.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got that kind of cushion in your budget and you don\u2019t need that money, use it to pay down the debt,\u201d he said.\u201cWe gave him what he wanted,\u201d Mr. Tester added, referring to the administration\u2019s formal request for $1.6 billion. \u201cHe ought to take it.\u201dMr. Shelby said the delicate negotiations, particularly a stopgap spending bill extending funding into February, were continuing.\u201cIt goes all the way back to \u2014 I call it the linchpin \u2014 the wall and funding for the wall,\u201d Mr. Shelby said Tuesday night. \u201cYou never know.\u201dEmily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Baseless Claim That Mexico Will Pay for the Wall Through the New Nafta", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact Check of the DayThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement does not compel Mexico to pay for the wall, and little in it would divert funds from Mexico to the United States. What WAS SaidI often stated, \u201cOne way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.\u201d This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!The new trade deal does not stipulate that Mexico pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall, nor do any of the provisions in the trade deal divert Mexican funds to finance the wall. The pact simply updated the North American Free Trade Agreement, which allows Mexico, Canada and the United States to trade goods and services with zero tariffs. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to connect actual provisions of the U.S.M.C.A. to cash for the wall, since they don\u2019t put money in the coffers of the Treasury,\u201d said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cAny connection between labor, auto rule of origin and other chapters to the wall is pretty remote.\u201dScott Lincicome, a trade expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s claim with \u201cimmense skepticism,\u201d given that the new agreement merely updates Nafta and that none of the changes will be a major revenue driver. He also noted that \u201cthe biggest amount of liberalization is on the Canadian side\u201d \u2014 not Mexico\u2019s \u2014 through gradually opening Canadian markets to American dairy imports.Mr. Trump may be suggesting that the new agreement will increase economic activity in the United States, therefore generating enough tax revenue to offset the cost of his wall. The new trade deal is intended to make it less lucrative for American manufacturers to locate production in Mexico by requiring higher wages for autoworkers \u2014 a provision that the Trump administration says will shift more car production back to the United States. But even if that happens, higher economic output in the United States \u201cis not coming at the expense of Mexico. It\u2019s a trade growth effect,\u201d said Mr. Lincicome.\u201cAssuming the tariffs remain in place for five years at current levels, maybe the Treasury will collect $25 billion, but that\u2019s pretty hypothetical,\u201d Mr. Hufbauer said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Power Grabs in the Midwest, G.O.P. Risks a 2020 Backlash", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLANSING, Mich. \u2014 When Michigan Republicans began moving legislation last week to limit the power of newly elected Democratic officials, some liberal activists shouted \u201cshame!\u201d through the Capitol rotunda while others trailed legislators with boom microphones, live-streaming their interactions online to make them uncomfortable.The continuing legislative maneuvers in Michigan and Wisconsin are part of a broader war for power in the Midwest, a politically prized region for both parties \u2014 but especially for Republicans, who are trying to dilute Democratic control ahead of bigger battles. The G.O.P., which lost the House in November as well as four key governorships in the Midwest, depends on its gerrymandered districts in the region for a trove of seats in both Congress and state legislatures. Without these safe seats, they would be unlikely to attempt such last-minute tactics.But now, with incoming Democratic governors set to have veto power over the next round of redistricting following the 2020 census, a handful of states are confronting either court challenges to the existing districts or new, more equitable rules for drawing the next decade of legislative boundaries. In Michigan, voters this year approved an independent redistricting commission, but Republican lawmakers are using the current lame duck session to try to curb the new Democratic secretary of state\u2019s implementation of it.The Republican efforts could hurt the party\u2019s image with moderate voters in a region that President Trump considers crucial for his 2020 re-election effort, and where his standing has fallen in suburbs that he would need to carry again to win. Yet G.O.P. leaders are determined to push ahead, fearing that their decade-long dominance in the Midwest is coming to an end as newly elected Democrats and the prospect of more competitive districts threaten to shift the balance of power.Republicans remain poised to keep control of some of the region\u2019s state legislatures and many of their congressional seats in the coming years \u2014 the continued clustering of Democratic votes in urban areas ensures a baseline of conservative strength elsewhere. But their efforts to limit executive branch authority in Michigan and Wisconsin may only exacerbate voter anger at a political class that faces little accountability because of the safe seats they fashioned for themselves.\u201cThese are not arcane process issues,\u201d said David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist. \u201cThis goes to a fundamental defiance of the will of voters, essentially thumbing your nose at voters.\u201dIn Wisconsin, Republican state legislators are using a lame duck session to limit the authority of the new Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, while also expanding legislative authority and cutting back on early voting in the state. In Michigan, Republican lawmakers are attempting to dilute the power of Ms. Whitmer and the new Democratic attorney general and secretary of state, Dana Nessel and Jocelyn Benson, while also attempting to water down ballot measures voters passed last month that would expand voting access and create an independent redistricting commission.Republicans control both chambers of the Legislature in the two states and will continue to do so next year.\u201cThe root of this is that the clock is ticking, and you get it done now or it's going to be hard in some of those states with a Democratic governor,\u201d said Nick Everhart, an Ohio-based Republican strategist, noting that legislators may not be so eager to consolidate power when they or their successors are representing more competitive districts in the next decade. \u201cWho wants to take those votes in a potentially different world in \u201921 or \u201922?\u201dThe more fundamental risk for Republicans is that voters are increasingly savvy about issues like gerrymandering, voting rights and campaign finance, which were once thought to be of great interest to elites but of little relevance to most citizens. Those are some of the issues at stake in the G.O.P. bills under consideration this month.Many voters have become more supportive of a nonpartisan approach to redistricting, following years of gerrymanders that carved up states into impregnable red and blue districts and led to more political polarization rather than cooperation. Four states last month approved ballot measures that would create some form of an independent redistricting commission.Some leading Republicans believe their party is tempting an even greater backlash than they saw in 2018 if they defy the wishes of an electorate increasingly attuned to fairness and angered by what figures as different as President Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders have denounced as \u201ca rigged system.\u201dFrank LaRose, a Republican and Ohio\u2019s newly elected secretary of state, called it \u201ctough love for the party, but it\u2019s what the voters are starting to expect and demand from us.\u201d A former state senator, Mr. LaRose recalled that when he first began advocating for redistricting reform seven years ago, \u201cfolks\u2019 eyes would roll back in their head, but it\u2019s becoming more of a mainstream issue and it\u2019s not just the League of Women Voters crowd or political science students.\u201dOr, as the Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, put it: \u201cThe people are driving the change.\u201dIn Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, federal judges may also drive change. There are pending cases from each of the three states challenging their existing gerrymandered maps, whether congressional, state legislative or both. And even if the cases are all thrown out, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio will still likely have more balanced district lines in the next decade: Voters in each state this year overhauled their redistricting process to ensure more fairly drawn seats.\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive for bipartisan cooperation at this juncture,\u201d said Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, noting that statehouse Republicans can ram bills through on a party-line basis. \u201cBut I could see that changing dramatically in the next decade, to all of our benefit.\u201dMidwestern Republicans do not deny that they could face a more balanced political map, upending the dominance they have enjoyed since the 2010 election. Yet an uncertain future is not reason enough to restrain themselves now, said Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly and one of the architects of the lame duck intervention, noting that the first election under the new maps will not be until 2022.\u201cThat\u2019s four years away,\u201d said Mr. Vos, a Republican, adding that he expected Mr. Evers, the governor-elect, to reject whatever map they fashion. \u201cI would be surprised if he did not veto what we do,\u201d he said.Running candidates in districts crafted entirely by Republicans in 2011, Wisconsin Democrats this year won 53 percent of the vote in State Assembly races but only captured 36 percent of the seats (and they only gained a single seat).But Mr. Vos pointed out that Republicans have won State Assembly majorities with court-drawn maps in recent decades and argued they could do so again.The reason for the G.O.P.\u2019s dominance, said Lori Wortz, a longtime Michigan Republican strategist, is that Democrats are increasingly strong in high-density areas but continue to lose support in more rural localities \u2014 a divide that all but ensures a number of safe Republican seats no matter how legislative maps are carved.\u201cRepublican votes tend to be more spread out and Democratic votes tend to be more concentrated,\u201d Ms. Wortz said. \u201cWhether the lines are drawn by this commission, the Legislature or the courts, they\u2019ll come up with similar results.\u201dBut it\u2019s the voters in between urban and rural areas who pose the most peril to Republicans: The Trump-era drift of suburban voters away from the G.O.P. not only threatens his own re-election, it also jeopardizes his party\u2019s grip on statehouse power. And, Democrats say, Republicans are only compounding their difficulties in these fast-growing, largely college-educated communities by grasping for ways to retain power, whether it is gerrymandering, limiting voting access or trying to pass bills at the 11th hour to shift authority away from the executive branch.\u201cIt\u2019s the only way they can try to continue to be competitive,\u201d said Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor who helped run a redistricting-oriented Democratic group this year, noting his party\u2019s gains with the growing parts of the electorate. \u201cBut it\u2019s why people hate politics and politicians.\u201dAnd Mr. Evers, in an interview Saturday, echoed his fellow governor-elect in Michigan, suggesting Republicans would pay a price for their lame duck tactics.\u201cPeople have had it with hyperpartisan behavior,\u201d he said, nodding to his defeat of Gov. Scott Walker, the Republican who led Wisconsin for the last eight years. \u201cThat\u2019s what I ran on.\u201dIn Michigan, Democrats are confronting not just gerrymandered maps and diminished strength in rural areas, but also the state\u2019s term limits law, which forces lawmakers out after three terms in the House and two in the Senate.Democrats believe the constant turnover only emboldens Republicans, because many of the lawmakers will not personally face voters in the next campaign cycle.\u201cThe way the system works, there\u2019s little we can do about it,\u201d said Jim Ananich, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate.Ms. Whitmer said she and outgoing Gov. Rick Snyder, an often-pragmatic Republican, have had \u201cbroad\u201d discussions about the bills limiting the power of incoming Democrats. She said she remains hopeful \u2014 but not confident \u2014 he will defy members of his own party and reject them. The two have met weekly since the election.\u201cIt\u2019s my hope that he lives up to his rhetoric in regards to civility and respect for the institution,\u201d she said.But for progressive activists, the legislative maneuvering in Lansing and in Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s capital, has been instructive.Daniel Squadron, a former New York state senator who leads a liberal group focused on taking back statehouses, said the lame duck sessions illustrate the lingering cost of the Democrats\u2019 inattention to state and local politics.But Mr. Squadron was more hopeful about the lessons of the last few weeks \u2014 and what it could portend for Democrats if they are able to compete in statehouse races in the years to come.\u201cThe way to change politics in people\u2019s lives is to change state legislatures,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, and by the way, you\u2019ll also change voting rights and gerrymandering along the way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In November, his sister sent a specific list of gifts for her and her three young kids (with links!). It was odd. My husband said he\u2019d never received one before. But we\u2019re big readers, so we went to the bookstore and chose books for everyone, instead. When we opened gifts, my sister-in-law was furious at me (but not at my husband) for buying off-list. She even asked me to take back the books when we left! I did. But how do we move forward? My husband offered to talk to her. She was lovely to me before.SUZYLook on the bright side, Suzy: At least you were spared a good old-fashioned book burning! Your husband was supportive to offer to speak to his sister. But it\u2019s unlikely that this will be the last time anyone has to talk to her about this. Let\u2019s establish your agency now.Let\u2019s also note that your sister-in-law seems to have some retrograde ideas about division of labor in a marriage: She sent a gift list to her brother only after he had a wife to execute it, and she was angry with you alone for going off script. If she hews to this notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s work,\u201d the holidays must be exhausting with three young kids.Of course, her list and her fury were ridiculous and rude. Still, I\u2019d take the long view and ignore them (temporarily). Calling her out now, while she\u2019s agitated, may just cause her to dig in her heels. Give her a chance to come to her senses on her own. We all mess up (and freak out) occasionally.If she doesn\u2019t, decide with your husband \u2014 who is still her brother, after all \u2014 whether to cringe and submit to future gifting demands, the path of lesser resistance, or say to her: \u201cYour brother and I shop for gifts together. We love doing it! But we can skip the gift exchange, if you prefer. We\u2019d rather not tick off items from your shopping list.\u201d Then let her choose.E.J.S.My father is a big shot in finance. When I saw him recently, he asked about a friend and former roommate. I mentioned where he works. My father grimaced and said that my friend\u2019s company will soon be sold. According to my dad, this will be terrible for my friend. Should I tell him to find a new job?AMOSPaging the Schlegel sisters from E.M. Forster\u2019s novel \u201cHowards End\u201d (or its terrific TV adaptation that aired this year)! In similar circumstances, the heroines insisted that their friend quit his job, which he did to his detriment, while the \u201cdoomed\u201d firm sailed along just fine. So much for big shots and predicting the future.Assuming your father was not sharing confidential information (and let\u2019s give a bigwig credit for knowing not to), tell your pal about the rumored sale, but play down the dire warning. Let him investigate his prospects and decide on his own whether it\u2019s time to move on.I am a young grandmother (56). Walking home with my 7-year-old granddaughter from seeing \u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d we bumped into a friend who asked what we\u2019d seen. When I told her, she said, \u201cI heard it\u2019s a pile of dog [expletive].\u201d I was shocked! How do I re-educate my friends about swearing in front of kids?EMILYYou don\u2019t (probably). As a boy, when my mother barked at her naughty pals (\u201cLanguage!\u201d), I imagined something sophisticated and cool had transpired. Go to work on your granddaughter, instead. Tell her how dim and unimaginative vulgar language is.That may work for a few years, until she\u2019s swearing like a sailor (and most of the rest of us). For the record, your friend was wrong about \u201cMary Poppins Returns.\u201d It\u2019s not terrible, just leaden \u2014 and underscores how the original floats above that fine line between treacle and genuine feeling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toxic Smoke Is Africa\u2019s Quiet Killer. An Entrepreneur Says His Fix Can Make a Fortune", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEric Reynolds will tell you that he is on the verge of freeing much of humanity from the deadly scourge of the cooking fire. He can halt the toxic smoke wafting through African homes, protect what is left of the continent\u2019s forest cover and help rescue the planet from the wrath of climate change.He is happy to explain, at considerable length, how he will systematically achieve all this while constructing a business that can amass billions in profit from an unlikely group of customers: the poorest people on earth.He will confess that some people doubt his hold on reality.\u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s too good to be true,\u201d says Mr. Reynolds, a California-born entrepreneur living in Rwanda. \u201cMost people think I am pretty out there.\u201d\u201cDo we know that it\u2019s going to work?\u201d he asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s never been done before.\u201dInyenyeri presents a real-world test of an idea gaining traction among those focused on economic development \u2014 that profit-making businesses may be best positioned to deliver critically needed services to the world\u2019s poorest communities.\u201cProfit feeds impact at scale,\u201d says Mr. Reynolds, now in the midst of a global tour as he courts investment on top of the roughly $12 million he has already raised. \u201cUnless somebody gets rich, it can\u2019t grow.\u201dMore than four decades have passed since Mr. Reynolds embarked on what he portrays as an accidental life as an entrepreneur, an outgrowth of his fascination with mountaineering. He dropped out of college to start Marmot, the outdoor gear company named for the burrowing rodent. There, he profited by protecting Volvo-driving, chardonnay-sipping weekend warriors against the menacing elements of Aspen. Now, he is trying to build a business centered on customers for whom turning on a light switch is a radical act of upward mobility.Inyenyeri is betting that it can give away stoves and make money by charging people for fuel. If it succeeds, it vows to deliver virtues that go well beyond the bottom line.Rwandans in rural areas \u2014 and, eventually, across Africa and South Asia \u2014 would be freed from the time-sucking drudgery of having to look for wood. People in cities, who rely on charcoal, could switch to cheaper wood pellets, using the savings to buy health care, food and school uniforms.In much of the developing world, initiatives aimed at sparing the environment tend to pit the livelihoods of poor people against the protection of natural resources. Peasants in the Amazon are supposed to stop hacking away at forests to clear land for crops so the rest of the planet can benefit from a reduction in carbon emissions. Yet in Inyenyeri\u2019s designs, the everyday concerns of poor households are aligned with environmental imperatives, because people prefer to cook with the stoves.At 66, with sunburned cheeks and intense blue eyes, Mr. Reynolds can at times sound like the latest white man come to save Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s just outrageous that we have three billion people still cooking in the Stone Age,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely solvable.\u201dHe touts his ability to connect with customers, the women who do the cooking in Rwanda, though even after a decade living in the country he does not speak the local language, Kinyarwanda. He sits on the dirt floors of villagers\u2019 homes and speaks English slowly and loudly, exaggerating each syllable. Rwandan women trust him, he says, because he married one. He hands them his phone and displays the proof \u2014 pictures of his wife, Mariam Uwizeyimana Reynolds, 32, and their two fresh-faced boys, Terry Toulumne Reynolds, 6, and Marc Booth Reynolds, 3.On a recent evening, he visits Buzuta village, a scattering of mudwall huts on a rutted dirt road in western Rwanda, not far from the shore of Lake Kivu. He sits opposite Mukamurenzi Anasthasie, who is rearing two grandchildren and two orphans in a house with neither plumbing nor electricity.For most of her 60 years, Ms. Anasthasie watched the daylight seep away with a sense of dread, anxious that darkness might fall before she could find enough wood to cook a meal. The forests that once surrounded her village had been dismantled and hacked into firewood. She and her neighbors wandered for hours into the surrounding mountains looking for sticks.\u201cSometimes, we\u2019d just collect dry grasses and try to cook with those,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes \u2014 especially if it rained \u2014 we just didn\u2019t eat. It was painful. We were constantly worrying about where we could find wood.\u201dTwo years ago, Ms. Anasthasie traded her cooking fire for an Inyenyeri stove, a red cylinder holding a chamber to burn pellets that sits on her dirt floor. She no longer spends her day worrying about wood. She and the children have been relieved of their constant coughing. She can put beans on to simmer and walk away and do something else.\u201cI don\u2019t have to waste time waiting for food,\u201d she says.In Mr. Reynolds\u2019s telling, his career in business was born of a simple desire to sleep comfortably.It was the early 1970s, and he was 21 years old, officially studying climatology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, yet spending most of his time scaling the granite walls of the Yosemite Valley. He and his climbing partner were unhappy with their bulky sleeping bags. They began sewing their own. As word spread that their bags were lightweight and warm, demand soared. Mr. Reynolds left school to pursue Marmot full time.Revenues multiplied, but Mr. Reynolds was restless. As a kid in Davis, where his father taught microbiology at the University of California campus, he had been reared on the works of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi. He carried a sense that he was supposed to be addressing injustice.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he says, \u201call we really did was keep yuppies warm and dry.\u201dHe left Marmot in 1987, passing the years scaling peaks from the Andes to the Himalayas while based in Boulder, Colo. He took over a start-up that sold water-purifying pumps for backpackers. He worked as a consultant.Then, in the summer of 2003, he conceived what was supposed to be his ultimate creation, a business engineered to achieve social-minded goals. The company, Nau, designed and sold outdoor gear made from environmentally sustainable fabric. It sent 5 percent of its revenue to activist organizations. It raised $35 million in less than two years.Barely a year in, Mr. Reynolds was pushed out in a power struggle. He descended into depression.An old friend was helping design a memorial to victims of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. She invited Mr. Reynolds to help.He flew into the capital, Kigali, in March 2007, and drove seven hours over horrendous dirt roads to the village that held the memorial. The country he traversed was raw and broken. Thirteen years had passed since the wave of murder that had killed perhaps 800,000 people in 100 days, yet Rwanda was still seething with grief and distrust.The infant mortality rate was one of the highest on earth. Life expectancy was less than 60 years. The typical Rwandan had an income of $206 per year.As Mr. Reynolds visited villagers, he was struck by the impossibility of their daily existence. Clean drinking water was nonexistent. So were electricity and toilets. People spent hours fetching water and looking for wood.\u201cEvery time I went inside, I became more and more intrigued,\u201d he says. \u201cHow are these people surviving?\u201dSigns of the charcoal industry were inescapable. Fires wafted up from supposedly protected national forests. Steep, verdant hills once covered in rain forest were denuded and exposed to the elements. Rivers were choked with brown silt, the soil and nutrients stripped off the land by pounding rains.All this, to produce fuel that was quietly killing hundreds of thousands of people across Africa.\u201cThere is nothing in the house that causes as much suffering as cooking,\u201d Mr. Reynolds says. \u201cIt\u2019s dirty. It\u2019s smoky. Momma is there with the baby on her back, and both are coughing. It\u2019s ruinously expensive. I could see the trees disappearing and the mudslides forming. I could see that this was a time bomb.\u201dAfter three weeks in Rwanda, he returned to Boulder and tore into books and academic reports on cooking practices and stove technology.Philanthropic efforts were focused on distributing cleaner-burning stoves. For-profit ventures were developing models for sale. But all of these undertakings were bedeviled by the same problem. The high-tech stoves that limited toxic smoke were as much as $150 each \u2014 preposterously expensive for African villagers, many of whom lived on less than 50 cents a day. The cheaper models were useless.Most manufacturers were obsessed with keeping costs low, given that customers were poor. But the stoves still produced smoke, or took too long to cook, or required that the wood be chopped into little pieces \u2014 an extra burden. The women doing the cooking (and it was overwhelmingly women) were not inclined to use them. As Mr. Reynolds returned to Rwanda for research, he saw many of these models stuck behind houses or propped up by the cooking fire as stools.To succeed, a stove had to be so convenient and clean burning that women preferred it over their existing cooking method.Mr. Reynolds began testing stoves made in Italy, India, the United States and China. He tried making his own.He came to realize that the magic was in the combination of stove and fuel. He experimented with making charcoal out of corncobs. (\u201cA stupid idea,\u201d he says.) He tried burning banana leaves. Then he discovered wood pellets, which involve compressing wood and eliminating water, the element that produces much of the smoke.He settled on a Dutch-made stove that reduces wood down to clean-burning gases. Using pellets reduced the need for wood by 90 percent compared with charcoal. But those stoves cost more than $75.Then came the epiphany: Inyenyeri could supply the stoves for free while collecting revenue from subscriptions for pellets. Rwanda was urbanizing rapidly, and city dwellers rely on charcoal. They would be eager to switch to pellets, which were 30 to 50 percent cheaper.\u201cIf you sell fuel every day rather than selling a stove every two years,\u201d Mr. Reynolds says, \u201cthat\u2019s a business.\u201dCustomers in rural areas could not afford to buy pellets, but Inyenyeri could serve them with a barter system. People could gather sticks, though less than they needed for cooking, and exchange them for pellets. Inyenyeri would use the sticks to make more pellets.In this way, Inyenyeri would effectively become a utility providing clean cooking fuel. It would construct a network of factories to produce pellets. The bigger the business grew, the cheaper the cost of making them. As charcoal rose in price \u2014 a trend propelled by growing numbers of people flocking to cities and needing the product \u2014 the more appealing pellets would look.That development was getting a push from African governments intent on reducing the use of charcoal. Across the continent, charcoal is a $40 billion-a-year industry, one dominated by criminal gangs that pilfer public forests and employ child labor. Rwanda\u2019s government has vowed to phase out its use.\u201cTo be able to sell something that is essential to life, and where the government is actively trying to kill your competition,\u201d Mr. Reynolds says, \u201cis the kind of investment that venture capitalists hunger for.\u201dInyenyeri would start in Rwanda, where the government has gained credibility with international aid organizations for its success in reducing poverty. It could use success there as a springboard for expansion across Africa.The business model would get more attractive as the cost of charcoal climbed, and as innovation inevitably made stoves more efficient. Inyenyeri would also stand to collect revenue from an arrangement it later entered into with the World Bank to sell credits for reducing emissions.In 2010, Mr. Reynolds sold his house in Boulder and went all in on Inyenyeri. He unloaded his wine cellar, liquidated his retirement accounts and moved to Rwanda with no plan to leave.Today, Inyenyeri has distribution offices in cities and villages in Rwanda, including one inside a camp for refugees from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. It runs a small-scale pellet plant in Gisenyi, a city on Lake Kivu, and is developing a bigger factory.Company representatives go home with new customers to help them cook their first meal using their new stoves. Inyenyeri delivers pellets for free using bicycle messengers, and is close to rolling out a system that will allow customers to place orders using a smartphone.The company has engineered its own customer management software to track purchases of pellets, customer cooking habits and a host of other data, updated in real time by people in the field using a mobile app. The data has attracted research institutions including the National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins University and the University of North Carolina. They have undertaken studies probing how clean cooking technology affects public health, and how families freed from gathering wood use their extra time.But one crucial element is still missing \u2014 scale.In every company projection, a steep increase in customer numbers is required for the business to become profitable. Inyenyeri now needs to persuade investors to deliver the cash to buy hundreds of thousands of stoves and erect new pellet plants.For Mr. Reynolds, the all-or-nothing uncertainties are familiar. Back in his climbing days, he habitually opted for less-traveled routes. On an ascent of Everest that featured a rarely employed bypass around a treacherous ice field, he spent 58 days camped in the thin air between 20,000 and 28,000 feet above sea level.But Mr. Reynolds nurses fears. Once Inyenyeri demonstrates the potential in the clean cooking fuel industry, he says, greedy competitors are likely to emerge. They could pick off the wealthiest urban customers while abandoning the rural poor. They could buy wood from unsavory sources.\u201cI worry we could create a monster,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see us make a lot of money, and others are going to flock to this to make even more money by not being scrupulous.\u201dBut if the virtues of the business model have yet to be demonstrated, the demand for Inyenyeri\u2019s product appears overwhelming. Everywhere the company expands, word-of-mouth swiftly exhausts the supply of stoves. Customers speak of emancipation from smoke, and of less need to haul jerrycans of water to their homes from taps 20 or 30 minutes away by foot, because their pots are no longer covered in soot and need less washing.In Buzuta village, Dorcas Nyiransabimana, a mother of two, simmers beans and leaves them untended while she prepares to feed the pigs she keeps in a pen next to her house.Twice a year, she sells piglets, fetching 15,000 Rwandan francs (about $17), an enormous sum in rural Rwanda. With her cooking fuel secured, she can spend more time scavenging for food for the pigs \u2014 milk past its sell date from a nearby dairy and discarded grains from a brewery.Nearby, the walls of Ms. Anasthasie\u2019s house are bare, save for a torn poster of pop stars \u2014 Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Tupac. A low wooden table and three stools are the only furniture in her home. The red Inyenyeri stove glows like a totem of modernity.She used to be trapped by her wood fire. Now, she leaves her pot to cook and gathers banana leaves to feed to the goat she keeps tethered to a tree.\u201cBefore, I\u2019d find leaves for the goat and come back and not have time to cook for me and the family,\u201d she says. \u201cOr I\u2019d cook for us and the goat would not get to eat. Now, we all get to eat \u2014 us, and the goat.\u201dMr. Reynolds hears this story as darkness falls. As he walks up the dirt road through the village toward his car, cook fires are glowing inside houses, smoke wafting skyward.\u201cThis business model will happen,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s not Inyenyeri that\u2019s the first mover, then it will be someone else who learns from our mistakes and does it better. It\u2019s too big of an opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of global consulting company. It is Capgemini, not Capgemi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kurdish Fighters Discuss Releasing Almost 3,200 ISIS Prisoners", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria are discussing the release of 3,200 Islamic State prisoners, a prominent monitoring group and a Western official of the anti-Islamic State coalition said on Thursday, a day after President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American troops from the country.Mostapha Bali, the spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., denied that there had been any discussion of releasing prisoners from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. \u201cAny news coming from such sources is not reliable and is not coming from us,\u201d he said.But a Western official from the United States-led coalition fighting in Syria, which includes more than a dozen countries, confirmed that such discussions had taken place.\u201cThe best result of terrible options is probably for the Syrian regime to take custody of these people,\u201d said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss the matter on the record. \u201cIf they are released, it\u2019s a real disaster and major threat to Europe.\u201dThere have been reports that the Kurdish group was planning to withdraw its forces from front-line positions fighting the Islamic State, but there was no sign so far that had happened.The S.D.F. was also concerned that it would need all of its fighters to defend against a possible Turkish military invasion, the report said \u2014 a prospect made more likely by a United States withdrawal.The Syrian Democratic Forces are predominantly made up of Kurdish fighters from the Y.P.G., the People\u2019s Protection Units, but under American tutelage the group has signed up many Arab fighters opposed to the Islamic State; Arabs now make up about 40 percent of the force, which has up to 75,000 fighters. The group has been trained, advised, financed and supplied by the United States, which has 2,000 troops, mostly Special Operations forces, in Syria allied with the S.D.F.That led to a telephone conversation between Mr. Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey last Friday, after which the United States quietly began making preparations for the troop withdrawal.Kurdish leaders have so far been restrained in their public reactions to Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement. The S.D.F. General Command issued a statement on Thursday calling for the decision to be reconsidered.\u201cThe withdrawal decision will directly undermine the efforts of the final attempts to defeat terrorist groups and will have serious implications on stability and world peace,\u201d it said. \u201cThe withdrawal in such circumstances, will create a political and military vacuum in the region and will leave people in the clutches of enemy forces.\u201dThe threat of releasing Islamic State prisoners may be a trial balloon by the Kurds, whose own people suffered tremendously from the group\u2019s atrocities when it controlled many of the Kurdish cities and towns in the Rojava area of northern Syria. That control ended when the Americans and the S.D.F. teamed up to fight the organization.Now the Kurdish areas are free of the Islamic State, and the Kurds have been fighting the group in Arab-dominated areas far from Kurdish communities. Those communities, however, would be threatened by any resurgence of the Islamic State, so the Kurds may not follow through on freeing prisoners.On the other hand, maintaining the prisoners has been a burden on the group, and the United States has helped pay for the detention effort. There is no indication that American aid would necessarily end, but without American troops on the ground it may prove difficult to monitor what happens with the prisoners.Another possibility the Kurds are discussing is handing the prisoners over to the Syrian government, which is also fighting against the Islamic State, but has at times made alliances with the group. The Western coalition official said any release would not take place immediately, and would not happen until the American troops had left completely, which might take months.Mr. Trump defended his decision, praising America\u2019s \u201chistoric victories against ISIS\u201d and saying it was \u201ctime to bring our great young people home!\u201d Yet his own presidential envoy to the fight against ISIS, Brett McGurk, said on Dec. 11 that a withdrawal now would be disastrous and risk a resurgence of the group.American military officials as well as analysts who follow the Islamic State closely said it still has 20,000 to 30,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria, most of them underground. That is the number the Central Intelligence Agency estimated the group had at the beginning of its rise in 2014.In a State Department briefing last week, Mr. McGurk said, \u201cIf we\u2019ve learned one thing over the years, enduring defeat of a group like this means you can\u2019t just defeat their physical space and then leave.\u201dThe S.D.F. General Command said much the same thing: \u201cThe White House\u2019s decision to withdraw from northern and eastern Syria will negatively affect the campaign against terrorism and will give terrorism and its supporters the political and military momentum to restore ISIS\u2019 power again,\u201d it said.Mr. Bali, the group\u2019s spokesman, said the group would continue to fight the Islamic State.\u201cSo far, our forces are still fighting these battles against terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do all that we can do to continue the battle, but the U.S. decision was unfortunate and unexpected.\u201dHwaida Saad reported from Beirut, Lebanon, and Rod Nordland from London.Advertisement"}

The meals are meant to be cooked by children with help from a parent. \u201cIf you make something with your own hands, you are much more likely to try it and over time you will develop your palate,\u201d Ms. Scherer said.In Brooklyn, two longtime food writers and editors who have long preached the importance of passing cooking skills to children are now putting their money where their mouths are. Wilson Rumble, 12, started taking classes at the Dynamite Shop early this fall and now knows how to whip up guacamole \u2014 and that vegetables \u201ccan be cooked with certain ingredients to make them taste less like vegetables,\u201d he said.Kristin Earhart, Wilson\u2019s mother, has a 15-month-old daughter as well. Between work and taking care of the baby, Ms. Earhart has struggled to get dinner ready by the time Wilson gets hungry. She heard about the Dynamite Shop and was surprised by her son\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cI was excited,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI wanted to cook fine meals.\u201dHe had always hated butter, but at the Dynamite Shop he was encouraged to make compound butter by adding spices to it that he likes. Then he slathered it all over a sweet potato that he baked and gobbled the whole thing.At home, he has been helping his mother in the kitchen. \u201cIt makes things go much smoother when you have a sous chef,\u201d Ms. Earhart said. \u201cAnd one day, probably not too long from now, I\u2019ll be his.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For-Profit College Chain Closes, Shutting Out Nearly 20,000 Students", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe for-profit college chain Education Corporation of America said this week that it would shut down nearly all of its schools, leaving almost 20,000 students with partially completed degrees and credits that many other schools will not accept.The company, based in Birmingham, Ala., operated more than 70 vocationally focused campuses nationwide before losing its accreditation on Tuesday. The chain\u2019s programs included training for aspiring chefs, nurses and green-energy workers at schools including Brightwood College, Virginia College and the Golf Academy of America, which sold itself with the slogan \u201cpreparing students to win in the game and the business of golf.\u201dThat caused potential investors to walk away from the financially struggling chain, according to a letter that Stu Reed, the company\u2019s chief executive, sent to students on Wednesday.\u201cIt is with extreme regret that this series of recent circumstances has forced us to discontinue the operations of our schools,\u201d Mr. Reed wrote.Just one of the chain\u2019s schools \u2014 the online-only New England College of Business and Finance \u2014 will remain open, according to a spokeswoman for the school. The body that accredits it is different from the one covering the chain\u2019s other campuses.Its abrupt collapse came at an otherwise promising time for for-profit schools: The Education Department is reversing a regulatory crackdown that pushed several of the nation\u2019s largest chains into bankruptcy in recent years.Federal student loan funds are the lifeblood of most for-profit schools, but critics have long criticized the industry for saddling students with large debts for programs that rarely led to well-paying careers. President Obama\u2019s administration imposed new rules designed to cut off federal cash to schools that routinely left students with debts that dwarfed their earnings.The abrupt closing \u201cis highly disappointing and not best for its students,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cThere were other options available.\u201dTo qualify for federal loan funds, schools must be vetted and approved by an accrediting agency, which is supposed to investigate and vouch for the institutions\u2019 quality and soundness. The agency that withdrew Education Corporation of America\u2019s certification, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, had its own recent brush with death and regained its federal recognition just two weeks ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exploring the Future of Our Cities", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 How do the greatest cities succeed?The question could not come at a more critical time, as cities around the world face challenges \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 unimagined in human history. By some estimates, 68 percent of the world\u2019s population will live in cities by 2050. Will city dwellers have sufficient housing? Can police forces cope? Will food distribution be adequate? What about the effects of climate change? Will technology provide the answers?Among the conference guests are policy and government officials, entrepreneurs, cultural and sports figures, thought leaders, and industry executives.Topics include the race among tech companies of all kinds, along with venture capitalists, to invest in urban areas large and small \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s plan to move to New York and suburban Washington; efforts to promote environmental resilience with an eye toward social equity; techniques for working effectively with state, federal and even international counterparts to advance local interests; thoughts on conquering the urban income divide; and the impact of athletes-as-activists on cities and the nation.On a lighter note, the conference is acknowledging the food and music scenes that have helped make New Orleans so famous.Some of the guests include the mayors of the cities of New Orleans, San Diego and Seattle; Mitch Landrieu, a former mayor of New Orleans who was the state\u2019s lieutenant governor during Hurricane Katrina; Steven Case, a venture capitalist; Walter Isaacson, an author and professor at Tulane University; Grant Hill, co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks; Adam Silver, commissioner of the N.B.A.; Stefano Boeri, architect and city planner; Emeril Lagasse, the celebrated chef; and Jon Batiste, bandleader and musical director of \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d\u201cBoston is brutal right now, because we\u2019re going through this really huge growth spurt,\u201d said Ms. Lynch, who owns eight restaurants in the city and has won three James Beard Awards.She sees developers latch on to young chefs eager for their own restaurants, but then they lock the chefs into high rent, she said, and demand 6 percent of sales. \u201cThey\u2019re using your name,\u201d she said.Mr. Lagasse, whose restaurant empire has its headquarters in New Orleans with outposts in Florida, Las Vegas and Pennsylvania, also complained about being squeezed by rising real estate costs.Cities that have been through disaster learn one important lesson: \u201cNature wins.\u201dThese local leaders agree that while you can\u2019t fight nature in terms of the disasters that have hit their homes \u2014 hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Katrina \u2014 you can learn to live with it, even as climate change promises to make such crises even worse in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s recognizing that you have to look at storm water management as a system,\u201d Ms. Cantrell said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pump your way out of it; it\u2019s not just pumps and power.\u201dInstead, she added, preparing for disasters and recovering from weather challenges require many different strategies, including \u201cholding that rainwater, keeping the flow from going into the drains faster, raising your homes above the flood line.\u201dOf course, Ms. Cruz said, understanding the challenge doesn\u2019t make it easy to address. \u201cYou have to sort of fly the plane and fix it at the same time.\u201dDealing with the challenges of weather and climate require a new way of seeing the world, Mr. Emmett said. Texans have seen themselves, historically, as being in a battle with nature. \u201cWe were going to tame nature, by gum,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were going to build and keep growing.\u201dNow the realization is that people have to \u201cstay out of nature\u2019s way,\u201d even though too many people still live not only in the floodplain, but also in the floodway, putting themselves directly at risk. \u201cTexas is big on freedom,\u201d he said.Ms. Cruz said disaster recovery meant \u201cengaging in a massive battle over gentrification.\u201d Poor people can be displaced in a recovery as speculators buy cheap land hoping to make a score.Ms. Cantrell said the rules regarding recovery could work against those of limited means, since recovery money is often tied to the value of a damaged home before a storm.\u201cNo matter where you live, Sheetrock costs the same,\u201d she said, and so the income disparities grow worse even in the process of rebuilding. She recommended \u201cgap financing\u201d to address the issues, and to keep gentrification from driving people out of their neighborhoods.It\u2019s not the type of crime that typically ends in arrest: a murder in a parking garage after a suspected drug deal. But a camera from the New Orleans Police Department\u2019s $40 million camera system caught high-definition images of the probable killer.The department disseminated clear images and made an arrest within a few days, Michael S. Harrison, the police superintendent, said in a conversation with the privacy expert Julia Angwin.Although Ms. Angwin raised civil liberties concerns about the use of the cameras and their oversight, Mr. Harrison, who is usually reserved, was uncharacteristically enthusiastic. \u201cAny sheriff or law enforcement executive who does not have this is living in the Dark Ages and working behind the times,\u201d he said.Mr. Harrison said the city\u2019s 300 cameras were placed on public poles on public streets and that staff members from the city\u2019s Real Time Crime Monitoring Center tapped into the images only when prompted by a 911 call reporting crime in the area. He called it a \u201ccrime-fighting tool,\u201d not surveillance.He said that residents and businesses are now able to buy their own cameras, and that they can be used by the center to deal with routine nuisance crimes like drug dealing and illegal dumping. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to identify the murderer?\u201d Ms. Angwin asked. \u201cBut what about the protester, the dumper?\u201dMs. Angwin also asked about oversight. How could citizens be assured that protocols were being followed, she asked. And did everyone in New Orleans know how to deal with images generated by the camera system?\u201cWe have a clear system in the offline world,\u201d she said. Probable cause is clearly defined in court, for instance. \u201cAnd we know what happens afterward: how to challenge that warrant in court.\u201dIn Washington, the border between the United States and Mexico is often portrayed as a lawless place and a threat. But to local leaders in San Diego, Calif., and in Tijuana, Mexico, it\u2019s the line marking a close and mutually beneficial relationship.\u201cWe\u2019ve always managed to live with a fence,\u201d said Ivette Casillas, a member of the Tijuana City Council. \u201cBut between us, it\u2019s like a Romeo and Juliet story. Even though they try to keep us apart through this wall or fence, or whatever you want to call it, the love still exists.\u201dJust as important, commerce exists. When the United States closed the border for just a few hours recently, it resulted in about $5 million in economic loss, said Kevin Faulconer, mayor of San Diego. Each day, 135,000 people cross the border for business, for family and even to use the Tijuana airport. \u201cIt\u2019s the strength of us,\u201d he said.Ms. Casillas said that when the number of migrants and asylum seekers in Tijuana jumped from several hundred at a time to 6,000, \u201cthe city wasn\u2019t prepared.\u201d But, with the help of hundreds of local nonprofit agencies, they have been able to accommodate them.The Vertical Forest buildings of the architect and urban planner Stefano Boeri make the most of the often overlooked and profound contributions of a single tree.The beauty of incorporating more trees and plant life in urban architecture is that the trees both assist in absorbing carbon dioxide and in producing more oxygen.As Mayor Mike Duggan was trying to revive Detroit, he traveled to other parts of the country and talked with planners and officials in flourishing urban areas. He had vacant buildings, left behind in the early 2000s, as jobs had dried up and 260,000 people left the financially stagnant city.Mr. Duggan heard about the downside of prosperity, including gentrification. So he asked, \u201cIf you were in Brooklyn and you could rewind the clock, what would you do differently?\u201dLeaders of other cities told him that instead of displacing existing residents, they would work harder to keep those residents in place as rents and property values increased. Mr. Duggan returned to Detroit and worked to help carry out an ordinance requiring that developers who buy discounted city-owned land or receive a certain level of municipal support must include a minimum of 20 percent of permanent affordable-housing units in their buildings.Ms. Wylde said that Amazon was bringing 150,000 jobs to New York because the city\u2019s universities had worked hard to develop skills within the city\u2019s work force.\u201cThey are not coming because of the incentives we offered,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for talent; they need a talent pipeline that is very big and that they can tap.\u201dMr. Duggan also required developers who received subsidies to hire a minimum of 51 percent Detroit residents. Those who did not reach that point paid a penalty that went into a fund to help train local residents to be plumbers, carpenters and electricians.In four years, developers who had started out with 6 percent local residents have risen to about 30 percent, he said.When Mr. Tubbs took office, he talked to his staff about Stockton\u2019s high poverty rates, with 22 percent of residents under the poverty line in 2017. \u201cThe crux of all our issues is poverty,\u201d he told staff members. \u201cLet\u2019s find the most radical intervention for poverty. Give me a policy.\u201dAfter extensive research, his staff came back and told him, \u201cGive out a basic income; give people money.\u201dAt first, they had conversations about \u201cthe dignity of work,\u201d Mr. Tubbs said. \u201cWork has dignity,\u201d he said. But he added that it was \u201cinherently undignified\u201d for people working 14 hours a day or driving lengthy Uber shifts to try to pay their bills.The N.B.A. has earned a term that its commissioner hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cHow does it feel to be the wokest professional sports league?\u201d asked Marc Lacey, the national editor at The Times.\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were given that designation,\u201d said Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, laughing. \u201cBut I understand the sentiment and we\u2019re proud of that.\u201dIn the past few years, the N.B.A. has found itself in the spotlight for the way its players and teams have spoken out on social and political issues. They are in stark contrast to the N.F.L., which has struggled to handle the reaction to its players kneeling during the national anthem.Which begs the question. Where would Colin Kaepernick be if he were an N.B.A. player?Mr. Kaepernick, who led the San Francisco 49ers to the Superbowl in 2012, has remained unsigned since the end of the 2016 season, when he took a knee during the national anthem to raise awareness of racism, social injustice and police brutality.He pointed to Mr. Silver, who has been the N.B.A. commissioner since 2014. \u201cAdam takes the time to listen and understand the issues and what players are concerned about and where they are coming from,\u201d Mr. Hill said.Mr. Silver said he views free speech as a part of a core set of American values being shared with an international audience and teams full of international players.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Is Unwilling to Tackle Climate Change. China Must Step Up.", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina can do more. The planet depends on it.Professor Gardner is the author of \u201cEnvironmental Pollution in China: What Everyone Needs to Know.\u201dEvery year, China burns as much coal as the rest of world combined, and every year since 2009, more cars have been sold there than in any other country. This has left its cities choking on poisoned air and has been responsible for an estimated one million premature deaths a year. But since 2014, China has been waging a \u201cwar on pollution,\u201d and this campaign has begun to show results. Last year, levels of particulate pollution in Beijing dropped by more than 20 percent over the previous year.The politics of this was obvious. The country\u2019s leadership was worried that its citizens simply wouldn\u2019t tolerate air so polluted that it can be difficult on some days in some cities to see through the soupy, acrid haze to the buildings across the street. But China has shown less determination to corral its runaway emissions of carbon dioxide, the colorless, odorless gas that is principally responsible for the warming of the planet. A warming planet, after all, doesn\u2019t present the same palpable and immediate threat to people\u2019s daily lives that toxic air does. With the Trump administration unwilling to confront climate change, the world needs a more deeply committed China. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the present rate, by 2040, coastlines will be inundated, droughts and floods will intensify and food shortages will be widespread. So the world is facing an immense challenge, made much more difficult by an American president who believes coal, oil and gas are the fuels that will drive America\u2019s return to greatness.These measures will help bring down greenhouse gas emissions. So too will some of the measures that Beijing has already taken in its \u201cwar on pollution\u201d: shuttering coal power plants, investing hundreds of billions of dollars in renewable energy development, especially wind and solar, introducing a nationwide carbon emissions trading program, and heavily subsidizing the production and purchase of electric vehicles.But China can do more. The planet depends on it.For one, it must stop financing and building coal-fired power plants around the world. China has made reducing coal production and consumption a high priority at home, but Chinese energy companies are behind more than 200 new coal-fired power plants around the world that are either planned or under construction. Fighting a \u201cwar on pollution\u201d and calling for \u201cbuilding an ecological civilization\u201d at home while promoting the use of dirty coal in less developed countries makes China look hypocritical, even colonial. Instead, Beijing can and should be exporting the renewable energy technology that it has been so aggressively developing. With this clean energy, underdeveloped countries could leapfrog the outworn development model that sacrifices environmental well-being for economic growth.It also must quickly expand its nationwide carbon emissions trading system. China introduced the largest carbon market in the world in 2017-18, using a market-driven approach to push down emissions. But Beijing is moving cautiously. Thus far, its application of the trading system has been largely limited to the power sector, which covers about 30 percent of China\u2019s total carbon emissions. This market should be extended to other heavy industries, especially chemical, iron, steel and aviation, no later than 2020.The country must also figure out how to maximize its wind and solar capacity, the largest in the world. A good deal of it now goes unused \u2014 a situation known as curtailment. In 2016, for instance, 17 percent of China\u2019s total wind capacity was curtailed, and in some provinces, that figure was much higher. Solar curtailment nationwide was nearly 20 percent. That\u2019s a lot of waste. Much of this has to do with an inadequate power grid that can\u2019t transmit the additional power. But the government needs as well to enforce its policy of giving renewable sources priority access to the grid (so called green dispatch) ahead of coal and other fossil fuels.And, finally, Beijing should set 2030 as the year for ending the production and sale of all gas and diesel powered cars and trucks, and replacing them with electric vehicles powered by renewable energyAll of these measures are within Beijing\u2019s reach and are achievable within just a few years.We live in a world in which global mistrust of China is widespread, and with ample reason: the military buildup in the South China Sea, the mass internment of Uighurs, human rights abuses, the disregard for intellectual property rights and more. But that mistrust shouldn\u2019t blind us to the reality that in fighting climate change, the nations of the world are on the same side. We should cheer China on whenever it takes steps to reduce carbon emissions \u2014 especially as the Trump administration sits by idly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Empty Homes and Protests: China\u2019s Property Market Strains the World", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA glut of unwanted apartments gets part of the blame for a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In some places, homeowners are taking to the streets.JURONG, China \u2014 For Hu Peiliang, Jurong was a city of cranes, concrete and opportunity. He was so sure it was on the cusp of a boom that last year he moved his family there.On an overcast day last month, Mr. Hu, a 31-year-old real estate agent, pointed to one new building after another as evidence. New city blocks have been built, crosswalks and streetlights erected overnight. One development straddling several blocks called Yudong International will include 120 buildings when completed.But who will buy all those apartments? Mr. Hu paused before answering. \u201cI was wondering that myself,\u201d he said. Since July, he has sold only a handful.Unwanted apartments are weighing on China\u2019s economy \u2014 and, by extension, dragging down growth around the world. Property sales are dropping. Apartments are going unsold. Developers who bet big on continued good times are now staggering under billions of dollars of debt.\u201cThe prospects of the property market are grim,\u201d said Xiang Songzuo, a senior economist at Renmin University, said during a lecture at Renmin Business School this month. China is grappling with an economic slowdown brought on by efforts to curb debt and worsened by the trade fight with the United States. But any solution will have to contend with the country\u2019s property problems. More than one in five apartments in Chinese cities \u2014 roughly 65 million \u2014 sit unoccupied, estimates Gan Li, a professor at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu.\u201cWe are already in a difficult economic situation,\u201d Mr. Gan said. \u201cThe decline will only get worse.\u201dIn places like Jurong, homeowners are paying the price. Some property developers have slashed prices on new apartments to gin up business or cut corners to save money. That undercuts the property values of earlier buyers, who increasingly are taking to the streets to protest.In October, dozens of apartment buyers in Jurong gathered outside the sales office of Center Park, a 22-building residential complex pitched by Country Garden, the developer, as China\u2019s version of Central Park in Manhattan. Security guards barricaded the entrance to prevent protesters from storming the building to demand their money back.\u201cI am very angry,\u201d said Jia Rui, 24, who bought a Center Park apartment a year ago. He watched last year as property prices rose for months before deciding to buy the apartment, which will be bigger than the one he currently lives in with his wife and parents. When he learned that similar apartments were later being sold at nearly half the price, Mr. Jia said, he felt helpless.\u201cIt is not possible to get a refund,\u201d Mr. Jia said. Then again, he added, Jurong will have a subway line connecting it to Nanjing, a major city, by 2023. \u201cMaybe the price will go back up by then,\u201d he said.\u201cYou never know when the music will stop in China, so you try to do as much as possible before the music stops,\u201d said Nicole Wong, a property analyst at CLSA, a stock brokerage. \u201cWhich it did.\u201dThat store of wealth is looking increasingly shaky. Sales in terms of gross floor area on the market have dropped sharply since September. The share of apartments in new developments that are being sold has plunged since the summer. The number of failed land auctions has doubled this year, indicating that property developers are unwilling or unable to buy land for new developments.Now people are angry, and Chinese officials and property developers are doing something about it. Officials tried various measures to take steam out of the market last year and are now reversing some of them. In recent months, they have loosened mortgage requirements, eased restrictions on when homeowners can resell their properties and made it easier for university students to continue living in the cities where they are studying after they graduate, potentially increasing housing demand. In some cities, property developers have cut deals with home buyers to give them back the difference between the current price and the one they originally paid.As housing prices begin to fall \u2014 in some cities by as much as they did during the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009 \u2014 some buyers have made their displeasure known. Jurong, a small city by Chinese standards of 600,000 people about a 45-minute drive from Nanjing, has experienced at least six protests alone in recent months.Jurong represents a bet by home buyers that a buoyant market in Nanjing, a former Chinese capital and one of its more picturesque cities, will spread to surrounding areas. Many home buyers are retired workers or farmers who have moved to the city from the surrounding countryside.Today the city appears to be preparing for a future in which its population more than doubles. There are 19 other projects like Center Park.Country Garden, the developer behind Center Park and other residential complexes around the country, has endured slumping sales and has slashed prices. It has faced fury from buyers, some of whom have taken to smashing in the windows of sales offices in at least one city, according to the local news media, which posted images and video. In a written statement, Country Garden said fluctuating home prices were \u201ca normal market phenomenon\u201d and said it would \u201cmake proper arrangements\u201d to assuage angry home buyers.Hu Peiliang, the real estate agent in Jurong, and his friend Wang Liwei were selling homes in Nanjing before they decided to make the move to Jurong. If prices were so high in Nanjing, it seemed only logical to both men that prospective buyers who were unable to afford a place there \u2014 or who were locked out of the market because of residential restrictions \u2014 would look to Jurong. The government\u2019s plan to build a metro system made the city even more appealing.At first they were right. In 2016, some 49,000 apartments were sold in Jurong, a remarkable number for a city where the annual average is closer to 4,000, according to Huifeng Li, a research director at the Purple Mountain Digital New Media Research Institute in Nanjing. The majority of the new buyers these days are speculators, he said.Mr. Hu added: \u201cMostly it\u2019s buyers who are looking for investments who come here. They see opportunities here.\u201d Hundreds of buildings sprang up, offering a glimpse of a future bustling city.

Cities committed to GCoM, the largest global alliance of cities and mayors tackling climate change, are already leading this action.% of population living in GCoM urban areasSeoul, South KoreaFor Seoul, one of the most technologically advanced and connected cities in the world, sustainability goals are interlinked with a \u201csmart\u201d strategy and open data. \u201cWe believe open data helps citizens have a better understanding about Seoul\u2019s policies and motivates them to join the city government\u2019s efforts,\u201d says Park Won-soon, the city\u2019s mayor.Under Park, the Seoul government launched the Open Government 2.0 policy in 2012. Under this initiative, all data, except for confidential or personal data, is shared freely and openly on one of the city\u2019s digital platforms. By accessing two websites, Seoul Information Communication Plaza and Seoul Open Data Plaza, the city\u2019s residents can get real-time air quality information and data. Seoul\u2019s Eco-Mileage Program also lets them monitor their energy use and savings, and provides incentives based on the amount of energy saved during a certain period of time.Energy has been a core focus of Seoul\u2019s sustainability efforts. Prompted by the idea that nuclear power\u2019s demands on the environment ultimately make it unsustainable, the One Less Nuclear Power Plant initiative aims to save and produce renewable energy amounting to the energy produced by one nuclear power plant. \u201cOver the past six years, through various programs, the amount of energy saving and renewable energy production reached 4.65 million tons of oil, which is almost the same as the energy produced by two nuclear power plants,\u201d says Park.Chefchaouen, MoroccoChefchaouen, a picturesque town in northern Morocco, is a beloved tourist spot famous for its striking blue streets. But in recent years, this hillside community has been leaning green, taking major strides toward becoming a model for sustainable development in the region. \u201cIn Chefchaouen, civil society plays a central role in driving the city\u2019s leadership and engagement in becoming greener, more sustainable and inclusive,\u201d says Mayor Mohamed Sefiani.One such landmark project is its Energy Information Center, a part of the E.U.-funded Sustainable Urban Demonstration Project. Opened four years ago to raise awareness of saving energy among the public, it is the first initiative in Morocco that targets both businesses and individuals to provide information about energy savings. \u201cThe center aims to assist urban policy makers in the Southern Mediterranean region to address local sustainable energy challenges,\u201d Sefiani says.Chefchaouen has also played an important role in Invest4Cities, GCoM\u2019s initiative that invites investors and donors to fund the development of climate action plans. The aim is to raise up to $200 million for technical assistance for 400 cities, mainly in the Global South. This would also include $600 million for credit enhancement financing for projects related to public transit, e-mobility, bike sharing, energy-efficient buildings, clean energy, waste management and flood walls. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in my own city, Chefchaouen, to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change, but there is always more to be done. Accelerating cities\u2019 access, particularly for those in the Global South, to funding for sustainable infrastructure developments is critical as we work together toward the shared goals of the Paris Agreement\u201d says Sefiani.Edmonton, CanadaWith its inclusive and innovative spirit, Edmonton, the capital of Alberta, is one of the country\u2019s most determined advocates for tackling climate change. \u201cEdmonton was one of the founders of the Partners for Climate Protection Initiative,\u201d says Don Iveson, the city\u2019s mayor. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about climate change since long before it was taken seriously at a subfederal or federal level.\u201dThis year, the city convened a summit of international mayors, which issued the Edmonton Declaration, a bold call for governments at all levels to implement scientifically robust policies to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. An evidence-based approach is at the core of the city\u2019s efforts to fight climate change. \u201cEdmonton is a university town, with great fundamental research,\u201d Iveson says. \u201cThe nation\u2019s largest polytechnic is here. It\u2019s a health-care and life-sciences innovation hub for western and northern Canada.\u201dIn line with the city-level efforts, Edmonton is home to a wealth of start-ups addressing sustainability through technology and innovation. One recent example is Landmark Homes, a builder that aims to use automation and building science to create \u201cnet zero\u201d (i.e., zero carbon emissions generating) houses at the same price as conventional ones. \u201cThe owner, Reza Nasseri, is shifting net-zero from being a boutique, high-end thing to being ready for mass adoption, at no price penalty,\u201d Iveson explains.He stresses that cities in particular need to play a strong leadership role in instilling urgency in the climate change issue. \u201cCities play a really critical role in that we\u2019re able to put a climate lens on decision-making,\u201d he says.things you can do as a city dweller to help reduce global warming:actions cities can take to limit the effects of climate change:The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "As Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown Changes, Food Vendors Keep a Bit of the Old With the New", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe population of Chinatown, one of Manhattan\u2019s few historic immigrant working class neighborhoods, is shifting. How are the people in the food businesses there adjusting?Even when I lived hours away, Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown was my family\u2019s destination for groceries. Decades back, you couldn\u2019t find the same variety and quality of Chinese produce, meats and dried goods in most of the Mid-Atlantic.But that\u2019s changed.Cheaper options in Flushing, Queens; Sunset Park, Brooklyn; and elsewhere in the city have drawn working-class Chinese immigrants away from this neighborhood bordered by trendy SoHo and TriBeCa. As Chinatown\u2019s population changes, what will happen to the grocers and specialty food stores that feed the community?But while New York City\u2019s Chinese population continues to grow, by more than 70 percent since 2000, Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown is losing Chinese residents. According to census data, and the city\u2019s neighborhood map, Chinatown\u2019s Chinese population has declined by 30 percent since 2000.I spoke to some food shopkeepers, who ran first- and second-generation family businesses in Chinatown. Their answers both surprised and inspired me and suggested that while some see a neighborhood in decline, others see merely a transition.Business was brisk, especially on Chinese New Year\u2019s. \u201cIt was actually like a can of sardines.\u201d Mr. Wu reminisced, \u201clong lines throughout the whole day.\u201dSo while his sisters went into medicine and dentistry, he chose the family business. With two floors and 17,000 square feet, Hong Kong Supermarket is one of the largest in Chinatown and larger than most grocery stores in Manhattan: The store has several tanks for live fish and shellfish, a butcher section, a back wall entirely for frozen goods, and a lower level for kitchenware, herbs, rice and noodles.Just a few years ago, Hong Kong Supermarket expanded its selection of products like yogurts and cold cuts, though Mr. Wu explained that it wasn\u2019t just non-Chinese customers who had asked for it. While his customer base used to be more first-generation Chinese, he said now he saw more second-generation Chinese-Americans along with non-Asian customers.\u201cLike dinosaurs,\u201d said Mr. Wu, \u201cif you don\u2019t change with the environment, you won\u2019t be here.\u201dBut he added that despite the relative higher rent in Chinatown, the volume of sales at the Hester Street store still made it the most profitable. On a recent December afternoon, Muoi Truong could be found wearing six layers of clothing and three hats. One shopper considered a box of strawberries and asked, \u201cIs it sweet?\u201dKarlin Chan, a community activist in Chinatown, introduced me to Ms. Truong, who has sold fruit with her husband for over 20 years at this location. Her sister and brother run a similar stand around the corner farther east on Canal. Ms. Truong usually starts at 8 a.m. and works until 10 p.m. (Her mother, 83, often spends the day outside as well.) Would she want one of her four children to continue the business? \u201cOf course not, I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll go to medical school!\u201d she said. Her two oldest are in college, at Columbia University and the University of Richmond. My 80-something-year-old uncle in Missouri said that before he died, he would love to be able to eat cherimoya, a fruit closely related to the soursop and brought to Southeast Asia from the Americas. We sent one from Ms. Truong.Paul Eng really wants to appeal to everybody.The store will also sell conventional tofu, other soy-based products and sticky rice cake to serve older Chinatown residents.\u201cI still want to serve the community,\u201d Mr. Eng said.He had long disliked working at his family\u2019s store. \u201cAny little thing that needed attending to, it had to be done right away, seven days a week,\u201d said Mr. Eng, who was the youngest child. So a few years ago, when his parents and older brothers asked if he wanted to take over the business, he had no interest. But unlike the original shop, the new shop will serve foods like soy custards topped with red and mung beans, boba or grass jelly, a combination he was introduced to while visiting Taiwan.\u201cWho knew?\u201d Mr. Eng\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten all this stuff in separate parts my whole life, but together? Oh my God!\u201dThe name will still be \u5b8f\u5b89, this time transliterated as Fong On. \u201cI\u2019m going to put everything that I know into it,\u201d Mr. Eng added. \u201cThe photography, the marketing, the art direction.\u201dThe customers, and even the vendors, call her \u201cMommy.\u201d\u201cIt would be boring to stay home,\u201d she said. About 30 years ago, after Ms. Wong\u2019s husband passed away, she built up the current business, now managed by her two sons, Freeman, 42, and Steven Wong, 39, along with other family members.But she still comes every day \u201cto point out the things they should pay attention to and how to solve problems,\u201d she added.Freeman Wong spent 10 years in the finance industry. But when his job required a move to Ohio, he decided in 2004 to dedicate himself full time to Aqua Best.\u201cI needed a little bit of time to figure out what I wanted to do,\u201d he said. The business and its block have changed a lot since then. Its neighbors used to be a handful of other Chinese-owned seafood shops, now replaced by an ice cream shop and a Vietnamese restaurant among others. And wholesale makes up 90 percent of its revenue now, with restaurant clients like Blanca and Del Posto, along with nearby Chinese restaurants.Steven and Freeman Wong have partnered with a former executive chef from the restaurant Talde to open a seafood market and restaurant called Essex Pearl. It\u2019ll be ready next spring at the new Essex Crossing, an enormous development on the Lower East Side. The menu won\u2019t be strictly Chinese, but rather a mix of Jewish, Hispanic, and Asian cuisines, a homage to the neighborhood\u2019s history.Freeman Wong said, \u201cThe second and third generation, we\u2019re bringing our own ideas of what Chinatown should be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the origin of the cherimoya fruit. It is native to Central and South America, not Southeast Asia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Growth of Health Care Spending Slowed Last Year", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The growth of national health spending, which surged as millions of Americans gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, slowed last year, the Trump administration said on Thursday.Health spending in the United States totaled $3.5 trillion last year, up 3.9 percent from 2016, or about $10,740 a person. It accounted for 17.9 percent of the economy, officials said.But the rate of increase for the major categories \u2014 drugs, doctors and hospitals \u2014 was more modest than in recent years.For the first time in several years, health spending grew at about the same rate as the economy as a whole in 2017. So the share of the economy devoted to health care stabilized. By contrast, over the past few decades, health spending has generally grown faster than the economy.The 3.9 percent increase last year \u2014 down from 4.8 percent in 2016 \u2014 was the lowest since 2013.\u201cThe relatively low rate of health spending growth in 2017 was similar to the average annual growth during 2008-13, which predated the major coverage expansions,\u201d said Anne B. Martin, an economist in the office of the actuary at the Department of Health and Human Services.In addition, more people with insurance have high-deductible health plans, which tend to make them cost-conscious because they are personally responsible for a larger share of their medical costs.Health spending grew rapidly in 2014 and 2015 because of the expansion of Medicaid and private insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, as well as the use of expensive but highly effective new drugs to treat hepatitis C.The Affordable Care Act was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010, and the main provisions expanding coverage took effect in 2014.Federal spending on health care shot up nearly 11 percent in 2014, mainly because of the expansion of Medicaid, but the growth has slowed every year since then, the report said. Federal spending on health care totaled nearly $1 trillion last year, and that does not count the huge tax subsidies for health care and coverage.Spending on Medicaid, which now covers more than 70 million low-income people and is financed jointly by the federal government and the states, continued to grow in 2017, reaching a total of $582 billion, the report said. But the rate of growth slowed for the third straight year.Medicaid spending \u2014 the total of federal, state and local funds combined \u2014 increased last year by 2.9 percent, following growth of 11.8 percent in 2014, then 9 percent in 2015 and 4.2 percent in 2016, the administration reported.President Trump and Republicans in Congress tried last year to roll back the expansion of Medicaid, but ultimately failed.Federal Medicaid payments increased less than 1 percent last year, following growth of 4.6 percent in 2016 and double-digit growth in 2014 and 2015.Despite alarm over high drug prices, the administration reported that spending on prescription drugs at pharmacies, grocery stores and other retail outlets increased last year by just four-tenths of 1 percent, to $333 billion. That was the slowest growth since 2012, when many blockbuster drugs lost patent protection, driving down prices and total spending.Those figures do not include spending on drugs in hospitals, where patients receive some of the most expensive drugs.Declines in generic drug prices, lower price increases for existing brand-name drugs and a reduction in the number of prescriptions for pain medications contributed to the slower growth in drug spending last year, the administration said.The growth of Medicare spending for hospital care also slowed last year, and federal officials said one reason was increased enrollment in private Medicare plans. Older Americans in these private Medicare Advantage plans \u201ctend to use more physician and less hospital services,\u201d compared with people in the original government-run Medicare program, the study in Health Affairs said.More than one-third of the 60 million Medicare beneficiaries are in private plans, offered by companies like Humana and UnitedHealth.Although the United States spends more on health care per person than any other country, the growth of spending here has slowed in the last decade.\u201cHealth care spending growth averaged 4.3 percent per year during 2008-17, compared to an average annual rate of 7.3 percent over the 1998-2007 period,\u201d the report said.Household spending on health care also slowed last year, increasing 3.8 percent after growth of 4.8 percent in 2016. The main reason, officials said, was slower growth in consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket spending, which includes co-payments, deductibles and payments for services not covered by insurance.Out-of-pocket spending grew 2.6 percent last year, to $365.5 billion, which was slower than the 4.4 percent growth in 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Smoke a Joint, Save the Subway?", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the list of states that have legalized marijuana continues to grow, New York could have a new reason to embrace cannabis: It could help save the subway.Some state and city leaders have started to discuss the idea of making recreational marijuana legal and using the revenue to pay for badly-needed and expensive subway upgrades. The proposal could face improved odds in Albany now that Democrats have taken full control of the State Legislature for the first time in a decade.\u201cThe biggest issue we hear about as elected officials is the state of the subway system,\u201d Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said in an interview. \u201cTo be able to tie these things together is something that could be highly impactful and potentially transformative.\u201dThe idea is still very much theoretical, but it has some prominent supporters and is being considered by a high-profile panel tasked with coming up with ways to pay for a subway overhaul. Any push to legalize marijuana in New York would have to be approved by state lawmakers and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.Another benefit of legal pot: Some subway riders who have been irate over terrible service might become a little more relaxed.State lawmakers have created a panel to recommend new revenue sources for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the city\u2019s subway and buses. The group is considering marijuana legalization as one of roughly a dozen money-generating ideas, said Michael Gianaris, a powerful Democratic leader in the State Senate who was appointed to the panel by Mayor Bill de Blasio.Mr. Gianaris supports marijuana legalization and said the subway could be a good way to spend the revenue.\u201cThere are a lot of needs that we have that new revenues need to be considered for,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe M.T.A. is near the top of my list.\u201dThe panel, known as the Metropolitan Transportation Sustainability Advisory Workgroup, has 10 members. It includes Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a powerful business group, and Melissa Mark-Viverito, the former City Council speaker. Ms. Wylde was appointed to the panel by Mr. Cuomo, and Ms. Mark-Viverito by Mr. de Blasio.Ms. Mark-Viverito, who is running to be the city\u2019s public advocate, plans to announce her support for the idea on Thursday \u2014 a proposal she calls \u201cWeed for Rails.\u201d She wants half of the revenue from marijuana to go toward public transit.New York\u2019s subway, which carries nearly six million people each day, descended into crisis last year and continues to struggle with frequent delays. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the subway, had opposed marijuana legalization.An informal poll of subway riders on a recent evening found broad support for the idea of tapping marijuana as the subway\u2019s saving grace.\u201cThat would be phenomenal,\u201d Enrique Cruz of Harlem said as he rode an A train. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen anyway. It\u2019s a matter of time. So they might as well utilize the money on things that they have unfortunately neglected.\u201dJohn Ottavino, who lives in Brooklyn, agreed, especially as another fare increase is planned for March.\u201cThey have to find another source of money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep tapping out the consumer.\u201dRebecca Tunis said she was frustrated by unreliable subway service, especially on the weekends when stations are often closed for construction work to repair the system.\u201cI think subway riders would probably be willing to do anything for a better subway,\u201d said Ms. Tunis, who lives on the Upper West Side. \u201cPeople are so mad all the time \u2014 I think they\u2019d be willing to legalize anything.\u201dThe subway\u2019s leader, Andy Byford, has proposed a sweeping plan to modernize the subway that could cost $40 billion over ten years. Then the transit agency recently announced that it was facing a budget crisis and would need additional financing to avoid major fare increases and service cuts.Mr. Byford declined to comment on the idea of using marijuana revenue to pay for his plan. Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority, said in an a statement that Mr. Byford was focused on improving service and upgrading the system. In the past, he has said that he was \u201cagnostic\u201d about funding sources.The combination of a cannabis tax and congestion pricing would go a long way toward helping fund the agency\u2019s operating and capital budgets, Mr. Moss said. He urged New York to move quickly to legalize marijuana.\u201cNew York State is not a leader,\u201d his report said, \u201cbut it need not be a laggard.\u201dMr. Johnson, a Democrat and a potential candidate for mayor in 2021, has become increasingly involved in the debate over the future of the subway, pressing for half-price MetroCards for low income New Yorkers and advocating for congestion pricing.Mr. Johnson said he supported marijuana legalization and wanted to see some of the revenue go to the subway and another portion to help communities that have been hurt by discriminatory law enforcement.\u201cNow that the Democrats are going to be in control of the Senate with a large majority, I\u2019m going to look with my colleagues in the Senate to have this conversation,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Alessandra Biaggi, one of the new Democratic state senators who was recently elected, said she supported both congestion pricing and marijuana legalization as funding streams for the subway.\u201cOne source of funding is not going to be enough,\u201d said Ms. Biaggi, who will represent parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. \u201cWhy would we not try to include as many funding streams as possible without having to raise taxes, which a lot of people quite frankly are afraid of doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lean In\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg Problem", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe door to the Lean In office in Palo Alto, Calif., has Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s name on it. The email addresses for Lean In employees bear her initials. And millions of dollars in funding every year for the women\u2019s empowerment organization comes from her.But inside, surrounded by wall art reminding women to be bold, the Lean In staff has a singular message: Ms. Sandberg now has little to do with the group she founded.The sentiment extends beyond Silicon Valley. \u201cSheryl\u2019s not really Lean In,\u201d said Emily Schwarz, who runs Lean In Atlanta, a group of about 2,000. \u201cWe are Lean In.\u201dFor Ms. Sandberg, 49, none of this was the plan. She was widely expected to leave Facebook after the 2016 election and work for President Hillary Clinton, perhaps as secretary of the Treasury. When Mrs. Clinton lost, Ms. Sandberg continued at the company just as it became engulfed in crises.After an initial interview, Ms. Thomas emailed to say Ms. Sandberg remains \u201ca driving force behind all we do\u201d and has for years discussed making her own brand less central to Lean In. Through a Facebook spokeswoman, Ms. Sandberg declined to comment.Lean In inspired outrage from the start.But Ms. Sandberg\u2019s message largely won over the feminist mainstream, and she became one of its iconic leaders. According to the organization, more than 40,000 Lean In Circles now meet regularly around the world, from Fremont County, Wyo., to New Delhi and Paris.Some were drawn to Lean In exactly because of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s business success. They wanted more economic power, and here was a mother of two who had figured it out and whom they could aspire to be like.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at someone who\u2019s in Silicon Valley, a billionaire, one of the most powerful people in the world,\u201d said Julene Allen, describing why she founded Lean In Dayton in Ohio. \u201cHow can I be more influential?\u201dThat tipped the delicate balance of having a corporate leader as a feminist leader.\u201cAll people in power have potential to be corrupted by it, and women are no different,\u201d Ms. Westervelt said. \u201cYour social movement can\u2019t be led by a C.E.O. or the C.O.O.\u201dWhen I attended a few Lean In Circle meetings in 2013 and 2014, most of us had Ms. Sandberg\u2019s book \u2014 with her face on the cover \u2014 on our laps.Her life story inspired us, a group of mid-20s professionals in San Francisco confronting workplace challenges for the first time. And I found the advice, like to stop insulting my own work and to not be afraid of being disliked, useful.The manifesto, which was full of intimate anecdotes, made Ms. Sandberg a household name. It took her out of simply being Facebook\u2019s No. 2 and reframed her as a thought leader and, many fans thought, a potential candidate for president.In Silicon Valley, Ms. Sandberg became the social nexus for a collective of powerful women who met regularly for dinners at her house. At the events, she often invited a guest of honor and did a casual interview, the two in armchairs in front of 30 or so female guests who held plates on their laps.But what has changed is that some of those leaders and even friends of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s are playing down her role, and positioning her as a peripheral character to the movement.\u201cFrom the very beginning, Sheryl drew people in,\u201d said Deborah Gruenfeld, a professor at Stanford and a co-director of the university\u2019s Executive Program in Women\u2019s Leadership. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think of her as all that central to what\u2019s happening right now.\u201dAlexa Crisa, a digital strategist who leads Lean In Atlanta alongside Ms. Schwarz, told me: \u201cWe don\u2019t work at Facebook, we work with Lean In. We only ever even mention who Sheryl is to explain why her experience is relevant to women. That\u2019s where it ends to us in terms of the mention of Sheryl.\u201dThese women were ones Lean In suggested I call.Most anyone not on its list had a different take. Gia Punjabi, a senior finance analyst at Levi Strauss & Company, founded a Lean In Circle in San Francisco in August 2017. She said that she had noticed a recent drop in interest, and that she suspected it was tied to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s changing brand.\u201cAt the end of the day, Lean In is something that\u2019s integrated with Sheryl\u2019s name,\u201d Ms. Punjabi said. \u201cYou can\u2019t know one without the other.\u201dMany in Ms. Sandberg\u2019s corner argue that the news coverage of her role at Facebook has been unfair. They say it is sexist and focused more on Ms. Sandberg than on Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive. Some I spoke with called the claims that she was involved in nefarious behavior false news.\u201cIt\u2019s starting to sound a little bit like a witch hunt,\u201d said Nuala Murphy, the founder of Lean In Belfast in Northern Ireland and chief executive of Moment Health, a health technology start-up.Kathy Andersen, the executive director of the Women\u2019s Fund Miami-Dade in Florida, said the media was trying to fool women into disavowing one of their advocates.\u201cWomen are not fooled by the gender-biased tear-down of Sheryl that\u2019s happening,\u201d Ms. Andersen said. \u201cThey\u2019re fueled by it.\u201dThe critical articles about Ms. Sandberg are rooted in sexism, said Shelley Correll, a professor of sociology at Stanford and the director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research.\u201cFlawed people were involved in the civil rights movement,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t give up on a movement because people aren\u2019t perfect.\u201dOne chilly day in November, I visited the Lean In office, in an open-air shopping center above a Bar Method in Palo Alto. There, I met Ms. Sandberg\u2019s longtime friend Ms. Thomas, who led me past a \u201cProceed and Be Bold\u201d sign and into a room called \u201cPeople First.\u201d\u201cHas Sheryl inspired a lot of what we do here? Of course,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really grown way beyond Sheryl.\u201dShe added that moving beyond Ms. Sandberg\u2019s name was always the agenda for Lean In and was what Ms. Sandberg had wanted. (When I later called another founding member of the Lean In team, she laughed and disputed that characterization. Ms. Sandberg is the organization\u2019s sole source of funding, and no other figures have stepped in to take her place.)Ms. Thomas talked about what Lean In was doing now. The organization had published a fourth annual study with McKinsey called \u201cWomen in the Workplace,\u201d and has created a new workplace justice-oriented deck of cards called 52 Ways to Fight Bias. On the front of each card is a microaggression, like the female executive who is mistaken for a more junior figure; on the back is why it happened, why it matters and what to do.We circled back to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s work at Facebook. Wasn\u2019t it always risky, I asked, to have someone leading such a large company also leading a movement fighting for workplace equality?\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart, engaged woman on all of this \u2014 why is that hard for you?\u201dIt\u2019s hard, I replied, to reckon with the idea that we have taken life and career advice from someone who could be building something that\u2019s not good for the world.For a beat, Ms. Thomas sat silent and looked right at me.She later brought up a study, which she wanted to make clear was apropos of nothing and was part of an \u201cintellectual conversation,\u201d about how we perceive women in power who do something bad.\u201cWomen candidates had an edge out of the gate because people assumed that women were more ethical,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if women did something that was perceived as less ethical, the fall was \u2014.\u201dMs. Thomas stopped herself and did not finish the sentence.She picked up again: \u201cIt was just interesting the complexity around gender and expectations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Wins New I.M.F. Support as Tensions Rise With Russia", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ukraine won a new lending commitment from the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, a lifeline from the West for a country whose economy has been sapped by corruption and war with Russian-backed separatists.Before the new loan was announced, Ukraine had seemed headed toward default with $11 billion in debt coming due within two years.The I.M.F. has been demanding that Ukraine create an independent anticorruption court to crack down on the theft of budget money \u2014 which partly consists of Western aid \u2014 by government insiders. It is also urging the government to raise natural gas prices.The government has said an anticorruption court will be up and running next year.For decades, natural gas subsidies had left Ukraine vulnerable to Russian meddling, as the gas companies whose pipelines enter Ukraine from Russia and the Kremlin had insisted on dealing through middlemen. Some of those middlemen used their profits to finance a political party loyal to Moscow.A genuine market for gas, if it develops, is seen as a long-term solution for providing stability to Ukraine\u2019s economy, either by stimulating companies to tap the country\u2019s own large gas reserves or by importing from a diverse group of suppliers \u2014 rather than relying on a country Ukraine now considers its enemy.The government had resisted raising prices before an election, but agreed in October to increase them by 23 percent. Although the government had pursued the natural gas subsidies, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, said they had hurt the country.\u201cPopulism has led to the weakness of Ukraine,\u201d he said.The new program will last 14 months and will help a fragile recovery in Ukraine\u2019s economy, which is projected to grow by 3.5 percent this year, according to the I.M.F.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What These Medical Journals Don\u2019t Reveal: Top Doctors\u2019 Ties to Industry", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization.One is dean of Yale\u2019s medical school. Another is the director of a cancer center in Texas. A third is the next president of the most prominent society of cancer doctors.However, drug companies have paid his employer nearly $114,000 for consulting and speaking, and nearly $8 million for his research during the period for which disclosure was required. His omissions extended to the Journal of Clinical Oncology, which is published by the group he will lead.Medical journals, which are the main conduit for communicating the latest scientific discoveries to the public, often have an interdependent relationship with the researchers who publish in their pages. Reporting a study in a leading journal can heighten their profile \u2014 not to mention that of the drug or other product being tested. And journals enhance their cachet by publishing exclusive, breakthrough studies by acclaimed researchers.A review by The New York Times and ProPublica found that dozens of doctors have failed to disclose significant conflicts of interests in their journal papers.Calls for transparency stem from concerns that researchers\u2019 ties to the health and drug industries increase the odds they will, consciously or not, skew results to favor the companies with whom they do business. Studies have found that industry-sponsored research tends to be more positive than research financed by other sources. And that in turn can sway which treatments become available to patients. There is no indication that the research done by Dr. Burris and the other doctors with incomplete disclosures was manipulated or falsified.Journal editors say they are introducing changes that will better standardize disclosures and reduce errors. But some have also argued that since most researchers follow the rules, stringent new requirements would be costly and unnecessary.Dr. Alpern said in an email that he initially believed that his disclosure \u2014 that he had been a consultant for Tricida \u2014 was adequate. However, \u201cbecause of concerns recently raised about disclosures,\u201d he said he notified the publication, The Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, in October that he also served on Tricida\u2019s board and had stock holdings in the company.The journal initially told Dr. Alpern that his disclosure was sufficient. But after The Times and ProPublica contacted the publication in November, it said it would correct the article.\u201cThe failure to disclose this information at the time of peer review is a violation of our policy,\u201d Dr. Rajnish Mehrotra, the journal\u2019s editor in chief, said in an email.He later said that an additional inquiry had revealed that all 12 of the article\u2019s authors had submitted incomplete disclosures, and that the journal planned to refer the matter to the ethics committee of the American Society of Nephrology. Dr. Mehrotra also said that the journal had decided to conduct an audit of some recent articles to evaluate the broader issue.In an email, Dr. Arteaga described the omission as an \u201cinexcusable oversight and error on my part,\u201d and subsequently submitted a correction.As the debate continues, an influential group, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, is considering a policy that would refer researchers who commit major disclosure errors to their institutions for possible charges of research misconduct.Medical journals and professional societies strengthened their requirements. The drug industry restricted how it compensates doctors, prohibiting gifts like tickets to sporting events or luxury trips \u2014 although evidence of kickbacks and corruption continues to surface in criminal prosecutions. And a 2010 federal law required pharmaceutical and device makers to publicly report their payments to physicians.Despite these changes, the system for disclosing conflicts remains fragmented and weakly enforced. Medical journals and professional societies have a variety of guidelines about what types of relationships must be reported, often leaving it up to the researcher to decide what is relevant. There are few repercussions \u2014 beyond a correction \u2014 for those who fail to follow the rules.Most authors do seem to disclose their ties to corporate interests. About two-thirds of the authors on the Kisqali study, for example, reported relationships with companies, including Novartis. But the researchers who did not included Dr. Arteaga, Dr. Burris and Dr. Denise A. Yardley, a senior investigator who works with Dr. Burris at Sarah Cannon.The Tennessee-based research center received more than $105,000 in fees for consulting, speaking and other services on Dr. Yardley\u2019s behalf in the three-year period in which she declared no conflicts.The Sarah Cannon institute said it switched over a year ago to a \u201cuniversal disclosure\u201d practice promoted by ASCO, the cancer group that Dr. Burris will lead. That requires doctors to disclose all payments, including those made to their institutions.\u201cWe believe we adhere to the highest ethical standards in the industry by not allowing personal compensation to be paid to our leadership physicians,\u201d the center said.ASCO said it would post corrections to Dr. Burris\u2019s disclosures in The Journal of Clinical Oncology for the past four years. The group said that in the fall of 2017 \u2014 as Dr. Burris was seeking a leadership role in the organization \u2014 it began working with him to disclose all his company relationships, including indirect payments. Dr. Burris will become president in June 2019.\u201cDisclosure systems and processes in medicine are not perfect yet, and neither are ASCO\u2019s,\u201d the group said in an email.Dr. Burris\u2019s updated disclosure listed relationships with 30 companies, including that he provided expert testimony for Novartis.Jennifer Zeis, a spokeswoman for the journal, said that it was contacting those studies\u2019 authors, and that it now asked researchers to certify that they had checked their disclosures against the federal database.Some institutions have pushed back, arguing that the journals\u2019 inconsistent rules make it difficult for even well-meaning researchers to do the right thing.In a letter last month To the New England Journal of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering objected to the treatment of one of its top researchers, Dr. Jedd Wolchok. When he tried to correct his disclosures, the journal shifted its position, from saying its editors were satisfied with his disclosures to saying he had failed to comply with the rules, the center said in citing communications with the journal.This year, JAMA began requiring authors to confirm multiple times that they had nothing to disclose. ASCO has a centralized system for reporting conflicts to all of its journals and speaker presentations.Dr. Bernard Lo, the chairman of the 2009 Institute of Medicine panel, said journals have only begun to confront some of the systemic flaws. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not out in front trying to be trailblazers, let me just say it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that it hasn\u2019t been done means that nobody has it on their priority list.\u201dCharles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shutdown Fight Over Wall Is Likely to Be Delayed Until Just Before Christmas", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe measure, which includes funding for the Homeland Security and Interior Departments and other federal agencies, would push a showdown over funding for a wall on the southern border to Dec. 21, just before Christmas. It is expected to be passed by unanimous consent this week, according to people familiar with the talks.President Trump has signaled that he will sign a short-term measure that does not contain wall funding, but has repeatedly threatened to shut down parts of the government if Democrats do not give him the wall money he has demanded.Instead of continuing the debate over money for a wall and border security, Republicans and Democrats spent the weekend negotiating the terms of an agreement that would delay the original Friday deadline. The Senate also postponed votes until late Wednesday while the House canceled all votes until next Monday to accommodate Mr. Bush\u2019s funeral services.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the two Democratic leaders, also asked the president to postpone a scheduled meeting on Tuesday that would have touched upon the spending debate, according to a Democratic aide.The two-week delay means lawmakers have more time to haggle over the presidential push to allocate $5 billion for a border wall. Democrats have steadfastly opposed providing any more than $1.6 billion for border security, and they want no money allocated for a concrete wall on the southern border, which Mr. Trump promised would be financed by Mexico.Republicans have floated the possibility of spreading the $5 billion over two years, an idea that Mr. Schumer rejected.The stopgap measure means that lawmakers \u2014 including those who are retiring or being replaced come January \u2014 could be forced to remain in Washington at least an extra week while the border wall funding issue is resolved. Negotiations on six of the seven remaining bills are virtually complete and are likely to be packaged together. The seventh funds homeland security.Without an agreement, a shutdown would be limited. Mr. Trump has already signed into law funding measures that cover most of the government, including military, education, health and energy programs. But a partial shutdown would include some high-profile closings for the holiday season, such as national parks.On Monday, the president again attacked Democrats for their aversion to his beloved wall, saying on Twitter that the government \u201cwould save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Cryptocurrencies Survive the Start of Government Regulation?", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchThe government has finally begun a crackdown on the market for cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. Does this spell the demise of digital currencies and the end of initial coin offerings?The Justice Department and the C.F.T.C\u2019s investigation is focused on whether Tether, a cryptocurrency issued by a Hong Kong-based company, may have been used to drive up Bitcoin\u2019s value through well-timed trades. Bitcoin surged 2,000 percent in 2017 to a peak of nearly $20,000, only to tumble more than 80 percent this year.But any nascent market, like that for Bitcoin, has significant growing pains. The question is whether cryptocurrencies are really just a new form of penny stocks, albeit with a much higher valuation.Penny stocks are cheap, thinly traded and not closely followed by analysts. And as anyone who has seen \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Wall Street\u201d knows, they are subject to wild swings and market manipulation by their controlling shareholders. A little bit of good news \u2014 whether true or not \u2014 can double or triple the stock\u2019s price overnight. That is when those in control of the stock can dump their shares and leave those gullible enough to invest in the hope of getting in on the ground floor of the next big thing with losses.Cryptocurrencies are subject to many of the same issues as penny stocks. Most of the trading takes place on unregulated platforms overseas. While many call themselves \u201cexchanges,\u201d they provide virtually none of the protections afforded to investors in stocks and bonds. With no clear records of who is trading, manipulating the price may not be very difficult for sophisticated participants looking to pump up the price.By the end of the month, the S.E.C. had also settled charges with the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and the music producer Khaled Khaled, known as DJ Khaled, for their promotion of digital tokens issued by a start-up called Centra Tech. The men did not disclose that they received payments for making online postings that hyped the digital coin, the regulators said. Mr. Mayweather agreed to give back the $300,000 he received, pay an additional $300,000 penalty and adhere to a three-year ban on promoting other investments. Mr. Khaled will pay back the $50,000 he got, as well as a $100,000 penalty.For the naysayers of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, this is the anticipated end of a speculative bubble, much like the tulip mania in 17th-century Holland or the dot.com implosion. That does not necessarily mean that this type of investment will disappear, but greater government scrutiny will raise the costs for trading platforms and could effectively eliminate initial coin offerings if they must be registered with the S.E.C.Just like penny stocks, digital tokens have seen their fair share of scam artists and questionable uses. As the government puts more resources into policing the trading of digital assets, the decline in cryptocurrency prices may well accelerate as those who fear being a target of fraudulent conduct wait for a time when there are greater protections for investors. The question is: Will cryptocurriences survive for long enough for us to ever see that day?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the U.S., Young Hockey Goalies Are Coming In From the Cold", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWant to make some American hockey goaltenders laugh? Ask how much instruction they received while growing up.For those whose careers finished by the year 2000, the most common answer is little to none. Coaches largely ignored them. Clinics, when they actually took place, were limited to one week in the summer.Bob Mason, the Minnesota Wild\u2019s goalie coach, grew up in hockey country \u2014 International Falls, Minn. \u2014 and said he got all the way to the N.H.L. in 1984 before anyone actually coached him on technique.\u201cThe way I learned in high school was copying the guys in front of me,\u201d Mason said of a group that included Kevin Constantine, who went on to become an N.H.L. head coach. \u201cThat was my video.\u201dThe person at the center of this goal is Ron DeGregorio, who was president of USA Hockey from 2003 to 2015.\u201cIn everything we did, I always wanted to have a goal we could measure, something that would be a reach but attainable,\u201d DeGregorio said in a telephone interview from Salem, N.H., where he lives. \u201cWe really wanted to focus on minutes because that was a measure of excellence in our training \u2014 in my view, anyway.\u201dIt was DeGregorio, a former college goaltender himself, who eventually began to push for more robust goaltending instruction from youth coaches within USA Hockey\u2019s development programs. Giving every coach two or three goalie drills to run before practices would help, he thought, along with promoting goaltending as a cool position to play.The growth of American goaltending schools over the last 15 years has helped some players \u2014 but generally the ones whose parents could afford to pay for the tutoring. American goalies like Tim Thomas and Jonathan Quick were winning Vezina and Conn Smythe trophies in the N.H.L., but over all, youth-level coaching for goalies was still hit or miss, particularly for young goalies from families of modest means.Ultimately, USA Hockey officials want a coach on every youth staff who is qualified to teach goaltending. So, in line with DeGregorio\u2019s thinking, USA Hockey, in the last few years, began hiring goalie-development coordinators for each of its 34 affiliates. It has also created a goalie-coach development program and posted instructional webinars and videos of goalie drills on its website and mobile app.\u201cWe wanted to remove that stigma behind, `I can\u2019t coach goalies because I didn\u2019t play goalie,\u2019 or, `I\u2019m not going to talk to them because I\u2019m afraid to mess them up,\u2019\u201d said Phil Osaer, who presided over the youth-goaltending program for USA Hockey from 2015 until a few months ago, when he took a job scouting for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\u201cWe started the rhetoric of, if you\u2019re a hockey coach, you have to coach all of your hockey players,\u2019\u2019 Osaer said. \u201cAnd goalies are just hockey players.\u201dOsaer, a former minor-league goaltender, said he was one of the lucky ones, to a degree. His pee-wee hockey team in Michigan did have a goalie coach \u2014 a rarity back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Still, that was just a small part of his formative years. In other years, there was no instruction at all.Kevin Reiter, who is a director of player personnel for USA Hockey, had the same sort of challenges growing up in Pittsburgh, where he mainly learned how to be a goaltender by emulating Tom Barrasso, the Penguins\u2019 goalie at the time.\u201cGuys like Kevin and I were, in a roundabout way, neglected as kids, \u201d Osaer said. \u201cSeeing that as a player and a coach, we decided to come up with efforts that would change that for future generations.\u201dThree years later, the Washington Capitals hired Strelow as the N.H.L.\u2019s first full-time goalie coach, and he went on to work for the Devils and San Jose Sharks before his death in 2007. U.S.A. Hockey\u2019s national team goaltending camp is named for him.Recent goaltending prospects like Spencer Knight, a goalie for the U.S. national team at the world junior championship that began this week in British Columbia, have benefited from a more specialized path. Raised in Darien, Conn., Knight switched from forward to goalie as an 11-year-old. A fan of Henrik Lundqvist and the Rangers, he liked the pressure that came with the position. And he loved the equipment. \u201cI thought the gear was really cool,\u201d he said.His parents \u2014 Chris, a retired Darien police officer, and Lilly, who works in finance \u2014 sent him to Pro Crease Goaltending, a goalie school in East Berlin, Conn.\u201cMy parents laid out a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate my parents were wiling to pay for that and let me fulfill my dream of playing goalie.\u201dKnight excelled at the All-American Prospects Game in St. Paul in September, stopping 12 of 13 shots and twice foiling Jack Hughes, the likely No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 N.H.L. amateur draft.Now Knight is bound for Boston College and is a potential first-round draft choice himself.One person who likes this stepped-up emphasis on goalies is Jamie Langenbrunner, a two-time Stanley Cup champion forward who is now the player-development coordinator for the Boston Bruins.\u201cIt\u2019s such a specialized position,\u201d said Langenbrunner, who coached Knight\u2019s team in the Prospects game. \u201cThe skill, the teaching of it, is difficult. I\u2019ve been in hockey for a long time and I couldn\u2019t tell you the first thing about teaching a goaltender. We\u2019re working on it. We\u2019ve done all right, but to continue working on it is great.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname for one of the American N.H.L. goalies. He is Jonathan Quick, not Swift.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "She Stood Up to Cuomo. Soon She\u2019ll Be the First Woman to Lead the N.Y. Senate.", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe private meeting last year between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democrats in the New York State Senate was going as many did: Mr. Cuomo was pontificating and the Democrats were listening, neither side particularly pleased.The Democrats were asking for the governor\u2019s help in winning elections and breaking up a group of eight Senate colleagues who had crossed party lines to help keep Republicans in control of the chamber. But Mr. Cuomo suggested that the Senate Democrats\u2019 problem was that they only understood New York City voters.Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Democrats\u2019 leader, interjected.\u201cYou look at me, Mr. Governor, but you don\u2019t see me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see my black skin and a woman, but you don\u2019t realize I am a suburban legislator.\u201dAlbany insiders were stunned that Ms. Stewart-Cousins had rebuked Mr. Cuomo, who is known to hold a grudge. And they were especially struck that she had invoked her race, a topic she often plays down.The meeting with Mr. Cuomo eventually helped lead to the disbanding of the Independent Democratic Conference, the renegade Democratic group, and paved the way for Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s rise.Ms. Stewart-Cousins, 68, declined to elaborate on that meeting or describe what had prompted her response. But she said the episode, although surprising to some, was emblematic of her history for speaking up \u201cin places and spaces whether other people might not.\u201d\u201cMy being here is not a natural progression,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI think that people have underestimated me over the course of my political career.\u201dOn financial issues, she has been more moderate, emphasizing her suburban district in southern Westchester County, and promising to hold the line on taxes.But as Ms. Stewart-Cousins prepares to redefine the so-called three men in a room \u2014 the governor and the leaders of the Assembly and Senate \u2014 she remains untested as a majority leader.Not only will she have to navigate negotiations with Mr. Cuomo and the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, she must also wrangle the views of more than three dozen Democratic senators \u2014 more than a third of whom are newly elected.Of those, several are first-time state lawmakers from New York City who have said they would push Albany aggressively left.Ms. Stewart-Cousins has acknowledged the unpredictability of what the majority will bring, albeit with her usual air of imperturbability; when a reporter asked how her presence would change Albany\u2019s closed-door negotiations, she replied with a smile, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019ve not been in the room.\u201dBut past interactions offer a sense of her approach.In early 2017, criticism peaked after three more Senate Democrats joined the I.D.C. Rumors swirled about who would be next to go.Ms. Stewart-Cousins quietly met with senators individually. She acknowledged having little to offer by way of stipends or committee chairs \u2014 all the prerogative of the majority. But she made a case for why they should stay.With some, she appealed to cherished progressive ideals. With others, she made clear that she and her deputy, State Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, had begun talking to grass-roots progressives about their antipathy to the I.D.C., and how that might play out in the primaries.While she did not make threats, she also did not mince words, Mr. Gianaris said.\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of saying, \u2018Hey, Donald Trump is president now, people are not screwing around \u2014 is this really something you want to be doing, jumping to the side of the line with him?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gianaris recalled. \u201cAnd making that point less diplomatically.\u201dNo other senators broke off. The I.D.C. disbanded in April, and Democratic primary voters ousted many former members in September.Many Democrats considered those private conversations a turning point. Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s penchant for listening, they said, made it possible.\u201cMy members, for the most part, I know each and every one of them,\u201d Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. \u201cAnd I know what\u2019s important to them.\u201dThat approach has made her an outlier in Albany, where predecessors often have burnished the capital\u2019s cutthroat reputation.When she first ran for the State Senate, in 2004, allies of her opponent \u2014 Nick Spano, a powerful 18-year Republican incumbent \u2014 were complacent, according to his brother, Michael Spano, now the mayor of Yonkers.\u201cWe weren\u2019t worried,\u201d Mr. Spano said. \u201cAnd that was a mistake.\u201dNick Spano acknowledged the power of Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s approach. \u201cThat style is disarming.\u201dIndeed, Ms. Stewart-Cousins is collaborative, sometimes to the point of self-effacement, which has earned her the fierce loyalty of her senators. After Mr. Cuomo brokered the long-awaited dissolution of the I.D.C., Ms. Stewart-Cousins declined to accept a reunification deal on the spot, telling the governor that she would need to consult her conference.She ducks questions about a specific agenda for next year, and she demurred when asked if she wanted to advance any issues particularly dear to her.\u201cI will always want to hear what the conference cares about,\u201d she said.Senator Liz Krueger, of Manhattan, said critics often mistakenly interpret Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s brand of leadership for a lack of having any.\u201cAndrea probably wouldn\u2019t be defined as a political animal, where everything\u2019s a political move,\u201d Ms. Krueger said. But, she continued, \u201cI think we\u2019re all starting to learn that she knows how to play the politics game also, even if it means finding the right people to do those pieces for you.\u201dSenator Brian A. Benjamin, a Democrat from Harlem, said Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s leadership style seemed born of her experiences as a black woman.\u201cI would imagine that she has had some familiarity with being undercounted, underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cI see her, as she leads, making sure that people are heard. That her members have a say. That no one\u2019s overlooked.\u201dStill, Ms. Stewart-Cousins rarely refers to those stories.She speaks readily and sweepingly of her devotion to progressive causes \u2014 women\u2019s rights, voting rights, housing justice \u2014 but doesn\u2019t usually say whether those views might have been shaped by her parents\u2019 experiences with job discrimination, her childhood in public housing or by becoming a single mother at 19.Ms. Stewart-Cousins also does not often bring up the story about her ubiquitous colorful scarf, which she started wearing so that people would be able to tell her apart from the other black female elected official in Yonkers.In an interview, she said she had not built her political career around her identity as an African-American woman, in part, because it would have been a mismatch for her district.As she did with Mr. Cuomo last year, she more often emphasizes her geographic roots rather than her race or gender. (Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said that no one was offended at the meeting.)If Ms. Stewart-Cousins wanted to seize on identity politics, an opportune time arose last year, when Daniel S. Loeb, a billionaire political donor, likened Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s opposition to increased charter school funding as doing as much harm to black people as the Ku Klux Klan.Yet at certain moments, in front of certain audiences \u2014 a women\u2019s business group, a Black Westchester Magazine radio show \u2014 she acknowledges her own story. And it becomes clear that it is never far from her mind.\u201cPeople assume that we\u2019ve had a certain consciousness for a very, very long time, and the reality is that we have not,\u201d she said of the recent importance of diversity in public life. \u201cWe have constantly had to assert our version of the dream for ourselves.\u201dAli Watkins and Jesse McKinley contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Michigan G.O.P. Starts Limiting Power of Incoming Democratic Leaders", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLANSING, Mich. \u2014 Michigan Republicans, following the tactics of conservative lawmakers in Wisconsin, moved on Thursday to start limiting the power of the incoming Democratic secretary of state and set the stage for additional curbs on the Democrats who will take over as governor and attorney general in January.The G.O.P.-led State Senate in Michigan, voting largely along party lines, passed a bill that strips the incoming secretary of state of the authority to oversee campaign finance issues and hands it to a new bipartisan commission. Other bills, which are likely to be approved next week, include proposals that would weaken the ability of the governor and attorney general to control the state\u2019s position in court cases.A major difference between Wisconsin and Michigan, however, may be their Republican governors.In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker, who was denied a third term in November, is now weighing the bills to limit his successor, Tony Evers; Mr. Walker has not indicated how he will act, but he has worked in concert for years with Republican legislative leaders there.In Michigan, however, the outgoing governor, Rick Snyder, has long portrayed himself as a relatively pragmatic former businessman, rather than a hard-right ideologue like Mr. Walker. Michigan Democrats think their best chance of success lies with Mr. Snyder, who has, at times, broken with the most conservative members of his own party.A spokesman for Mr. Snyder said Thursday that the governor has not taken a position on any legislation yet, nor indicated whether he would sign it.In November, Jocelyn Benson became the first Democrat to be elected Michigan\u2019s secretary of state in more than 20 years. Gretchen Whitmer, a former member of the state legislature, was elected governor, and Dana Nessel is the attorney general-elect.All three are women, while the Republican legislative leaders and outgoing governor in Michigan are men \u2014 a dynamic that could be in the spotlight next week, when Democratic-led protests are expected at the State Capitol.\u201cI reject this incivility and discord,\u201d Ms. Whitmer said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThis legislation needlessly divides and won\u2019t deliver results. It won\u2019t clean up our water. It won\u2019t improve literacy or fix the roads.\u201dWisconsin Republicans also used their postelection lame-duck session to force through several proposals that would limit the power of the incoming Democratic administration and limit early voting, which tends to benefit Democratic candidates. Republican leaders there argued that the state had allowed too much authority to shift to the executive branch, despite acting after eight years of Republican control under Mr. Walker.In Michigan, however, the proposed bills are even more wide-ranging. In addition to the ones aimed at incoming Democratic lawmakers, there is also a host of bills about conservative legislative priorities, including limits on benefits for union workers and the reduction of some environmental protections.State Senator Dave Robertson, a Republican from Grand Blanc, Mich., rejected the accusation that the moves were aimed at Democrats. When asked if he was trying to limit power from Democrats, Mr. Robertson laughed.The hardball political maneuvers, which critics have characterized as a subversion of democratic principles, are testing the limits of American partisanship, as lawmakers in one party try to enact 11th-hour proposals over heavy criticism. Mass protest action is being planned in Michigan for next week, when the majority of the bills will have their final votes before heading to the desk of Mr. Snyder.\u201cLAME DUCK WATCH,\u201d read a T-shirt worn at the Capitol building by Sam Inglot, the deputy communications director from Progress Michigan, which is working to organize progressive groups to pressure lawmakers.\u201cIt\u2019s a last grasp at power,\u201d said Christine Greig, the Democratic floor leader in the Michigan House, in an interview. \u201cIt really makes you think that they are sore losers and they just want to take their ball and go home with it.\u201dThe challenge for Ms. Greig and groups like Progress Michigan is in getting Republican lawmakers to split from their own party. As in Wisconsin, the state legislators forging ahead with the controversial bills are not only Republicans, but deep-red conservatives who represent tightly gerrymandered districts engineered to produce conservative results.In Wisconsin, Democrats chose to engage in protests at the State Capitol building, packing the rotunda and chanting in committee hearings to shame Republicans into different action. Michigan Democrats, however, plan to try to persuade Mr. Snyder to take their side and stop the proposed bills from becoming law.In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Snyder said the governor would carefully examine the coming bills and take a nonpartisan approach.\u201cIn this case, where the authority of different branches of government is affected, he will look at the bills as if he were continuing as governor,\u201d said the spokesman, Ari Adler. \u201cHe won\u2019t look at the bills based on who is in the governor\u2019s office or which party they represent.\u201dDemocratic leaders in the state are hoping mass action could sway him to defy his party. Brandon Dillon, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, said Mr. Snyder\u2019s decision is a legacy-defining one.\u201cThe governor is going to have to make a decision on if he wants his legacy to be the same as someone like Scott Walker \u2014 or like someone who actually walks out of office with the proper respect for the office he occupies,\u201d Mr. Dillon said. \u201cThe legislature is going to do what the legislature is going to do. But this is his decision to make.\u201dTwo notable bills in Michigan have already emerged out of the lame duck session and are awaiting Mr. Snyder\u2019s final decision.One dramatically changes the state\u2019s paid sick time law, making it only applicable to companies with 50 or more employees and adding other exemptions. Another slows a previously planned minimum wage hike, which was set to also raise the minimum wage for tipped workers.Both measures were supposed to head to the November ballot for voters to consider, but were removed after lawmakers passed laws identical to what the voters would approve. Then, after the election was over, Republican lawmakers reversed the bill\u2019s original language, ensuring that both measures would be decided in their favor without voter input.At the Michigan Capitol building Thursday, several Republicans avoided or declined requests for interviews. Democrats said what they called cynical actions by Republicans have not only left them without much political recourse, but personally stunned.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely disheartening,\u201d said Nigel Tann, political director for Good Jobs Now, a Detroit-based group protesting the recent bills. \u201cBut then again, anyone who has been in this work has been feeling disheartened for a while now. We\u2019re used to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
