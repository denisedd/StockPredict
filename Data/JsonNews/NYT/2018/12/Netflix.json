It\u2019s a good exercise, gets the mind working nicely and helps in the matter of kitchen confidence as well. Try a free-form pasta puttanesca: olive oil, garlic, anchovies, canned crushed tomatoes, pitted black olives, capers and red-pepper flakes, to serve over linguine or spaghetti or bucatini or whatever dried pasta you happen to have in the house. I like it with shells sometimes, for how the olives get lost in them.It\u2019s simple work: Saut\u00e9 the anchovies and a lot of garlic in a lot of olive oil while your salted pasta water comes to a boil in a big pot. (How many anchovies? How many you got? I go minimum four, and same with cloves of garlic.) When the fish are melted and the garlic\u2019s gone gold, add the tomatoes and stir everything together. Let that simmer a while, get a little thicker, then add the olives and capers and red-pepper flakes until it\u2019s as fiery as you like. Taste for salt and pepper. Keep simmering and, when the pasta is done to your liking, taste again, then toss it with sauce and serve.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Normal: It\u2019s a Buyer\u2019s Market", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "With the luxury real estate market in a funk and the rest of the market weakening, what works now? Price cuts, sweeteners and pop-up yoga classes.Supported byThree guests arrived for the recent opening of a three-bedroom rental in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan, with an asking price of $12,589 a month. But no one brought a checkbook \u2014 likely on account of the yoga pants.Such is the state of New York\u2019s luxury housing market, where repurposing, rebranding and, crucially, re-pricing luxury apartments has become the new normal. Amid a glut of new inventory, deals are still happening, but not before buyers and renters exact their pound of flesh. And with continued uncertainty about the economy, rising mortgage rates and the prospect of higher taxes looming, the market isn\u2019t likely to improve soon.So what hath the buyer\u2019s market wrought?Price cuts are deepening, and agents expect more sellers to bend next year. Some developers are negotiating sweeteners, like offering to pay transfer taxes or common charges for a year or more. The rental market shows improvement, but uncertainty remains.And the slowdown has convinced a growing number of developers to get creative with empty apartments \u2014 enlisting tech start-ups that flip unleased rental units for extended-stay travelers or turning unused living rooms into makeshift amenities. Others have doubled down on high-end marketing, while some have delayed listing properties altogether. Even film and TV crews are in on the act, as location scouts turn increasingly to empty luxury apartments for inspiration.Through the first three quarters of the year, 84 percent of ultraluxury listings \u2014 the priciest 10 percent in Manhattan \u2014 sold below the original asking price, up from 65 percent in 2015, when the market was riding high, according to StreetEasy. The median price cut remained unchanged at $500,000, which could suggest sellers need to cut deeper still, said Nancy Wu, an economic data analyst for the company.\u201cIt feels worse when you\u2019re out in the trenches,\u201d said Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, which puts out a weekly report on contracts signed on properties seeking $4 million and up. That segment has taken an average of 441 days to go into contract so far in 2018, the longest stretch since at least 2013, when similar homes spent 172 days on the market. Through Dec. 2, $4 million-plus homes were reduced on average by 9 percent before a contract was signed, but Ms. Olshan believes that after sellers make additional concessions, the actual discount is closer to 15 or 20 percent.She predicts that 2018 will finish with 6 to 10 percent fewer $4 million-plus contracts signed than last year, when 1,172 were signed, and roughly 20 percent fewer than during the peak year of 2013.Some are taking aggressive steps to jump-start sales. Last month, the luxury developer Extell announced that it would pay three years of common charges on its one- and two-bedroom apartments and up to five years on three- to five-bedrooms that go into contract before the end of the year \u2014 a sizable incentive, considering the company owns some of the most expensive condos in the city, including the upcoming 179-unit Central Park Tower in Midtown. Prices there are expected to start at $1.5 million for a studio, according to filings with the state attorney general\u2019s office. The most expensive units have not yet been revealed, but the annual common charges for a five-bedroom asking $78.1 million would be $127,596, according to the filing, or almost $638,000 over five years.Extell ran a similar promotion in some buildings last year, but has since extended the offer to its entire portfolio, said Tamar Rothenberg, a senior vice president with the company, adding that the push was partly prompted by a \u201csignificant amount of product\u201d on the market. In many cases, however, winning concessions from sellers is like pulling teeth.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to tell an owner who wants $8.5 million that it\u2019s worth $6 million,\u201d said Frances Katzen, an agent with Douglas Elliman. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear it, and they usually end up firing the agent.\u201dBut cut they must. Nikki Field, an agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, represents the second brokerage to work on selling the 10,000-square-foot, triplex penthouse at 212 Fifth Avenue, in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan. In 2016, it languished at $68.5 million. Ms. Field and her team came on the following year and raised the price to $73.8 million, but by this November they had re-listed it for $62.8 million, an $11 million discount.In addition to lowering the price, they furnished the formerly raw space with more than $5 million in furnishings and art, from luxury brands like Fendi Casa and Bugatti Home to works by Carroll Dunham, the painter and father of the actor Lena Dunham. \u201cHowever you boil it down, it\u2019s all about price,\u201d said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime Manhattan Residential, who notes that most new units on the market would benefit from a price cut of at least 10 percent. At 100 Barclay, an Art Deco condo conversion in TriBeCa, where sales began in 2015 and where the developer is still unloading new units, Mr. Dankner is listing a three-bedroom resale for $4.09 million.His clients, who bought the apartment in 2017 for $4.35 million, will be taking a loss at that price, but they have agreed to Mr. Dankner\u2019s strategy, because they are competing with similar but more expensive new units in the same building, not to mention the broader market.\u201cYou have to be nimble enough, and eat some humble pie,\u201d said Mr. Dankner, who first listed the unit in September for $4.65 million, and has since dropped the price four times, by increments of 3 to 4 percent. He said he was confident they would have a deal in the next few weeks.With new competition coming to market, coupled with general buyers\u2019 hesitance, time is of the essence for sellers. \u201cAsking too much and passing that three-month point is death,\u201d said David Walker, the chief executive and a founder of the brokerage Triplemint.His agency has recently urged clients, especially those with homes priced over $4 million, to hold off officially listing their properties for about a month, while Triplemint quietly builds interest and gets feedback from prospective buyers. The hope is to get qualified bidders, and a sense of the property\u2019s real worth, before wasting days online.To find motivated prospects, the agency aggregates user data from its website and pulls from a mix of third-party subscription services to narrow down a list of likely buyers. Mr. Walker would not reveal the sources of the data, but similar strategies have mined consumer purchases to find people who might be more likely to buy real estate because of a major life event like marriage or pregnancy.\u201cNone of these things mattered in 2017, when the market was stronger,\u201d he said.Softness in Manhattan\u2019s luxury market has helped the rental market in recent months, but there is still cause for concern.In October, the rental vacancy rate fell to 1.49 percent, the lowest level for that month in nine years, according to a Douglas Elliman report. But that also marked the 41st consecutive month in which the share of landlord concessions had increased over the previous year. Some 41 percent of leases included sweeteners for renters, like a month or more of free rent, up from 28 percent in the same period last year. And over the next several years, more than 22,000 rentals are expected to be built in Manhattan, about half of them currently in some stage of construction, according to Nancy Packes Data Services. In some cases, hard-to-sell condos are seeking renters in the short term, which adds more competition to the rental market, said Jennifer M. Stutz, of Olshan Realty. While the rental market improved last quarter, she said, heading into 2019 \u201cit\u2019s still up in the air.\u201d \u201cWe bring them a new type of demand,\u201d said Alexandros Chatzieleftheriou, a founder and the chief executive of Blueground, noting that the softening market has been a boon for business.For instance, the company leased a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea that might have rented unfurnished for $5,000 a month. It signed a multiyear agreement on the unit, outfitted the space with stylish furniture and amenities like a stocked bar cart and espresso machine, and now rents the space for roughly $6,000 a month. The developer fills an otherwise empty unit, and Blueground turns a profit.\u201cWhat I was paying in hotels was substantially more,\u201d said Jared Anderson, 36, who lives in Florida, but travels to New York weekly for his work at a furniture company, and signed a one-year lease on the space.\u201cI would say it\u2019s pricey, but you get what you pay for,\u201d said Ali Kole, a cosmetics consultant from Boulder, Colo., whose company paid for her one-bedroom in the same building, for $6,450 a month \u2014 shorter stays have higher premiums. No complaints otherwise: After a three-month stay, she leased another unit in the building for three more. (The company\u2019s apartments are not regulated like Airbnb units, because the shortest lease agreements are for one month.)Other start-ups, like hOM, the yoga and social events planner, have given developers and landlords another use for vacant space. At Aalto57, the luxury rental tower in Sutton Place, residents attending an intimate yoga class sat in lotus position, barefoot on the new hardwood, facing an expensive Bertazzoni gas range in a luxury three-bedroom apartment. The unit was listed in November for $12,589 a month, and is offering two months of free rent.The events are a way to boost tenant retention in the building, said Francesca Loftus, the company\u2019s chief executive. Property managers pay hOM a subscription fee, from $2,100 to $30,000 a month, to plan events for residents in amenity spaces and unused apartments. The company currently holds about 50 classes a day, in more than 50 residential buildings in New York. (The majority of the classes are in residential buildings, with about a third in unused apartments.)\u201cThere\u2019s this sort of word-of-mouth marketing benefit,\u201d said Scott Marino, the executive director of multifamily management for Rose Associates, the property manager. Residents who take classes in such units might someday want to upgrade, he said. Other builders have developed an affinity for Hollywood. The Durst Organization began fielding requests from movie and TV producers to film in its buildings about five years ago, said Jordan Barowitz, the company\u2019s vice president of public affairs.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more interest in the residential side, as of late,\u201d said Mr. Barowitz, adding that the company has brought in \u201cwell north of seven figures a year\u201d through the agreements.Recent shoots at Via, the developer\u2019s Far West Side luxury rental tower with an unusual pyramidal facade, have included Bollywood sagas and an upcoming Netflix project. The productions pay from $5,000 for a few hours in an amenities space or apartment to $100,000 for a multiday shoot, Mr. Barowitz said.Via leased its final units about a year and a half ago, Mr. Barowitz said, but it has had more vacancies recently, as several two-year leases expired. He stressed that the company\u2019s growth in the film world isn\u2019t tied to the strength of the rental market; it is simply an arrangement that has created another revenue stream.At the Hub, a rental tower in Downtown Brooklyn, a homegrown film director found inspiration in a vacant penthouse.Spike Lee recently filmed an episode of the forthcoming second season of the Netflix series \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d in a two-bedroom apartment listed for $6,643 a month. That apartment, and the rest of the building, is now leased. Tim Stacker, the location manager for the series, said he had noticed an uptick in developers offering empty apartments for film shoots.\u201cNew developments are attractive to film and TV, because you don\u2019t have to deal with existing tenants, the units are empty, it looks pristine,\u201d said Douglas C. Steiner, the Hub\u2019s developer, who is also the chairman of Steiner Studios, one of the largest film studios in the country.\u201cI\u2019m hoping not to have empty units,\u201d Mr. Steiner said. But the film business hasn\u2019t treated him poorly either, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s found money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tech That Was Fixed in 2018 and the Tech That Still Needs Fixing", "Date": "2018-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixFrom Facebook to creepy online ads, the worst tech of the year made the internet feel like an unsafe place to hang out. Yet there were some products that were fixed, our personal tech critic writes.Personal technology was so awful this year that nobody would think you were paranoid if you dug a hole and buried your computer, phone and smart speaker under six feet of earth.Facebook made headlines week after week for failing to protect our privacy and for spreading misinformation. Juul, the e-cigarette company under investigation for marketing products to teenagers, emerged as the Joe Camel of the digital era. And don\u2019t get me started on just how intrusive online advertising has become.On the other hand, there was good technology this year that improved how we live, like parental controls to curb smartphone addiction and a web browser with built-in privacy protections.For the last two years, I\u2019ve reviewed the tech that needed the most fixing and the tech that was fixed for the first time. This year, I\u2019m repeating the tradition in hopes that the list of lows gets shorter and the list of highs gets longer over time. The bottom line: Social media companies demonstrated they could barely be trusted with our data and were still trying to get a handle on all of their issues. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for problems like hate speech and misinformation. And keeping our information private is not really in the interest of many of these companies, which use our data to target us with digital advertising. Speaking of which: Online ads became so intrusive in 2018 that they increasingly ruined people\u2019s web-browsing experiences and raised more hackles about privacy.The online ads industry became so good at tracking our web browsing activities that it increasingly knew precisely what we were thinking about buying. If you did a web search for a blender, for example, you could be certain that a digital ad for that blender would follow you around. In addition, the autoplay videos embedded on many news sites were ruthless about shouting for our attention while draining our batteries and burning through data plans.These fixes are not ideal because they take a long time to put in place, and blocking ads hurts media businesses. That means there\u2019s work to do on this yet.The Food and Drug Administration this year announced restrictions that allowed stores to sell most flavored e-cigarettes only in areas where minors were not permitted. The agency also said it was investigating whether Juul, which accounts for more than 70 percent of e-cigarette sales, intentionally marketed its products to youths. Juul has since suspended its social media promotions. E-cigarettes notwithstanding, at least parents can worry less about their children\u2019s addiction to smartphones. This year, Apple released Screen Time, a feature for people to set restrictions on the amount of time they spend on their iPhones. The software includes the ability for parents to remotely monitor and limit their children\u2019s iPhone use.Firefox could still be better. Chrome, for instance, is still faster at loading some web pages. But after a harsh year when consumers lost faith in how companies like Facebook managed their data, it feels heartening to know that someone in the tech industry is making a browser for the people.So did we get to a shorter list of personal tech lows and a longer list of highs? Not quite. I guess there\u2019s always next year. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Season of Turmoil", "Date": "2018-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization.Hundreds of doctors packed an auditorium at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on Oct. 1, deeply angered by revelations that the hospital\u2019s top medical officer and other leaders had cultivated lucrative relationships with for-profit companies.One by one, they stood up to challenge the stewardship of their beloved institution, often to emotional applause. Some speakers accused their leaders of letting the quest to make more money undermine the hospital\u2019s mission. Others bemoaned a rigid, hierarchical management that had left them feeling they had no real voice in the hospital\u2019s direction.The day after the meeting, the hospital\u2019s chief executive, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, promised greater openness with rank-and-file doctors about decision-making. He also committed to doing the \u201croot-cause analysis\u201d requested by the doctors of how \u201cegregious conflicts of interest,\u201d as one physician put it, had been allowed to happen.Other hospitals around the country are confronting similar dilemmas. But at Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation\u2019s leading cancer research and treatment centers, they are especially acute. Internal emails, audio recordings of meetings and interviews with doctors show how this major New York institution has struggled to contain a crisis of confidence in its leadership.Closer ties between nonprofit research centers like Memorial Sloan Kettering and corporations are being fueled by a rush of potentially breakthrough cancer treatments. Venture capital firms and drug companies have looked to cash in on the scientific discoveries, said Brad Loncar, the founder of an investment fund that focuses on cancer. \u201cMoney follows success,\u201d he said, and Memorial Sloan Kettering has been a focus \u201cbecause they conduct terrific science there.\u201dIn recent years, the hospital, like its competitors, has struck increasingly sophisticated deals to commercialize its discoveries, in some cases receiving equity stakes in start-ups rather than simply collecting royalties.The predicament of Memorial Sloan Kettering also reflects a shift in its own culture. Its prior chief executive, Dr. Harold E. Varmus, a Nobel-prize winning scientist, personally kept companies at arm\u2019s length, while Dr. Thompson, also a respected cancer researcher, has more fully embraced such relationships. The new approach has been applauded by some for expanding access to the cancer center\u2019s discoveries, even as others have worried that the hospital may be losing sight of its mission.\u201cWe do have to sort of decide which side of this we\u2019re on, or at least notice that we are feeding at the very trough that is causing worse access here than in any other Western country,\u201d Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the hospital\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, said at the Oct. 1 meeting.Even as Memorial Sloan Kettering leaders have promised greater transparency, they have engaged a public affairs firm, SKDKnickerbocker, to manage their message and have aggressively pushed back against the idea that the hospital\u2019s leaders are too close to industry.\u201cI can see how someone might think that business relationships are problematic,\u201d said Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, who has stepped into Dr. Baselga\u2019s former position at Memorial Sloan Kettering on an acting basis. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, as someone who works with patients, and I\u2019ve worked with patients throughout my entire career here, that working with industry has helped me save lives.\u201dThe Times and ProPublica asked to speak to Dr. Tabar and Dr. Brown about the critical remarks they made about the hospital\u2019s direction at the Oct. 1 meeting. Mike Morey, managing director of the communications firm engaged by the hospital, arranged for them to speak to reporters on the phone while he listened. The doctors said they were not specifically referring to Memorial Sloan Kettering during the meeting that was recorded by one of those in attendance, but to broader changes in the medical world.It now operates more than 120 research laboratories, employs more than 1,000 doctors, admits some 23,500 patients a year, operates one of the world\u2019s largest clinical trial programs and had revenues of nearly $4.5 billion in 2017. It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York\u2019s social calendar.As a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies. While it did business with industry during the tenure of Dr. Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, he and a top deputy, Dr. Robert E. Wittes, did not consult for companies, own their stock or serve on their boards, according to several people who worked for Dr. Varmus while he was at the hospital from 2000 to 2010. Dr. Varmus and Dr. Wittes declined to comment.But some on the hospital\u2019s board wanted its chief executive to do more to encourage company-financed clinical trials and to bring discoveries to market. In an interview, John R. Gunn, the cancer center\u2019s chief operating officer from 1987 to 2015, said board members felt gems of research were \u201clying fallow and nobody was kind of pushing it, to commercialize it.\u201dBy the time Dr. Varmus left to direct the National Cancer Institute in 2010, Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s board was looking for a leader who was as comfortable in a corporate board room as in the lab, according to several longtime current and former cancer center employees.Dr. Thompson met those criteria. He headed the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, was the co-founder of a biotech start-up, Agios, and served on the board of Merck.His early tenure was marred by controversy. In 2011 and 2012, he was sued by his former employers, the Abramson center and the University of Pennsylvania, which accused him of walking off with valuable research and using it to start Agios. At the time, Dr. Thompson denied wrongdoing and the suits were later settled for an undisclosed sum.But several doctors who worked under Dr. Baselga said in interviews that he had an abrasive style and created a culture where ties to industry were not kept in check. Dr. Baselga has not responded to requests for comment.Dr. Baselga\u2019s conflicts were not overseen by Dr. Hudis\u2019s committee, but by the audit committee of the hospital\u2019s board of directors. \u201cI was told this was pretty standard for the highest level executives,\u201d said Dr. Hudis. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why any clinician would have separate rules from any other.\u201dMr. Morey said the hospital is evaluating its process for reviewing conflicts of interest, but that executives like Dr. Baselga had their financial relationships overseen by the board \u201cto protect faculty from being put in a position of having to review their supervisor\u2019s potential conflicts.\u201dEthicists and health experts say having leaders and researchers at nonprofit hospitals sit on corporate boards is especially problematic. When they serve on the board of a publicly traded company, they have a legal duty to the corporation and its shareholders, which can clash with their duty to their patients and primary employers. Those who sit on boards are often paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can serve two masters,\u201d said Dr. Bernard Lo, who led an influential Institute of Medicine panel in 2009 that investigated financial conflicts in medicine. \u201cThe whole reason for being in the cancer care business is that you\u2019re trying to help people in need, and that\u2019s not at all the company\u2019s main purpose. It\u2019s to generate profits on their products.\u201dThough he takes no salary from AngioGenex, Dr. Benezra owns nearly nine percent of the company he helped found through stock or options, setting him up for a lucrative payday if the company is acquired or its drugs come to market.Dr. Benezra said in a statement issued through the hospital, \u201cWhile I do not work directly with patients, I hope that this important science can one day make an impact in the lives of cancer sufferers.\u201dMr. Morey said Dr. Benezra spends just 30 hours a year on business related to the publicly traded company. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about 45 minutes a week, which is less than what most people spend on Netflix in a night,\u201d Mr. Morey said.Dr. DeAngelis, the acting physician-in-chief, said the high number of Memorial Sloan Kettering leaders who serve on corporate boards is reflective of their stature. \u201cMaybe we should turn this around and say, we have more people on corporate boards because people value the opinions from our faculty,\u201d she said in an interview.Referring to Dr. Thompson and Douglas A. Warner III, the outgoing chairman of the hospital\u2019s board of managers and overseers, who is known as Sandy, he said, \u201cAs far as I can tell neither Sandy nor Craig understand this very basic point. And if you don\u2019t recognize that a problem exists there is no chance you will solve it.\u201dHe also said, \u201cMaking billions is not our mission. M.S.K. is a nonprofit with a fundamentally social mission.\u201dDr. Begg declined to comment.Mr. Warner also addressed the doctors, informing them that the board was assessing whether Dr. Thompson should remain on Merck\u2019s board.\u201cShould Craig continue to sit on the Merck board? We have no policy on that,\u201d Mr. Warner said, according to the transcript, noting that Dr. Thompson\u2019s role on the board was initially seen as a \u201cgood thing\u201d when he joined the hospital. \u201cWe need to step back from that now and ask ourselves whether that continues to be appropriate, whether it\u2019s appropriate in the future.\u201dThe next day, Oct. 2, Dr. Thompson announced that he was resigning from both the boards on which he served.Requests to interview Dr. Thompson and Mr. Warner were declined. Instead the hospital arranged for reporters to speak to Dr. DeAngelis, who said she saw nothing wrong with the corporate ties that Dr. Thompson had earlier said were under review.She downplayed the concerns voiced by Dr. Begg about the culture of the hospital. \u201cHe is a biostatistician. He does not work with patients. He works with data,\u201d she said, adding that he does not have \u201cas full an understanding\u201d about policies to prevent doctors with corporate ties from having an undue influence on clinical trials.\u201cWe expect the piece to question the ethics of some of our most accomplished researchers and clinicians.

{"Headline": "How the Rage of \u2018Network\u2019 Went From Prophecy to Nostalgia", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the stage adaptation of the landmark film opens on Broadway, Howard Beale\u2019s uniting anger seems almost innocent and endearing.Mr. Belcher is an editor in the Hong Kong office of the Opinion section.Who knew it would turn out to be a terrifying glimpse into a future of paranoia, rage and the power of a fourth network to not only sway public opinion but blur \u2014 or perhaps obliterate \u2014 the line between truth and fiction.Forty-two years later, \u201cNetwork\u201d is on Broadway as a play at a time where that very sentence \u2014 and dozens of others from Paddy Chayefsky\u2019s not-a-word-wasted screenplay \u2014 are almost jaw-dropping in their relevancy to today\u2019s fractured and embittered America.And as the director Ivo van Hove\u2019s new stage version proves, the power of \u201cNetwork\u201d is its portrayal of how the public feeds on the promise of a savior \u2014 even an angry one. The rage that pours out of Howard Beale, the film\u2019s fallen angel of a newsman who is pushed out of his anchor chair only to become a voice box for the fed-up average Joe and Jane, was a rare public display on a fictitious TV network that felt all too real. But in the waning days of 2018, public airing of rage is a minute-by-minute spew-fest on Twitter or your choice of the social media du jour. Somehow \u201cNetwork\u201d feels almost touchy-feely nostalgic.This is perhaps what is almost negating about adapting \u201cNetwork\u201d to the stage. Mr. van Hove and his creative team have certainly updated this version with the technology of in-your-face video and a modern TV studio set (though still set in the late \u201970s). The actor Bryan Cranston embodies Howard Beale with a similar desperation and pent-up bitterness that earned Peter Finch a posthumous Oscar for best actor. The wrinkles in Mr. Cranston\u2019s weary face are a performance unto themselves.But \u201cNetwork\u201d is a time capsule. For those of us who came of age during the glory years of the holy trinity of ABC, CBS and NBC, the power of \u201cNetwork\u201d was its absurd idea: a fourth network, fictitiously called UBS, which is the underdog network that dares to usurp that trifecta with provocative programming and what is ostensibly a reality TV show that blends news and slanted political interpretations to prey on Americans\u2019 fears. Ring a bell?So as this fourth-network scenario came true in America \u2014 along with cable TV and the present-day onslaught of premium channels and the comfortably numbing power of quality shows on HBO, Showtime, Netflix and others \u2014 \u201cNetwork\u201d has remained not just a period piece but an almost psychically inspired glimpse into the future. It is that rare gem of American cinema that is both dated and ultimately timeless and most certainly a bellwether of how America has lurched forward over the decades. Other such films could be \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d (Hollywood abandoning its silent-film stars for sound and fury) or \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d (an equally brilliant satire at the height the Cold War) or \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d (an X-rating and Best Picture Oscar winner during the tumult of the Vietnam War).Much of the success of \u201cNetwork\u201d was its relevancy to the news at the time: the post-Watergate malaise and sense of betrayal by a president who flat-out lied to the American public (imagine!); the abduction of the heiress Patty Hearst; the two attempts on President Gerald Ford\u2019s life; the rise of homegrown American terrorism by political activists; the corporate takeover of television networks. There is a sort of innocence to these events from the perspective of our far more volatile world. Kidnapped heiresses! Good heavens!Perhaps the most revealing moment in \u201cNetwork\u201d comes near the beginning when Ms. Dunaway\u2019s character and her colleague, played by Robert Duvall, realize that Howard Beale\u2019s ratings are skyrocketing \u2014 that the more he loses it on the air, the higher the ratings go. They can no longer ignore the fact that a divided, soul-crushed America wants an unhinged anchorman to lead them to salvation.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on network television,\u201d Mr. Duvall\u2019s character says, to which Ms. Dunaway nods ever so gentle obviousness, but tinged with menace and power.Viewed from 2018, that\u2019s a chilling moment \u2014 one burned on celluloid from the dizzying bicentennial year of 1976. People might see this film in 50 to 100 years as a nostalgic depiction of old media, complete with wisecracking journalists in period costume. Viewers may not make the connection to its prophetic vision of the future, just as we don\u2019t see, say, \u201cThe Front Page\u201d as depicting the power of newspapers in 1920s America. \u201cNetwork\u201d captures a moment in time when network television was nearing the end of its reign. Perhaps that\u2019s all its legacy will be in half a century.Ah, to see \u201cNetwork\u201d from such a viewing platform: learning life from a sarcastic cartoon rabbit and being swayed by just a TV set in your living room.David Belcher is an editor in the Hong Kong office of the Opinion section.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Digital Data Gives Billboard Owners More Reason to \u2018Love a Good Traffic Jam\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingThe increasingly lengthy commute isn\u2019t just a traffic jam. It\u2019s a captive audience for advertisers.\u201cWe love a good traffic jam,\u201d said John Miller, vice president of sales and sales operations for Lamar Advertising in Baton Rouge, La. \u201cWe are all about eyeballs on billboards, and the increased amount of traffic is helping us.\u201dLamar has 175,000 billboards throughout the United States, Mr. Miller said, adding that slower traffic had helped the company\u2019s data collection program determine who was looking at the board and for how long. Using anonymous data from mobile devices and apps, Lamar has figured out how fast cars are passing by, how much \u201cdwell time\u201d drivers spend paying attention to billboards, what the demographics of the drivers are, and even where they live, travel and shop.Roughly three years ago, Clear Channel Outdoor started its own data collection service, Radar. Using global positioning data from mobile apps that require mapping \u2014 navigation, dating, shopping and restaurant ads \u2014 the service blends third-party demographic data with information about people passing billboards to determine not only where commuters will spend, but how.\u201cNow we\u2019re starting to understand what mobile devices we saw exposed to our billboards, and we look back in time and say, \u2018Where else have we seen those devices?\u2019\u201d said Dan Levi, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Clear Channel Outdoor. \u201cIn the case of businesses trying to get people into Target, we say, \u2018What are the locations that are the most efficient in getting people whose devices we\u2019ve seen in Target?\u2019\u201dHe noted that a recent analysis of fast-food customers in Southern California had found a strong (and perhaps counterintuitive) correlation with their going to the gym, largely because commuting whittled away time for sit-down meals and other forms of exercise. It also showed that billboards for gyms worked better when placed near a commuter\u2019s workplace than near his or her home.Mr. Miller said that data could also help digital billboards, which make up 2 percent of Lamar\u2019s billboard inventory, change to meet an advertiser\u2019s needs at specific times of the day. That could mean a movie studio\u2019s billboard mocking traffic congestion at the height of rush hour, a Dunkin\u2019 billboard changing from coffee in the morning to sandwiches at night, or sequential billboards telling a story.If advertisers can\u2019t catch commuters\u2019 eyes with billboards, they are also trying to reach them through radio.For instance, iHeartMedia \u2014 which owns Clear Channel Outdoor \u2014 has spent the last three years looking at listener behavior on both its radio stations and its app. Its research has produced data that iHeartMedia now sells to advertisers along with demographic information and specific ad time.However, Robert Pittman, chairman and chief executive officer of iHeartMedia, said commuters were so bombarded with information that advertisers might get them to want a product or service in the moment but not get them to remember once they\u2019re out of their cars.Mr. Pittman said introducing a Taco Bell breakfast menu to commuters when they\u2019re hungry, suggesting they drink Bacardi rum when they get home or pitching a car dealership while they\u2019re stuck in their clunker put those advertisers foremost in a commuter\u2019s mind when they\u2019re most susceptible to persuasion.When 20th Century Fox was preparing to release the Queen biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d this year, iHeartRadio stations used peak commute times to air interviews about the rock band, Mr. Pittman said. On Nov. 1, a day before the film\u2019s release, different versions of the six-minute title song played across all 650 iHeartRadio stations and sites.\u201cThe longer the commute and the more time they\u2019re in the car, the more they\u2019re looking to enjoy the experience in the car or to make it at least more tolerable,\u201d Mr. Pittman said. \u201cWe really try to make the programming that way, and we\u2019re able to bring our advertising partners into it as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen some amazing ads on my 2 train going back in the morning and coming back in the evening,\u201d Ms. Sarnoff said. \u201cIn this market, I\u2019ve seen advertisers really raise their game, and people\u2019s expectations of what people are going to see when they go into the subway are high.\u201dOutfront Media is rolling out 50,000 digital video boards at subway and rail stations in New York, the Bay Area, Washington and Boston.\u201cBrands like Casper and Seamless have becomes household names by sharing their brand stories with subway riders,\u201d Mr. Male, Outfront\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cSmart brands like Spotify, StreetEasy and WeWork leverage consumers\u2019 predictable travel paths, frequency and time spent, and in-the-moment-in-time mentality to drive app usage, sales and site visits.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of the advertising technology company Intersection.

{"Headline": "Facebook Data Scandals Stoke Criticism That a Privacy Watchdog Too Rarely Bites", "Date": "2018-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers, consumer advocates and even former commission officials were clamoring for tough action against Facebook, arguing that it had violated an earlier F.T.C. consent decree barring it from misleading users about how their information was shared.But the enforcement official, James A. Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm \u2014 echoing Facebook\u2019s own argument \u2014 cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm\u2019s reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.Almost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country\u2019s de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.\u2019s future.\u201cThey have been asleep at the switch,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.\u201dThe agency \u2014 overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president\u2019s party \u2014 is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.\u201cIf the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,\u201d Mr. Simons said in a statement. \u201cOur investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.\u201dThe agency\u2019s defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.As the federal government\u2019s main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.But it is hampered by its relatively small size \u2014 about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency\u2019s enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn\u2019t have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.\u201cThey have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,\u201d said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.F.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as \u201cKidVid.\u201d Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.\u2019s power to issue new regulations.Even today, \u201cin just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,\u201d said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.Fears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.\u201cThey think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. \u201cThey have an institutional culture of deference.\u201dNor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.(The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebook used the data.)Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.Ashkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn\u2019t see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi\u2019s data could not identify specific individuals.Ms. Ohlhausen\u2019s staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.With limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should \u201cpursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.\u201dBut that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.Two former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.In recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users\u2019 locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.Mr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm \u201chas dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.\u201dMichael LaForgia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Chen, a tech columnist, meaning my job is to obsess over tech news so you don\u2019t have to. So here\u2019s the CliffsNotes version of the week in tech.I remember a time when tech companies were desperate to be in the news. Just a decade ago, making headlines usually meant a company\u2019s gadget or software product was making a big splash and getting nice publicity. But nowadays, tech companies are more powerful than ever, and journalists are focusing on holding them accountable rather than cheerleading.The documents revealed how Facebook treated user data as a bargaining chip.

The arrangement involved sharing user data with those parties that other companies were restricted from obtaining.Canada\u2019s Justice Department said she was sought for extradition to the United States but did not give a reason.

{"Headline": "5 Ways Facebook Shared Your Data", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Facebook gave many large technology companies special access to users\u2019 information. Here\u2019s how it worked.Yahoo said people who opted in to its new features would see their Facebook friends and the articles those friends had read, in a \u201cfacebar\u201d at the top of the Yahoo News site. To accomplish such sharing, the Netflix application had to be able to send Facebook messages. But Netflix was given the ability not only to send private messages but also to read, write and delete them, and to see all participants on a thread. A Netflix spokesman said the company was not aware it had been granted such broad powers and had used the access only for messages sent by the recommendation feature.Netflix deactivated the feature about a year after it was introduced, but documents show that the company still had access to users\u2019 messages in 2017. Spotify, which continues to offer its own similar recommendation feature, also said it was unaware of the special access.Beginning in 2010, if people visited one of those partner sites while logged in to Facebook, a blue bar on the screen would let them know the site was receiving their Facebook data to personalize what they saw. For example, people might see what movies their friends liked, or get tailored search results based on preferences gleaned from Facebook.Facebook eventually wound down instant personalization, but it continued to allow some sites, including Bing and Rotten Tomatoes, access to much of the same data they had been getting for the discontinued feature.The internal documents shed light on a Facebook feature called \u201cPeople You May Know,\u201d a friend-suggestion tool that has long confused and unsettled users. In some deals, Facebook shared information with other companies and in turn received people\u2019s contact details \u2014 data Facebook used to develop complex friend network models and suggest more connections, the documents show. The partners that fed information to the tool included Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei.The tool incorporated Facebook friend lists and allowed people to share articles and make recommendations to other readers. The feature was shut down in 2011, but The Times continued to have access to friend lists until 2017. The Times spokeswoman said they were unaware of the continued access and were not receiving any data for the feature from Facebook.Advertisement"}

In 2018, it became harder for the tech and media industries to ignore those voices, with more consumers and lawmakers discovering how extensive, secretive and unstoppable data collection can be.\u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Steve Satterfield, director of privacy and public policy at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201dGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cThere are so many aspects of how companies deal with the public that obfuscates what actually goes on and so many attempts to placate people using jargon,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who write privacy policies who admit \u2014 they admit \u2014 that they aren\u2019t written for the public.\u201dIn their survey this year, researchers led by Professor Turow found that most Americans did not understand privacy policies on websites. More than half did not know the correct answer to this true-or-false statement: \u201cIf a website has a privacy policy, that means the site won\u2019t share user information with other sites or companies without permission.\u201d (The statement is false.)The researchers also found that most Americans did not know that companies can legally collect and keep personal data on 13-year-olds as if they are adults. Companies are able to do that because the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law, extends only to children who are 12 and under.\u201cI would argue that\u2019s because people can\u2019t imagine that the law would allow this kind of attitude,\u201d Professor Turow said. The researchers conducted national surveys in 2015 and this year, working with two polling companies to interview a representative sample of Americans on their landlines and cellphones.The findings are particularly notable as tech companies and marketers argue that individuals should be responsible for understanding and navigating all of these policies and their privacy settings. Some people may delete Facebook, but what about Instagram and WhatsApp? Avoiding Google for search purposes is one thing. Then try avoiding Gmail, YouTube and Waze.Advertisers are watching closely as Americans question these services. They are the ones, after all, paying to use all this data to send messages to the right consumers. There is a stark difference between targeting consumers who are eagerly sharing their information for so-called relevance and targeting those who have given up, and who may not even understand how, exactly, their data is being collected and interpreted.\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that Americans see privacy as an important issue,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cThe question is: What do you do about it?\"Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018White Christmas\u2019 (1954) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.It was twelve years ago that Bing Crosby was in a place and a film called \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d wherein he sang a little number tagged \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d written\u2014as was all the music in that picture\u2014by Irving Berlin. The occasion was happily historic, for a reason we scarcely need recall: \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d and Mr. Crosby became like \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and Kate Smith\u2014so much so, indeed, that the notion of starring Mr. Crosby in a film that would have the title \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d was broached as long as six years ago.Various obstructions beset it, but the purpose was ultimately achieved. \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d with Mr. Crosby, opened yesterday at the Music Hall.What\u2019s more, it is in Technicolor and VistaVision, which is Paramount\u2019s new wide-screen device, and it has Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen in addition to its focal star. A new batch of Irving Berlin numbers comprises its musical score. Paramount, to put it simply, has done \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d up brown.But, oddly enough, the confection is not so tasty as one might suppose. The flavoring is largely in the line-up and not in the output of the cooks. Everyone works hard at the business of singing, dancing and cracking jokes, but the stuff that they work with is minor. It doesn\u2019t have the old inspiration and spark. For one thing, the credited scriptwriters\u2014Norman Krasna, Norman Panama and Melvin Frank\u2014have shown very little imagination in putting together what is sometimes called the \u201cbook.\u201dThey have hacked out a way of getting two teams of entertainers\u2014a pair of celebrated male hoofers and a singing sister act\u2014to a ski lodge in New England (reminiscent of the Holiday Inn) which happens to be run by the good old general of the outfit the fellows Were in during the war. And to show their appreciation of the good old general and the difficult circumstances he appears to be in, they provide free entertainment and call in a big rally of comrades for the Christmas holidays.It is a routine accumulation of standard romance and sentiment, blessed by a few funny set-ups that are usually grabbed with most effect by Mr. Kaye.And the music of Mr. Berlir is a good bit less than inspired Outside of the old \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d which is sung at the beginning and the end, there are only a couple of numbers that have a measure of charm. One of these is \u201cCount Your Blessings,\u201d a song of reassurance that Mr. Crosby and Miss Clooney chant, and another is \u201cThe Best Things Happen While You\u2019re Dancing,\u201d which Mr. Kaye sings and to which he and Vera-Ellen cavort. Three numbers are given over to the admiration of generals and Army life, which seems not alone an extravagance but a reckless audacity.Even the sweetness of Dean Jagger as the old general does not justify the expense. Someone\u2019s nostalgia for the war years and the U. S. O. tours has taken the show awry. Fortunately, the use of VistaVision, which is another process of projecting on a wide, flat screen, has made it possible to endow \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d with a fine pictorial quality. The colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring\u2014or very little\u2014such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn\u2019t hit the eardrums and the funnybone with equal force.Running time: 127 minutes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy and E.U. Reach a Budget Deal, as Populist Plan Runs Into Reality", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 This time, Italy\u2019s populists blinked.Since taking power in June, Italy\u2019s populist government has outmaneuvered political opponents, out-screamed its loudest critics, used the press for target practice and waltzed away from scandals unscathed. Italian and European liberal forces that sought to stop their rise have seemed powerless to lay a glove on them.But on Wednesday, the populist juggernaut slammed into reality, the only force that seems capable of slowing it down.After months of torturous negotiations, acrid insults, internal tensions and enough social media airtime to fill a Netflix series, Italy\u2019s populist leaders bowed to the demands of the European Union to roll back its expensive, rules-flouting budget. It did so in the face of costly penalties and potentially debilitating economic punishment inflicted by the international markets, real-world forces that threaten to inflict genuine pain on their electoral base.\u201cThe U-turn from the Italian government,\u201d financial analysts at Barclays wrote in a note to clients, indicated that the populists had realized \u201cthe potential perils involved with Italy holding unreasonable fiscal policies and an anti-E.U. stance.\u201dInvestors, on edge over the possibility of Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, causing an economic disaster that could infect all of Europe, breathed a sigh of relief. Markets reacted warmly to the deal, and the Milan-based stock market rallied and borrowing costs fell.The initial budget spent billions on a universal income plan, essentially an enormous unemployment program, that would benefit the base of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement in the chronically underemployed south. Five Star\u2019s coalition partner, the League, demanded tax breaks and a lowering of the retirement age. Critics considered the promise a hand out for the League\u2019s base of workers in the north.The initial budget had a spending deficit equal to 2.40 percent of gross domestic product, a figure considered onerous for a country with such a burdensome debt.For months, Italy refused to budge. But on Wednesday, it yielded by shaving billions of euros off the budget.Speaking in Brussels, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice-president responsible for the euro, announced that the agreement would leave Italy with a budget deficit next year of 2.04 percent of gross domestic product.A substantial part of the savings, he said, \u201cstems from the delayed entry into force of the two main expansionary measures \u2014 the citizens\u2019 income and the rolling back of pension reforms.\u201dPierre Moscovici, the bloc\u2019s commissioner for economic and financial affairs, who for months fought with Italy\u2019s populists, said \u201cthe agreement of today shows unambiguously that the Commission is not the enemy of the Italian people, as some people would like to describe us.\u201dHe added that \u201cI hope that after today we can move beyond these caricatures, both ways, and I hope that today we can also put to rest any doubts over Italy\u2019s place in the European Union.\u201dTo bring Italy back into the fold, Brussels, which originally wanted the budget spending to be no more than 1.6 percent, chose vinegar over honey. Eager to instill structural changes in Italy, it took a hard line and made it clear that it would begin a process that could punish Italy with costly fines for breaking its agreements.In addition to trimming its spending plans, the Italian government responded by promising to sell off public buildings and to impose stiffer fines and higher interest rates on tax dodgers.It revised its growth forecast from 1.5 percent, which Europe and the markets found deeply unrealistic, to less than 1 percent, which Europe and the markets find only mildly unrealistic.Officials in Europe, who are eager to prevent more chaos in what many consider the soft southern underbelly of the European Union, characterized the deal as Italy\u2019s recommitment to the bloc and to the euro.The Italians tried, with some difficulty, to claim they had gotten what they wanted.In an address to the Italian Parliament, which will have to approve the budget by the end of the year to avoid another round of negotiations with Brussels, Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said that the \u201cdetermined\u201d negotiations had paid off. He said the government never did anything to \u201cbetray the trust\u201d of its voters.Instead, speaking over heckles from opposition senators, Mr. Conte, who once said there was no \u201cPlan B\u201d to the original budget proposal, said that the technicians in Brussels had shown how the government actually needed less money \u201cthan initially foreseen.\u201dContrary to the official statement in Brussels, he said, plans for a universal income and lowering the retirement age would not be delayed, a claim helped by the fact that no official start date for the programs had ever been offered.\u201cWe never backed down on content,\u201d he insisted, adding, that the government \u201cnever retreated.\u201dIt sure seemed like they had.Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s powerful deputy prime minister and leader of the League party, had earlier said that he would not budge from the 2.4 percent spending figure, \u201cnot even if baby Jesus arrives.\u201d He insisted that he would not allow even \u201cone comma\u201d of the budget to be changed. \u201cItalians come first,\u201d he said at another point. \u201cItaly no longer wants to be a servant to silly rules.\u201dOn Wednesday, he sounded like he suddenly took those rules more seriously. \u201cTo have avoided the infringement procedure is the victory of common sense for the good of Italian citizens,\u201d he said.Mr. Salvini\u2019s governing partner, Luigi Di Maio, the political leader of the Five Star Movement and the minister of both economic development and labor, had in September called the proposed budget \u201chistoric.\u201d\u201cIn a decisive manner, with this measure, with this budget, we will have abolished poverty,\u201d he said on Italian television.Throughout the negotiations, Italy\u2019s populists tried to rally popular support against Brussels with their usual mix of aggressive language, social media attacks and public outrage. Mr. Salvini insinuated that the Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was a drunk, while the Five Star co-founder, Beppe Grillo, mused about his potential mental illness.But none of it seemed to work.On Wednesday, critics of the government hoped to exploit the government\u2019s vulnerability. The previous government argued that the negative reactions of the financial markets to the government\u2019s provocations had cost Italians real money.\u201cFor the first time, Italy\u2019s budget was launched in Brussels,\u201d Paolo Gentiloni, the prime minister with the previous center-left government, who had proposed a budget with a 0.8 percent deficit, wrote on Twitter. \u201cSovereigntists without sovereignty. The economic effort of the last six years liquidated in six months.\u201dBarclay\u2019s, the financial analysis firm, added in its note that \u201cthe experience of the past six months suggests the Italian government may be more mindful of the effects that anti-E.U. rhetoric can have, which is also a positive development in our view, albeit unlikely that a populist coalition such as this will fully abandon such a stance.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Just Don\u2019t Ask Him About Bond.", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Word WithWritten by Jed Mercurio (\u201cLine of Duty\u201d), \u201cBodyguard\u201d stars Madden as David Budd, a PTSD-afflicted Afghanistan war veteran assigned to protect the home secretary, Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes), whose hawkish politics he loathes \u2014 and icy allure he can\u2019t resist.When it debuted in late August, the numbers were staggering: According to the BBC, 41 million (and counting) watched the six-episode set, making \u201cBodyguard\u201d the highest-rated drama since \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d Then in October, \u201cBodyguard\u201d moved to Netflix and was widely binged, leading to Golden Globe nominations for both Madden and the series, in the best television drama category.\u201cPeople asked me, \u2018Did you know it was going to do so well?\u2019 And no, I didn\u2019t have a clue because it was about surviving quite a grueling shoot,\u201d Madden said. \u201cAnd to think this little British TV show that we all worked really hard on had such an impact is a bit overwhelming for me. I think one in four people in Britain watched it, which is crazy.\u201dIt also solidified Madden, a 32-year-old Scotsman, as leading-man material and cast him as a front-runner to replace Daniel Craig as the next James Bond. Make what you will of reports that he favors a vodka martini. But if Madden knows anything, he\u2019s not saying.In a phone interview from Los Angeles as he prepared for awards season, he talked about the alchemy of \u201cBodyguard\u201d and keeping his cool under the paparazzi\u2019s glare. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Those ratings! What was the magic formula?I wish I knew because I could recreate it on every job I did. [Laughs] It\u2019s something to do with this gray zone that we all live in, this moral ambiguity. Things can sometimes be so clean-cut in who\u2019s the bad guy and who\u2019s the good guy. And this straddled the lines of both, and played with the audience\u2019s perception.Then there\u2019s Budd\u2019s steamy relationship with his powerful boss. I understand that\u2019s not such a far-fetched story line.Actually, we worked closely with a lot of men who had been in that position \u2014 looking after foreign dignitaries and members of Parliament and royalty \u2014 and said, without naming names, that these bonds do get made and the lines do get very crossed. Because this person that you live with all the time, you see them a lot more than you do your own family, and you go through extreme situations. And thus, that kind of intimacy does happen.What was so grueling about the shoot?It was six-day weeks, and we were filming 14 hours a day, and the camera was always on my character. And I had this bulletproof vest on the whole time, and that\u2019s physically uncomfortable. But it was more down to the mentality of someone who\u2019s struggling very much with mental health issues while trying to keep his life together.Surely there has to be a second season.Later this spring you\u2019ll sing and dance your way through \u201cRocketman,\u201d starring Taron Egerton as Elton John and you as John Reid, his former manager and boyfriend. So I guess you\u2019re going to be a different kind of sex symbol.[Laughs] I don\u2019t know about that. Have you seen my hair in the movie? It\u2019s very long and very \u201970s, with some real big blow-dries going on and huge crests and things. And dyed very black along with my eyebrows, which was not fun to live with. I looked like my eyebrows had been Sharpied in.So, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Have your friends from the show told you how it ends?I don\u2019t know how it ends, and I wouldn\u2019t let them tell me. Not that they would, but I don\u2019t let them have conversations around me about it because I don\u2019t want it to get spoiled. That\u2019s the joy of not being in the show. I can just enjoy it as a viewer without having read the scripts and knowing what\u2019s coming next. And I think they filmed multiple endings, so I don\u2019t even know if they know.Did they ask you for \u201cBodyguard\u201d spoilers? The show was on weekly in the U.K., so everyone did lots of speculating. You binged it [in the United States]. You didn\u2019t get that watercooler chat.Now for the topic you\u2019ve been avoiding: 007. [Squeezes out a small chuckle.] So many people have such great ownership over that character and who they think should play it, so for people to be endorsing me publicly, that\u2019s very, very flattering. But no, there\u2019s not any conversations being had on that front. That\u2019s all just speculation.Is Bond someone you would like to play?You know, I\u2019ll see what happens in the future. Yeah, I think we\u2019ll deal with that when we get to it.Is it true that you have a neighborhood alert system for when the paparazzi are hiding in trees?Yeah, on my street, there is a little WhatsApp group just because the photographers hide outside the house. So my neighbors will snap a picture of a car and tell me, \u201cBy the way, that one\u2019s there,\u201d which is very kind of them. [Laughs]And yet, they still manage to find you. Has the success of \u201cBodyguard\u201d and the speculation about Bond prompted you to up your game?I\u2019m definitely not running to the store in my pajamas on the weekend. But I\u2019d never do that anyway.Do you feel like you\u2019re finally entering your prime?\u201cBodyguard\u201d was great for that because it\u2019s a role in which I\u2019ve got two children, so I very much feel the shift that is happening between playing a son and playing a father in terms of age and responsibility. I\u2019ve played so many of these young men and sons and princes over the years that it\u2019s really exciting to go into that space where you\u2019re an adult yourself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Markets Are Wild, but Bond Markets Can Be Dangerous", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sell-off in stocks isn\u2019t the only ominous economic sign emanating from financial markets. The bond markets, much more closely linked to the actual economy, are also flashing a warning.Ask someone how \u201cthe Dow\u201d is doing and, even if they don\u2019t know the answer, they\u2019ll know what you\u2019re talking about. Ask them about the bond market and you\u2019ll most likely get a blank stare.When it comes to the economy, however, bonds are far more important than stocks. Bond markets dictate the cost of borrowing money, and that can determine actual economic activity. The decision by a C.E.O. to build a plant or take the plunge on a new product is often decided by how much it will cost to borrow the money to pay for it. When that payment climbs too high, corporate activity slows, and so does the economy. Lately, borrowing costs have been rising quickly. Investors worried about corporate debt loads and the impact of a potential slowdown on profits are demanding companies pay them higher interest rates. And, in a recent troubling sign for the economy, fewer companies have been turning to the bond market to finance their businesses.As with the swooning stock market, weakness in the bond market doesn\u2019t mean the economy is destined for an immediate downturn. But signals being sent by bond investors will almost certainly arise in discussions among policymakers at this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on monetary policy, which will culminate on Wednesday with a decision on interest rates. Here\u2019s what you need to know.Like any borrower, a company raising capital in the bond markets pays interest. What they pay depends on how likely it is that a lender will get repaid. Consumers have credit scores. Companies have debt ratings. The greater the risk that a borrower won\u2019t be able to pay up \u2014 known as credit risk \u2014 the higher the interest rates. American Treasury bonds almost always have the lowest interest rates. That\u2019s because lending to the United States government \u2014 which has a virtually unblemished record of repaying creditors \u2014 is considered pretty much the safest investment on earth.Everyone else, even the most powerful, cash-rich corporations, must pay more. For example, Home Depot went to the bond market late last month, raising $1 billion by selling 10-year bonds. At the time, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 the federal government\u2019s cost to borrow for 10 years \u2014 was about 3.06 percent. Home Depot, considered a safe or \u201cinvestment grade\u201d borrower \u2014 paid an interest rate of almost 4 percent to borrow for 10 years. The difference between the low interest rate that the government pays and the higher rate of another borrower is called the credit spread. Riskier borrowers typically have larger spreads. Bankers who arrange bond issues for companies set the interest rate by looking at where the company\u2019s other bonds are trading and assessing the demand for the new bond.A higher credit spread can also reflect investors\u2019 concerns about things like the broader economy and the future ability of any company to pay money back. In recessions, for example, they rise for even the healthiest companies.\u201cAs the credit spread goes up, lenders are saying, \u2018We\u2019re really worried about making loans, riskier than lending to the government,\u2019\u201d said Philip Bond, a professor of finance at the University of Washington.Since early October, credit spreads have increased fast.Borrowers with investment-grade debt ratings (essentially higher credit scores) are paying more than 1.4 percentage points above Treasurys to borrow, up from less than 1 percentage point at the start of the year. Spreads on junk bonds, issued by companies that are considered significantly less creditworthy, have risen even more, from around 3.2 percentage points at the start of the year to more than 4.5 percentage points now, according to FactSet.The sudden increase \u2014\u00a0\u201cwidening\u201d in the bond market\u2019s lingo \u2014\u00a0is telling us that investors are suddenly more nervous about handing over their cash to corporations. The same change in sentiment is playing out in the stock market and the reasons are largely the same. A trade war that has no end, signs of a slowing world economy and a widely expected deceleration in growth the United States have all pushed investors to take less risk. At the same time, the Fed is slowly removing the helping hand it has extended to markets and the economy for the last decade, by raising rates and shrinking the stockpile of bonds it owns. Recent drops in oil prices are also making investors less willing to place their money with the smaller energy companies that tend to borrow in junk-bond markets.While the stock market sell-off may eventually affect sentiment among consumers and corporate executives, bond market moves can have an immediate impact on the economy by discouraging borrowing and investment. It is true that borrowing costs are still very low by historical standards, because the Fed only just began to step back from its post-crisis programs to keep them that way. But one concern among investors is that this effort to hold down costs encouraged borrowing to a point that could be problematic in a downturn. Netflix has gone from having very little debt in 2010 to having more than $10 billion now. Verizon now has $113 billion of debt, more than double the amount it had six years ago. By one measure, the ratio of corporate debt to G.D.P., the total level of borrowing is at all-time highs.In general, higher debt levels could make it tougher for companies to repay the lenders if there\u2019s a slump in the economy, or a hiccup in sales, or a decline in the value of assets.That turmoil didn\u2019t lead to a full-blown recession. But it did coincide with what some economists, including those at JPMorgan Chase, now call a \u201cmini recession\u201d between 2015 and 2016, in which industrial spending by companies in the manufacturing sector slowed sharply and dragged on growth.And with the American economy already expected to slow in 2019, the climbing costs of corporate borrowing could determine whether any slowdown turns into something much worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together.Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn\u2019t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack \u2014 mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity.\u201cWhat we call \u2018tech companies\u2019 really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,\u201d Professor Damodaran said in an interview. \u201cThe aging process for tech companies \u2014 which usually start out as high-growth companies \u2014 is very rapid.\u201cAlso, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.\u201dThe problem, then, is twofold.\u25a0 First, Professor Damodaran said, \u201ctech companies live in dog years.\u201d They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics.\u25a0 Second, tech has become ubiquitous. \u201cNearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,\u201d he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn\u2019t a distinguishing characteristic.Even the newspaper industry \u2014 which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century \u2014 has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers.\u201cOn the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?\u201d Professor Damodaran asked.Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles?Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle.As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits.Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to know with a young company,\u201d he conceded, adding that Tesla is \u201ca risky proposition but not an impossible one.\u201dOld profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn\u2019t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking.\u201cAn old company can\u2019t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d he said.Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks.While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications.Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 \u2014 more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries.The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren\u2019t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

Smith, its executive director, said. A quarter century on, it remains a complex depiction of Nazi horrors.\u201cWe were surprised that somebody even attempted to make a film about it,\u201d said Renee Firestone, 94, whose story is told at the foundation.Days before Mr. Spielberg\u2019s 72nd birthday, wearing a suede jacket and 1860s-style boots from his 2012 opus, \u201cLincoln,\u201d the director munched a granola bar at the foundation\u2019s headquarters. The color of his beard is now saltier, he has a few more inches around the middle, but his gray-green eyes still shine boyishly when he\u2019s discussing his foundation and his seminal film. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.Why expand the mission of the Shoah Foundation?I think there\u2019s a measurable uptick in anti-Semitism, and certainly an uptick in xenophobia. The racial divide is bigger than I would ever imagine it could be in this modern era. People are voicing hate more now because there\u2019s so many more outlets that give voice to reasonable and unreasonable opinions and demands. People in the highest places are allowing others who would never express their hatred to publicly express it. And that\u2019s been a big change. There\u2019s all kinds of efforts to take the truth and subvert it to twisted ideology. We saw it happen in Europe first, in France, then Poland again \u2014 I never thought it would come back home to us like it has existed over the last two years.Many groups are clamoring that they have it harder than others \u2014 how do we overcome that?We can commiserate with each other about suffering and pain, but we should never compete that way. Being marginalized, being discriminated against, having racist and anti-Semitic slurs hurled is something that unites [all people]. Everything against black society is also against the Jewish community. Everything against the gay and lesbian, LGBTQ community is against black and Jewish communities. Hate is hate and the spillover makes us all responsible for watching each others\u2019 backs and standing up for each other. None of us could ever be bystanders again.How can Hollywood combat this?Look how many movies are now telling the stories of women. There\u2019s a huge shift that is gender-centric, and we saw it happen at the beginning of the Harvey Weinstein downfall. Storytelling is fundamentally human. But the art of listening is what I\u2019m hoping the Shoah Foundation is able to inspire.You are rereleasing \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d after 25 years. Do you believe it can still make an impact?If you made the film today, what are the things you would have changed?What sticks with you 25 years later about filming in Poland, where the carnage happened?The foundation decided to include modern testimonies about genocide when it already has over 51,000 testimonies on record about anti-Semitism. My grandparents were filmed by the foundation in 1996; is video the best teacher?Look, we\u2019re all storytellers. There\u2019s no one alive who isn\u2019t a storyteller, even if they don\u2019t think they are. Every day is a story. Maya Angelou said: \u201cHistory, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.\u201dWhat are your earliest memories of being different?My grandmother taught English to Hungarian Holocaust survivors in Cincinnati. I was 2 or 3, and I would sit with them around the table. That\u2019s where I learned my numbers \u2014 on the arm of an Auschwitz survivor who showed me the numbers of his forearm.

{"Headline": "Canada Faces a New Challenge as a Century of Automaking Ends", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCanada LetterIt swiftly became clear that the plant closure was one of those economic issues that governments have little control over, other than to mitigate their consequences.Both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Premier Doug Ford of Ontario have pledged to help the workers who will become jobless. But exactly what the federal government and provinces can or should do is unclear, and there are few obviously effective approaches at hand.In the past, early retirement was often a ready \u2014 and sometimes welcome \u2014 prospect to major layoffs in the auto sector. But the wave of layoffs that followed G.M.\u2019s bankruptcy a decade ago means a majority of workers at the company today are nowhere near retirement age, according to Unifor, the workers\u2019 union.Retraining has already been raised. General Motors said on Thursday that it will set up a program with schools in Oshawa to turn assembly line workers into mechanics for car dealerships. But while there is certainly a shortage of qualified mechanics, it seems unlikely that dealerships will need more than 2,500 of them.\u201cI think we have to view with suspicion plans to retrain employees, because we\u2019ve heard that story before,\u201d Scott Aquanno, a political scientist at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, who has studied previous G.M. layoffs, told me. \u201cThe opportunities for high-paying jobs are slim.\u201dAnd while Oshawa, like many Canadian cities, is trying to turn itself into a hub for technology industries, Mr. Aquanno said even if that effort is successful, it\u2019s unlikely to help many G.M. workers.Beyond retraining, Mr. Ford has asked Mr. Trudeau to extend federal jobless benefits by five weeks: a measure likely welcomed by workers, but well short of a solution.The Oshawa shutdown doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Canada\u2019s auto industry as a whole is doomed \u2014 at least, not immediately. There was relatively little attention paid earlier this year when Toyota announced it would spend 1.4 billion Canadian dollars (including 200 million in government money) to add hybrid versions of its best-selling RAV4 compact sport vehicle to its factory in Woodstock, Ontario.But Toyota\u2019s Woodstock plant, which opened 10 years ago, is the last new car factory Canada has seen. Since then, all new plants from carmakers around the world intended mainly to serve the North American market have popped up in the United States or Mexico.The closing of Oshawa\u2019s plant, expected to happen roughly a year from now, will be a drag on the city\u2019s economy, and painful for the many people who work there. The challenge facing Mr. Ford and Mr. Trudeau until the closing is to make sure those people aren\u2019t left behind.Esi Edugyan, who lives in Victoria, recently won her second Giller Prize for her latest novel, \u201cWashington Black.\u201d This week, the editors at The Times Book Review declared it one of the 10 Best Books of 2018, describing it as \u201ca wondrous tale of exploration and discovery.\u201dAlso this week, Margaret Atwood announced she\u2019s penning a sequel to her award-winning novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d \u2014 an idea she had previously rejected.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s no surprise that Pace Gallery\u2019s \u201cAgnes Martin/Navajo Blankets,\u201d where serene abstractions by the 20th-century painter alternate with chief-style textiles from the early 19th century, is the first of its kind. There\u2019s no particular historical connection between the two bodies of work, though Martin did live for many years in New Mexico. All it takes is one unforgettable performance \u2014 like Darlene Love\u2019s 1963 original \u201cChristmas (Baby Please Come Home)\u201d \u2014 to become a fixture of holiday movies, TV and radio, where nostalgia reigns supreme.

The protagonists in his latest work are named after his mother and father, Zula and Wiktor, and are given familiar temperaments, but the similarities mostly end there. In \u201cCold War,\u201d Zula, an enigmatic young singer from a provincial Polish town, worms her way into auditions for a folk-arts ensemble, and soon into the fantasies of its artistic director, Wiktor. When the group visits Berlin, Wiktor persuades Zula to escape with him \u2014 thus beginning a chase across time, borders and musical genres, from Polish songs and Parisian jazz to a Hollywood-esque rock around the clock. Shot in black-and-white, with a soundtrack that aches, it\u2019s a ravishing study in passion and tyranny.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Orbiting, Another Thing for Online Daters to Worry About", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDigitally observing a prospective love interest, or an ex, online is yet another way that people are confusing each other romantically.Prying eyes on Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter can be exciting when they come from a prospective romantic partner, confusing when unrequited and infuriating when the looker is an ex. In the last case, it\u2019s as though the specter of a Relationship That Could Have Been is peeping over your shoulder, keeping tabs without having to commit to any real-world interactions.The way it feels to be orbited depends on your relationship to the orbiter. When you\u2019re interested in the satellite entity watching your social media activity, orbiting brings an endorphin rush, the feeling of being circled by someone you want to get closer to.\u201cOne thing he didn\u2019t stop doing, though, was watching my Stories and liking photos on Instagram,\u201d Ms. Mahan said. At first she felt hurt by the silence and confused by her ex\u2019s sustained surveillance of her online life. But after some time, Ms. Mahan came to see the behavior as a form of contact. \u201cI felt the urge to send subliminal messages via my Instagram Stories, knowing that was the only way I could communicate with him,\u201d she said.Ian Coon, 21, of Des Moines, ditched Snapchat altogether, in part because of the number of former friends and dates who were orbiting his account. When he met his current boyfriend, he said, \u201cif I cared enough to get to know him, I had to text or FaceTime or \u2014 gasp \u2014 go on a date.\u201d Sometimes, orbiting is so inexplicable that it just feels rude. Alexi Mojsejenko, 22 and living in New York, believes there\u2019s someone from her past who views her Stories to spite her, but withholds likes and comments on her Instagram posts.\u201cOrbiting, in this sense, just feels very passive aggressive,\u201d Ms. Mojsejenko said, \u201clike a silent and lonely battle.\u201dKate, a 27-year-old living in Colorado, took a more positive view. She says that orbiting has become a form of flirting for many people. \u201cThe bold ones will go far and like things from way back, which is definitely saying something,\u201d she said, referencing posts on her Instagram account. \u201cOr they are just clumsy and accidentally showed they stalked.\u201d She said that orbiters avoid liking family photos or scenic pictures. Liking selfies, on the other hand, is an optimal way to orbit someone without acknowledging their existence offline.It should also be said that orbiting isn\u2019t always intentional. Instagram Stories stream seamlessly into one another (and ads), so it\u2019s possible to view someone\u2019s day-to-day updates by accident, without ever digging deeper into their posting history.Regardless, it\u2019s a fact that dating is confusing, and orbiting can make that worse. Small online behaviors are infinitely interpretable, making it impossible to understand where you and another person stand. The lurking of a potential connection makes you wonder whether they\u2019ll ever materialize in person. And the orbiting ex only serves to keep you mired in a shadow version of the relationship, wondering, each time he or she views one of your Stories, what happened or what could have been.Advertisement"}

And we\u2019re going to earn it back not by spending on marketing but by fixing the product.\u201dMr. Lowe added: \u201cThe way we have been going about this is not the right way. We listened. We reassessed.\u201dMoviePass struck a nerve in August 2017 when it began offering an eye-popping deal. For $10 a month, members could see a movie a day in theaters, including new releases, 365 days a year. To a degree, the plan depended on traditional subscription economics: more people pay than actually go.Within months, three million people had signed up \u2014 far more than Mr. Lowe had anticipated \u2014 pushing MoviePass to the brink. In August, the company reduced the number of movies that subscribers could see to three a month and restricted the films to a rotating list.Starting in January, MoviePass will offer three plans. Each offers members three films a month, or up to 36 movies a year.The basic plan, Select, will cost $10 to $15 based on where in the country subscribers live. (Ticket prices are generally much cheaper in smaller cities than in big ones.) Members will not have access to 3-D screenings and the selection of films will be limited to certain titles on certain days.The next tier, All Access, will cost $15 to $20 and carry no restrictions on film selection beyond 3-D screenings. Red Carpet plans, costing $20 to $25, will include one Imax, 3-D or other large-format screening a month.To spur interest, MoviePass will begin selling All Access and Red Carpet packages on Thursday at a reduced \u201choliday\u201d rate.Mr. Lowe and Mr. Itum said they hoped the new structure would reverse a decline in subscribers \u2014 MoviePass has acknowledged erosion but not to what degree \u2014 and allow the company to attract additional investors.Under its business model, theaters get paid full price for every admission. People who sign up receive a membership card that functions like a debit card. When members want to see a movie, they use a MoviePass smartphone app to check in at the theater. The app instantly transfers the price of a ticket to the membership card. Members in turn use the card to pay for entry. It all works independently of theaters, sometimes to their chagrin.In 2017, Mr. Lowe and Theodore Farnsworth, chief executive of Helios and Matheson, took over MoviePass and drastically cut subscription prices.MoviePass had hoped to make money by striking bulk ticket pricing partnerships with theaters, charging studios fees to promote new films to members and perhaps even getting theaters to share a slice of concession revenue.But the big theater chains and many studios recoiled.\u201cUnlimited movies in theaters for $9.95 was offensive to them because they thought it devalued their product,\u201d Mr. Itum said.Mr. Itum and Mr. Lowe said they expected studios and theater owners to be more amenable to the new plans. Part of their new strategy involves teaming with theater owners to help fill multiplexes during off-peak times.\u201cIf there is anything we\u2019ve learned,\u201d Mr. Lowe said, \u201cit\u2019s to be a good member of the ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But I\u2019m more fascinated with you than you are with me, I bet!\u201dParton\u2019s egoless curiosity about other people surprised Linda Perry, who produced and co-wrote \u201cGirl in the Movies\u201d with the singer. \u201cShe\u2019s very aware of everyone in the room and what their job title is,\u201d Perry told me later in a phone call. \u201cAnd she\u2019s very considerate of people\u2019s time, even if it\u2019s someone just coming in and bringing coffee.\u201dTo hear Parton tell it, that inquisitiveness has kept her sharp as a storyteller, and it allowed her to write \u201cGirl in the Movies\u201d from the perspective of the title character of \u201cDumplin\u2019,\u201d Willowdean, an overweight teenager whose participation in a beauty pageant shakes up her small town.\u201cI can relate to everybody about anything \u2014 and that\u2019s good, because as a songwriter, I have to keep my feelings out on my sleeve,\u201d Parton said. \u201cSome people harden their hearts just to get through life, and I think if I do that, I won\u2019t be able to write. I try to keep my heart open, even to the point of having to suffer more because I take everything so personal. But that\u2019s why I can write for other people: I try to keep myself where they are.\u201dPerry, who has worked with Pink and Christina Aguilera, found Parton\u2019s accessibility to be a marked change from most modern musicians.\u201cWho are we kidding?\u201d Perry said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any work ethic, and they\u2019re really inconsiderate: They\u2019ll burn bridges, they\u2019ll tear people down. But the old-school mentality Dolly comes from is that you do treat people with respect no matter who they are, even if it\u2019s someone changing your strings or doing your catering. You treat them with respect because that\u2019s what true stars do.\u201dSo if Netflix wanted Parton to woo potential voters, then woo she would. \u201cEverybody I talk to, they don\u2019t drain me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m learning something about them, which helps me learn something about myself.\u201dThe same goes for interviews, which she has been giving for decades. \u201cI\u2019m getting a whole lot more out of this than you might think,\u201d Parton said, again trying to forecast my future. \u201cEverybody has got something really special, and I see that in you. I\u2019m sitting here thinking about a career for you! I\u2019m listening to you talking, thinking you could work in commercials \u2014 I may have to manage you!\u201dParton soon took the stage, and notably didn\u2019t demur when it came to justifying her single-song concert. \u201cWe\u2019re out politickin\u2019, trying to get our song heard, maybe get nominated for an award on the Oscars,\u201d she told the crowd. Then she launched into \u201cGirl in the Movies,\u201d tapping her black high heels to the beat.Alas, it was not to be. As Parton finished her song, she trilled, \u201cGo vote for us!\u201d before she was whisked through a side door and disappeared. It was a performance as brief as my delusions of grandeur, yet no one seemed to mind. Dolly Parton was the only real star in that room. But she sure made it feel contagious.Advertisement"}

The newsletter will be back on Jan. 5. Until then, best wishes for the holidays.______Even in winter or late spring, the vastness of the prairies offers an exotic sort of beauty. Part of that is an overwhelming sense of isolation. Farming is large scale in Saskatchewan. Traffic is scarce.Countering that isolation, however, is the powerful sense of community the world saw in Humboldt following the crash. We all learned that the Broncos are one of the ties that bind the town. The arena\u2019s capacity of 1,854 people means that there\u2019s a seat for every 2.6 of the town\u2019s residents. But Humboldt isn\u2019t just hockey. Its churches and community halls are just as vibrant and were, even at a time of immense tragedy, as warm and welcoming to those in grief, and to strangers like me.Many players among the 16 killed in the bus crash came from throughout Canada, mostly the West. In the towns the Broncos\u2019 bus passed through, there were few doors without a hockey stick beside them as a memorial. Every restaurant and shop I visited solicited donations. At the crash site, drivers stopped to say silent prayers, leave something on the impromptu memorial or simply try to understand what went wrong.We still don\u2019t know exactly what happened, although the upcoming trial of a truck driver may shed some light. Eight months later, one Bronco remains in hospital. But in September, the team again moved to billets in Humboldt, and took to the ice for the first time since the tragic events of the spring.\u2014Ian Austen______I had barely arrived back in Canada after 28 years abroad when I was sent to Quebec City to cover the hearing. Sitting in a hulking court house, and seeing Mr. Bissonnette, a waiflike figure, handcuffed behind a glass enclosure in a crowded courtroom, was hard to get out of my mind. As was seeing his father, a lawyer, looking heartbroken and averting my gaze in the hallway during a break.The story was a stark reminder to me that even Canada has a dark underbelly \u2014 that the forces of populism can percolate here, sometimes with lethal consequences.\u2014Dan Bilefsky______She is a Yazidi woman from Kocho, a town in northern Iraq that ISIS militants attacked in August 2014. She was separated from her family and fianc\u00e9 and sold \u2014 so many times, she can\u2019t remember \u2014 as a sex slave.While being held in an underground prison, she tattooed the names of her loved ones across her chest, arms and hands, using a sewing needle, soot and the breast milk of a fellow captive. They are the first things you notice about her \u2014 both forlorn love letters and fiery acts of resistance.Jihan is among the few victims of ISIS taken in by Canada. She arrived in June 2017 with her sister Munifa, and was settled by the Calgary Catholic Immigration Society into a residence along a street in southwest Calgary.The next afternoon, Jihan posed for photos in an empty classroom. As we were leaving, I heard a thud behind me. She had dropped to the floor. At first, I thought she was having a seizure. But as it soon became clear, she was reliving an attack. Psychiatrists diagnosed her with conversion disorder, a rare diagnosis that is relatively common among Yazidi survivors of ISIS.I was shaken to see Jihan in that state. I also marveled at her resilience \u2014 how she came to school each day to learn English and try to start a new life in this strange country, rather than give in to sorrow and hatred.You might pass Jihan on a downtown street in Calgary, and not guess what she\u2019s lived through. She is a warrior.\u2014Catherine Porter______This week\u2019s Trans Canada and Around the Times highlights were compiled by Lindsey Wiebe, the Canada audience growth editor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "TikTok, a Chinese Video App, Brings Fun Back to Social Media", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftAbout an hour after downloading TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, I experienced a bizarre sensation, one I haven\u2019t felt in a long time while on the internet. The knot in my chest loosened, my head felt injected with helium, and the corners of my mouth crept upward into a smile.TikTok \u2014 a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d \u2014 is a refreshing outlier in the social media universe. A so-called challenge video on TikTok, from the user @spellmantwinz, which encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song.There are no ads. There\u2019s no news, unless you count learning about viral dance crazes. There are few preening Instagram models hawking weight-loss tea, and a distinct lack of crazy uncles posting Infowars clips.Instead, TikTok \u2014 a Chinese-made app that was known as Musical.ly until ByteDance, the Chinese internet conglomerate, acquired the company in 2017 and merged it with a video app it owned \u2014 has a simple premise. Users create short videos set to music, often lip-syncing along, dancing or acting out short skits. The app contains templates and visual effects to spice up the videos. There is also a live-streaming feature that allows users to send virtual \u201cgifts\u201d to their favorite creators, which can be bought with real money. The rest works like any other social app \u2014 followers, hashtags, likes and comments.It doesn\u2019t sound like much. But, somehow, it adds up to what might well be the only truly pleasant social network in existence.I feel comfortable making that call because I go on social networks for a living, and I have spent thousands of hours wading through an unholy slurry of Twitter spammers, Instagram scammers, teenage YouTube fascists and baby boomers whose brains have been turned to pudding by too many Facebook memes.TikTok has none of that. Instead, it\u2019s that rarest of internet creatures: a place where people can let down their guards, act silly with their friends and sample the fruits of human creativity without being barraged by abusive trolls or algorithmically amplified misinformation. It\u2019s a throwback to a time before the commercialization of internet influence, when web culture consisted mainly of harmless weirdos trying to make each other laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s a safe haven for people that are seeing the world on fire and being like, \u2018I need silliness,\u2019\u201d he said.TikTok\u2019s global head of marketing, Stefan Heinrich, said in a statement that the company\u2019s mission was to \u201ccapture and present the world\u2019s creativity, knowledge and moments that matter, directly from the mobile phone.\u201dBefore I go any further, let\u2019s get one thing out of the way: If you\u2019re reading this, you are almost certainly too old to feel at home on TikTok. The company declined to provide information about its users, but judging from what\u2019s on the platform, the median TikTok user seems to hover in the midteens. TikTok is full of acne-studded faces, barely concealed tween angst and impenetrable youth-culture references. As far as I can tell, there is no way for adults to use it without feeling as if they are chaperoning a high school dance.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a really popular, cool site, but you also have the issue of kids being significantly too young for it,\u201d said James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews tech products for families. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the content on TikTok isn\u2019t O.K. for your 15-year-old. It\u2019s what happens to your 6- or 7-year-old.\u201dWhile using TikTok, I never saw examples of bullying or harassment. (Both of which are prohibited by TikTok\u2019s community guidelines, as is sexually explicit content.) There are, however, a decent number of videos featuring teenage girls dancing suggestively \u2014 which, if you are a 31-year-old newspaper columnist and not a 16-year-old boy, is fairly unsettling.A TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement that promoting safety and positivity on the platform is \u201cour top priority.\u201d She added, \u201cwe periodically add to and adjust our protective measures, policies and moderation efforts to support the well-being of our users.\u201dIs TikTok a Facebook killer? No, probably not. For all the variety in its videos, it is still a fairly limited app, with a more narrow appeal than more populist social platforms.But by purposely limiting its features, by resisting the temptation to monetize its users aggressively and by keeping trolls and bullies off its platform, TikTok has done something truly impressive \u2014 it has built a social network that is genuinely fun to use.There might be a lesson there.Advertisement"}

Ugh,\u201d said Amy Cappellazzo, the chairman and executive vice president of Sotheby\u2019s, having been told of the German artist Gerhard Richter\u2019s long-held desire for his paintings to acquired by public galleries, rather than private collectors. \u201cThat\u2019s a very socialist, democratic way of having to deal with, like, rich people who want them,\u201d added Ms. Cappellazzo. A forthcoming Sotheby\u2019s auction included abstracts by Mr. Richter valued at $20 million to $30 million each.\u201cThe thing about a painting is it\u2019s unique. You have the hand of the artist. You can own it, you can transport it. It can accrue value, it lives in its own world,\u201d said Tom Eccles, director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in New York, in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd to display it, you just need a nail.\u201d Other kinds of art works require \u201ca different kind of commitment,\u201d he added.But the commercial dominance of painting has produced a reaction. Judges of some of the most prestigious public awards for contemporary art regard other media as more in tune with our times.\u201c\u2018It\u2019s a video installation. You\u2019re physically required to be in that space,\u201d said Lisa Panting, a co-founder of Hollybush Gardens, the east London dealership that represents Ms. Prodger, who has been chosen to represent Scotland at next year\u2019s Venice Biennale. \u201cIt\u2019s not like watching a video on YouTube,\u201d she added.Ms. Panting said \u201cBridgit\u201d had been produced in an edition of three. Versions have been sold to the Arts Council of England, a public body that funds cultural events, and the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, for less than \u00a350,000 each, according to Ms. Panting. She said she did not know when or where the film could be seen after the show at Tate Britain closes on Jan. 6.In his groundbreaking 1936 essay, \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Production,\u201d the philosopher Walter Benjamin wrote how the \u201caura\u201d of an original work of art \u201cwithers\u201d the more it is reproduced. But now in the digital age, high resolution illustrations have become so accurate and ubiquitous that we feel we \u201cknow\u201d certain artworks, particularly paintings, without seeing them in the original. By contrast, creators of videos or performances can feel their work is diminished by mass reproduction.\u201cToday I work with artists making film-based works who are wondering whether they should distribute them through Amazon Prime or Netflix,\u201d said Mr. Eccles of Bard. \u201cBut then is it an artwork or not?\u201dThe art market and public institutions can seem at times to be far-distant worlds. One fetishizes the historical prestige of painting; the other, multidisciplinary experimentation. But of course the two worlds overlap all the time.The London branch of the international dealership Hauser & Wirth, for example, is currently showing \u201cToast,\u201d a museum-quality selling exhibition of recent works by the British conceptual artist Martin Creed, who won the Turner Prize in 2001.Free to the public, the show includes his trademark numbered works in painting, drawing, sculpture, textile, music, performance and video. \u201cWork No. 3071\u201d is a bronze of a piece of toast spread with gold peanut butter, priced at $35,000. The gallery is periodically darkened for a performance and videos, including the film \u201cDifficult Thoughts,\u201d showing the artist repeatedly bending 90 degrees in a busy London street. Again, these have to be experienced in person in the gallery and can\u2019t be viewed online.The title of Mr. Kahn\u2019s documentary derives from an interview with Mr. Edlis, the collector. Quoting Oscar Wilde, Mr. Edlis said that people in the art market \u201cknow the price of everything, and the value of nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Satan Is in the Illinois Capitol. Because It\u2019s the Holidays!", "Date": "2018-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, Illinois, there is a Satan. If you\u2019re looking for him, just check near the Christmas tree and the menorah in the state Capitol.It is there, among the twinkling lights and flickering candles, that you will find a tribute to the prince of darkness by the Chicago chapter of the Satanic Temple, a group based in Salem, Mass., that has 15 chapters nationwide.It looks a bit different from the pine boughs and mistletoe often associated with this time of year: a woman\u2019s hand presenting an apple as a serpent coils around her wrist. A pentagram and the words \u201cknowledge is the greatest gift\u201d are written on the pedestal below.The onyx-black statue has drawn criticism from people who think a mephistophelian tribute to the Fall of Man seems a little \u2026 un-Christmaslike. But state officials said there was little they could do once the temple requested a spot in the holiday display, which was unveiled to the public on Monday.If it is true, as the saying goes, that the Devil is a liar, he also has the good fortune to have attracted followers with a keen understanding of both the Constitution and the outrage-driven internet news cycle.David Druker, a spokesman for the Illinois secretary of state\u2019s office, said lawyers on staff agreed that the Temple had a right to participate in the display.The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and religion under the First Amendment and forbids government endorsement of a specific religion. The Supreme Court has ruled that temporary holiday displays such as trees and menorahs are allowed on public property.\u201cIf you allow people to convey some messages then you need to be consistent,\u201d Mr. Druker said. \u201cAnd the message itself \u2014 knowledge is the greatest gift \u2014 I don\u2019t know that there is much controversy with that.\u201dThe Satanic tribute is one of four in the Capitol rotunda, along with the Christmas tree, the menorah and a solstice display from an anti-religion group that includes a sign that says, \u201cReligion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds.\u201dThe anti-religion group has been part of the holiday display for several years but has not drawn as much controversy as the Satanic Temple, Mr. Druker said. His office has received only a few complaints, he said, but some of them were \u201cvociferous.\u201d\u201cPeople feel strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Satan is evil, how could we do anything that endorses him?\u2019 And that wasn\u2019t the intent.\u201dReligious groups and conservatives have been irked by the tribute. Some see it as a mockery of their beliefs, while others see forces at work that are larger than the First Amendment.In fact, the group says it does not \u201cbelieve in the existence of Satan or the supernatural\u201d at all.For them, Satan is \u201ca symbol of the Eternal Rebel in opposition to arbitrary authority\u201d and Satanism as a creed is based on a high-minded devotion to \u201crational inquiry removed from supernaturalism and archaic tradition-based superstitions.\u201dThis is not the first time the Satanic Temple has used a statue to make a statement at a state house.The temple also sued Netflix last month for copyright infringement after a similar statue appeared on \u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\u201d The lawsuit was settled on undisclosed terms, but the temple said it would now be acknowledged in the credits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: A Watered-Down \u2018Watership Down\u2019 on Netflix", "Date": "2018-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo it\u2019s a shame that the main thing that draws your eye, in Netflix\u2019s emotional but blandified adaptation of \u201cWatership Down\u201d arriving Sunday, is the unnatural.The details \u2014 bristles of fur, ripples of water \u2014 are remarkable. Until something moves. Then the limitations, whether of craft or budget, become apparent. The stiff, floaty, uncanny motion looks like something from a \u201990s CD-ROM video game.You might adjust to it, eventually, because the core story is so immersive. Fiver (Nicholas Hoult), a runt troubled by prophetic visions, persuades his brother Hazel (James McAvoy) that their warren is doomed. The chief rabbit, Threarah (Tom Wilkinson), dismisses Fiver as a crackpot. He\u2019s not about to ask his people to up and abandon their comfortable lives.But Fiver is right \u2014 the culprit is humans, who gas and excavate the colony to make way for a housing development \u2014 and the mild-mannered Hazel leads a small group on a postapocalyptic exodus to a distant hill, the promised land Fiver has envisioned.In between them and safety are rivers and train tracks, the \u201celil\u201d (the \u201cenemies,\u201d foxes, owls and such) and the mindless, deadly \u201chrududil\u201d (machines) of humans. But the ultimate enemy proves to be another rabbit, General Woundwort (Ben Kingsley, leaning into the big-bad role), who has turned his colony, Efrafa, into a militaristic kind of Bunny Sparta in the name of safety.This \u201cWatership,\u201d a coproduction of BBC One and Netflix written by Tom Bidwell and directed by Noam Murro (\u201c300: Rise of an Empire\u201d), sticks fairly close to the novel. (Kehaar, the Eastern European-accented sea gull, is now Scottish for some reason, courtesy of Peter Capaldi\u2019s voicing, but I may be the only crank bothered by this.)It is, nonetheless, not a carefree kids\u2019 story at heart (though kids can definitely watch, as long as they know what to expect). The strength of Adams\u2019s novel was how deeply it committed to imagining a whole culture for rabbitdom. What kind of society would evolve from creatures who lived their entire lives as prey?But if the Netflix \u201cWatership Down\u201d fails its potential, it benefits from strong voice performances (Boyega is expressive as the bluff but loyal Bigwig) and a solid central story. Even this easy-listening version, which lays on the romance, jokes and limp dialogue (\u201cThey may not have wanted a war, but by Frith, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll get\u201d), has moments of grandeur and the sweep of a fantasy epic.The pestilence, in this case, is not zombies but us: human beings, who kill not from hunger but coldly and casually, because it\u2019s mildly convenient. The ultimate insult that one rabbit delivers to an Efrafan soldier is, \u201cYou lack animality.\u201dThat\u2019s fine. There\u2019s never any lack of situations to which you can apply the message here: that it can be deadly foolish to dismiss a prophet\u2019s dire warning as hysterical, simply because it would be too horrible if it were true.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After \u2018Gravity,\u2019 Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n Had His Pick of Directing Blockbusters. Instead, He Went Home to Make \u2018Roma.\u2019", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "FeatureThe director\u2019s new film tells the story of his childhood in Mexico \u2014 but seen from the vantage of the domestic worker who raised him.Supported byIt\u2019s tempting to compare Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s extraordinary new film, \u201cRoma\u201d \u2014 which has already won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and begins streaming on Netflix on Dec. 14 \u2014 to landmark neorealist movies. An exquisite party scene at a country estate reminded me of Jean Renoir\u2019s \u201cThe Rules of the Game.\u201d A climax near a churning ocean brought to mind Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s \u201cThe 400 Blows.\u201d A landscape of urban poverty recalled Vittorio De Sica\u2019s \u201cBicycle Thieves.\u201d But Cuar\u00f3n himself sought to imitate no one. What he wanted was something like the scene of the girl and her dolphin balloon: beauty, naturalism and spontaneous emotion.To achieve this, Cuar\u00f3n returned to Mexico to shoot a film in his homeland for the first time in nearly 20 years. He hired a cast of mostly nonactors and filmed in absolute continuity. None of the cast and crew ever saw the script, so every plot twist hit them with surprise. The crew was so blindsided by one scene that they burst into tears as the camera rolled. Actors were given their lines only the morning of the shoot. Many times, they had no lines at all; Cuar\u00f3n simply suggested how they might react to other characters or even disrupt an entire scene. Often Cuar\u00f3n gave them contradictory instructions. \u201cSo when we began filming, we had chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was it. Everyone would have to exist inside that chaos, as in life.\u201d More than anything, he told me, his job was to watch the actors carefully to spot the moments when some essential truth emerged.For most of his life, Cuar\u00f3n has struggled to juggle his auteur ambitions with his need to stay solvent. For years, when asked why he directed this or that Hollywood movie \u2014 \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d say, or \u201cHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\u201d \u2014 Cuar\u00f3n has given journalists variations on \u201cI was running out of money and I needed to survive.\u201d He wrote \u201cGravity\u201d with his eldest son, Jon\u00e1s Cuar\u00f3n, in a fit of desperation after another project they started lost its funding in the 2008 financial crisis. Together they knocked out a rough draft of the script in a day. Making the existential space thriller, however, took four and a half years \u2014 a process complicated by the challenges of filming the effects of microgravity and the need to sign an A-list star to justify its $100 million budget. Sandra Bullock ultimately agreed to spend nine hours at a time in a 10-by-10-foot special-effects box, executing choreographed moves so precise that her acting verged on modern dance. Released in 2013, \u201cGravity\u201d grossed more than $700 million worldwide, won seven Academy Awards and made Cuar\u00f3n the first Mexican ever to receive the Oscar for best director. After that, he could shoot whatever he liked.\u201cThey offered me bigger pictures with bigger budgets, bigger everything,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n explained. Instead, he poured himself into \u201cRoma\u201d: a Spanish-language, black-and-white period piece. Most of the film is set in the same Roma neighborhood of Mexico City where Cuar\u00f3n grew up. Ninety percent of its scenes were inspired by his family\u2019s history. \u201cThis,\u201d his manager, Steve Golin, told me, \u201cwas the most expensive home movie ever made.\u201dWhat Cuar\u00f3n wanted, the director told me, was to make \u201ca kind of spiritual X-ray of my family, with its wounds and its sores.\u201d Staring into childhood trauma, stylizing it, exploring it from the vantage of maturity in order to understand the construction of the self: Such therapeutic forensics are so common among artists that they\u2019re almost a clich\u00e9. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s brilliance lies not in his subject but in his decision to make himself a peripheral character. Almost every scene includes an event that would have been unforgettable for a young boy: the night he witnessed a fire, the afternoon he discovered a family secret, the day he nearly killed a sibling. But you need to track back to piece that all together, because Paco, the character based on Cuar\u00f3n, rarely holds the center of the frame. Instead \u201cRoma\u201d follows Cleo \u2014 a character based on a domestic worker who has lived with Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s family ever since he was a newborn.One of the most potent memories of Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s childhood is an absolute lack of freedom of expression. He felt it viscerally at school, where he and his three siblings tried to hide the fact that their father, Alfredo Cuar\u00f3n, a doctor specializing in nuclear medicine, abandoned their family when Cuar\u00f3n was 10. Dr. Cuar\u00f3n never paid much attention to his second-eldest son \u2014 Cuar\u00f3n has few childhood memories of him \u2014 but after his departure their contact slowly dwindled to nothing. His mother, Cristina Orozco, a pharmaceutical biochemist, struggled alone to pay the family\u2019s bills. (She bought Cuar\u00f3n a Super 8 camera, but couldn\u2019t afford to keep him stocked in film.) In high school, priests taught that divorce was a mortal sin. Cuar\u00f3n never believed that, but when other kids asked questions, he lied: Of course his father lived at home. He just needed to travel for work. A lot.\u201cThat contributed to whatever continued later on as insecurities, as solitudes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also had a lot do with a pretty lonely adolescence where film was not only a passion, it turned into a refuge, into the only friend.\u201d Long before his parents split, Cuar\u00f3n knew he wanted to make films. When his cousins played war games, he played \u201cshooting war movies.\u201d But when he was a Catholic-school pariah, his need for cinematic escape intensified. He tried to visit every single movie theater in Mexico City, often watching a double feature a day.Cuar\u00f3n found tenderness mostly in Liboria Rodr\u00edguez, a domestic worker who, he said, is like his second mother. She sat next to him at the movies and told him stories about Tepelmeme, the Oaxacan pueblo where she was born. He grew up calling her \u201cMam\u00e1\u201d as well. \u201cI think that it\u2019s one of the strongest emotional ties in my family,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says of Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cIt\u2019s part of that very perverse relationship that the bourgeoisie has with domestic workers. It\u2019s that on one hand, yes, they do the laundry, they do the cooking, they do the shopping. But in addition to working extremely hard in what would be the definition of their employment, they also take on roles that should be filled by the parents, you know? They wake the children, they give them breakfast, they tuck them into bed, they pick them up from school. That presence is so beautiful, but why is that presence needed? Simply because the parents are absent.\u201dAfter \u201cGravity,\u201d when Cuar\u00f3n decided to make a movie about these years, he asked Rodr\u00edguez and his family for permission. \u201cI said yes,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez told me, recalling their conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s already healed. It\u2019s not important anymore. So it\u2019s fine now.\u201d They spent hours on long-distance calls talking about the tiniest details of her daily life in the 1970s. What kind of alarm clock did she use? Where did she keep her clothes? When I asked if she would like money for her story, she scoffed. \u201cHow barbaric. I did it because he\u2019s my child. It\u2019s something done for love.\u201dReconstructing their past, Cuar\u00f3n saw how little, as a child, he understood of her life. As an indigenous woman born into rural poverty, Rodr\u00edguez suffered different heartbreaks and challenges than her white, middle-class employers. \u201cWhen I was a boy, she would tell me about her pueblo, and she told me about the terrible cold they suffered and the hunger they suffered. But for me as a boy, it\u2019s the cold equivalent to \u2018Shoot, I forgot my sweater to the movie,\u2019 and the hunger is \u2018[Expletive], they\u2019re running two hours late with dinner,\u2019 you know? I had no awareness,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n said. His grandmother discouraged Rodr\u00edguez from using electricity for anything other than work. \u201cThe family can have all the damn lights on all day, and it\u2019s her job to go around turning them all off while the family is upstairs, but they\u201d \u2014 domestic workers \u2014 \u201care not allowed to use electricity in their own room.\u201d Cuar\u00f3n shook his head with disgust. \u201cIt speaks not only to what she did, but to my family\u2019s attitude toward her.\u201dCuar\u00f3n methodically shredded his old blindness so he could make Rodr\u00edguez the protagonist of \u201cRoma.\u201d The film paints 1970s classism, parental neglect and federal violence with icy neutrality, but love colors its close-ups of Cleo, the character he based on Rodr\u00edguez. She bears witness to many of her employers\u2019 humiliations: slaps, betrayals, car accidents. Cuar\u00f3n makes us the witnesses to hers. She works while her employers relax and rests only when they sleep. The children snuggle with her. The adults bark at her. By training and by necessity, Cleo shares little of what she thinks, and even less of what she feels, with other characters. She is a woman of tremendous sensitivity and limited verbal expression.The search for an actor to carry this tricky role took eight months. The casting director, Luis Rosales, traveled all over southern Mexico auditioning more than 3,000 women in cities and villages. Then one day Yalitza Aparicio appeared at an audition in a town in Oaxaca as a favor to her sister. Aparicio had just finished her degree at a teachers\u2019 college and was looking forward to taking charge of her own preschool classroom. She and her close friend Nancy Garc\u00eda, who plays the family cook, decided to do \u201cRoma\u201d as a lark. \u201cAt the beginning, I told Alfonso I don\u2019t know how to act,\u201d Aparacio told me. \u201cHe said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll explain it to you later.\u2019\u2009\u201d She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting.\u201d Yet Aparacio possesses an ability to convey emotion through the tiniest shifts in her brows and eyes. In one powerful scene she suggests Cleo\u2019s entire sexual history while murmuring no more than a handful of words.Some journalists have accused Cuar\u00f3n of not going far enough, claiming that Cleo is a passive character. The criticism puzzles Cuar\u00f3n. \u201cThere\u2019s a flaw in commercial film where the strong character, the active character, has to give big speeches and make big disclosures,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n told me. He wanted to show Cleo\u2019s strength without deforming her into a Hollywood stereotype. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have grand speeches, but in the end she\u2019s someone who binds together an entire family.\u201dBut after his first child, Jon\u00e1s, was born in 1981, when Cuar\u00f3n was 20, he shelved his cinematic dreams in favor of supporting his son. With no prospects and no degree, he took a job at the National Museum of Art and was rescued from a career as a sad bureaucrat only when the producer Fernando C\u00e1mara and the director Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda Agraz came searching for him a year later. If Cuar\u00f3n left right away to become the assistant director for one of their pictures, they\u2019d pay him even more than his pathetic salary.So began Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s life as a \u201cblue collar\u201d worker in the Mexican film industry. Boom operator, editor, production assistant, assistant cameraman: He took every gig he could until he established himself as the go-to assistant director for foreign productions filming in Mexico. That was his best shot at learning technique in the 1980s. State funding for films had almost disappeared. Many Mexican directors scrounged together a living by shooting political spots for corrupt politicians or \u201cvideohomes,\u201d cheap films shot quickly for export to Mexican immigrants in the United States. Scarce resources fostered a culture of secrecy and rivalry. One well-respected Mexican cinematographer would cover his lenses on set, so that no one could learn which apertures he used. Cuar\u00f3n feared that he might never direct anything of his own.For two years, Cuar\u00f3n shuttled back and forth between Mexico and California. His relationship with Jon\u00e1s\u2019s mother, Mariana Elizondo, had fallen apart. In Los Angeles, he lived out of a beat-up Volkswagen Rabbit and crashed with friends like Lubezki. Every dollar he saved on motels was a dollar he could bring back home. He jokes that he was a \u201cwetback deluxe.\u201dHis break came in 1993 when Sydney Pollack hired him to direct an episode of \u201cFallen Angels,\u201d a Showtime series that he produced. Aiming for highbrow at a time when cable movie channels showed mostly soft porn, \u201cFallen Angels\u201d contracted a roster of hotshot directors, like Steven Soderbergh and Jonathan Kaplan. To keep the budget low, however, Pollack also hired Cuar\u00f3n. \u201cWe brought him in because we thought we could beat him up to do it for less money,\u201d Steve Golin, then a producer on the series, told me.Cuar\u00f3n felt so insecure when he showed up for shooting that he stuttered when he spoke English and could barely bring himself to talk to the lead actors, Alan Rickman and Laura Dern. By the end of Day 1, he was wildly behind schedule. Then Rickman called for him. Cuar\u00f3n dreaded being chewed out. He found Dern and Rickman sitting together. Alfonso, Rickman said. We are here for you. We want you to tell us what you want. We believe in you.That night Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki stayed in a dive motel near the Hollywood sign. There were stains all over the carpets, stains all over the sheets, stains all over the synthetic coverlet. \u201cAll that night I wanted to cry,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n told me. \u201cBut there were Alan\u2019s words.\u201d The next morning, he announced that they would reshoot all the scenes they\u2019d done the day before. His assistant director protested, but Cuar\u00f3n insisted. They reshot Day 1 and shot everything they needed for Day 2. In the end, Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s episode, \u201cMurder, Obliquely,\u201d won a CableACE Award for best directing, paving the way for the rest of his career.So began Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s years as a director for hire. He moved to New York \u2014 he says he couldn\u2019t bear the industry chatter in Los Angeles \u2014 and devoted himself to reading scripts. A studio executive advised him that if he wanted work in Hollywood, he shouldn\u2019t mention writing. At first, this wasn\u2019t so painful. Cuar\u00f3n focused on polishing other skills. His third film, \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d (1998), is proof of how quickly he came to master every aspect of movie production: sets, costumes, lighting, sound, choreography, shot-planning. When the French critic Michel Ciment screened a clip of it at Cannes last year \u2014 a long take of Ethan Hawke searching for Gwyneth Paltrow as an aria plays \u2014 the audience responded with cheers. But Cuar\u00f3n himself looked sheepish.He had signed on to \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d because he needed money and liked the idea of working with Robert De Niro. He didn\u2019t really get Dickens, but he thought he could compensate with visuals. As he shot the film with Lubezki, though, he felt disgusted with the process of making only aesthetic decisions. One day as he and Lubezki drove a van full of lighting gear from a shoot in New Jersey, he gazed at the passing landscape and asked out loud, \u201cWhy are we stylizing all this?\u201dBefore \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d premiered, he was developing a screenplay for a road movie with Miramax, to star Viggo Mortensen. But when \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d tanked, Miramax abandoned him again. The scripts that came his way got worse. He didn\u2019t like movies anymore. He didn\u2019t like movie people. In the midst of this depression, Cuar\u00f3n rented a couple dozen of his favorite films and holed himself up in his apartment on West 11th Street for two weeks. The old cure still worked. Buoyed, he called his brother Carlos and asked him to come to New York so they could write another script. He and Lubezki ditched the dollies and cranes in favor of hand-held cameras and natural lighting. The producer David Linde \u2014 then a partner at Good Machine and now the executive producer for \u201cRoma\u201d at Participant Media \u2014 financed the picture so that Cuar\u00f3n could reinvent himself in Mexico.Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s second mother, Liboria Rodr\u00edguez, has a bit part in the film, as a domestic worker who carries a sandwich on a plate to Luna. As she walks through a mansion, a telephone rings and rings. Loafing on a sofa, Luna ignores it until \u201cLeo\u201d hands him lunch, passes him the phone and pats his head. Later in the movie, Luna remembers her as the station wagon passes the village where she was born, but he says nothing to his feckless companions. Fleeting though they are, these scenes stayed with me for years. In them, you can feel the mix of affection and indignation that would fuel \u201cRoma.\u201dCritics often focus on Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s prowess with the long take. Certainly, his 12\u00bd-minute opening for \u201cGravity\u201d \u2014 shot by Lubezki \u2014 ranks among cinema\u2019s more jaw-dropping feats. For Cuar\u00f3n, however, the long take is only a means to an end. \u201cThe Olympics of the long take don\u2019t interest me,\u201d he says. \u201cRoma\u201d contains scenes that are full of quick cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s about how to lead to that thematic content through the filmic experience,\u201d he told me, \u201cso that it\u2019s given in the filmic experience, not explained.\u201dFor the first time in his career, he wrote a feature-length script entirely by himself. He wrote scenes randomly at first, using memory as a kind of Geiger counter to locate where the most potent material lay. He didn\u2019t question whether the script was too long or too short, whether it had a first, second and third act, whether it would be boring. For a while, he thought the screenplay might not have any plot, but he still decided not to share it with his usual sounding boards \u2014 del Toro; Carlos; the director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, whom he met in the 1990s. Lubezki wanted to shoot it \u2014 \u201cI thought that it was the most beautiful script, probably, I\u2019ve ever read in my life\u201d \u2014 but shortly after preproduction began he had to depart for a family situation. \u201cI would have never abandoned Alfonso in his most personal movie for anything else.\u201dCuar\u00f3n gave producers dates to research, having them look up, say, which television programs played on a certain night in 1970. I was particularly stunned by his recreation of the Corpus Christi massacre. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s crew not only watched archival footage of the event, they also located and interviewed survivors. More than 800 extras were cast for the scene: students, paramilitaries, police, bystanders. These moments in \u201cRoma\u201d amount to an indictment of Mexico\u2019s federal government, a dossier on a crime against humanity.When the shooting wrapped, he spent months in color correction to ensure that every frame looked like a photograph by Ansel Adams. In truth, Cuar\u00f3n never gave up on beauty; he has just subordinated that passion. \u201cIf you begin with aesthetics, you begin with preconceptions about what is beautiful,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd in great art, it\u2019s the reverse. It\u2019s the revolutions in language that create other aesthetic forms.\u201dThough he didn\u2019t understand it as he composed the screenplay, he later realized that the urgent need he felt to do this film stemmed from a need to reclaim, and to come to terms with, his own identity. \u201cFor almost a decade I lived in that chimera of cosmopolitanism,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I do believe that we are all citizens of the world, but if you\u2019re not centered and deeply rooted in a cultural identity, then that cosmopolitanism turns infertile.\u201d One of Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s greatest themes is the tension between the individual and the environment. His movies can be read as studies in how what we do is shaped by where we live. In \u201cRoma,\u201d he turned that approach on himself. \u201cThe film confronted me with the mystery of what I no longer am yet still am at the same time,\u201d he said.Mexico has also changed and not changed since the 1970s. \u201cNow I go back to Mexico, and I almost envy the young people,\u201d he said. \u201cMexico is exuberant, full of life, very creative.\u201d The changes, he thinks, have to do with the arrival of the internet and the end of the PRI\u2019s political monopoly. Yet many of the miseries of the 1970s endure. In 2014, 43 students from a teachers\u2019 college in Ayotzinapa disappeared. Three film students disappeared in Jalisco this past March. Social mobility remains dismal. \u201cRoma\u201d speaks to the present through the past.Still, cycles can be broken. The last day that I saw Cuar\u00f3n, he received an urgent text. \u201cHold on,\u201d he told me. His eyes lit up with amusement as he understood the situation. His 13-year-old son had forgotten his computer at home. Could Dad run and fetch it before he needed it for class? Cuar\u00f3n had been up until 2 the night before, preparing \u201cRoma\u201d for Mexico\u2019s Morelia film festival and going through page proofs of a companion book of photographs published by Assouline. Every time I saw him, he looked like a man badly in need of a good night\u2019s sleep. Yet he turned to me without a trace of irritation: Would I mind?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Times Arts Critic Reviews His Own Role", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byunderstanding the timesHow we call the hits \u2014 and limit our misses \u2014 on the culture beat.By the end of this year, if recent history is any guide, around 900 movies will have opened in theaters in the United States. Hundreds more will have made their debuts on streaming platforms, along with more than a million hours of serial programming on traditional networks, cable channels and web-based broadcasters like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Defying periodic reports of its demise, live theater is flourishing: on Broadway and off, in Brooklyn and Chicago, in London and Louisville. Nearly every week brings new dance recitals, chamber music concerts, pop albums, museum and gallery exhibitions \u2014 am I missing anything?Everyone is always missing something, but the critics who write for The New York Times \u2014 in staff positions and as regular freelancers \u2014 collectively strive to miss as little as possible, and to provide some help to readers faced with the overwhelming abundance of contemporary culture. How to make sense of it all? How to choose?Those are difficult questions, and they aren\u2019t the same question. Part of the critic\u2019s job is to offer consumer advice. You want to know if a given performance or exhibit is worth your time. But criticism doesn\u2019t stop with warnings and recommendations. (The Times doesn\u2019t use stars, thumbs or letter grades, but especially worthy productions are designated Critic\u2019s Picks.) Whether or not we like the thing we\u2019re reviewing, we are interested in what it means, how it works (or doesn\u2019t), why it matters (or doesn\u2019t), and how it reflects and is part of the larger world. We assume that readers are looking not only for advice, but also for ideas, arguments, provocations and the occasional joke. We hope that, even if you skip the movie, give up on the show or can\u2019t get tickets to the opera, you\u2019ll at least find something worth reading.As a practical matter, we begin the critical process with choices of our own, since we can\u2019t cover everything. Some selections are obvious. There\u2019s no way to ignore the latest big Hollywood movies, Broadway shows, premium cable dramas, blockbuster museum retrospectives or whatever Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 are up to. But we don\u2019t want the shape or scope of our critical coverage to be determined by hype and publicity. At the assigning stage \u2014 as editors and chief critics decide what to review \u2014 we make room for discovery and surprise. We pay significant attention to small triumphs as well as grand ambitions, to interesting failures as well as astonishing successes.To do this we rely on instinct, experience and hard work, though \u201cwork\u201d can sound like an odd way to describe what the rest of the world might call bingeing. Critics don\u2019t wield the authority of experts so much as the credibility of devotees. One thing we share in common is love for the art forms we write about.Another is independence from the people and institutions who make and distribute that art. As the critic Lester Bangs (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) says to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in \u201cAlmost Famous,\u201d referring to the rock stars they both idolize: \u201cThose people are not your friends.\u201d Much as we may admire the artists, our allegiance is to the audience. We are spectators, like you.But we do get an early look. Reviews are timed to greet the arrival of the new (on opening day or shortly before), so critics attend press screenings or previews, receive advance copies of albums or TV episodes. This is a convenience and a courtesy, helpful but not essential to the job, and not a favor granted in the expectation of anything in return. In the old days, theater and movie critics raced back to the newsroom on opening night to type out their notices for the next day\u2019s paper. Sometimes, like reporters on a breaking story, they ran to the nearest pay phone to call in the review.Criticism is a kind of news reporting, even if the news is inherently subjective. The raw data may be emotion, experience and opinion \u2014 how did that make us feel? what did we think of it? \u2014 but the resulting story still has to be factual, honest and fair. No reader will agree with a critic all the time, and no critic requires obedience or assent from readers. What we do hope for is trust. We try to earn it through the quality of our writing and the clarity of our thought, and by telling the truth. The truth, in this case, about what we thought about what we saw, read or heard. Some of the time some of our readers might think we\u2019re wrong, but being wrong \u2014 starting an argument about what matters to us \u2014 is one of the ways we can be most useful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s That Smell?", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.A decade ago Marie and Surinder Uppal fulfilled what they considered their American dream: the construction of a two-story home next to vineyards in Sonoma County.But earlier this year, besieged by a mysterious, pungent odor, they wondered if they had made the right decision.\u201cWe said, \u2018What the heck is that smell?\u2019\u201d Ms. Uppal said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. The stench was very bad, stronger than a skunk.\u201dThe Uppals are among hundreds of people across California who have showed up at town hall meetings, petitioned city councils and hired lawyers to fight an unanticipated consequence of marijuana legalization: the stink from pot farms across the state.Those affected by the smell say it is much more potent than the pot cloud above a Grateful Dead concert or the medicinal smell of a cannabis dispensary.In the case of the Uppal family, the cannabis was being grown in greenhouses nestled in the vineyard several hundred feet away. One member of the Uppal family with muscular dystrophy, Jiwan, had trouble breathing and was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital.\u201cThe smell was so bad we couldn\u2019t even go outside,\u201d Ms. Uppal said.The smell stretched to the nearby Old Adobe Elementary Charter School, where children playing outside asked what the odor was, according to the school\u2019s principal, Jeff Williamson.\u201cSome parents were really upset about it,\u201d Mr. Williamson said.With three other families in the neighborhood, the Uppals sued the pot grower, Carlos Zambrano, who was found to be operating without a license, according to the Uppals\u2019 lawyer, Kevin Block.The Uppals and their neighbors sued in federal court under the RICO Act \u2014 the decades-old law designed to prosecute organized crime \u2014 to stop the cannabis operation and recover $60,000 they paid in legal fees so far. The court will hear a motion to dismiss the case on Thursday.Under a settlement agreement with the county, the grower was ordered to pay more than $400,000 in fines and back taxes. But the settlement came with a twist that puzzled the Uppals: He was allowed to harvest and sell his crop in part so that he could pay the fines.\u201cI told my husband, \u2018We are in the wrong business,\u2019\u201d Ms. Uppal said.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers. We appreciate you reading Times stories, but we\u2019d also encourage you to support local news if you can.)Initially, there was supposed to be a system of electric pods that could move 16 people at a time. Instead, a Tesla was lowered into the tunnel. The company said vehicles would be able to move up to 150 miles per hour, but the test was much slower.Still, Mr. Musk was upbeat.\u201cWhat we believe we have here is a real solution to the traffic problem we have on earth,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s much more like an underground highway.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "\u2018Black Mirror\u2019 Gives Power to the People", "Date": "2018-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS GATOS, Calif. \u2014 \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d the speculative fiction series that encouraged people to be wary of new technology, is now hoping they will embrace it. The Netflix show released just one episode on Friday, a narrative titled \u201cBandersnatch\u201d during which the viewer decides what will happen next.It begins like this: Should the teenage video game whiz Stefan have Sugar Puffs or Frosties for breakfast? Soon the choices become more consequential. Will Stefan work at a game company, tell his therapist about his mother, take his meds? As so often on \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d reality is up for grabs.Viewers are voting on more than who lives and dies on one program. If the response to \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is enthusiastic, Netflix will take it as a strong signal that the public is ready for interactive movies and television shows, and a new age of storytelling will commence.Not that the company needs much encouragement. It has already developed software to help organize stories that have endless permutations. It has perfected, or so it hopes, the technical ability to present these tales on multiple platforms around the world simultaneously. And it is calling for producers to submit interactive proposals in genres from horror to romantic comedy while hinting that it already has a few new shows in the works.The idea behind the interactive push is simple: Viewers will care more if they are complicit.\u201cIf bad things happen, you\u2019ll feel even more crestfallen, because you were responsible,\u201d said Todd Yellin, Netflix\u2019s vice president for product. \u201cIf the character is victorious, you\u2019ll feel even more uplifted because you made that choice.\u201dOne problem is that audiences are not clamoring for interactivity. A long time ago, drama was a live, communal experience. Now it comes over all sorts of devices, but almost always is a one-way street. Netflix has an immense hurdle to overcome.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned to press \u2018play,\u2019 drop the remote and just lean on back and let the TV wash over us,\u201d acknowledged Carla Engelbrecht, Netflix\u2019s director of product innovation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen 2-year-olds do this.\u201dGiving lots of options to the viewer while keeping the main character consistent \u201cwas a huge nut to crack,\u201d Brooker said. It was a five-week shoot for about two and a half hours of script, a much longer time than a typical episode requires.Even now, he is uncertain about what he has made.\u201cI think some people will judge it just on a narrative basis, some people will judge it as a game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us. It\u2019s down to them.\u201dJones disagreed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really designed as a game. It was designed as a cinematic experience.\u201d\u201cWith game-y elements,\u201d Brooker persisted. \u201cYou are making decisions. You are actively guiding it.\u201dWhatever its other merits, \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is definitely not funny. Those who wish to encounter it unencumbered by any prior knowledge should employ a primitive method of interactivity and avert their eyes from the next two paragraphs.The year is 1984, the setting London. Stefan (Fionn Whitehead, last seen in \u201cDunkirk\u201d) lost his mother when he was 5. He blames Dad (Craig Parkinson), who hid the boy\u2019s stuffed toy. The ensuing ruckus made Mom take a later train, which derailed.Stefan is hired by a game company. He adapts a choose-your-own-adventure story by a novelist named Jerome F. Davies, who became convinced that he was trapped in a world of multiple realities, with spectacularly unfortunate results. Stefan\u2019s life begins in some ways to mirror Davies\u2019s.Plot choices in \u201cBandersnatch\u201d come thick and fast at the bottom of the screen, with only a few seconds to click one of them. At one point, I refused to do anything, just to see what would happen. The episode went back to the beginning. It was not clear if this was a bug or I was being punished.Watching the episode, it is easy to see how interactivity could be the next step forward in entertainment. It is less easy to see how this could ever be art. It\u2019s hard to lose yourself in a story if you\u2019re constantly being pulled out of it. \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is not linear, which made it feel unresolved even when I was offered the chance after about 70 minutes to go to the credits. I took instead the option to plunge back to the story and tried to make different choices.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many endings there are,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve created here.\u201dJones, who plays the stern adult to Brooker\u2019s madcap boy genius, shot back: \u201cYes, we do!\u201dBrooker: \u201cSorry. We do.\u201d But he didn\u2019t sound convinced.(A Netflix spokeswoman later clarified that \u201cthere are five main endings with multiple variants of each.\u201d)When making the show, the creative team had endless conversations about good endings versus bad endings or premium endings or five-star endings. Said Brooker: \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 aspect where it keeps cycling around, deliberately so.\u201d It\u2019s an artist\u2019s dream: a story the audience can never escape.Interactive filmmaking is simple to mock. Are we now going to have \u201cMary Poppins\u201d where the nanny dismembers the children with a hacksaw? Few artists are in favor of letting their fans make the decisions. But the technology is perpetually enticing.In 1993, a 20-minute short called \u201cI\u2019m Your Man\u201d seemed to offer real possibilities. Viewers in a handful of specially equipped theaters used a pistol grip attached to each seat to collectively vote on dozens of scene variations.It was a prediction grounded in reality. Moviegoing was in decline, so multiplex owners were open to new approaches. A generation had grown up with a joystick in its hand and wanted to take control of its entertainment.But the whole effort fizzled. \u201cIt was classic ahead-of-its-time technology,\u201d said Bejan, who now runs experiential marketing at Microsoft.Netflix is not making any predictions. Quite the contrary.\u201cIn five years, 10 years, we\u2019ll either say, \u2018Wow, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d was a real turning point for interactive content,\u2019 or we\u2019ll be going, \u2018That was another false start,\u2019 \u201d said Yellin, the Netflix executive.Still, he has great hopes. \u201cWe have our eyes and ears wide open to the creative community \u2014 writers, producers, directors \u2014 for more ideas that would leverage this art form,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the new storytelling conventions that can be invented? We\u2019re meeting with people now.\u201dNetflix, which has 137 million worldwide subscribers, says \u201cBandersnatch\u201d is available across \u201cmost\u201d newer devices, including TVs, game consoles, web browsers and Android and iOS devices running the latest version of the Netflix app. It won\u2019t work on Chromecast, Apple TV and some legacy devices.Since \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is always full of tricks, it\u2019s perhaps inevitable that \u201cBandersnatch\u201d undermines the whole notion of interactivity. The viewer is asked whether a murder should be committed, and if the answer is yes, there is a further decision: Bury the body or chop it up? It\u2019s not much of a choice, which is of course the joke.\u201cI\u2019m not in control!\u201d Stefan rages to his therapist. One path the viewer can take develops into a mocking plug for Netflix, which did not exist in 1984. This is about the fourth meta level \u201cBandersnatch\u201d ascends, or descends, to.\u201cYou think you\u2019re choosing your ending, but are you?\u201d said Russell McLean, a \u201cBandersnatch\u201d producer. \u201c\u2018Black Mirror\u2019 is choosing your ending.\u201dBejan, the interactive pioneer, had no knowledge of the existence of \u201cBandersnatch\u201d when he was interviewed. But he said interactive filmmaking was less about the audience\u2019s choices than it seemed.\u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of media the filmmaker creates, which he slices and dices to give the illusion of control while at the same time guiding the viewer through the underlying blueprint,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more megalomaniacal than linear filmmaking.\u201dWhich brings us to the data, where every story in tech ends up. Interactive filmmakers will take your preferences \u2014 I really want this character to commit murder, and that one can kill himself \u2014 and convert them into numbers that will guide the creation of new shows you will be programmed to find irresistible.\u201cWe\u2019ll see what resonates with audiences and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d Netflix\u2019s Yellin said.What Netflix is really building is a voting machine. It\u2019s simple to see how technology like this could be used during, for instance, debates by presidential candidates. Viewers would react to promises being made, with their reactions immediately relayed to the candidates.\u201cBlack Mirror\u201d anticipated this sort of possibility in its very first episode. In 2011, \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d posed the question, What if a British politician were forced to follow the whims of the public in real time? He would end up having sex with a pig on live television, of course.\u201cWhatever path you take, there\u2019s darkness ahead,\u201d observed David Slade, who directed both \u201cMetalhead\u201d and \u201cBandersnatch.\u201dThat is pretty much Brooker\u2019s life philosophy. He began as a game reviewer, then became a TV critic, then a critic on TV. \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d \u2014 named after the shiny objects on our desks, walls and all too often in our hands \u2014 anticipated the tech backlash.As Jones explained to Brooker: \u201cYou are naturally suspicious and paranoid and neurotic.\u201d\u201cI worry about things, basically,\u201d he said.He is trying to dial back on technology. This is not easy or perhaps even desirable, because his confrontations with tech feed the show. That is one reason he got an Amazon Echo: research.\u201cQuite quickly my children, 4 and 6, starting talking to it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my kids walked into the room and called me Alexa. \u2018Alexa \u2014 oh, Daddy, where are my shoes?\u2019 I thought, \u2018I have to kill that device.\u2019\u201d\u201cHow would Alexa know where his shoes are?\u201d Jones asked.\u201cAlexa probably does know where his [expletive] shoes are,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cThat\u2019s the tragedy of it.\u201dNow that we\u2019re all suspicious and paranoid and neurotic, at least about technology, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is in flux. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more optimistic episodes and stories, rather than just dystopian and negative ones,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cWe want to keep the show interesting for us.\u201d He and Jones were, however, extremely hazy on when the next episodes would arrive. \u201cBandersnatch\u201d consumed all their attention for a year.One thing is clear, though. The new episodes won\u2019t be interactive. Asked if he had any advice for someone who wanted to try the format, Brooker said in a joking-but-not-really tone: \u201cRun away. It\u2019s harder than you think.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Rebuked for Failing to Disclose Data-Sharing Deals", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook and some of the other largest technology firms in the world faced sharp criticism on Wednesday for failing to disclose the extent of the social network\u2019s data-sharing deals, many of which went back to the company\u2019s early years.Lawmakers in the United States and Britain on Wednesday called for greater oversight of Facebook, the world\u2019s dominant social media platform. But critics also focused on statements that Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had made in recent months while defending the company.Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, said the revelations made him question Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision making. \u201cI know he\u2019s smart, but sometimes I think he\u2019s got no sense,\u201d Mr. Kennedy told Fox News, adding that the disclosures were cause to consider stricter privacy laws. \u201cCongress is going to have to regulate them and stop this, and I hate to do it, but by God I will if they can\u2019t clean up their act.\u201dFacebook officials said the deals did not violate user privacy \u2014 or a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred it from sharing data without permission \u2014 because the companies were acting on Facebook\u2019s behalf.In a post published on Facebook on Tuesday, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, the company\u2019s director of developer platforms and programs, defended the partnerships, saying the company entered into the agreements to let users interact with Facebook friends across devices and popular websites.\u201cNone of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people\u2019s permission,\u201d Mr. Papamiltiadis wrote, asserting that most partners did not have to seek consent before obtaining users\u2019 data because they were serving as extensions of Facebook.But he also acknowledged that Facebook had made mistakes in managing some of the deals. \u201cWe recognize that we\u2019ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information,\u201d he wrote.Facebook was already dealing with fallout from reports that a political consulting company, Cambridge Analytica, obtained the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users. Cambridge used the information to build tools later deployed in President Trump\u2019s election campaign. The F.T.C. launched an inquiry into Facebook\u2019s practices after the data leak became public, and the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating the social network.News of the deals on Wednesday further roiled the technology industry as policymakers and privacy advocates directed anger at Facebook\u2019s leaders and its partners.Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, attacked Mr. Zuckerberg for not disclosing the full scope of the agreements during a Senate hearing in the spring, when Mr. Zuckerberg assured officials that users had complete control of their data.\u201cMark Zuckerberg had a lot of chutzpah telling Congress that Americans could control their data, when seemingly every other week Facebook faces a new privacy scandal for abusing our personal information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat, called for the F.T.C. to police the company more aggressively. \u201cFacebook\u2019s seemingly unrestrained sharing of user data is the privacy equivalent of the BP oil spill,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal wrote on Twitter. \u201cOngoing, uncontained & toxic. We will be paying the price for decades.\u201dDamian Collins, a British lawmaker whose parliamentary committee is investigating online disinformation, said Facebook officials should answer for why they had not been more forthcoming. \u201cI feel that we have been given misleading responses by the company when we have asked these questions during previous evidence sessions.\u201dAnd Barbara Underwood, the New York attorney general, said her office would examine the deals as part of a continuing investigation into Facebook. \u201cThe news that Facebook struck data-sharing partnerships with other corporations reflects the many unanswered questions to which New Yorkers deserve clear answers,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Ms. Underwood\u2019s office.Facebook has sought to contain the damage in part by winding down many of its data-sharing partnerships. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had brought more than 60 of its agreements to a close.But deals with two giants of the technology world \u2014 Amazon and Apple \u2014 remain in place. Facebook officials said the deals must continue because of contracts the social network signed with the companies.Records obtained by The Times showed that the social network granted Apple devices broad access to people\u2019s personal data, even when users had disabled sharing. Facebook gave Amazon access users\u2019 email addresses without permission, among other things, the records revealed.An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. An Apple spokesman said that the company stopped integrating Facebook into its operating systems earlier this year, but that the access continued to accommodate users of older systems.In addition to those partnerships, Facebook will continue allowing special access for Tobii Technology, a company that makes devices allowing people with neuromuscular diseases to use the social network, a Facebook spokeswoman said.Facebook also had a deal to share the data of users\u2019 friends with Microsoft, and agreements that gave Spotify and Netflix full access to users\u2019 private messages. Users were especially incensed at the Spotify and Netflix deals, which appeared to go far beyond what the companies required for their integrations.Spotify\u2019s Facebook feature, still active, allowed users to share music with friends; Netflix\u2019s integration, discontinued in 2015, let users share movie and TV recommendations. A Netflix spokesman on Wednesday said the company did not view personal messages for any other reason.\u201cThe total lack of respect for user wishes is the infinitely repeating scandal of 2018,\u201d she added.An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement made to Fox News about Facebook. The statement was made by Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, not Senator Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rome Gets a New Christmas Tree, Sponsored by Netflix. Will It Weather Social Media?", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Rarely have expectations for a tree been so high.So it\u2019s no wonder that this year\u2019s tree has been under especially close scrutiny. The official presentation is scheduled for Saturday, but its journey, to glory or infamy, has been tracked for weeks.In late November, intrepid reporters from Rome trekked to the Lombardy town of Cittiglio, 416 miles north of the capital to a garden nursery whose identity had been kept secret for weeks.There, they chronicled the tree\u2019s axing and preparation for the trip to Rome, which involved detaching the larger branches of the 75-foot tree, to be reaffixed upon arrival in Rome.In comparison, the Vatican\u2019s equally tall Christmas tree, which was officially illuminated on Friday afternoon, came to Rome from the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia in one piece.As befits a social media star, #Speracchio/#Spezzacchio/@Speraggio has its own entourage, and on Friday, a publicist fielded questions from a camp at the base of the tree. Security guards kept interlopers at bay.The new tree\u2019s reviews on social media have been mostly positive.On Friday, though lights were still being strung, Rome\u2019s new tree was already getting ready for its close up.

{"Headline": "Springsteen on Netflix, Where Everyone Can Get a Ticket", "Date": "2018-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookBruce Springsteen\u2019s solo monologue-plus-concert was sold out far in advance during its entire run, with an average face-value ticket price of around $500. For the last performance (on Saturday, the day before Netflix is releasing the film), resale tickets are currently running from $3,000 to well over $40,000 each. Making the show available for the cost of a streaming subscription is an unqualified boon, a greater contribution to the public good than our civic institutions seem capable of at the moment.Admittedly, the feeling of being in the audience at the Walter Kerr Theater, sharing the distinct but equally electric currents of an unplugged rock show, a cadenced sermon and a shrewdly theatrical entertainment, can\u2019t be replicated. The live experience is inimitable, and the post-show emotional high as you walk out of the theater probably can\u2019t be duplicated, either.But the film, directed by Thom Zimny and shot by Joe DeSalvo at two private performances this year, has its own compensations. \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d has sold out on the strength of its star\u2019s connection with his huge fan base, and the opportunity to see him do a clutch of his best-known songs in a relatively small setting. But the show\u2019s revelation \u2014 and the reason it actually worked so well \u2014 was his ability to take the stagecraft he\u2019d honed in rock clubs and arenas and transfer it so effortlessly to the theater.It\u2019s a master class in pacing, dynamics, modulation of volume and tone, and the film brings you right up onstage with Springsteen, giving you a more intimate view of his technique \u2014 understated, seemingly casual but absolutely controlled \u2014 than you could get in the theater. Each expression, gesture, artful hesitation and sly punch line is zeroed in on, framed for our appreciation.Zimny, who served as his own editor, presents the show unadorned, almost entirely without directorial intervention \u2014 it\u2019s just Springsteen onstage, joined for two songs by his wife and fellow E Street Band member, Patti Scialfa. The one noticeable strategy Zimny employs has to do with the audience, which is unseen during the first half of the film, when Springsteen delivers a series of vignettes about his childhood and his beginnings as a musician. Zimny films these highly personal anecdotes, and their accompanying songs, in close-ups and medium shots that don\u2019t stray beyond the stage.In the show\u2019s second half, as Springsteen\u2019s text opens up (and loses some of its poetic intensity) to encompass themes like fatherhood, relationships and the current political moment, Zimny gradually opens up, too, showing us hints of the audience members. They finally appear in full during the rousing closing performance of \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d and the film ends on a note of community, with the Boss reaching across the lights to shake hands with his fans.Advertisement"}

Reruns of Joey\u2019s thespian trials, Chandler\u2019s hapless sarcasm, Monica\u2019s compulsive cleanliness, Phoebe\u2019s feline riffs and the seemingly permanent courtship of Ross and Rachel will be available to watch on Netflix for at least another year, the streaming service has announced.But it will come at a steep price: The company will pay around $100 million to continue licensing the program from its owner, WarnerMedia, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the deal.That\u2019s a significant jump from the $30 million a year that Netflix had paid previously to stream the show. But the new amount reflects the thirst for content in the streaming age. Online viewing is the future of entertainment, and the industry\u2019s biggest players \u2014 including WarnerMedia\u2019s parent, AT&T; the Walt Disney Company; Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal; Viacom; CBS; and Discovery \u2014 are retooling their streaming operations to take on services like Netflix and Amazon.WarnerMedia and Netflix declined to comment.For Netflix, paying big money for hit content is necessary to expanding its customer base, now 57 million in the United States and 130 million worldwide.At an investor conference in New York on Monday, Ted Sarandos, head of Netflix\u2019s content division, said the show\u2019s departure \u201cis a rumor.\u201dThe deal to keep \u201cFriends\u201d on Netflix was due to expire by the end of the year, but both Netflix and AT&T had been negotiating for at least a few months to extend it, the people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\u201cThat\u2019s content we definitely want on our platform,\u201d AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said of \u201cFriends\u201d at an investor conference on Tuesday. \u201cAnd clearly it\u2019s important to Netflix as well.\u201dHe added that the new agreement between the two is nonexclusive, meaning \u201cFriends\u201d is likely to appear on AT&T\u2019s coming service by 2020. The sides are currently negotiating rates for after 2019 that would be significantly lower than $100 million, since the show would no longer stream exclusively on Netflix, the people with knowledge of the matter said. It\u2019s also possible that \u201cFriends\u201d could leave Netflix after next year, they added.To attract new streaming customers, AT&T will likely have to keep some of its shows and films off other services like Netflix and have them available only on AT&T\u2019s offering. Disney, which plans to debut its own streaming service by the end of next year, will start pulling some of its films from Netflix after next year.Companies like Netflix \u201cshould expect their libraries are going to get a lot thinner,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s going to make it exciting for us,\u201d the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, said on the company\u2019s earnings call in October of the forthcoming competition. \u201cIt\u2019s great for consumers. Incredible for producers. I mean there\u2019s never been so much TV and movies being created around the world. So the game is on.\u201dThe market will support two or three on-demand streaming services, including Netflix, Mr. Stephenson said on Tuesday, \u201cand we want to be one of the two or three.\u201dThe entrance of AT&T and Disney into streaming could lead to a situation where studios hold off licensing their shows and films, or at least drastically cut back on such deals, to help stoke subscriptions to their own streaming services.\u201cFriends\u201d ran for 10 seasons from 1994 through 2004 on NBC\u2019s once-mighty Thursday night lineup that dominated television.Whether it is or not, Netflix has decided it\u2019s worth $100 million.Advertisement"}

After his shift ended, the two were introduced and immediately started having several drinks together. The accuser said he told Mr. Spacey he was 23, even though he was actually 18.At one point, the two were beside a piano at the bar, where Mr. Spacey and the accuser had been singing songs.

Mr. Spacey left to go to the bathroom and the accuser, who said he was distraught, left to go home.The criminal complaint includes interviews with other people, including the accuser\u2019s girlfriend, who told the authorities that the Snapchat video showed Mr. Spacey \u201ctouching the front\u201d of the accuser\u2019s \u201cpants by his crotch.\u201dA bartender who was working at the Club Car that night told detectives that he remembered Mr. Spacey being there with the accuser but did not see any sexual assault.A bystander told the police something similar, and that the accuser looked \u201cpale, blank, a bit frightened.\u201dHis only public response so far has been a bizarre video posted on Twitter on Monday after initial news of the felony charge broke.

{"Headline": "Maria Callas, the Diva We Love to Keep Alive ", "Date": "2018-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA documentary and a hologram concert re-creation celebrating the famous opera singer are testament to her enduring legacy. Get in line. Mr. Belcher is an editor in the Hong Kong office of the Opinion section.Why do we find such enduring fascination with Maria Callas more than 40 years after her death at age 53? What is it about this opera diva, whose life and career were equal parts brilliant and tormented, that excites us so? And what the heck did she see in Aristotle Onassis?And our fascination isn\u2019t for the reasons that, say, James Dean or Marilyn Monroe are still an industry of calendars and pop culture exploitation. They died in their primes and were adored as much for their sexual beauty as their talent. The paparazzi transformed Callas into a jet-set sex symbol \u2014 the Ava Gardner of opera: tempestuous and naughty, even if that was mostly spin \u2014 as they tracked her famous cancellations, illnesses, fashion and, above all, her volatile love affair with Onassis, often referred to as the richest man in the world at the time. Her personal life became tabloid fodder when Onassis the savior became Onassis the Judas after he dumped Callas to marry Jackie Kennedy.Perhaps it is also the way we are drawn to the tragic figures of the past \u2014 that parade of exquisitely talented people who become victims of the system and the company they keep. In the 1950s and \u201960s, when opera was truly for the wealthy and highly educated \u2014 before supertitles and high-definition simulcasts made it more like a Broadway musical or a really sharp Netflix movie on a large laptop \u2014 an opera singer of Callas\u2019s stature was a pop icon, and perhaps nobody played the prima donna role better than Callas. Just listen to her tell the press mob at an airport in \u201cMaria by Callas,\u201d \u201cI have no further comment, gentlemen,\u201d as she whisks by them, with the kind of guilty grin we all try to suppress when we\u2019re the center of attention.The major sopranos and mezzo-sopranos of the opera stage these days are not linked to rich playboys, and their personal lives are not the target of columnists and aggressive photographers. Opera is more accessible now \u2014 and therefore more like pop music. Opera is mostly a personal music preference or a place to show off your formal attire rather than a passion or a signpost of class status.Perhaps the cult of Callas is so enduring because she so succinctly embodied the tragedy in her voice. For all of the debate about the quality of her voice (and whether it suffered as she dropped so much weight) and her electrifying gift for acting, it\u2019s the recordings that embody the desperation of Italian tragic opera. She was not a comic actress or singer \u2014 Callas wore despair like Debbie Reynolds wore perky \u2014 and that place that Italian death opera is so willing to explore took Callas to her own depths, and certainly to ours.The images that flicker across \u201cMaria by Callas\u201d and \u201cCallas in Concert: The Hologram Tour\u201d are restored, digitized and perfected with 21st-century technology to celebrate a 20th-century icon and, perhaps, the era that molded her. Callas has never felt as beautifully captivating and anguished \u2014 even if it\u2019s a few fleeting moments of flickering light in the darkness.

That\u2019s also what the [expletive] hosting a talk show has come to,\u201d he deadpanned.We\u2019re nearly two years into the Trump administration, and late-night television remains obsessed. Almost every day of the week, the late-night indignation machine seizes on some new comment from Trump, then feeds its interpretations back into a news cycle that Trump himself \u2014 a devoted TV watcher \u2014 consumes.The ouroboros effect is real.The president\u2019s off-the-cuff, often-vitriolic Twitter feed is the hosts\u2019 most consistent source of comic material. In January, Trump seemed to contradict himself with a series of tweets about the Russia investigation, then capped one message with, \u201cGet smart!\u201d It was perfect bait for Colbert.The line between reportage and entertainment has blurred over the past two years. Viewers of John Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on Sundays know that he often gets deep into the policy weeds. (Best of Late Night covers only weekday shows.) For late-nights hosts broadcasting every night, it can be hard to match that amount of research.But Samantha Bee broadcasts only on Wednesdays, and usually includes at least one lengthy investigative segment in each show.Colbert, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah and Jimmy Fallon have all mastered the art of the Trump impression: grimacing, sandy-voiced and full of jerky hand gestures.Jimmy Fallon has caught flak for his reluctance to hammer the president on substantive issues, and it\u2019s true that he treats Trump in a way that reflects how late-night hosts used to deal with past presidents: He portrays Trump as quirky and confused, but rarely expresses real consternation. Fallon\u2019s funniest moments often come when he impersonates Trump. On Halloween, he played the president as a tanning-addicted Dracula.Some hosts never perfected a Trump impersonation. Instead, Jimmy Kimmel and Samantha Bee in particular often use a different tactic: the un-joke. Without relying on parody, it can be hard to find a way to make humor out of Trump\u2019s unorthodox conduct. So they just go slack-jawed, and enact the amazement that many viewers feel.Some of the best laughs of the year came from timely jokes that had nothing to do with Trump. These now feel like a vintage commodity, nearly lost in an era after Jay Leno and David Letterman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix, Amazon and More in December", "Date": "2018-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe holidays can be a stressful time, even in the best of families. So in this month\u2019s roundup, we\u2019ve looked for the most soothing and crowd-pleasing TV series and movies coming to the major streaming services in December, with special favor bestowed upon anything nostalgic or mouthwatering. Below are the most interesting of what we\u2019ve found, followed by a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.)What if you suddenly had a chance to be the president? It happens to an ordinary man named Dave Kovic (a versatile Kevin Kline) \u2014 but only because of his uncanny resemblance to Bill Mitchell, the actual U.S. President (also Kline). When Mitchell has a medical emergency, Dave finds himself in the Oval Office. Naturally, high jinks ensue. (It\u2019s particularly satisfying to watch him balance the budget). A fun romp for political junkies on both sides of the aisle.Despite being set in early February, \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d is an existential holiday movie in the same vein as \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d: A smug protagonist is compelled to rethink his mortal sojourn \u2014 how he has spent his days, how he has treated people \u2014 and to realize the error of his ways. Here, the case study is condescending TV weatherman Phil Connors (a wonderfully grouchy Bill Murray) who makes an annual trek to cover the big Groundhog Day festival in Punxsutawney, Penn. \u2014 only to find himself mysteriously condemned to relive the day over and over again. Is he in purgatory? A makeshift parallel universe? He doesn\u2019t know and can\u2019t escape, so he learns to make the best of it, ultimately connecting with his fellow human beings (including WrestleMania fan Michael Shannon). Like Phil\u2019s day, this movie becomes better with endless repeat viewings.The director and motion-capture master Andy Serkis\u2019s take on \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d is for those who prefer their anthropomorphized animals to look like they actually live in a jungle \u2014 in other words, less cute and cuddly and more scruffy and muddy. Adopted by wolves, Mowgli (Rohan Chand) struggles with his precarious place in the pack; if he can\u2019t keep up, he will be cast out. But might this wild child be able to adapt to the human world? A colonial hunter (Matthew Rhys) takes Mowgli under his wing, and Mowgli is befriended by a village woman (Freida Pinto) during Holi festivities. As Mowgli straddles the two worlds \u2014 belonging to both and to neither \u2014 the story turns dark. And no one, animal or human, gets off easy. Major plus: the stellar voice work by Benedict Cumberbatch (as the tiger Shere Khan) and Christian Bale (as the panther Bagheera).Some baking shows you watch to marvel at the artistry, but not \u201cNailed It!\u201d This American series is for the barely-able-to-bake set, people who consider it a win if their pathetic attempt at patisserie resembles anything in the vicinity of say, a cake pop, a doughnut or an elaborate exercise in excess fondant. (Seriously, what is the deal with fondant, \u201cNailed It!\u201d?) These holiday episodes are a mad chef\u2019s laboratory for dreidel-shaped cake pops, polar animal confections and edible nativity scenes. \u201cThis baby Jesus is the most delicious baby I\u2019ve ever eaten,\u201d host Nicole Byer quips at one point. And later: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to eat Santa.\u201d OK, maybe you can.In the beginning, there are only splashes of water rushing across stone tiles, then receding. Eventually we realize we are watching Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio, in her first role), a live-in domestic worker for a middle-class family in Mexico City, scrub the household driveway. The movie, shot in gorgeous black-and-white, is a moving, semi-autobiographical interpretation of the Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s own childhood in the 1970s. Cleo is modeled after his family\u2019s live-in housekeeper, Liboria Rodriguez, and Cuar\u00f3n imagines the world through her eyes, noting, with intimate deal, the conflicted status of servants who are both quasi-family members and, inevitably, perpetual outsiders. A must-see.The story of a boy and his dog, basically. But since this is a Wes Anderson film, and it\u2019s made in painstaking stop-motion animation, there\u2019s a bit more to it than that. The boy is Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin), and he\u2019s on a mission to rescue his loyal canine Spots (Liev Schreiber) from Trash Island, where the dogs of Megasaki have been quarantined by a cat-loving, dog-phobic mayor (Kunichi Nomura, who co-wrote the script). Anderson\u2019s whimsy is relentless as always, but depending on your reading of its usage, the movie is either a sincere tribute to, or plunders, Japanese art, cinema and music. On another level, it\u2019s also a parable about bigotry, propaganda, the rise of authoritarian regimes and the need, everywhere and always, for compassion.If the 1978 animated adaptation of Richard Adams\u2019s novel left you with emotional scars as a child, be assured that this limited series is a gentler viewing. Which isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s no danger or pain involved as a group of refugee rabbits set out in search of a new home when one of their own, the nervous Fiver (voiced by Nicholas Hoult), has visions of \u201csomething bad\u201d coming. Something bad is always coming for rabbits, of course \u2014 they are preyed-upon creatures, after all \u2014 but the destruction of their natural world forces them to confront their concept of mortality and to reassess established power structures, as well as the price they are willing to pay for peace. It\u2019s easy to love these little guys and girls (there are more female rabbits this time around) and as we spend more time with Fiver, his brother Hazel (voiced by James McAvoy) and their pal Bigwig (John Boyega), we become invested in their fates. Prepare yourself for the usual \u201cWatership\u201d waterworks.Audrey Hepburn\u2019s Holly Golightly is vividly remembered for her sleek dawn-of-the-sixties styles \u2014 the little black dress, the big sunglasses, the jaunty cigarette holder. In Blake Edwards\u2019s celebrated movie version of Truman Capote\u2019s novella, she still casts a spell, and not just over the men passing through her breezy New York life \u2014 has the city ever seemed more emblematic? \u2014 but over us, too.

{"Headline": "Best TV Shows of 2018", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames PoniewozikTV gets better and better, but it does not necessarily do so in a straight line. The first several months of 2018, I worried I might have a hard time filling this list. The last half of the year, though, came on with a burst of creativity that kept me adding and subtracting to the last minute. This is one reason I don\u2019t rank it in order. I\u2019d be lying if I told you I liked my No. 7 show measurably better than No. 8, and you could make a solid Top 10 out of my near-misses (\u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d among them).[Why I love this opening of \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d]Mike HaleThe magic number that\u2019s used to scare us these days with regard to the excessive population of scripted television shows is 500. But my research \u2014 consisting of poring over my own obsessively maintained lists \u2014 indicates that in 2018, the number of new seasons of international shows alone was more than 600.Chinese soap operas and Korean romantic comedies, British conspiracy thrillers, Indian gangster sagas, moody Scandinavian ghost stories, Mexican melodramas, Spanish crime capers, French children\u2019s shows and Japanese anime \u2014 the only bar to entry is how many TV and streaming subscriptions you\u2019re willing to spring for.The other issue is time, of course. The shows on the following list are my 10 favorites among the relatively small share of international series I was able to sample. Please use the comments to fill in the gaps with your own picks. (Before you ask, \u201cThe Crown\u201d didn\u2019t have a new season in 2018.)Margaret LyonsTop debuts included addictive thrillers and nihilistic satires.Even though Peak TV shows no real signs of actually peaking, this wasn\u2019t a banner year for new shows \u2014 most of the year\u2019s standouts were veteran series. There were hundreds of premieres, which often felt like thousands of premieres, which is why no one person can possibly watch it all. I know I\u2019ve missed some great shows in the last 12 months. All I can say is I\u2019ve caught some great ones, too, and these were the freshmen that stood out.The dreamy-surfy \u201cLodge 49\u201d has arguably the best casting of any series on this list. A show this gentle and diffuse only works if all the performances have a strong gravitational pull, and the show lives and dies on Wyatt Russell\u2019s ability to give the dopey but loyal Dud enough grounding. Luckily Russell\u2019s terrific, as is the rest of the cast \u2014 especially Brent Jennings as Ernie, Dud\u2019s mentor in the show\u2019s fictional fraternal order, and Sonya Cassidy as Liz, Dud\u2019s twin sister who\u2019s been handling the family\u2019s affairs since their dad died. \u201cLodge 49\u201d has a radiant internal decency, one that respects its characters\u2019 sometimes silly quests because it\u2019s a series that knows trying new things is hard but worth it.Ryan Murphy\u2019s ensemble drama set within the drag world of 1980s New York knows how to balance its sad side with its soapy side with its fun side with its human side. It\u2019s a show about allegiance and community, about characters who have found one another on the fringes and made a life and a world for themselves.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Internet Church Isn\u2019t Really Church ", "Date": "2018-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShowing up in person is exhausting, especially compared with live-streaming. But being together is the whole point. Ms. Turner is a writer. When I walk into services on Sunday morning, I\u2019m usually about 30 minutes late. Our 6-month-old wakes up from his morning nap at 10, right when the first chords of a hymn begin to be played in our San Francisco church. My husband and I rush to get the baby dressed, fed and in the car. We drop him off at the nursery 20 minutes after all the other kids have settled in, kiss him goodbye, walk upstairs and find our seats just around the time the sermon is beginning.Not all online church is so flashy \u2014 many congregations simply stream their services for those who just can\u2019t make it in. For many churchgoers, consuming church the way we consume the news is more convenient, and more in line with our lifestyles than the old-fashioned Sunday morning visit.And yet, church calls. Going to church \u2014 sitting in a room with other people for an hour and a half on Sundays \u2014 is nonnegotiable for me, unless I\u2019m out of town. At the same time some people find themselves at brunch with friends or catching up on Netflix in bed, I am in a padded, stackable chair at the Russian cultural center my church rents for our services, sitting under a disco ball and listening to a sermon about Jesus. Live-streaming church services is nothing new, and churches have been making and selling recordings of their sermons ever since the advent of cassette tapes. The intention behind live-streaming services \u2014 to make church, and its attendant benefits of community, prayer and worship, available to everyone with a smartphone \u2014 is a good one. But it presumes that God is primarily present to us one on one, as individuals, rather than as a community of believers. This is not what the Bible says. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that \u201cwhere two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.\u201d This passage suggests the necessity of being part of a community in which we approach God, rather than doing it alone.In his letters to early Christian communities, the Apostle Paul describes the church as a body comprising different but equally necessary members. When the church at Corinth was bickering over the importance of different spiritual gifts, Paul wrote to remind them that \u201cthe body does not consist of one member but of many.\u201d He writes, \u201cThe eye cannot say to the hand, \u2018I have no need of you,\u2019 nor again the head to the feet, \u2018I have no need of you.\u2019\u201d Later, he says, \u201cIf one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.\u201dTwo Christmases ago, my husband and I were dealing with our second miscarriage in three months. It was a time that was fraught with anxiety and debilitating sickness. There were so many Sundays when streaming a church service would have been preferable to getting out of bed, and there were Sundays when I couldn\u2019t get out of bed at all. As the holidays approach, I can already feel myself pulled in a dozen different directions. When will we buy the tree? What traditions should we institute for our new family of three? Have I gotten enough work done that I can take a few days off around Christmas? When can I pack for our visit to see family? Every moment seems full of things to do. But instead of wanting to put church on TV in the background while I wrap presents, I find myself pulled toward those stackable chairs, the Advent hymns, the communion bread and cup handed to me with the reminder that they are the body and blood of Christ. I want to hear the children sing off-key during the Lessons and Carols service, smell the musty air in the Russian Center, eat too many doughnuts in the common area with the people who are the church to me. This, then, is the beauty of the church: not that it is perfect or convenient or fits easily into my life but that without it, my life would be deficient. I could still believe in God without the church, could celebrate Christmas without it, or go once a year. But I don\u2019t believe I would truly be a Christian without the real, in-person, Sunday morning church. Disco ball and all.Laura Turner is the author of a forthcoming book about the cultural history of anxiety. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Version of YouTube Takes Shape With Pranksters, Magicians and Cartoons", "Date": "2018-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant sees Facebook Watch, with its rising number of videos from internet stars, as a key to future growth. A 20-something magician performing on the streets of Thailand and Jamaica. Three Australian brothers who shock bystanders with devious pranks. A conservative commentator in Mississippi who rants about America\u2019s priorities from his car. These are some of the video makers who in recent months have started making serious money from Facebook Watch, the tech giant\u2019s answer to YouTube. Julius Dein, the magician, said his videos had attracted revenue in the \u201csix figures\u201d since July, when he became able to run ads on them. The prankster brothers, known as the Jalals, said they had earned more than $500,000 since August. But creating a space that can attract that money has been a challenge for Facebook. Since beginning Watch in August 2017, the company had limited the number of pages that could run video ads to a tightly curated set of entities, including well-known publishers, TV networks and celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith and Tom Brady. That has now changed. At the end of August, Facebook started to allow more pages to run ads on videos that were at least three minutes long. The number of Facebook pages that can run video ads has gone from about 3,700 on Aug. 1 to more than 23,000 this month, according to data shared with The New York Times by OpenSlate, an analytics firm that helps advertisers assess online video content. While Facebook has invested in plenty of original programming and established shows like \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d this year, it has also opened up Watch to much more do-it-yourself content from comedians, video bloggers and other digital entertainers. In other words, the YouTube crowd \u2014 though the number of videos on Watch is a small fraction what\u2019s available on YouTube.\u201cThey need premium, hit, intellectual-property-driven stuff to fuel the idea that this is TV-style content,\u201d said Ben Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine Media, which oversees brands with popular Watch shows like \u201cThe Dodo\u201d and \u201cNowThis.\u201d \u201cBut then they need the volume that comes from News Feed content coming into Watch. That\u2019s a balance that\u2019s really delicate.\u201dWith more pages showing video ads, there are more places for advertisers to run their messages, and more opportunities for Facebook users to get access to videos on the platform. Among the most popular of these pages are entries from mainstream companies like Disney, BuzzFeed and Vice, according to OpenSlate. But in October and December, the most popular pages included a provocative group of bare-chested performers known as Magic Men Live, and others with names like \u201cInsane Stunts,\u201d \u201cJesus Today\u201d and \u201cNurse Blake.\u201d There was little in the way of news and politics. Facebook said on Thursday that more than 75 million people around the world spent at least one minute on Watch every day, and that those users then spent at least 20 minutes there on average. Ms. Pinkett Smith\u2019s \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d is its most-followed show and has the most active Facebook group, according to the company. Fidji Simo, who leads Facebook\u2019s video efforts, said that most users were getting access to Watch by clicking into it from the platform\u2019s main site rather than through videos on their News Feed.  \u201cSeeing how many people are coming in and watching for an average of more than 20 minutes has definitely been encouraging,\u201d Ms. Simo said. \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing this content create communities and social engagement on the platform.\u201d\u201cOne\u2019s a more lean-forward experience, and one\u2019s a more lean-back experience,\u201d said George Manas, who leads performance marketing across Omnicom Media Group agencies. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that because it\u2019s running across both environments, it\u2019s creating challenges in measurement and, frankly, just in quality control because the user experience just isn\u2019t the same.\u201d Graham Allen, the 31-year-old host of \u201cRant Nation With Graham Allen,\u201d a Watch show from Conservative Review\u2019s CRTV (which recently merged with TheBlaze to form Blaze Media), said the viewership had made up for a sharp drop in traffic to his personal page after Facebook shifted its algorithms to favor its video offering.\u201cMost people don\u2019t even realize that the majority of videos they\u2019re watching now on their News Feeds are from Watch pages,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that was intentional from Facebook, to make it a seamless transition, or they just didn\u2019t think it through enough, like, \u2018Wow, people might not be able to know the difference.\u2019\u201d He added, \u201cAs far as video content goes, if you don\u2019t have a Watch page, you\u2019re kind of dead in the water right this second.\u201d The ad revenue has been welcome, he said, noting that he was previously more reliant on outside deals with sponsors. Mr. Dein, a 24-year-old magician from London who posts videos of street performances around the world, was able to start running video ads on his page in July. He said Facebook\u2019s rules affected the kind of videos that performed well, noting that ads can run after a minute as long as the video is at least three minutes long. \u201cWith me, since I\u2019m magic, I\u2019ll make sure the ad is on an exciting moment of the video,\u201d Mr. Dein said. \u201cIf I\u2019m about to cut my finger open for a magic trick, the ad plays just as the knife goes down.\u201d Mr. Dein said he had found it harder to produce \u201csuper-viral videos,\u201d like one he posted last year about homeless people reacting to magic, which he said had been watched more than 200 million times. But he said it made sense for Facebook to mimic YouTube and adopt longer-form content to appeal to advertisers. \u201cIf someone\u2019s watching a vlogger like Logan Paul and tuned into that person, they\u2019re paying more attention to the ad, whereas if someone is watching a seven-second clip, they don\u2019t care about the video or the ad,\u201d he said. \u201cNews content tends to be on the shorter side, so we\u2019ve seen a lot of news partners have a lot of one-minute videos,\u201d she said. Advertisers are also able to opt out of categories that tend to be closely related to news and politics, like \u201cdebated social issues\u201d and \u201ctragedy and conflict,\u201d she said. 1.

Mr. Manas of Omnicom said that while the service had potential, advertisers were still figuring out how people react to ad breaks in social videos. The agency also wants more control over choosing the specific videos for its clients\u2019 ads, rather than simply being offered genres or other bundles. Advertisers are also already spending plenty of money with Facebook on display ads and even other video ads, including sponsored posts that appear on the News Feed, said Susan Schiekofer, chief digital investment officer at GroupM, the media buying arm of ad giant WPP. There are also numerous other online platforms offering original content, from Amazon, Netflix and Hulu to Snap and Google. \u201cThe burden of proof is on Facebook\u2019s end to be able to illustrate to people that they are providing a longer-form video experience,\u201d Amanda Grant, GroupM\u2019s United States head of paid social, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a role for the highly produced content, but it\u2019s more of the sizzle, not the steak,\u201d said Mike Henry, the chief executive of OpenSlate. \u201cSuccess for these guys will come from scale and diversity of content.\u201d\u201cIf Facebook gets this right and can generate scale of inventory and scale of audience, they have the opportunity to combine sight, sound and motion with incredible user targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the holy grail.\u201d Advertisement"}

Medical Center. But when I was 2, my dad got a good job in Kansas City, so my parents packed up and left the place where they grew up for the Midwest.Now, I understand it for the smart career move that it was. For the 10 years we lived outside the Golden State, though, I only ever wanted to go back.Whenever we\u2019d fly into LAX to visit my grandparents and my cousins, it felt like coming home for reasons I couldn\u2019t really articulate.Part of it was that in Kansas, I never quite forgot that I looked different from my tawny-headed classmates, who sometimes asked if I was Chinese. That was hurtful only because it underscored that I\u2019d never be like them at an age when I just wanted to fit in.My mom is Japanese-American and my dad is of Russian Jewish descent. And in California, I felt like I could be just another face in the crowd \u2014 whether we were at an udon restaurant with my mom\u2019s parents in Gardena or the West Hollywood comedy club where my paternal grandmother worked.I share this because it captures the peculiar magic of California for me.We eventually moved back, to the Mission Viejo area. Then I went to college at U.C. Berkeley and worked in Bakersfield, Orange County and Los Angeles as a reporter. During that time, I learned California is a place that\u2019s impossible to explain, to encapsulate in any one way.But it\u2019s a place where almost anyone can feel at home.And that\u2019s what I want California Today to help you feel. I want you to look forward to opening the newsletter every morning, knowing that you\u2019ll start the day understanding your state a little better, even if it\u2019s boundless.To achieve this, we\u2019ll be rethinking the newsletter from greeting to kicker.

Vying against \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d and the blockbuster \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d as best drama contenders will be the superhero smash \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d the melancholy \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d and Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201d (But the group ignored the Viola Davis vehicle \u201cWidows.\u201d)\u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d drew two nominations, for Constance Wu\u2019s acting and best musical or comedy, a category that also included \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d \u201cGreen Book,\u201d \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d and \u201cVice.\u201dHere are five more things to consider about the Globes nominations.The Globes are seen as the most unserious stop on the road to the Oscars, which will take place on Feb. 24. Only 88 people vote on the Globe nominees and winners. And the top Globes are split into dramatic and comedic categories, often in nonsensical ways.Movie fans may also be confused by the inclusion of \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d in the best drama category. The romantic remake is plenty dramatic, but the Globes has a whole category specifically for musicals and comedies. \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d has lots of singing, and the 1976 version starring Barbra Streisand won the Globe for best musical. What\u2019s the deal this time around? It boils down to category shopping: \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d producers wanted to compete in the dramatic category, which is seen as having more heft.A parade of films (\u201cBeautiful Boy,\u201d \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d \u201cThe Old Man & the Gun\u201d) ended up with a lone nomination. That\u2019s how Globes voters roll: Spread the love.Reacting to his nomination, Mortensen, in a statement, positioned the movie as one that \u201cinspires hope and compassion\u201d while inviting audiences to \u201cthink profoundly about our society\u2019s past and present.\u201dThe inclusion of McKay in the director category came as a surprise to most awards handicappers. Squeezed out of the director race was Yorgos Lanthimos, the force behind \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d which compensated with acting nominations for Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz.Because the press association\u2019s nominations arrive as Oscar voters are gearing up for their own selection process, the movie-related Globe categories receive most of the attention. But the truth is that the Globes ceremony draws much of its power from TV stars \u2014 and the desire by voters to be tastemakers by throwing their weight behind fledgling series. In recent years, the Globes have helped put streaming-service shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d on the map.One reminder: Two stalwarts, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d were not eligible this time around because no new episodes of either series aired in 2018.The FX limited series \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u201d led all shows with four nominations, including for best TV movie or mini-series. Among television snubs, the twisty HBO sci-fi western \u201cWestworld\u201d received just one nod, for Thandie Newton\u2019s acting, and the creators of NBC\u2019s sentimental hit \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d known for inspiring buckets of tears, might be shedding a few of their own: It was totally shut out.An earlier version of this article misidentified the streaming service that offers \u201cThe Kominsky Method.\u201d It is Netflix, not Amazon.Jeremy Egner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "10 Classic Christmas Movies That Our Critics Didn\u2019t See Coming", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom as far back as Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d which struggled to find its footing in the end-of-the-year glut of late December 1946, predicting the canon of Christmas movie future has never been easy. Some of today\u2019s favorites had to survive a critical drubbing, or a ho-hum box office. Others needed a push from cable TV. And still others just didn\u2019t seem like holiday movies, becoming classics almost accidentally thanks to reclassification or cult followings.The holidays have given us an occasion to dig through the archives to see if New York Times critics were on the right side of history when they first reviewed these films, or if they missed an annual tradition in the making. Here\u2019s a sample of 10 that are currently available to stream \u2014 some established favorites, others quirky upstarts \u2014 along with excerpts from what our critics first thought of them and links to their full reviews.Frank Capra\u2019s classic tear-jerker about Christmas Eve as a dark night of the soul has been a Yuletide standard-bearer for so long that it\u2019s easy to forget what a ho-hum reception it got at the time. A best picture nomination was the sole consolation prize for a film about a small-town family man (James Stewart) that neither critics nor audiences fully embraced until the mid-1970s, when its revival as an annual television staple commenced. Sentiments like these, from Bosley Crowther\u2019s review, were common:Indeed, the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer\u2019s point of view, is the sentimentality of it \u2014 its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra\u2019s nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical attitudes rather than average realities. And Mr. Capra\u2019s \u201cturkey dinners\u201d philosophy, while emotionally gratifying, doesn\u2019t fill the hungry paunch.Irving Berlin won an Oscar for the song \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d but not for the movie \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d which wasn\u2019t produced until a decade after \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d the Bing Crosby-Fred Astaire musical in which the song first appeared. Christmas was but one of the occasions for mirth in \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d but here it is the VistaVision payoff to the team-up of two different song-and-dance acts. Crowther was unimpressed:\u201cThe colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring \u2014 or very little \u2014 such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn\u2019t hit the eardrums and the funny bone with equal force.\u201dBefore taking a decidedly warmer view of the holiday season with \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d the director Bob Clark offered this nasty piece of counterprogramming, a proto-\u201cHalloween\u201d slasher film with big scares and boozy wit, much of it coming from Margot Kidder. \u201cBlack Christmas\u201d proved to be vastly influential, particularly in its use of first-person camera, but contemporaneous reviews, like A.H. Weiler\u2019s, were dismissive:This moody depiction of the Christmas slayings of university sorority sisters and their housemother, among others, is as murky as the script, which dotes largely on obscenities that are no more pointed than the violence, dull direction and pedestrian performances.Clark\u2019s nostalgia-soaked comedy about a put-upon nine-year-old (Peter Billingsley) in the 1940s and his disaster-prone Midwestern family owes its popularity to Turner broadcasting, which turned a modest hit into a phenomenon by airing it relentlessly on TBS and TNT. Cherished details like the \u201cLittle Orphan Annie\u201d decoder ring, a triple-dog dare on the schoolyard and the Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle were lost on Vincent Canby at the time:There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them.Chaos and malevolence come to a Capra-esque small town in Joe Dante\u2019s anarchic comedy about an exotic pet from Chinatown that turns out to be a troublemaking Christmas present. Dante\u2019s Looney Tunes-style upending of its wholesome holiday setting pushed its PG rating far enough to help trigger the development of PG-13, and the kiddie-movie violence left Canby shaken:[Dante and the screenwriter Chris Columbus] attack their young audience as mercilessly as the creatures attack the characters. One minute they\u2019re fondly recalling Frank Capra\u2019s sentimental classic, \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d and the next minute they\u2019re subjecting this Capraesque Smalltown, U.S.A., to a devastation that makes the original \u2018Invasion of the Body Snatchers\u2019 look benign.Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d had been adapted so many times to heartwarming effect \u2014 as drama, in the Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim standards from 1938 and 1951; as a musical, with Albert Finney in 1970; and with Muppets in 1992 \u2014 that it needed Bill Murray to drop a few coals in the stocking. The film\u2019s spiked nog of cynicism and sentimentality wasn\u2019t easy for some to swallow, including Canby:As Frank Cross, the ratings-mad program chief of the IBC television network, Mr. Murray\u2019s contemporary Scrooge is a joy as long as he\u2019s making life miserable for everyone around him. When, finally, Frank sees the error of his ways, the movie succumbs to its heart of jelly.The question of whether \u201cDie Hard\u201d is a true Christmas movie, rather than merely the template for the last 30 years of action cinema, has been a perennial debate for a long time now. But in 1988, critics like Caryn James were mostly coming to terms with its blockbuster excess:Partly an interracial buddy movie, partly the sentimental tale of a ruptured marriage, the film is largely a special-effects carnival full of machine-gun fire, roaring helicopters and an exploding tank. It also has a villain fresh from the Royal Shakespeare Company, a thug from the Bolshoi Ballet and a hero who carries with him the smirks and wisecracks that helped make \u2018Moonlighting\u2019 a television hit. The strange thing is, it works: \u2018Die Hard\u2019 is exceedingly stupid, but escapist fun.Fatigue is in the air. This third look at the quintessentially middle-American Griswold family, led by Clark (Mr. Chase) and the very patient Ellen (Beverly D\u2019Angelo) is only a weary shadow of the original \u2018National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\u2019 which found a lot to laugh at as it followed the dopey paterfamilias Clark and his quarrelsome brood on a hellish cross-country journey in their station wagon.Christmas seems like the only occasion big enough to accommodate this oversized mistletoe from Richard Curtis, the screenwriter of \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and \u201cNotting Hill,\u201d who combines about half a dozen rom-coms into one mega-rom-com. The film\u2019s too-muchness is an annual indulgence for fans, but A.O. Scott, in one of his most blistering reviews, is not one of them:A romantic comedy swollen to the length of an Oscar-trawling epic \u2014 nearly two and a quarter hours of cheekiness, diffidence and high-tone smirking \u2014 it is more like a record label\u2019s greatest-hits compilation or a \u201cvery special\u201d sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie.Starting with his breakthrough script for \u201cLethal Weapon,\u201d Shane Black has set six of his films over Christmas in Los Angeles, but \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d his directorial debut, is especially keen about finding evidence of the holiday in a city where it isn\u2019t so obvious. This neo-noir buddy picture about a thief posing as an actor (Robert Downey Jr.) who joins forces with a private eye (Val Kilmer) on a murder case is Yuletide fun for smart-alecks, but not for A.O. Scott:I don\u2019t think \u201cKiss Kiss, Bang Bang\u201d is an altogether bad movie. It\u2019s just a movie with no particular reason for existing, a flashy, trifling throwaway whose surface cleverness masks a self-infatuated credulity.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the character played by Chevy Chase in \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation.\u201d He is Clark Griswold, not Griswald. An earlier version of this article also misspelled the surname of an actor. He is Alastair Sim, not Sims.Advertisement"}

Having disrupted the television and music businesses, the internet is finally threatening the heart of Hollywood.Mr. Stuber\u2019s operation is set up to supply 55 original films a year, including some with budgets as high as $200 million. Add in documentaries and animated movies, handled by other divisions, and the number of annual Netflix film releases climbs to about 90. To compare, Universal, one of Hollywood\u2019s most prolific traditional studios, releases roughly 30 movies a year.\u201cGiven the marginal profitability of the theatrical business, if you lose 10 percent of the audience \u2014 some people stay home \u2014 some cinemas go out of business,\u201d said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, a group whose members believe big screens are part of the very definition of film.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a new studio that is exciting for artists,\u201d Mr. Stuber said. \u201cAs we do that, it\u2019s important to be open to criticism. When a great artist says, \u2018Hey, this doesn\u2019t work,\u2019 then we\u2019d better try to fix it. For some of our filmmakers, that means having a theatrical release and contending for awards.\u201dDon\u2019t expect Netflix to bend much further, however.\u201cIn a world where consumer choice is driving everything \u2014 how we shop, how we order groceries, how we are entertained \u2014 we\u2019re trying to get to a place where consumers have theatrical viewing as a choice,\u201d Mr. Stuber said. \u201cBut we also think it is critical that, if you don\u2019t have the means or the access or the time to go to a theater, you are still able to see movies without a long wait.\u201dMr. Fithian of the theater owners association called Mr. Stuber\u2019s comment about access \u201cabsolute hogwash.\u201d He added, \u201cFor filmmakers who want to go to Netflix, they are kind of selling their soul \u2014 the pot of money versus how they know a movie should be seen.\u201dMr. Scorsese disagrees. Netflix adopted his coming mob drama \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, after Paramount balked at its cost.He added: \u201cI trust Scott. I\u2019ve known him for a long, long, long time.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Stuber casually spoke about projects with \u201cSandy\u201d and \u201cMarty\u201d between sips of golden oolong tea. (That would be Ms. Bullock and Mr. Scorsese.)At Netflix, Mr. Stuber has had to bridge the cultural gap between Hollywood, where decisions are made by gut instinct, and his own company, where data and algorithms rule. \u201cIt can\u2019t be easy, but Scott seems to be everywhere at once,\u201d said Susanne Bier, who directed \u201cBird Box.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll send him a text and there will be a quick text back.\u201dMr. Stuber has greenlight authority for all Netflix films but delegates some of those decisions.After graduating from the University of Arizona with a film degree (he went there to play baseball), Mr. Stuber got a job at Universal in 1992 as a publicity assistant. His duties included delivering news clippings at 8 a.m. daily to the studio\u2019s all-powerful chief, Lew Wasserman.After about six months, Mr. Wasserman, apparently impressed by Mr. Stuber\u2019s punctuality, spoke to him for the first time. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey kid, what do you want to be when you grow up?\u2019\u201d Mr. Stuber recalled.The young Mr. Stuber\u2019s quick reply? \u201cYou.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drag Queens on the Screen: There to Prove a Woman\u2019s Authenticity", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAs gender norms become more elastic, drag has burst like a glitter cannon into the mainstream. Think \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d on TV or \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch\u201d on Broadway. Drag queens are appearing more frequently onscreen to \u201cpull the wig down from the shelf,\u201d as Hedwig might put it.But in three recent films and shows \u2014 \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d \u2014 drag queens play second fiddle to the straight women who take center stage. They prod these films and shows, which are all about performers and performances, to work out what \u201creal\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d mean, sometimes at the cost of the drag stars.The movie\u2019s distinction is clear: what the drag queens do is artifice, predicated on a kind of fakery. What Ally does is real, daring to look the audience in the eye as she pauses her performance of \u201cLa Vie en Rose\u201d to gaze at Jackson, who gazes at her, because, unlike the other women performing that night, she has truth in her.It\u2019s that truth that Jackson wants to foster. Ally can accentuate qualities of femininity and female aesthetics for her drag persona, but Jackson sees her talent in spite of the drag, not the drag as an augmentation of her talent. Fittingly, then, the pop star Ally will eventually become is just another kind of drag queen, all about flashy costumes (orange hair, prismatic colors), her modified persona reliant on what the film sees as soulless excess. While \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d is fond of its drag queens, it ultimately condescends to them. For Jackson, and for the film, the artifice of drag (or pop stardom) is an obstacle to authenticity, not another path to it.Conversely, the drag queens in the Netflix movie \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d encourage Willowdean \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d Dickson (Danielle Macdonald) to use the illusion of drag as a way to express her true self. Willowdean is an alienated, overweight high school student and Dolly Parton fan whose mother\u2019s former glories as a pageant queen have dogged her all her life. Spurred by the discovery that her late aunt almost competed for the crown but decided not to, Willowdean signs up for the pageant that made her mother (Jennifer Aniston) famous. But she struggles to really understand why she\u2019s doing it and who she might be if she does enter. Then she learns that her aunt was a beloved patron of a Dolly Parton-themed drag bar.In the film\u2019s effort to upend notions that a pageant is a one-dimensional showcase of beauty, one scene is especially striking: Willowdean is finally able to connect with her hitherto neglectful mother, Rosie (Jennifer Aniston), in a backstage dressing room; they\u2019re both in their own kind of drag, Rosie in the dress and tiara she wore when she won Miss Teen Bluebonnet, and Willowdean in Dolly-as-magician regalia, including ferocious red lipstick, for the competition\u2019s talent section. For them, the performance of beauty can be as honest a place of vulnerability as something more conventional without ornamentation.So, too, does Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) find comfort, catharsis and truth in performing as a stand-up comic in the Amazon show \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d created by Amy Sherman-Palladino. In the Season 2 premiere, her mother has fled to France, frustrated by her marriage and her life in New York. Midge ruminates about her own complicated marriage as she drifts through the streets of Paris, only to end up in a drag bar, where her incisive comedy style, exposing herself in a bracing, sarcastic manner, is juxtaposed against the drag performances, including a trio singing a song about gay Paree.She\u2019s mesmerized and entirely shocked that they are, in fact, drag queens, blithely unaware of their existence outside this club, never mind in New York, or in the Village where she often performs. She loudly exclaims at how \u201creal\u201d they seem, quipping, \u201cDammit, your waist is small, smaller than mine.\u201d With an impromptu translator at hand, she delivers a set about her tempestuous marriage, which, even across a language barrier, turns tragic, leaving the crowd in tears. But that\u2019s what makes her brilliant, her husband argues on the phone later: \u201cIt\u2019s real, it\u2019s authentic\u201d \u2014 no matter how constructed.As much as I enjoy seeing drag queens sashay across the screen with more frequency, it\u2019s hard to get around the fact that they are, in all three works, primarily playthings or props. It\u2019s not just the condescension in \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d In \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d (directed by Anne Fletcher), Lee is essentially a \u201cmagical Negro,\u201d the racist trope of a black character who, without agency of his or her own, doles out wisdom to the main white character. The drag queens in \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d are something for her to gawk at and use in her comedy. Because all of these projects are about straight women, the way they depict drag queens feels little more progressive than the convention of the gay best friend, popular in 1990s romantic comedies like \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Wedding\u201d: neutered, a sidekick existing solely to catalyze change in the main character.During her set, Midge Maisel riffs on what makes a woman, poking fun at her drag queen props and the ideals that they would have to live up to. Imagine if the actual queens got to express that themselves.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Epic Battles, Palaces and Concubines: A Chinese Studio\u2019s Vast World of Fantasy", "Date": "2018-12-02", "News": "China DispatchHengdian World Studios, in a small town in central China, churns out scores of movies and television series from each period in the country\u2019s history.Supported byHENGDIAN, China \u2014 If you are going to make a movie in China today about ancient warriors defending a mythical kingdom or a partisan resisting the Japanese occupation in the 1930s, or involving any variation of that staple of China\u2019s entertainment industry \u2014 the back-stabbing concubine drama \u2014 chances are you are going to make it in Hengdian.The city is home to Hengdian World Studios, which claims to be the world\u2019s largest outdoor movie and television lot.To call it a \u201clot\u201d is an understatement. It is not one lot, but 13 of them, scattered over 2,500 acres in and around what was once a sleepy farming village nestled in the hills of Zhejiang Province, in eastern China.There are other studios in China \u2014 Shanghai Film Park, for example. Only in Hengdian, though, will you find a faithful recreation of the palace of Qin Shi Huang, who ruled in the third century B.C. near what is today known as Xi\u2019an, or of the capital of the Northern Song dynasty, which reigned from the 10th to the 12th centuries.There is even a Forbidden City that is not only startlingly realistic, but also only a little bit smaller than the real thing in Beijing.\u201cThe Story of Yanxi Palace,\u201d made in the studio, has been streamed 20 billion times on iQiyi, China\u2019s version of Netflix.Lam Yik Fei for The New York TimesThe one thing that might seem to be missing from its huge front gate is the photograph of Mao Zedong \u2014 except that the gate was constructed to look as it did during the Ming dynasty, not the later version known since the 17th century as Tiananmen.\u201cThese scenes today no longer exist,\u201d said Guo Huizhong, a director, as he filmed a war drama, whose title roughly translates as \u201cThe Last Bodyguard,\u201d inside a building reconstructed as an opera house from the first half of the 20th century.Moviemaking blurs the distinction between reality and fantasy, and Hengdian World Studios arguably does that better than any other place on Earth.\u201cThis is where the empress committed suicide,\u201d a studio assistant, Xu Hailei, explained as she guided an open cart through the faux Forbidden City, which, even up close, is pretty convincing.\u201cShe jumped from there,\u201d she went on, describing a historical fact of 18th-century China \u2014 the death of Empress Fucha \u2014 but also a pivotal scene in one of the most sensational dramas of the year, a 70-episode epic, \u201cThe Story of Yanxi Palace.\u201d\u201cYanxi Palace\u201d streamed on iQiyi, China\u2019s version of Netflix, from July to August, and continues to do so in China and dozens of other countries. It has been streamed 20 billion times, and its staggering popularity has influenced everything from fashion to the debate over China\u2019s struggling #MeToo campaign.It has also attracted more visitors to Hengdian, which distributes maps and postcards showing the sites where the series was filmed, including the building of the title, which means the Palace of Prolonged Happiness.That is where the concubines of the Qing dynasty emperors lived and conspired until the place burned down in the middle of the 19th century. The one in the Forbidden City today is a reconstruction from 1931.Ye Yunfeng, 24, came with her boyfriend from Lishui, a city not far to the south, because she wanted to see the hall where the emperor\u2019s Grand Council met.\u201cThe details of this show are very good,\u201d she explained. \u201cMany details, like the clothes, the headdresses and the backdrops, are in line with history.\u201dThe serial\u2019s creators, and its fans, judging from comments posted online, credit its success in large part to the attention to historical detail.\u201cThe cost of actors and actresses are not expensive,\u201d said Yang Le, the chief executive officer of Huanyu Film, the Beijing production company that produced \u201cYanxi Palace.\u201dInstead, the producers spent their budget on artisanal embroiderers to recreate the dresses and flowered headdresses of the era \u2014 3,000 outfits, some of which are on display in the company\u2019s office in Beijing.Yu Zheng, a screenwriter and producer of \u201cYanxi Palace,\u201d said he wanted to convey an aspect of China\u2019s \u201cintangible cultural heritage\u201d \u2014 combined with \u201cthe pacing of an American television series.\u201d\u201cPeople in our generation are all watching American and British television series,\u201d said Mr. Yu, who is 40, \u201cbut actually there are many traditional cultures in China that are very worthy of being promoted to the world. We have a lot of beautiful things.\u201dThat is the illusion Hengdian World Studios was created to sustain.The studio was founded in 1996 by one of China\u2019s first billionaires, Xu Wenrong. His Hengdian Group made a fortune in electronic components in the early years of the country\u2019s capitalist transition.Battle scene from \u201cPromise to Chang\u2019an.\u201d Lam Yik Fei for The New York TimesSince then more than 2,400 films and television series have been made at the studio, including 337 between January and October this year.On a recent visit, there were 15 different projects being shot there, requiring studio organizers to juggle schedules and enforce deadlines.There are 400 distinct spaces where filming can take place, covering the entire breadth of China\u2019s history, its culture and its architecture.\u201cMany people learn history through television dramas,\u201d said Zheng Junnan, a production assistant for another concubine melodrama set in the Qing dynasty.\u201cI don\u2019t read books often,\u201d he explained.Mr. Zheng, like many in Hengdian, is a transient; he moved to Hengdian for the duration of shooting.There is a sort of union hall in the town center where people play cards and shoot pool while waiting for the chance to get parts as extras. And epic battles need lots of extras.Another lot, \u201cThe Exposition City of the Ming and Qing dynasties,\u201d is a reconstruction of ancient buildings that were torn down in nearby parts of China and hauled to Hengdian.There are scores of courtyard temples, houses and other structures, including a wooden tower from Nanjing. Each is marked with plaques describing their origins and \u201cdate of migration.\u201dMr. Xu\u2019s own collection of artifacts \u2014 vases, sculptures, precious stones and the like \u2014 are displayed in several of the 120 buildings in the complex, which includes a recreation of Nanjing\u2019s riverfront.The theater house where Mr. Guo was filming \u201cThe Last Bodyguard\u201d was a reconstruction of an 18th-century building from Anhui Province, with the region\u2019s distinctive southern architecture.It wasn\u2019t his first choice, he said, but other sets in the studio were already booked, so he made do, decorating the stage in the style of the 20th century, and bringing in opera singers from Beijing.Yuxuan Honghao, a 26-year-old actor on the set of another series about concubines set in the Qing dynasty, said the attention to historic details had not always been a priority in the past but \u201cThe Story of Yanxi Palace\u201d is already encouraging others to follow.\u201cThe things in history books are one-side; they are only textual,\u201d he said. \u201cFilms and television dramas can restore Chinese history as much as possible, and people can see what it was like.\u201dClaire Fu contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Love Actually\u2019 (2003) Review", "Date": "2018-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren\u2019t particularly holiday-focused.\u201cLove Actually,\u201d which opens today nationwide, is an indigestible Christmas pudding from the British whimsy factory responsible for such reasonably palatable confections as \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral,\u201d \u201cNotting Hill\u201d and \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary.\u201d A romantic comedy swollen to the length of an Oscar-trawling epic \u2014 nearly two and a quarter hours of cheekiness, diffidence and high-tone smirking \u2014 it is more like a record label\u2019s greatest-hits compilation or a \u201cvery special\u201d sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie.The air is thick with bad pop songs, which those plucky, ironical Britons seem to love in spite of their badness. A sparkling British-American cast of newly minted and long familiar stars chirp, swoon, pine, quip and shed the odd tear. Presiding over it all is the new prime minister, a twinkly bachelor with a tonsorial resemblance to Tony Blair, who is played by none other than Hugh Grant. As he did in the far superior \u201cAbout a Boy,\u201d Mr. Grant makes a climactic onstage appearance at a school talent show. He also sings \u201cGood King Wenceslas\u201d and disco-dances around 10 Downing Street in his shirt sleeves.In his opening voice-over, Mr. Grant establishes a new standard for bad taste masquerading as its opposite when he introduces this fluffy farrago, written and directed by Richard Curtis, with a reference to the World Trade Center attacks. The phone calls made from the towers, he suggests, show that however perilous the state of the world, \u201clove is all around.\u201d Further support for this thesis is gleaned from the arrival gate at Heathrow, where people tend to hug and kiss each other a lot.Like much else in \u201cLove Actually,\u201d you almost buy this moment of banal sentiment, because it is so prettily shot and smartly spoken. But the film\u2019s governing idea of love is both shallow and dishonest, and its sweet, chipper demeanor masks a sour cynicism about human emotions that is all the more sleazy for remaining unacknowledged. It has the calloused, leering soul of an early-60\u2019s rat-pack comedy, but without the suave, seductive bravado. The worst kind of cad is the one who thinks he\u2019s really a sensitive guy deep down.Most of the picture\u2019s half-dozen or so romantic subplots \u2014 which lie scattered about like torn wrapping paper on Christmas morning \u2014 involve workplace dalliances of one kind or another. The ones with the best chances of success all involve an older male boss and a young female subordinate. Jamie (Colin Firth), a writer cuckolded by his own brother, retreats to a villa in the South of France and falls for his Portuguese housekeeper, Aurelia, who speaks no English and who obligingly strips down to her underwear to rescue manuscript pages that have blown into the lake.Harry (Alan Rickman), the head of a nonprofit organization, is besotted with his secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsh), who makes no secret of her attraction to him. The prime minister, moral exemplar of the nation, develops a crush on Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), a member of the Downing Street household staff. When the goatish president of the United States, in London for a state visit, puts the moves on her, the P.M.\u2019s jealousy precipitates a chill in British-American relations (and also makes him a national hero).The funniest and most winning on-the-job romance bubbles up between two people (Martin Freeman and Joanna Page) who work as body doubles on a movie set, miming explicit sex scenes in the absence of the prudish stars. As their naked bodies go through the motions, the two of them chat mildly about traffic and the weather, and their mutual attraction is sealed, on the first date, by a chaste kiss on the cheek.The other genuine comic spark comes from Bill Nighy, playing a washed-up, dissolute rock star named Billy Mack, who is trying for a comeback with a treacly Christmas record. Billy says shocking, hilarious things in television and radio interviews, and his casual indifference to proper decorum makes him the most honest character in the film.The problem is that the movie, more than any of the characters in it, is a mess of crossed signals, swerving between cynicism and sincerity without quite knowing the difference between them. It is most grotesque when it tries for earnest drama, parading the grief of a widower (Liam Neeson) and the humiliation of a middle-aged wife (Emma Thompson) before us when it thinks our throats need lumping.It is disturbing to see Ms. Thompson\u2019s range and subtlety so shamelessly trashed, and to see Laura Linney\u2019s intelligence similarly abused as a lonely, frustrated do-gooder. The fate of their characters suggests that women who are not young, pert secretaries or household workers have no real hope of sexual fulfillment and can find only a compromised, damaged form of love. Perhaps Mr. Curtis wishes to offer this as an insight into contemporary social arrangements; if so, his indifference to the cruelty of those arrangements is truly breathtaking.But it is unlikely that any particular insight was intended. Instead, \u201cLove Actually\u201d is a patchwork of contrived naughtiness and forced pathos, ending as it began, with hugging and kissing at the airport (where returning passengers are perhaps expressing their relief at being delivered from an in-flight movie like this one). The loose ends are neatly tied up, as they are when you seal a bag of garbage \u2014 or if you prefer, rubbish.\u201cLove Actually\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, nudity and profanity. Running time: 128 minutes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Netflix Take Turkey\u2019s TV Dramas to the World?", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 On a recent evening, Nahid Akhtar, 47, sat on a sofa in London shouting at a TV. She was watching \u201cThe Protector,\u201d Netflix\u2019s first original series in Turkish.The show, released that day, is about a young antiques dealer, Hakan Demir (Cagatay Ulusoy), who discovers he belongs to an ancient line of superheroes who have to save Istanbul from evil \u2014 and find love at the same time.\u201cOh, please, don\u2019t kill his baba!\u201d Akhtar, a Turkish drama superfan, called out at one point before Demir\u2019s father was, indeed, murdered. \u201cTurkish dramas have so many orphans,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single series I\u2019ve watched the hero never has both parents.\u201dOn screen, Hakan was in tears. \u201cThis is another thing I do like about Turkish TV,\u201d Akhtar added. \u201cThey show a lot of emotion.\u201dTen minutes later, the character was still distraught. \u201cOh, for crying out loud,\u201d Akhtar said. \u201cSort yourself out!\u201dNow the shows are spreading across Europe. This year, a dubbed version of \u201cFatmagul,\u201d an acclaimed drama about the aftermath of a gang rape, attracted almost a million viewers per episode in Spain, despite being on Nova, a minor channel that specializes in Latin American telenovelas. Other series have found similar success in countries from Bulgaria to Sweden.Only France, Germany, Britain and the United States are resistant, said Fredrik af Malmborg, the managing director of the TV distributor Ecchorights, in a telephone interview. \u201cTurkish TV is about family and moral issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly conservative, slightly old-fashioned, but it\u2019s not cynical.\u201dNetflix has shown Turkish dramas since 2016, but its move into making its own shows their growing appeal, af Malmborg said.There\u2019s already a strong community of enthusiasts across Europe and America for Netflix to target. Akhtar got into Turkish dramas in January 2017 while stuck in bed. \u201cI had chronic, really bad flu,\u201d she said. Bored, she opened Netflix and it suggested an episode of \u201cKurt Seyit ve Sura,\u201d a wartime romance.\u201cI thought I\u2019d just give it a go \u2014 it was only 45 minutes \u2014 and I was absolutely enthralled,\u201d she said.It was the chivalry and romance \u2014 the old-fashioned values \u2014 that grabbed her, she said. But also the dialogue: \u201cIt\u2019s very elegant and poetic. It calls to your soul.\u201dAkhtar soon became obsessed. She once took an emergency two days off work as an information technology consultant to finish another series. She has traveled to Turkey several times, once just to try and bump into her favorite actor. She also joined some 20 Facebook groups, and wrote to the director of a show, begging him to make two characters kiss.\u201cIf characters kiss, the shows can get hugely fined,\u201d Akhtar said. (Turkey\u2019s Radio and Television Supreme Council can punish broadcasters that show anything it considers contrary to the national and moral values of the society.) \u201cSo all the fans put together some money, then contacted the director and said, \u2018Let them kiss. We\u2019ll pay the fine for you.\u2019 \u201dBottles of alcohol are usually blurred to avoid trouble with the censors, she added. Murder is fine, though.Yasemin Y. Celikkol, a doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania who studies Turkish dramas, said some series had proved to have particular resonances in some other countries. A show called \u201cFalling Leaves\u201d was a hit in Bulgaria, she said, because its plot is \u201cabout the terrible things that happen to families when they move to cities.\u201d There\u2019s been a lot of internal migration in Bulgaria, and people could see themselves in it, she added.Dramas have overhauled Turkey\u2019s image in Russia too, Celikkol said, leading many Russians to travel there for vacations, to find husbands or to seek medical treatment. But that seemed to have produced a backlash, she added. In 2016, a Russian television company made a series, \u201cEast/West,\u201d about a Russian couple visiting a Turkish fertility clinic, only for the Russian woman to end up as the Turkish doctor\u2019s unhappy second wife.\u201cIt almost seemed like the show was saying to Russian women, \u2018Don\u2019t go there, you\u2019ll lose your freedom and have no access to your children,\u2019 \u201d Celikkol said. A second season of \u201cEast/West\u201d was broadcast this year.Back in London, Akhtar raced through the first two episodes of \u201cThe Protector,\u201d pointing out all the differences between the Netflix show and other Turkish productions. A scene featuring a woman in her underwear would definitely not appear on television in Turkey, she said. And there was more swearing than normal. The lead actor also looked more unkempt.But she liked it. \u201cI will keep watching,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of it is overacted, when they\u2019re normally more subtle. But I want to know what happens next and the main thing is it\u2019s got subtitles.\u201dThat\u2019s normally a problem, she said. Akhtar speaks only some Turkish, and often has to search online for streams of shows that fans have subtitled themselves.\u201cI just love seeing Istanbul again,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s something in me that wants to go live there for a year and learn Turkish. Or just sit in an apartment and watch these shows.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified one of the actors in the series \u201cFatmagul.\u201d He is Engin Akyurek, not Kerim Ilgaz, which is the name of the character he plays in the program.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Facebook Raised a Privacy Wall, It Carved an Opening for Tech Giants", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "Internal documents show that the social network gave Microsoft, Amazon, Spotify and others far greater access to people\u2019s data than it has disclosed.Supported byFor years, Facebook gave some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies more intrusive access to users\u2019 personal data than it has disclosed, effectively exempting those business partners from its usual privacy rules, according to internal records and interviews.The special arrangements are detailed in hundreds of pages of Facebook documents obtained by The New York Times. The records, generated in 2017 by the company\u2019s internal system for tracking partnerships, provide the most complete picture yet of the social network\u2019s data-sharing practices. They also underscore how personal data has become the most prized commodity of the digital age, traded on a vast scale by some of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley and beyond.The exchange was intended to benefit everyone. Pushing for explosive growth, Facebook got more users, lifting its advertising revenue. Partner companies acquired features to make their products more attractive. Facebook users connected with friends across different devices and websites. But Facebook also assumed extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2 billion users \u2014 control it has wielded with little transparency or outside oversight.Facebook allowed Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users\u2019 friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users\u2019 private messages.The social network permitted Amazon to obtain users\u2019 names and contact information through their friends, and it let Yahoo view streams of friends\u2019 posts as recently as this summer, despite public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years earlier.But the documents, as well as interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its corporate partners, reveal that Facebook allowed certain companies access to data despite those protections. They also raise questions about whether Facebook ran afoul of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that barred the social network from sharing user data without explicit permission.In all, the deals described in the documents benefited more than 150 companies \u2014 most of them tech businesses, including online retailers and entertainment sites, but also automakers and media organizations. Their applications sought the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, the records show. The deals, the oldest of which date to 2010, were all active in 2017. Some were still in effect this year.In an interview, Steve Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s director of privacy and public policy, said none of the partnerships violated users\u2019 privacy or the F.T.C. agreement. Contracts required the companies to abide by Facebook policies, he added.Still, Facebook executives have acknowledged missteps over the past year. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201d He said that the partnerships were \u201cone area of focus\u201d and that Facebook was in the process of winding many of them down.Facebook has found no evidence of abuse by its partners, a spokeswoman said. Some of the largest partners, including Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo, said they had used the data appropriately, but declined to discuss the sharing deals in detail. Facebook did say that it had mismanaged some of its partnerships, allowing certain companies\u2019 access to continue long after they had shut down the features that required the data.Data privacy experts disputed Facebook\u2019s assertion that most partnerships were exempted from the regulatory requirements, expressing skepticism that businesses as varied as device makers, retailers and search companies would be viewed alike by the agency. \u201cThe only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth into an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist at the F.T.C.Mr. Soltani and three former employees of the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection division, which brought the case that led to the consent decree, said in interviews that its data-sharing deals had probably violated the agreement.\u201cThis is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u201d said David Vladeck, who formerly ran the F.T.C.\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u201dFacebook\u2019s stock price has fallen, and a group of shareholders has called for Mr. Zuckerberg to step aside as chairman. Shareholders also have filed a lawsuit alleging that executives failed to impose effective privacy safeguards. Angry users started a #DeleteFacebook movement.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is legitimate to enter into data-sharing partnerships where there is not prior informed consent from the user,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook. \u201cNo one should trust Facebook until they change their business model.\u201dPersonal data is the oil of the 21st century, a resource worth billions to those who can most effectively extract and refine it. American companies alone are expected to spend close to $20 billion by the end of 2018 to acquire and process consumer data, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Few companies have better data than Facebook and its rival, Google, whose popular products give them an intimate view into the daily lives of billions of people \u2014 and allow them to dominate the digital advertising market.Facebook has never sold its user data, fearful of user backlash and wary of handing would-be competitors a way to duplicate its most prized asset. Instead, internal documents show, it did the next best thing: granting other companies access to parts of the social network in ways that advanced its own interests.Facebook began forming data partnerships when it was still a relatively young company. Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to weave Facebook\u2019s services into other sites and platforms, believing it would stave off obsolescence and insulate Facebook from competition. Every corporate partner that integrated Facebook data into its online products helped drive the platform\u2019s expansion, bringing in new users, spurring them to spend more time on Facebook and driving up advertising revenue. At the same time, Facebook got critical data back from its partners.The partnerships were so important that decisions about forming them were vetted at high levels, sometimes by Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, Facebook officials said. While many of the partnerships were announced publicly, the details of the sharing arrangements typically were confidential.By 2013, Facebook had entered into more such partnerships than its midlevel employees could easily track, according to interviews with two former employees. (Like the more than 30 other former employees interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or still maintained relationships with top Facebook officials.)So they built a tool that did the technical work of turning special access on and off and also kept records on what are known internally as \u201ccapabilities\u201d \u2014 the special privileges enabling companies to obtain data, in some cases without asking permission.The Times reviewed more than 270 pages of reports generated by the system \u2014 records that reflect just a portion of Facebook\u2019s wide-ranging deals. Among the revelations was that Facebook obtained data from multiple partners for a controversial friend-suggestion tool called \u201cPeople You May Know.\u201dFacebook, in turn, used contact lists from the partners, including Amazon, Yahoo and the Chinese company Huawei \u2014 which has been flagged as a security threat by American intelligence officials \u2014 to gain deeper insight into people\u2019s relationships and suggest more connections, the records show.Some of the access deals described in the documents were limited to sharing non-identifying information with research firms or enabling game makers to accommodate huge numbers of players. These raised no privacy concerns. But agreements with about a dozen companies did. Some enabled partners to see users\u2019 contact information through their friends \u2014 even after the social network, responding to complaints, said in 2014 that it was stripping all applications of that power.As of 2017, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon and others could obtain users\u2019 email addresses through their friends.Facebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users\u2019 private messages, and to see all participants on a thread \u2014 privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems, the records show. Facebook acknowledged that it did not consider any of those three companies to be service providers. Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix said those companies were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them. A spokesman for Netflix said Wednesday that it had used the access only to enable customers to recommend TV shows and movies to their friends.\u201cBeyond these recommendations, we never accessed anyone\u2019s personal messages and would never do that,\u201d he said.Spotify, which could view messages of more than 70 million users a month, still offers the option to share music through Facebook Messenger. But Netflix and the Canadian bank no longer needed access to messages because they had deactivated features that incorporated it.These were not the only companies that had special access longer than they needed it. Yahoo, The Times and others could still get Facebook users\u2019 personal information in 2017.Yahoo could view real-time feeds of friends\u2019 posts for a feature that the company had ended in 2012. A Yahoo spokesman declined to discuss the partnership in detail but said the company did not use the information for advertising. The Times \u2014 one of nine media companies named in the documents \u2014 had access to users\u2019 friend lists for an article-sharing application it had discontinued in 2011. A spokeswoman for the news organization said it was not obtaining any data.Facebook empowered Apple to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were asking for data. Apple devices also had access to the contact numbers and calendar entries of people who had changed their account settings to disable all sharing, the records show.Apple officials said they were not aware that Facebook had granted its devices any special access. They added that any shared data remained on the devices and was not available to anyone other than the users.Facebook officials said the company had disclosed its sharing deals in its privacy policy since 2010. But the language in the policy about its service providers does not specify what data Facebook shares, and with which companies. Mr. Satterfield, Facebook\u2019s privacy director, also said its partners were subject to \u201crigorous controls.\u201dPam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit privacy research group, said that Facebook would have little power over what happens to users\u2019 information after sharing it broadly. \u201cIt travels,\u201d Ms. Dixon said. \u201cIt could be customized. It could be fed into an algorithm and decisions could be made about you based on that data.\u201dBesides Facebook, the F.T.C. has consent agreements with Google and Twitter stemming from alleged privacy violations.Facebook\u2019s agreement with regulators is a result of the company\u2019s early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, it changed the privacy settings of the 400 million people then using the service, making some of their information accessible to all of the internet. Then it shared that information, including users\u2019 locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.Facebook called this \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.The F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.Under the decree, the social network introduced a \u201ccomprehensive privacy program\u201d charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.But the privacy program faced some internal resistance from the start, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s efforts. Some engineers and executives, they said, considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews \u2014 numbering about a dozen people by 2016 \u2014 was moved around within Facebook\u2019s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.Critically, many of Facebook\u2019s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.Facebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \u201cdepended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\u201dIn 2014, Facebook ended instant personalization and walled off access to friends\u2019 information. But in a previously unreported agreement, the social network\u2019s engineers continued allowing Bing; Pandora, the music streaming service; and Rotten Tomatoes, the movie and television review site, access to much of the data they had gotten for the discontinued feature. Bing had access to the information through last year, the records show, and the two other companies did as of late summer, according to tests by The Times.Facebook officials said the data sharing did not violate users\u2019 privacy because it allowed access only to public data \u2014 though that included data that the social network had made public in 2009. They added that the social network made a mistake in allowing the access to continue for the three companies, but declined to elaborate. Spokeswomen for Pandora and Rotten Tomatoes said the businesses were not aware of any special access.Facebook also declined to discuss the other capabilities Bing was given, including the ability to see all users\u2019 friends.Microsoft officials said that Bing was using the data to build profiles of Facebook users on Microsoft servers. They declined to provide details, other than to say the information was used in \u201cfeature development\u201d and not for advertising. Microsoft has since deleted the data, the officials said.For some advocates, the torrent of user data flowing out of Facebook has called into question not only Facebook\u2019s compliance with the F.T.C. agreement, but also the agency\u2019s approach to privacy regulation.\u201cThere has been an endless barrage of how Facebook has ignored users\u2019 privacy settings, and we truly believed that in 2011 we had solved this problem,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an online privacy group that filed one of the first complaints about Facebook with federal regulators. \u201cWe brought Facebook under the regulatory authority of the F.T.C. after a tremendous amount of work. The F.T.C. has failed to act.\u201dAccording to Facebook, most of its data partnerships fall under an exemption to the F.T.C. agreement. The company argues that the partner companies are service providers \u2014 companies that use the data only \u201cfor and at the direction of\u201d Facebook and function as an extension of the social network.But Mr. Vladeck and other former F.T.C. officials said that Facebook was interpreting the exemption too broadly. They said the provision was intended to allow Facebook to perform the same everyday functions as other companies, such as sending and receiving information over the internet or processing credit card transactions, without violating the consent decree.When The Times reported last summer on the partnerships with device makers, Facebook used the term \u201cintegration partners\u201d to describe BlackBerry, Huawei and other manufacturers that pulled Facebook data to provide social-media-style features on smartphones. All such integration partners, Facebook asserted, were covered by the service provider exemption.Since then, as the social network has disclosed its data sharing deals with other kinds of businesses \u2014 including internet companies such as Yahoo \u2014 Facebook has labeled them integration partners, too.Facebook even recategorized one company, the Russian search giant Yandex, as an integration partner.Facebook records show Yandex had access in 2017 to Facebook\u2019s unique user IDs even after the social network stopped sharing them with other applications, citing privacy risks. A spokeswoman for Yandex, which was accused last year by Ukraine\u2019s security service of funneling its user data to the Kremlin, said the company was unaware of the access and did not know why Facebook had allowed it to continue. She added that the Ukrainian allegations \u201chave no merit.\u201dIn October, Facebook said Yandex was not an integration partner. But in early December, as The Times was preparing to publish this article, Facebook told congressional lawmakers that it was.An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the commission agreed with Facebook\u2019s interpretation of the service provider exception, which is likely to figure in the F.T.C.\u2019s ongoing Facebook investigation. She also declined to say whether the commission had ever received a complete list of partners that Facebook considered service providers.The first assessment, sent to the F.T.C. in 2013, found only \u201climited\u201d evidence that Facebook had monitored those partners\u2019 use of data. The finding was redacted from a public copy of the assessment, which gave Facebook\u2019s privacy program a passing grade over all.Mr. Wyden and other critics have questioned whether the assessments \u2014 in which the F.T.C. essentially outsources much of its day-to-day oversight to companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2014 are effective. As with other businesses under consent agreements with the F.T.C., Facebook pays for and largely dictated the scope of its assessments, which are limited mostly to documenting that Facebook has conducted the internal privacy reviews it claims it had.How closely Facebook monitored its data partners is uncertain. Most of Facebook\u2019s partners declined to discuss what kind of reviews or audits Facebook subjected them to. Two former Facebook partners, whose deals with the social network dated to 2010, said they could find no evidence that Facebook had ever audited them. One was BlackBerry. The other was Yandex.Facebook officials said that while the social network audited partners only rarely, it managed them closely.\u201cThese were high-touch relationships,\u201d Mr. Satterfield said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Yahoo ended a feature on its website that incorporated Facebook user data. The feature was discontinued in 2012, not 2011.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting. Research was contributed by Grace Ashford, Susan C.

{"Headline": "These Men Are Waiting to Share Some Feelings With You", "Date": "2018-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn meetings and retreats, chastened menfolk are working stuff out.On a Monday night in a sparsely decorated room in Midtown Manhattan, a group of approximately 20 men including an endocrinologist, a sportscaster, a policeman and an employee of the United Nations were baring their souls.\u201cI\u2019m angry that my health is deteriorating. I\u2019m not ready to be an old man,\u201d said Jeff Nichols, 70, a former consultant. \u201cI\u2019m checking in with some anger. I didn\u2019t get accepted to the Ashtanga Institute, and I smashed two candles, which I know isn\u2019t very yogic,\u201d said another man, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional repercussions.The goal, according to many affiliated with MKP, is to break down patriarchal and hierarchical ideas of masculinity. And the place to start is where another man, Socrates, did centuries ago: with the mandate of \u201cknow thyself.\u201d MKP translates this as a process of cultivating awareness around one\u2019s emotions, so they aren\u2019t projected onto others in harmful and destructive ways. This is accomplished through a series of facilitated exercises, some of which involve props, aimed at bringing feelings to the surface and to hold a mirror to oneself.MKP helped him navigate becoming a father of two. \u201cThere is no way I could have done that without a brotherhood telling me all the bull I was projecting onto my wife but also hold me with compassion,\u201d he said.\u201cThe weekend is a little strange at first,\u201d recalled Zvika Krieger, 35, who attended one 11 years ago and now helps to facilitate the MKP retreats in the Bay Area, where he runs a technology policy organization. \u201cYou are pushed emotionally, but there is certainly nothing that happens you are ashamed of after.\u201dAfter completing the New Warrior Training Adventure, many men join Integration Groups, or I-Groups, where they continue, on a weekly basis with the guidance of a trained peer facilitator, the \u201cwork,\u201d as it is called in MKP, that was started during those 48 hours. I-Groups are attended not just by woke, liberal elites on the coasts. Kansas City, Mo.; the greater Carolinas; Atlanta; Indianapolis; Milwaukee; Memphis; and Louisville, Ky., all have sizable groups, according to the organization. Evryman has a half a dozen groups in Montana and over 20 in the Northern Rockies. In March, one of its retreats will take place in Logan, Ohio, the first in the Midwest.The Evryman weekend is called the Open Source Retreat ($475 to $975, depending on accommodations) and brings together 50 men and eight leaders who have completed something called Men\u2019s Emotional Leadership Training (MELT) \u201cto set aside cultural norms and be transparent, honest, and vulnerable with each other,\u201d to quote from the company\u2019s literature. The goal is to \u201cleave feeling like we shed 30 pounds of emotional baggage.\u201d Ebenezer Bond, 42, the founder of a marketing agency, said that until getting involved with Evryman he hadn\u2019t had a cathartic drag-it-out cry since he was 16. The retreat he attended in late 2016 opened the floodgates. \u201cI was skeptical at first \u2014 I even deleted an initial email with the invitation to the weekend,\u201d Mr. Bond said. \u201cBut it was the single most transformational experience I\u2019ve had as an adult male. I was able to express emotions in front of other men, something I\u2019d never done before.\u201dSimon Isaacs, who was invited by Mr. Bond to a later retreat, said he \u201cpanicked\u201d when he learned, five minutes before he arrived at Race Brook Lodge in Sheffield, Mass., that there would be no consumption of alcohol and minimal cellphone use. \u201cI thought, \u2018What am I supposed to do: express myself?\u2019\u201d he said. Now Mr. Isaacs, 38, a founder of the millennial parenting site Fatherly, attends a weekly Evryman group and calls it part of his \u201cemotional retraining.\u201d Perhaps the biggest endorsement is Mr. Isaacs\u2019s wife, who has told him to \u201ckeep going.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a work in progress,\u201d he said.Chimezie Uzodinma, 32, an information-technology professional in New York who has been involved with MKP for a decade, credited his weekly group for pulling him out of hopelessness and despair. \u201cThere was a moment when I thought I was going to die alone and I was very depressed,\u201d he said.But MKP and Evryman are very clear that they are not offering group therapy. \u201cWe don\u2019t pretend to be counselors or therapists, but sometimes people come at the suggestion of their individual psychotherapist,\u201d said Scott Fried, a motivational speaker who works with at-risk teenagers and often facilitates his I-Group on Monday nights in New York.At Evryman, Mr. Krump said he and other organizers \u201cintentionally didn\u2019t include spirituality\u201d in their approach. \u201cThe groups, which don\u2019t have specific leadership, start with a rather agnostic meditation. Then participants share how they are feeling and try to identify where those sensations are appearing in the body. Next is a more in-depth round in which the men are asked whether they have met \u201ctheir stretch\u201d: a commitment or goal for the next week based on what the person had worked on in the group. These can vary from making time to do restorative yoga every day, to connecting on a deeper level with family over the holidays \u2014 something Peter Nesbit, 34, a finance executive at a software company, said he was able to do over Thanksgiving weekend with his parents in South Dakota.Then each man is given around 10 minutes to talk more at length about what\u2019s going on with himself. Group members ask probing follow-up questions: \u201cHow do you feel? What do you need to let go of? What do you want? What do you need from the group?\u201d The prodding often elicits frustration, anger and sadness. Screaming into a pillow is not uncommon. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid to be with myself. I don\u2019t want to feel fragile and afraid,\u201d said Kevin Hermann, 27, an entrepreneur, at one Monday evening Evryman group at a Williamsburg loft.There is something undeniably powerful about a group of people, let alone men, sitting and listening intently \u2014 cross-talk, interrupting and giving advice are highly discouraged \u2014 without distraction or interruption. And eye contact is a must. This may sound like basic conversational etiquette, but \u201cholding space,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the personal development world, is, at a minimum, cathartic in era of constant distraction and always looking for the next best thing. In some cases, it can feel quite profound.Sex, sexuality and relationships are big topics. \u201cWe have millennials come to groups or training whose introduction to sex has been through porn, and no one talked to them about the link between sex, intimacy and love,\u201d Mr. Krieger said. Now in his 30s, Mr. Krieger, who also goes to therapy, says he feels lucky to have started the MKP when he was 24, before he was married or became a father. \u201cI can now see when I\u2019m shutting down, or I\u2019m really getting defensive,\u201d he said.And in the #MeToo era, issues of reconciling past sexual behavior come up, said Ben Fleisher, 40, who runs a men\u2019s group in Woodstock, N.Y. \u201cWe had one situation where someone talked about how they reached out to a woman because he felt like he may have crossed the line, but the woman didn\u2019t think it was sexual assault,\u201d said Mr. Fleisher, 40, an alumnus of Sterling\u2019s Men\u2019s Weekend who works as an acupuncturist. \u201cThis topic in general is an area where we need to dig deeper. Many men are struggling to come to terms with #MeToo and how they feel complicit in abuses, even if they aren\u2019t the perpetrators, by not taking a more active stand for a woman\u2019s sovereignty.\u201dLest this all comes off as self-indulgent, devotees of men\u2019s groups say blunt-force honesty is something that keeps them coming back. \u201cI\u2019m very verbose and have a lot of opinions,\u201d said Mr. Krieger, who has been training for almost seven years to be in a volunteer leadership position in the MKP. \u201cI started getting feedback that it was totally killing the energy in the circle and wasn\u2019t leaving room for other people. Since I\u2019m the boss at work, no one is going to tell me that to my face.\u201d Some are unflinching in requesting feedback. Instead of having a blowout party on his 50th birthday, Mr. Fried told his I-Group that he wanted each person to tell him something he needed to work on. Mr. Fried, now 55, said the experience made him realize that \u201cI come with a lot of victimhood because I got infected with H.I.V. But the group has called me on that and helped me recognize that I\u2019m a powerful man.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Hallmark Christmas Fan Watches Netflix\u2019s Holiday Movies", "Date": "2018-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are two reasons I still pay for cable: 1. NY1 (local news, Jamie Stelter and Pat Kiernan). 2. Hallmark Christmas movies.I am not someone these movies should appeal to. I will usually take horror movies over rom-coms. I don\u2019t dream about planning the perfect wedding. And I\u2019ve never said, \u201cIt\u2019s the season of miracles,\u201d without a strong dose of sarcasm.Still, when I go home to Oregon at Thanksgiving every year, cuddling up on the couch with my mom and my brother, watching these movies is the best kind of comfort. They bring us together to get teary over happy endings (me, often; my brother on rare occasions), as well as incredulous (me) over how characters who are supposed to be journalists are portrayed.Though I usually stick with Hallmark movies, this year I strayed from my main squeeze and headed to Netflix to see how its holiday fare compared.Fair warning: No one watches these movies for the acting or the plots, which are usually pretty bad. You are watching them for Christmas spirit.To judge by several Netflix offerings, the streaming service is aiming solidly at a younger, more diverse audience than Hallmark. The Netflix stars are more youthful and the films are solidly secular, while Hallmark movies sometimes have a strong religious message. Like their Hallmark counterparts, the Netflix movies are lovely to look at, with lots of snowscapes and great interiors. They follow themes that will be too familiar from Hallmark Christmas films. It would be impossible not to; there are a zillion Hallmark films. Here\u2019s a look at the new Netflix movies, and the Hallmark films they remind me of.This sweet film turns a favorite holiday-film theme (big-city gal returns to her hometown) around a bit. Abby (Kat Graham) is a photographer at a studio in her hometown. Her best friend, Josh (Quincy Brown), returns from traveling the world and blogging about it. Abby\u2019s Gramps gives her a magical Advent calendar. Can you guess the rest? The movie was sweet, but not too. And just sentimental enough. Best of all, Abby didn\u2019t really give up anything and still ended up happy. It was a win-win. The cast is mostly made up of actors of color, which is a nice change from Hallmark films, which are usually very, very white.Most reminiscent of Hallmark\u2019s films, \u201cChristmas Inheritance\u201d plays on a familiar theme. Spoiled city gal Ellen (Eliza Taylor), known as the Party Heiress, tries to prove herself. This time by heading to a little town to deliver a box of Christmas letters to her father\u2019s business partner. But when she gets there, the business partner has disappeared. As she waits for him to return, she\u2019s schooled in small-town life and gets close to a small-town hottie, Jake (Jake Lacy). You know where this film is going from the minute Jake steps out of his car. But Taylor and Lacy are both pretty charming and you root for them. Andie MacDowell, as Jake\u2019s aunt, adds a little star power to this gem.Stacy and Lady Margaret swap places and, with shades of Harry and Meghan, high jinks and romance ensue. There\u2019s a prince (Sam Palladio), who looks and moves a bit like Benedict Cumberbatch, and a wedding. This one was hard to love because Hudgens was never not acting. The accent she affects sounds about as real as mine would.This is a sequel to last year\u2019s enjoyable hit movie. (I\u2019m already expecting a third, perhaps with royal offspring.) Total fantasy, but easy to relax into. When Prince Richard (Ben Lamb) went to New York to ask the New York commoner and \u201cjournalist\u201d Amber (Rose McIver) to marry him in the first movie, I let out a high-pitched squeal, a noise I\u2019d never heard myself make. The sequel starts a little slow, but gains traction and likability as it unfolds.This film doesn\u2019t stand alone, however. At the beginning, the former prince, now king, is under stress and really kind of a grump; you probably won\u2019t like him unless you\u2019ve seen the first movie. Now his country is in financial crisis, he\u2019s too busy for his bride and he\u2019s frustrated that she\u2019s not toeing the line. Amber is a more adept journalist than she seemed to be in movie No. 1 (which is not saying much) and of course she proves herself a very fine partner to his royal highness.The couple are joined in their adventures by the king\u2019s adorable sister, Princess Emily (Honor Kneafsey); Count Simon (Theo Devaney), who tried to steal the crown in the first movie; and Emily\u2019s dad (John Guerrasio, who aims for endearing but solidly hits annoying). There\u2019s lots of tension, stress, some financial high jinks, and yes, a lovely wedding.This is by far the worst Christmas movie, maybe the worst movie, I have ever seen. It\u2019s 86 minutes of dreck. One of the charming things about holiday fare is that usually there\u2019s not much actual P.D.A. Chaste kisses are about all you get and they usually come at the very end. But this awful movie takes that a little too far, expecting us to buy that the leads will marry after having kissed twice. I don\u2019t think they even held hands.Despite all this \u201cresearch,\u201d I will still be watching more than a few Hallmark films. It\u2019s a family thing. My brother even has a T-shirt that says \u201cI\u2019d rather be watching a Hallmark Christmas movie,\u201d and he truly would. But I\u2019ll add some Netflix movies to my rotation, especially if there\u2019s a third installment of \u201cA Christmas Prince.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By the late 1920s, women were largely shut out of directing in the American industry until the mid-1960s. If film pioneers like Lois Weber and Alice Guy Blach\u00e9 had continued, it\u2019s possible that a radically different movie world might have emerged. In my alt-Hollywood fantasy, female and male filmmakers would have worked side by side, perhaps giving us unimagined stories and heroines. That history in turn might have laid the foundation for an equitable present rather than an industry defined by entrenched sexism.In this quietly political Trump-era documentary, Wiseman offers a long, searching look at a small American town where homespun charm exists side by side with steadfast isolationism.With their gently nodding, brilliantly colored flowers and shifting shadows, Dorsky\u2019s heart-soaringly beautiful films are reminders that cinema is also about light and form.A.O.

At a time when we tend to see ourselves and our fellow citizens as sociological stereotypes and ideological clich\u00e9s, these highly personal films suggest that a different way of telling the American story \u2014 the crazy multiplicity of American stories \u2014 may still be possible. Not because the filmmakers offer visions of consensus, but precisely because each one digs deep into the conflicts and contradictions that run through every neighborhood, household and individual heart. \u201cMonrovia,\u201d filmed in a tiny, mostly white heartland town, is the latest work from an 88-year-old master. \u201cHale County,\u201d set in a rural mostly black part of Alabama, and \u201cMinding the Gap,\u201d set in a mixed Illinois industrial city, are first features by skilled and intuitive young directors. \u201cBisbee \u201917,\u201d named for a mining town in Arizona, is a powerful midcareer foray into historical memory and political strife.Casting Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant as witty, cynical partners in crime in early \u201990s Manhattan is pretty much foolproof. They would be fun to watch if all they did was insult each other over drinks. They do a lot of that, and this movie \u2014 based on the real-life escapades of literary forger Lee Israel and her accomplice, Jack Hock \u2014 is admirably modest and specific in scale. It doesn\u2019t preach or pose, but in the fine grain of its characters and the skill of its performers (including Dolly Wells as a sweet and credulous bookseller), it achieves a kind of perfection.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s take a closer look.As a result, the work of health care companies in the United States is being reshuffled and remixed, but the results are as yet uncertain. We don\u2019t know if Amazon will indeed disrupt the industry, or if the likes of CVS-Aetna can revamp it from within.

Bray had come across a book of Szukalski\u2019s sculptures and paintings and, by happy coincidence, discovered that the artist actually lived nearby. As they became acquainted, it became clear that Szukalski\u2019s situation at the time \u2014 living anonymously in California \u2014 obscured the fame he had achieved in his youth, as well as his view of himself as something of a genius.The interviews are largely with those who would still count Szukalski as a friend, but Dobrowolski\u2019s opinions on his subject aren\u2019t obvious, even if he is helping to rescue the artist from oblivion. (Szukalski\u2019s works were mostly destroyed in World War II.) Still, for Bray, George DiCaprio and others who knew Szukalski in his final years, their struggle with his past is deeply personal. They effectively become subjects themselves, grappling with how he ought to be remembered. The viewer is left to decide.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "SAG Award Nominations: Emily Blunt Leads; Regina King Is Snubbed", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CarpetbaggerIf Wednesday\u2019s Screen Actors Guild nominations serve as a traditional Oscar bellwether, there\u2019s good news for an academy worried about falling ratings for the Oscars: Each movie nominated for the top SAG Award was a big box-office hit, and many major stars will be in the mix.But where there\u2019s good news, there\u2019s also bad news for a handful of performers and movies \u2014 including some presumed award-season front-runners \u2014 hoping to make a strong showing at the SAG Awards to indicate positive Oscar momentum. Unlike many of the other awards organizations to weigh in this season, SAG is full of actors, who also make up the largest voting body of the Academy. Where they go, Oscar often will, too.Let\u2019s take a look at the five film categories and analyze their surprises and snubs.Why not begin with the most prediction-defying category? Many pundits favor Regina King to take the Oscar for her warm performance as the mother in \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk,\u201d but the fact that she didn\u2019t even receive a SAG nomination probably scuttles that notion and could suggest that Amy Adams will finally take home her first Oscar. Instead of King or the \u201cFirst Man\u201d actress Claire Foy in this category, SAG voters gave us the category-frauded Emily Blunt for \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d and Margot Robbie in \u201cMary Queen of Scots,\u201d two movies that had not bagged significant acting nominations until now.Could this very well be our final five for Oscar? I\u2019m tempted to think so. The only slight surprise here is double SAG nominee Blunt, but she\u2019s very strong in \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d and will only get stronger as the movie is released. Had the \u201cRoma\u201d star Yalitza Aparicio shown up here, that would have been a boon to the overall Oscar chances for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s acclaimed black-and-white film, but SAG voters didn\u2019t give a single one of their movie nominations to Netflix.Last year, three of the films nominated by SAG in this category went on to earn an Oscar nomination for best picture, and I\u2019d expect the same this year for \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d and \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201d The cast nod for \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d here is surprising, given that it\u2019s essentially the Rami Malek show, but I spoke to many members of the SAG nominating committee who loved the film. \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d has the sort of success-vetted ensemble that SAG likes to recognize, but without a supporting-actress nomination for Michelle Yeoh, I don\u2019t expect it to make an Oscar dent.I\u2019m surprised \u201cThe Favourite\u201d didn\u2019t make it into this category, since its three actresses were all nominated and SAG clearly liked the movie. \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d did earn that nod, despite an even more intimate focus, so we can assume it\u2019s sitting pretty for Oscar. Still, there\u2019s a sliver of hope out there for \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d as well as movies like \u201cVice\u201d and \u201cGreen Book\u201d: While it\u2019s incredibly rare for a film to win best picture without a SAG nomination for its ensemble, the second time that ever happened was just last year, with \u201cThe Shape of Water.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the third SAG-nominated film likely to get an Oscar best picture nomination. Along with \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d may get an Oscar nomination, not \u201cCrazy Rich Asians.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "20 Things That Happened for the First Time in 2018", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning Points1. First NASA spacecraft named after living person launchesThe Parker Solar Probe, the first NASA spacecraft named after a living person, was launched in August. The craft is named after astrophysicist Eugene N. Parker, who was the first to describe solar wind in 1958. The probe, which has set a new record as the fastest spacecraft, is the closest any manmade object has been to the sun.2. Painting sets record for living African-American artist3. Apple becomes first company to reach value of $1 trillionApple became the first publicly traded company to reach a market value of more than $1 trillion in August, with Amazon in close pursuit, reaching the benchmark just a month later. The rise of these so-called superstar firms have helped spur a long period of economic growth in the United States, but may have also contributed to a shrinking middle class and rising income inequality, experts say.4. A New kind of human adaptationResearchers have reported a new kind of human adaptation \u2014 to the ocean. According to the journal Cell, a group of people known as the Bajau, who traditionally live in houseboats or houses on stilts in villages in Southeast Asia, have evolved to be better divers. The researchers\u2019 findings reveal that the Bajau \u2014 regardless of whether they\u2019re divers or have other jobs \u2014 have spleens that are about 50 percent bigger than those who live 15 miles inland. Studies have shown that larger spleens can aid in deep diving among marine animals.5. A unified Korea, at least on the iceMembers of the women\u2019s ice-hockey team from North Korea and South Korea played as a joint team at the XXIII Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, marking the first time the countries had a unified Olympic team. The team lost in its first game, to Switzerland. South Korea, however, went on to win a total of 17 medals in the games, including five gold medals.6. First-ever \u201csausage dog\u201d museum opensTwo former florists opened what they say is the first museum dedicated to \u201csausage dogs.\u201d The Dackelmuseum, which is in Bavaria, Germany, features canine stamps, dog-shaped breads, porcelain figurines, prints and other items dedicated to the dachshund, one of Germany\u2019s oldest canine breeds.7. First pedestrian fatality by a self-driving carA self-driving Uber test car killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March, in what is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality caused by an autonomous vehicle. Although the car had a backup driver, neither he nor the car\u2019s light detection and radar system sensed the pedestrian, a woman who was attempting to cross the street with her bicycle, in time to stop.8. Saudi Arabia hosts first fashion weekSaudi Arabia hosted its first-ever fashion week in Riyadh, in April. The event still bore hallmarks of the conservative kingdom. Despite the all-female audiences, a social media ban was in place so photos of women without their abayas, or floor-length overgarments, wouldn\u2019t leak. Organizers, however, hailed the event as a pivotal moment for women in a country where they still are expected to defer to their male guardians.9. Chinese company surpasses Apple\u2019s smartphone salesFor the first time, the Chinese company Huawei has outstripped Apple smartphone sales, selling more than 54 million phones in the second quarter of 2018, compared to Apple\u2019s 41 million, and trailing only Samsung. The company\u2019s success is all the more impressive considering that Huawei has failed to make inroads in some of the world\u2019s largest markets, including the United States, in part because of corporate and government espionage fears.10. Paris museum opens its doors to nudistsFor the first time in Paris, a museum has welcomed nude figures of a different kind: living ones. The Palais de Tokyo contemporary art museum opened its doors to nudists for a one-off tour scheduled by the Paris Naturists Association. Paris also has the world\u2019s first naturist restaurant, O\u2019Naturel, which opened in late 2017, as well as an area at a public park that is dedicated to people who prefer wearing their birthday suits.11. Machine tackles sea of plastic garbageThe world\u2019s first machine designed to clean up plastic detritus from the ocean \u2014 the brainchild of a college dropout who came up with the idea as a teenager\u2014 was deployed in September toward what\u2019s widely known as the \u201cgreat Pacific garbage patch.\u201d This expanse of ocean, located between Hawaii and California, has the world\u2019s largest accumulation of ocean plastic. Some experts, however, are worried that the machine will do more harm than good, arguing that it would be better to focus on efforts preventing plastic from entering the seas in the first place.12. French lawmakers ban smart devices in schoolsA law banning smart devices at schools in France went into effect in September. Students between the ages of 3-15 will have to leave their smartphones, tablets and any other digital devices at home or turned off on school premises, with exceptions for disabled students or during extracurricular activities. Some lawmakers scoffed at the new law as overkill, citing an existing rule that already prohibits smartphone use during instruction time in classrooms.13. Female fighter pilot breaks gender barrier in JapanJapan, which has a male-dominated workforce, named its first female fighter pilot in August. First Lt. Misa Matsushima, 26, who cited the American movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d as an inspiration, joined the Japan Air Self Defense Force in 2014. The JASDF began accepting female applicants in 1993, but women couldn\u2019t apply to be fighter pilots until 2015, when a ban was lifted as part of a nationwide initiative to increase the numbers of women in the workplace.14. Africa launches its first waste-to-energy plantEthiopia is the first country in Africa to open a waste-to-energy plant. Top government officials, including Ethiopian President Mulatu Teshome, were on hand at the inauguration of the $120 million plant, called Reppie, which was built in a landfill on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. It is supposed to take about 80 percent of the daily waste generated by the capital and fulfill about 30 percent of its energy needs.15. Ikea opens first store in IndiaIkea opened its first Indian store in Hyderabad, tweaking its usual strategy by cutting prices and changing its inventory \u2014 and even its cafe offerings \u2014 to appeal to the Indian consumer. The world\u2019s largest furniture retailer plans to open three other stores in the next two years to cater to the country\u2019s rapidly growing middle class.16. Russia flexes its musclesIn its largest show of military strength since the days of the Cold War, Russia assembled nearly 300,000 troops, 1,000 aircraft and 900 tanks for the exercises known as Vostok-2018. And for the first time, China participated in the exercises, sending helicopters and about 3,200 of its troops.17. Mexico\u2019s first reality series\u201cMade in Mexico,\u201d which follows the lavish lives of nine socialites in Mexico City, started streaming in September. The Netflix-backed series, Mexico\u2019s first reality program, has faced some heat, however, with critics pointing out that it\u2019s in poor taste in a country where nearly half the population lives in poverty.18. Canada legalizes recreational marijuanaCanada became the first major world economy to legalize recreational marijuana. It\u2019s the second country in the world \u2014 after Uruguay \u2014 to pass such legislation. Since mid-October, people over 18 could legally purchase and use dried cannabis flowers and oils. Legalization is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue once fully implemented.19. More pigs than people in DenmarkPigs now outnumber people in Denmark: 215 pigs per 100 people, according to new statistics released by Eurostat. The agency estimates that about 150 million pigs live in the European Union, with 40 percent of them in Germany and Spain. And according to new figures released by the Spanish government, the number of slaughtered pigs, at 50 million, outnumber the country\u2019s population of 46.5 million.20. India\u2019s high court strikes down ban on gay sexFor the first time in more than 150 years, a law banning consensual gay sex in India has been deemed unconstitutional by the highest court in the land. Introduced to Indian law under British colonial rule, the rule was rarely enforced, but critics said it made the blackmail, sexual assault and harassment of L.G.B.T. people permissible.Looking Ahead:Disneyland to serve alcohol publicly for the first timeBottoms up, Mouseketeers.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tawdry Tabloid Sagas Reveal Weightier Themes", "Date": "2018-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorAudiences gravitated to the scores of articles and cable news segments about Donald J. Trump, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal for an undeniable reason: Sex sells.But there was something more important lurking beneath the salacious surface of the stories about the president\u2019s alleged past encounters with a porn star and a former Playboy model.People who followed the sagas quickly learned that they were in for more than lurid details. Like one of those prestige television series on Netflix, FX, HBO or Showtime, the tale started off sleazy but ventured into weightier thematic territory as it unfolded.Enriching the narrative was Michael D. Cohen, who worked for Mr. Trump as factotum and fixer. He was part villain, part flunky.Now in the role of converted truth-teller for an audience of federal prosecutors, Mr. Cohen admits he was given a very big job: shut those two women up on the eve of the 2016 presidential election.He pulled it off \u2014 for a time, at least \u2014 with hush-money payments involving a hastily created Delaware shell company and the Trump-friendly tabloid news company that owns The National Enquirer, American Media Inc.The stories were tawdry, and the news coverage sometimes veered toward clickbait, but there were important questions hiding beneath the sheets.Has the presidential election process become so cynical that players in a campaign can surreptitiously blow through legal limits on spending to deceive the public?Are they free to coordinate with a media organization that behaved in a manner antithetical to the role the founders envisioned for a free press by paying to hide information about a presidential candidate, rather than share it with the public?On Friday, federal prosecutors in New York answered those questions with a resounding No.In making their stand against Mr. Cohen, they were arguing for the legitimacy of United States campaign finance law \u2014 which, for all its loopholes, may have some teeth, after all \u2014 and for the value of truth and transparency in campaigns.Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to two sets of criminal campaign violations. By secretly paying Ms. Daniels $130,000 for her silence in October 2016, he was flouting the law that limits individual campaign contributions to $2,700 in a general election.And by arranging for The Enquirer\u2019s parent company to squelch Ms. McDougal\u2019s affair accusation by buying the exclusive rights to her story for $150,000 and then sitting on it \u2014 a practice known in the tabloid trade as \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen was inducing A.M.I. to violate a law that prohibits corporations from spending any money in campaigns in coordination with candidates or their agents.\u201cCohen\u2019s commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for president of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,\u201d the prosecutors wrote in the sentencing memo. \u201cWhile many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows.\u201dPeople following the yarn may not have expected that a story centered on a porn star and a onetime Playboy model would end up with prosecutorial paeans to American ideals. But here we are.The prosecutors suggested Mr. Cohen was taking the rap for a crime that included others in higher places. They asserted that Mr. Trump \u2014 called \u201cIndividual-1\u201d in legal filings \u2014 had directed him to engage in the cover-ups, implicating the president in felony campaign finance violations.The prosecutors\u2019 memo also indicated that others in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle may have been involved in the payments. So the plot could thicken if the prosecutors \u2014 led by the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Robert S. Khuzami \u2014 pursue more charges.And then there\u2019s American Media Inc.Still, the investigators have made a powerful statement about what was a twisted use of journalism in an election.Generations of journalists have felt called to the profession, seeing a high mission in finding out all there is to know about the men and women who ask to be voted into the nation\u2019s highest office.For those who wonder why any of this might apply to The Enquirer, I would direct them to the supermarket tabloid\u2019s recent history of presidential muckraking.That dirt-digging was fully in keeping with the tabloid media tradition of going all-out to give the powerless a glimpse of what the powerful are hiding. And it led to a landmark campaign finance case against Mr. Edwards that, while ultimately unsuccessful, set the template for the one that has implicated Individual-1.By 2016, things had changed. During the campaign cycle, The Enquirer functioned more like a protection racket. According to prosecutors, the tabloid became part of the very sort of scheme it had once reveled in exposing, and it crossed the line into illegality when it spent money, allegedly in coordination with Mr. Trump, to protect his reputation.The Enquirer\u2019s behavior was part of a broader trend, in which various branches of the news media were used to distort the public debate \u2014 a corruption of mission that turned parts of the political arena into information junkyards.Beneath their words was a world-weary knowingness. Wasn\u2019t this how the game was played?On Friday, the law answered back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Bird Box\u2019 Review: The End of the World Is Riveting. Sometimes.", "Date": "2018-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe enigmatic title may be \u201cBird Box,\u201d but in the first flashback of this occasionally riveting sci-fi thriller, the banter between the sisters Malorie (Sandra Bullock) and Jessica (Sarah Paulson) keeps returning to horses. Jessica, a breeder, chats enthusiastically about her stud as she drops by to visit Malorie, a pregnant recluse who spends her days painting in her studio. During Malorie\u2019s checkup at the hospital, Jessica even imagines how great it would be if she herself existed in equine form.Bullock, accustomed to playing no-nonsense characters on life-threatening missions, effectively conveys the sense of urgency.The second timeline unfolds five years earlier, with the sudden arrival of a mysterious entity taking the form of the worst fears of any person who locks eyes with it, leading the victim to commit suicide. Leaving the hospital, Malorie finds mass hysteria \u2014 car crashes, fires and explosions in the streets \u2014 and seeks refuge with other strangers in a house on the corner.The house is a hodgepodge of types: John Malkovich is Douglas, the crotchety neighbor whose only priority is himself; Lil Rel Howery (\u201cGet Out\u201d) is Charlie, a supermarket employee who just so happens to be writing a novel about the end of humanity; and Tom, Trevante Rhodes (\u201cMoonlight\u201d) is the strapping, sensitive war vet who connects with Malorie. Danielle Macdonald plays Olympia, a woman who, like Malorie, is pregnant, but extremely happy about it. Jacki Weaver and BD Wong are here, too, though they have even less to do, with barely any back story or distinguishing traits.As the survivors hole up in the house, the usual end-of-the-world conflicts arise: Do they let in others suddenly banging on the door for help? Can anyone be trusted?Some saving graces: the disturbing set piece in which the creature first descends upon the city and, later, a genuinely unnerving scene in which Malorie leaves Boy and Girl behind in the canoe so she can replenish supplies.Yet too often \u201cBird Box\u201d walks right up to the edge of pure suspense and disappoints \u2014 the need for characters to be blindfolded or otherwise limited in sight presents the perfect opportunity to put audiences in their shoes and really dig into the threat of the unknown, \u00e0 la \u201cThe Blair Witch Project.\u201d Instead, those moments are chopped up anxiously, the camera frequently cutting wide to reveal what the characters are up against.By the final act, there are birds instead of horses, and Malorie\u2019s purpose as an individual is explicitly realized in the most obvious of ways. The squelching of promise is not my worst (cinematic) fear, per se. But it\u2019s still disappointing.An earlier version of this review misstated a character\u2019s role in the movie. The character Douglas is a neighbor, not the owner of the home in which some of the characters hide.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Used People\u2019s Data to Favor Certain Partners and Punish Rivals, Documents Show", "Date": "2018-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Facebook used the mountains of data it collected on users to favor certain partners and punish rivals, giving companies such as Airbnb and Netflix special access to its platform while cutting off others that it perceived as threats.The documents show how Facebook executives treated data as the company\u2019s most valuable resource and often wielded it to gain a strategic advantage. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, were intimately involved in decisions aimed at benefiting the social network above all else and keeping users as engaged as possible on the site, according to emails that were part of the document trove.In one exchange from 2012 when Mr. Zuckerberg discussed charging developers for access to user data and persuading them to share their data with the social network, he wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook and that content increases the value of our network. So ultimately, I think the purpose of platform \u2014 even the read side \u2014 is to increase sharing back into Facebook.\u201dIn a statement, Facebook said the documents had been selectively chosen to be embarrassing and misleading as part of a \u201cbaseless\u201d lawsuit. \u201cLike any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform,\u201d the company said. \u201cBut the facts are clear: We\u2019ve never sold people\u2019s data.\u201d\u201cI understand there is a lot of scrutiny on how we run our systems,\u201d he wrote, adding that context was needed. \u201cThis was an important change to protect our community, and it achieved its goal.\u201d\u201cAmericans\u2019 data belongs to them, not Facebook,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Democrat of Massachusetts. \u201cAny evidence of a pay-for-data model would fly in the face of the statements Facebook has made to Congress and the public.\u201dMuch of what was disclosed in the documents was not new, but the emails provide insight into the calculations of top executives as they worked to cement Facebook\u2019s position as the world\u2019s dominant social network. The documents\u2019 publication coincides with a more hawkish shift in public opinion toward online collection of user data, prompted partly by revelations this year of how the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica misused Facebook users\u2019 information.The 250 pages of documents cover a period when Facebook was shifting its business from a focus on desktop computers to mobile devices. After years of being largely open in sharing data with partners, Facebook was beginning to debate how to be compensated for the data it was sharing.For companies it liked, including Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix, Facebook made special \u201cwhite list\u201d agreements. The deals gave the partners preferred access to data that other companies had been restricted from receiving after a Facebook policy change.But for other companies that Facebook perceived as a threat, the company was less accommodating. In 2013, after Twitter released the video app Vine, Facebook shut off the access to its Facebook friends data.\u201cUnless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today,\u201d Justin Osofsky, a Facebook executive, said in an email at the time.Mr. Zuckerberg responded: \u201cYup, go for it.\u201dEmails also show that Facebook was hungry for more data and that user privacy, at least at the time, was an impediment to its goals of growth and engagement. In one email exchange, employees discussed avoiding a potential public backlash about an update to its Android app that would log calls made by people on their phones.\u201cThis is a pretty high risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,\u201d Michael LeBeau, an employee, said in a 2015 email.The documents also demonstrate the web of companies and services that plugged into Facebook\u2019s platform to receive information on users. The Royal Bank of Canada requested access in one note, as did the dating apps Badoo and Hot or Not.At the time, Facebook was also transitioning to what it called Platform 3.0, which would give it more control over the data of its users. Facebook emphasized the privacy benefits of the change, but the documents also show it trying to create more of a walled garden that it could leverage for its business.\u201cWithout limiting distribution or access to friends who use this app, I don\u2019t think we have any way to get developers to pay us at all besides offering payments and ad networks,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in a 2012 email.The emails also lay out how Facebook debated whether to restrict app developers\u2019 access to some data unless those developers bought advertising on the social network, a policy the company now says it never enacted.In other documents, employees outline potential ways to keep other services from using data collected from the social network in order to build their own services.\u201cWhy let someone like Pinterest or Path read all our data, create a separate stand-alone app, and then never use our paid distribution to compensate us,\u201d Mike Vernal, a former Facebook executive, said during one exchange.Facebook also relied on data from Onavo, a company it acquired in 2013, according to the documents. Onavo offered a series of apps that let people monitor their data use and protect themselves from malware and threats. The app also sent valuable data on what types of apps people were downloading back to Facebook.Adam Satariano reported from London, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ellen DeGeneres Is Not as Nice as You Think", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "On ComedyFeeling boxed in by her reputation for kindness, the comic is weighing whether to leave daytime TV, as her wife wants, or to stay, as her brother urges.Supported byEllen DeGeneres got sick of dancing, and really, can you blame her?She has to be the only 60-year-old woman in America who is expected to dance with total strangers wherever she goes. \u201cThere\u2019s been times someone wants a picture, and while I\u2019m doing a selfie, they\u2019re like: \u2018You\u2019re not dancing!,\u2019\u201d DeGeneres said in her office on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, Calif. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not dancing. I\u2019m walking down the street.\u201dAs she prepares to release her first comedy special in 15 years, DeGeneres is considering a much bigger change, retiring from the long-running hit show that bears her name. She\u2019s been receiving conflicting advice from her wife, the actress Portia de Rossi, and from her older brother, Vance DeGeneres, a comedian, and has changed her mind more than once.At a transitional moment in her remarkable career, DeGeneres agreed to sit for a rare series of interviews over two days. As much as anyone possibly could, she has taken on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s mantle as the queen of inspirational daytime talk, providing an oasis of positivity and escapist comedy in a culture short on both. But with DeGeneres\u2019s status as a sunny stalwart come certain burdens and constrictions, like the expectation to dance, which she finally stopped doing on her show two years ago, after some agonizing over how her audience would react.In person, she is more blunt, introspective and interesting than she is on the show, willing to express mild irritation that might seem off-key in front of a national audience. She\u2019s also much more likely to explore dark corners of her psyche, regrets, second thoughts, anxieties that linger. And DeGeneres is appealingly open about the tensions in her career between providing a cultural safe space and delivering laughs, and says she has learned to care less about being liked.Spoofing her own approachable, down-to-earth image, her surprising new special, \u201cRelatable\u201d (available Dec. 18 on Netflix), doesn\u2019t just reveal a refreshingly irreverent version of Ellen DeGeneres. It also provides a window into her state of mind.For a famously nice talk show host, this is risky stuff. Yet the most jarring jokes in this special are those that subvert her reputation for kindness. After a lifetime of clean comedy, she startles her crowd with a curse. The comic Tig Notaro calls it \u201ca decades-long payoff,\u201d adding, \u201cThen you\u2019re like: Ellen\u2019s a real person with a foul mouth.\u201dNotaro, a friend who co-directed this special with Joel Gallen, said that while these are jokes, they are rooted in honesty. \u201cBeing trapped in the world of being asked to dance and expected to be nice, it\u2019s real,\u201d Notaro said by phone, after noting that, of course, DeGeneres is exceedingly grateful. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s people who think she\u2019s kidding. Or can\u2019t have a bad day. But she does. It\u2019s an interesting pickle she\u2019s in.\u201dAsked why his sister returned to stand-up, Vance DeGeneres, a former correspondent for \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d who helped create the \u201cMr. Bill\u201d shorts for \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d said: \u201cAfter doing the show for 16 years, it\u2019s second nature. She wanted to break out of, not a rut, but a mold.\u201dDeGeneres put it another way, emphasizing the kind of expression stand-up allows. \u201cI wanted to show all of me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe talk show is me, but I\u2019m also playing a character of a talk-show host. There\u2019s a tiny, tiny bit of difference.\u201dBecause daytime talk shows get less attention than their late-night counterparts, DeGeneres is often overlooked in discussions of important hosts. But make no mistake: No other current daily host has been as successful or celebrated. Among her vast collection of awards are the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor and 32 Emmys. And apart from Conan O\u2019Brien, no one matches her television longevity (she\u2019s been daytime host for as many years as Jon Stewart led \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d) or her influence. Years before Jimmy Fallon turned games into standard elements of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d DeGeneres regularly invited guests to play them.Fallon has become known for these segments, and they have been imitated on other shows, but they all clearly owe DeGeneres a debt. (Last year, she started a hit game show \u201cEllen\u2019s Game of Games,\u201d which returns for a second season in January.) \u201cI\u2019m flattered that he\u2019s taken stuff,\u201d DeGeneres told me, adding: \u201cHe said he was going to steal everything, so it\u2019s fine.\u201dDuring an October taping of her show, what stood out was the stark contrast between the relaxed, low-key charisma of DeGeneres and the chaotic, charged-up energy of her audience. The crowd is encouraged to stand and dance, but they don\u2019t need to be told; they are ready to party, while DeGeneres projects a seemingly paradoxical blend of warmth and reserve, actively engaging, waving at people, listening intently to guests, adding a quip here and there, but never pushing too hard.With the supreme confidence of a professional who has seen it all before, she pingpongs from a monologue of topical jokes to an interview with a chef dying of cancer, from playfully joking with Sean Hayes of \u201cWill & Grace\u201d to talking to a Tennessee assistant principal whose dance video went viral. Some guests cry. More than one leaves with a big check. DeGeneres is clearly having a good time, but her energy remains steady. She doesn\u2019t look like someone going through the motions, ready to retire, nor does she appear particularly challenged.After the show \u2014 without her makeup on, she still looks a decade younger, her alert blue eyes her most distinguishing feature \u2014 she sat in an elegantly airy office surrounded by paintings as she analyzed her performance, beat by beat, with the authority of a doctor explaining lab results.As her private chef dropped off a drink, she explained that she spent a year struggling to come up with a subject to make comedy about. \u201cI used to talk about airplane food,\u201d she said, summing up her gentle mainstream style of observational humor. \u201cWhat do I do now?\u201dHer breakthrough, she explained, came when she developed a bit about whether she was still relatable, which, considering the extravagant surroundings (she and de Rossi have works by Richard Serra, Tracey Emin and Basquiat), does sound like a joke. But it is a subject DeGeneres understands in a personal, idiosyncratic way. \u201cIt was interesting to me that I was more relatable when I was closeted and dishonest than when I came out,\u201d she said.And yet, while DeGeneres has a spikier, more confessional style in her new special, this is more of a recalibration than a reinvention. She still dances and shows videos of adorable animals, even though de Rossi told her it was too much like her talk show. DeGeneres\u2019s inclusive sensibility remains fundamental to her outlook. She\u2019s too much of an old-school entertainer to pour out her neuroses onstage, as some comics do.Before DeGeneres stumbled into stand-up, really honing her craft at a comedy club in New Orleans, near where she\u2019s from (Metairie, La.), she had little idea what career she would pursue. In fact, DeGeneres said, in elementary school she didn\u2019t think she would live to see adulthood. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be alive,\u201d she said, vaguely. Asked why, she said without a trace of self-pity that she was a very sensitive kid. She remains sensitive, she added, confessing that she stayed up the night before worrying that she had sounded like she was accusing Jimmy Fallon of stealing her show. (She not only raved about him, but also texted me on Thanksgiving wishing me a happy holiday and mentioning she should also have praised James Corden and Seth Meyers along with Jimmy Kimmel. Then, after this article went online, she asked if we could add Stephen Colbert\u2019s name to that list.)Of the few memories she recalls from her youth, many are of feeling out of place or bottled up, in part because of her upbringing as a Christian Scientist. She recalls the other kids\u2019 being given shots, but her parents barred her from getting them or taking aspirin. With glassy eyes, she described her father, an insurance salesman who died in January, as kind and cautious, someone who wanted above all else for things to be harmonious. \u201cHe was a very fearful man,\u201d she said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t hear or engage with anything not pleasant.\u201dDeGeneres stays off social media and entirely avoids the news. She finds Donald Trump upsetting and dangerous, so steers clear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put that in me,\u201d she says.\u201cThis is my biggest fear,\u201d she said, sounding shaken. \u201cI\u2019m scared all the time for her.\u201dThe mood darkened and the interview seemed beside the point. But as she does so smoothly on her show, DeGeneres shifted gears, asking her chef for an iced tea, and explained how her wife had helped her with her new special, attending every performance, giving feedback and appearing onstage.DeGeneres said her wife also had a note about this interview. \u201cPortia said: Just remember, the nicer they are, the more they are going to screw you,\u201d DeGeneres said, smiling disarmingly.Unsure how to respond, I replied awkwardly: \u201cThat\u2019s good advice.\u201d Then I started feeling self-conscious and several minutes later, asked my least-nice question, about the tabloid stories featuring anonymous complaints that she isn\u2019t always kind to those she works with. \u201cThat bugs me if someone is saying that because it\u2019s an outright lie,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first day I said: \u2018The one thing I want is everyone here to be happy and proud of where they work, and if not, don\u2019t work here.\u2019 No one is going to raise their voice or not be grateful. That\u2019s the rule to this day.\u201dDeGeneres said that she stopped reading her press years ago, but that she knows what people say. \u201cI hear Portia and I are divorcing every other week or having a baby or whatever,\u201d she said, shaking her head.Minutes later, as if on cue, de Rossi entered in full riding gear, cutting a glamorous figure in jodhpurs and dark sunglasses. DeGeneres embraced her and shouted, \u201cBaby, stop riding horses!\u201dDe Rossi seemed unscathed, although her condition would worsen the next day, when she would have trouble concentrating. (She\u2019s doing better, but is still healing.) And as she bantered lovingly with her wife, she seemed charming and at ease, talking effusively about the special. \u201cShe\u2019s just a bit more complicated than she appears on the show,\u201d de Rossi said. \u201cThere\u2019s more range of emotion.\u201dDeGeneres recently took the option to extend her contract \u2014 until the summer of 2020 \u2014 although she had been close to declining. On the question of leaving, she changes her mind all the time. Her brother has been an advocate for staying on, making the case that in the age of Trump, the country needs her positive, unifying voice on television every day.\u201cShe gets mad when my brother tells me I can\u2019t stop,\u201d DeGeneres said, glancing over at de Rossi to see if she\u2019s gone too far.\u201cI just think she\u2019s such a brilliant actress and stand-up that it doesn\u2019t have to be this talk show for her creativity,\u201d de Rossi said. \u201cThere are other things she could tackle.\u201dDeGeneres, who has largely done voice work in film, most famously as Dory in \u201cFinding Nemo,\u201d said she would love to do another movie and play \u201csomeone unappealing\u201d; her wife mentions doing radio or a podcast.\u201cI don\u2019t see the end of her show as her career ending,\u201d de Rossi said.DeGeneres smiled and considered the comment for a second. But she skipped the kindest response and went straight for the laugh: \u201cYou have a concussion. What do you know?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Who Plays Aquaman\u2019s Nemesis, Gets Schooled in Chess ", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEncountersThe 32-year-old actor lands his biggest role yet, playing Black Manta, the underwater supervillain. Challenge Yahya Abdul-Mateen II to a staring contest and he\u2019ll almost certainly win. Chess, on the other hand? The verdict is still out.He was partaking in both on a recent Sunday morning in Union Square Park in Manhattan, where he was playing chess against Douglas Miller, a chess teacher recommended by a friend.He rubbed his mustache and sighed. \u201cI should\u2019ve seen that,\u201d he said, whispering to himself.\u201cI can quiet myself and allow myself to shut up and think,\u201d he said, staring intensely at the green-and-white chess board. \u201cI really enjoy that, I enjoy silence. I find that I need it, especially in a very loud business, one that always asks me to speak, to perform.\u201d\u201cBut I love the spotlight, too,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t go to a theater and not want to be on the stage when the lights come up. Those two things are simultaneous.\u201dThose opposing forces were on display on an unseasonably warm October morning, which brought teeming crowds to the park. Wearing a black beanie, a tangle of gold necklaces and a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt, Mr. Abdul-Mateen had an air of inscrutability.There were, however, some captivating ticks on display \u2014 covering his mouth, biting his cheeks, clearing his throat and little shrugs or laughs he shared with himself \u2014 that played like a three-act drama about how to conceal performance anxiety.\u201cLet\u2019s play again,\u201d he said, after Mr. Miller got to checkmate about 15 minutes into a game. \u201cMaybe I have moves or patterns that you can see and help me with.\u201d\u201cYou need theory,\u201d Mr. Miller said, setting up the board for another round as a group of Hare Krishnas sang and danced nearby. \u201cMost theory is endgame, and that\u2019s the deepest part of chess. You can easily get a piece to any position on the board, but you have to know how to use it and exploit it.\u201d He suggested reading the book \u201cMy System\u201d by Aron Nimzowitsch.Mr. Abdul-Mateen was raised in New Orleans and Oakland, Calif., the youngest of six children. Growing up, he said, his family was known as the \u201cblack Brady Bunch.\u201d \u201cWe had the house, the dog, the station wagon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a chain-link fence, though, not a white picket fence.\u201dWhen a childhood friend, Marshawn Lynch, was drafted to the National Football League, it opened his mind to more possibilities. \u201cThat was one of the first times that I saw someone that I knew inside the box, you know what I mean?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that demystified the whole idea that the people in the box were different than me.\u201dStill, he pursued a more traditional path at first, attending the University of California, Berkeley, where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in architecture, and working as a city planner in San Francisco.When he was laid off in 2010, he saw an opportunity to pursue his dream of acting and moved to Los Angeles. A castmate in a small community production of \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d was preparing to audition for graduate school, which inspired him to do the same. He aimed high and got accepted at the Yale School of Drama. His greatest lesson? \u201cIt took me three years to learn how to talk and listen,\u201d he said.Thanks to his brooding intensity and showman\u2019s swagger, he quickly made inroads into Hollywood. But playing the villain in a highly anticipated holiday blockbuster is his biggest role yet. A comic book neophyte when he landed the part, he had his work cut out for him.\u201cI immediately went on Twitter to see what the fans loved about Black Manta,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to be able to add those things to the character. I read the comics, too, so I could develop my own perspective on who he was.\u201dMr. Abdul-Mateen declined to give away anything about those two projects, set to debut next year. \u201cSorry, man. I wish I could,\u201d he said.The chessboard was set up for a rematch. At first, he seemed to hold his own, briskly advancing his pieces forward. But soon, his knight fell, followed by the rook, the bishop and the queen. It took Mr. Miller 10 minutes this time to reach checkmate.Mr. Abdul-Mateen seemed to crack under pressure. \u201cThat clock was ticking down, and I start making stupid choices, man,\u201d he said. \u201cOh well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Jungle\u2019 Review: Migrants\u2019 Heartbreaking Search for Home in Calais", "Date": "2019-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s PickEveryone on and off the stage \u2014 and the boundaries between the two are unnervingly porous in this immersive London-born production \u2014 is focused on the 17-year-old Sudanese boy, newly bruised and bleeding, with the ugly lattice of scars on his bared torso. His name is Okot, and he is about to enumerate the times he died \u2014 and no, he doesn\u2019t say \u201calmost died\u201d \u2014 during his journey, thousands of miles across desert and ocean, to this migrant camp in Calais, France.Portrayed by John Pfumojena with a concentrated stillness that absorbs light and sound, Okot asks an older member of the camp, a Syrian, if there is any point in his saying what he is about to say: \u201cIf I talk to her, you think she will understand?\u201dHe\u2019s referring specifically to Beth (Rachel Redford), an earnest young English volunteer in the camp. But the question encompasses us, the audience, too. Okot\u2019s Syrian friend, Safi (the wonderful Ammar Haj Ahmad), answers, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know. They don\u2019t know.\u201dAt the end of Okot\u2019s narrative, an account that makes \u201ctragedy\u201d (Beth\u2019s word) seem inadequate and frivolous, he is asked, \u201cHow did you survive?\u201d Another member of the encampment, an Eritrean woman (Nahel Tzegai), answers for all of them, \u201cWe didn\u2019t.\u201dAs directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin, with a set by Miriam Buether (lighted by Jon Clark), the production places the audience at the teeming center of a colony of displaced people and provisional stores, houses and churches. Benches border a network of runways, making theatergoers feel like part of the clientele of the improvised Afghan restaurant, set up by Salar (Ben Turner), which serves as a meeting place for these citizens of many \u2014 and no \u2014 nations.The play begins in a moment of crisis, when the migrants are facing eviction by the French government, and then moves back in time to the camp\u2019s early days, when its highly diverse members were trying to establish a system for living together. Though most of the 18 cast members have one very individualized part to play, they seem to be a countless legion.Their characters come from many countries \u2014 Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq and Iran, for starters. And the show summons, with uncanny clarity, the vigorous chaos from which a provisional order gradually emerges, as it asks, \u201cWhen does a place become a home?\u201d What we see does indeed seem to take the form, miraculously, of an autonomous nation in miniature, with a view across the channel of the British shore, the land they long to escape to.There is tension, of course, and apprehension and suspicion \u2014 particularly of the various well-intentioned, clumsy English people who arrive to help build houses and organize sanitation. But the clashes are often comic, and the pure energy of actors creating a world of people creating a world of their own is exhilarating.But don\u2019t be lulled into basking in your admiration and empathy for this diverse tribe of nomads. As exciting and entertaining as their exertions may be, the scarring pasts these characters carry and the profoundly uncertain futures they face are beyond the comprehension of those of us with homes, or even countries, to call our own.That\u2019s what registers so harrowingly when the second act begins, with its description of Okot\u2019s journey of many deaths. No, we don\u2019t know what the people in the camp went through to arrive there; no, we can\u2019t.Nor can the English creators of this show. And perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment of \u201cThe Jungle\u201d is that it acknowledges this incomprehension without being paralyzed by it.Yet \u201cThe Jungle\u201d is not one of those consciousness-raising exercises routinely described as \u201cworthy.\u201d It is, above all, a work of absorbing theater, which uses the immediacy of that art to conjure the paradoxes and confusions of a world dealing with an unprecedented flux of uprooted lives.The sensory flow of those lives is captured in both the artfully arranged rush of bodies in constant motion and an exquisitely textured aural soundscape that embraces both the taunting roar of nearby highway traffic and the susurrus of disparate voices melded in song and prayer. (Paul Arditti is the sound designer.)There are no unconditional heroes among the characters so vividly embodied here. That includes our professorial narrator, Safi, whom Mr. Ahmad presents, beautifully, as a man ultimately stranded between altruism and self-preservation.Each performance is slightly larger than life, perhaps for clarity\u2019s sake. And actors like Mr. Turner, as the charismatic restaurateur; Mohammad Amiri, as his industrious adolescent protegee; and Trevor Fox, as a hard-drinking, guitar-strumming Briton, have a touch of the music-hall charmer.The English volunteers are all, as Mr. Fox\u2019s character points out, themselves refugees of a sort, fleeing from their own lives. But the comparison with the real migrants only goes so far.These English, after all, like most of the audience, have real homes waiting for them. By the end of this extraordinary work, it is achingly clear that for the migrants, even those lucky enough to cross the English Channel, home will never again be more than a memory, and an infinitely fragile illusion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Tech Too Easy to Use?", "Date": "2018-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftSeven years ago, a younger and more carefree Mark Zuckerberg went onstage at Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference and announced a major change to the social network\u2019s design.\u201cFrom here on out, it\u2019s a frictionless experience,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Of all the buzzwords in tech, perhaps none has been deployed with as much philosophical conviction as \u201cfrictionless.\u201d Over the past decade or so, eliminating \u201cfriction\u201d \u2014 the name given to any quality that makes a product more difficult or time-consuming to use \u2014 has become an obsession of the tech industry, accepted as gospel by many of the world\u2019s largest companies.Airbnb, Uber and hundreds of other start-ups have made billions of dollars by reducing the effort needed to rent rooms, hail taxis and complete other annoying tasks. And when a company fails, excessive friction is often cited as the reason.There is nothing wrong with making things easier, in most cases, and the history of technology is filled with examples of amazing advances brought about by reducing complexity. Not even the most hardened Luddite, I suspect, wants to go back to the days of horse-drawn carriages and hand-crank radios.Over the past several weeks, I\u2019ve spoken to more than a dozen designers, product managers and tech executives about the principles of frictionless design. Many said that while making products easier to use was usually good, there were cases where friction could be useful in preventing harm, and steering users toward healthier behavior.Bobby Goodlatte, a former Facebook designer who is now an angel investor, told me that the tech industry\u2019s culture of optimization \u201cpresumes that reducing friction is virtuous unto itself.\u201d\u201cIt leads us to ask, \u2018Can we?\u2019 \u2014 never \u2018Should we?\u2019\u201d he said.Several people praised the Time Well Spent movement spearheaded by Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, as a kind of pro-friction cohort within the tech industry. Among other things, the group has successfully pressured companies like Facebook and Apple to take steps to curb tech addiction by including features that encourage users to limit their screen time.And a few lamented that in the tech industry\u2019s race for convenience, something important had been lost.\u201cWe wanted to juice engagement and therefore made things as frictionless as possible,\u201d said Jenna Bilotta, a design manager who has worked at Google. \u201cWe made a whole world of the literal \u2018least you could do\u2019 apps, and it\u2019s trashing people\u2019s mental health.\u201dOften, invoking the concept of friction is a useful way to obscure some larger, less savory goal. For Facebook, \u201cfrictionless sharing\u201d was a thinly veiled cover for the company\u2019s true goal of getting users to post more often, and increasing the amount of data available for ad targeting. For YouTube, auto-playing videos have sharply increased view time, thereby increasing the platform\u2019s profitability. And for Amazon, tools like one-click ordering have created a stunningly efficient machine for commerce and consumption.\u201cOur current application of tech has been to take something hard and make it easy,\u201d said Harper Reed, an engineer and the chief technology officer for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.When tech companies do make their products harder to use, it\u2019s generally to secure them from hackers, spammers or other malicious actors. (Think of the security Captchas that require users to solve math problems or pick out photos of traffic lights, or the way YouTube requires new users to verify their phone numbers before uploading videos longer than 15 minutes.)More of these kinds of changes would be welcome, even if they led to a short-term hit to engagement. And there are plenty of possibilities.What if Facebook made it harder for viral misinformation to spread by adding algorithmic \u201cspeed bumps\u201d that would delay the spread of a controversial post above a certain threshold until fact checkers evaluated it?Or if YouTube gave users a choice between two videos when their video finished, instead of auto-playing the next recommendation?Or if Twitter discouraged abusive pile-ons by making it harder for people who haven\u2019t followed an account for a set number of days to reply to that account\u2019s tweets?This approach might seem overly paternalistic. But the alternative \u2014 a tech infrastructure optimized to ask as little of us as possible, with few circuit breakers to limit the impact of abuse and addiction \u2014 is frightening. After all, \u201cfriction\u201d is just another word for \u201ceffort,\u201d and it\u2019s what makes us capable of critical thought and self-reflection. Without it, we would be the blob people from \u201cWall-E,\u201d sucking down Soylent while watching Netflix on our self-driving recliners.\u201cImagine you run a social network and you\u2019re trying to aggregate all the trending stories based on what all users are clicking,\u201d Mr. Harris, the Time Well Spent founder, told me recently. \u201cWould you prefer to jack the plug into each person\u2019s reptilian brain to aggregate those stories, or would you prefer to jack the plug into their calm, reflective brain that is considering the consequences downstream?\u201dThere may even be a business case for complexity.Consider what happened to Tulerie, a New York start-up that makes a platform that allows women to share designer clothing.Tulerie\u2019s co-founder Merri Smith told me a fascinating story from the company\u2019s early days. In the beginning, Ms. Smith said, the company invited women to join via a brief Google survey, which it emailed to hundreds of prospective members.\u201cWe wanted to create as little friction as possible, while still having to vet these people,\u201d she said.But only one person filled out the survey. So Ms. Smith and her co-founder decided to try a more complicated approach. Anyone who wanted to join had to conduct a brief video call with a company employee first.Logically, the new strategy should have failed. But it was a huge hit. Prospective members flooded the invite list, filling up the company\u2019s interview schedule weeks in advance. By creating a more complex sign-up, Tulerie had signalled that its service was special and worth the effort.\u201cIt goes back to values,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cPeople perceive it as harder to get into, and they want to be a part of it.\u201dI don\u2019t want to romanticize the slow, often frustrating processes of the past. There is nothing inherently good about complexity, and the tech industry could still do a lot of good by reducing friction in systems like health care, education and financial services.But there are both philosophical and practical reasons to ask whether certain technologies should be a little less optimized for convenience. We wouldn\u2019t trust a doctor who made speed a priority over safety. Why would we trust an app that does?Advertisement"}

The rout in junk bonds makes it more expensive for financially fragile businesses to borrow. The collapse in crude oil prices discourages new investment and hiring in the oil patch, which has been a source of job growth.In that sense, the markets are both a gauge of what investors expect to happen in the economy, and a potential catalyst for their decisions.

My first eight years in the business were mostly Shakespeare and dramas. \u201cWill & Grace\u201d came out of a whole other instinct that kicked in in my early 30s, where suddenly I\u2019m watching \u201cCheers\u201d and \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cFriends.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhere\u2019s this for me?\u201d But when it was over 12 years ago, I thought, I\u2019ve got to go back to this other thing not just because I miss it, but because it\u2019s going to take a while to convince people that I still have that side of me too. I\u2019m seesawing back and forth and loving it. One side of it is just me using all of my energy [as Will Truman] and the other side is me suppressing all of that energy into a kind of Michael Douglas leading man that took me a while to get to.\u201cTravelers\u201d is a Canadian show about saving humanity after a cataclysm. Are you polite people up to the task?There was a time when even we as Canadians would be nervous about that, going ha-ha, almost apologetic in advance. And now it\u2019s like, \u201cI dare you to not love this \u2014 and by the way, it\u2019s all-Canadian.\u201d Twenty years ago American producers were like: \u201cOh, man, I\u2019ve seen these guys. I don\u2019t want to have to hire here in Vancouver.\u201d But now I think people are amazed by the scope.No, I don\u2019t feel less nervous. I\u2019m a very hopeful person. I believe in a one-term president, but I don\u2019t know. We are dual citizens. We\u2019ve been living in this country for a long time, and we\u2019ve contributed a lot, and so what happens in 2020 matters. But we can still at the same time say we\u2019re proud Canadians.Has our political environment fostered a nostalgic yearning?Something about the election just said, \u201cWhere are smart clowns? Where do we get some relief?\u201d Because you can binge \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d but it ain\u2019t funny. I think what brought people back to \u201cWill & Grace\u201d was, \u201cOnce a week I get my ice cream.\u201d\u201cWill & Grace\u201d certainly has its political moments. But Max Mutchnick, one of its creators, said that the show is never going to motivated by what\u2019s on the cover of The Times. How, then, do you keep things current?The news changes so much that trying to do jokes about that seems almost futile now. However, we just did a #MeToo episode for Grace, which turned out to be an incredibly moving thing, and I\u2019m doing one in which I\u2019m trying to give my blood to someone that needs my type, and when he hears I\u2019m gay he doesn\u2019t want it. So it\u2019s looking at the fact that for all the changes in the world and all the Will and Graces, it doesn\u2019t matter. The stigma still exists. And Will has a couple of great scenes about how this fight is tiring. How long do we have to educate people? How long do we have to stand up for ourselves before we don\u2019t have to convince somebody to bake our freakin\u2019 cake?And yet the show is also rather revolutionary, isn\u2019t it, in that it looks at four New York singles in midlife? Usually that\u2019s a young person\u2019s game.We can tell all the dating stories, except it\u2019s not the second season of \u201cFriends.\u201d The decisions to make up and break up are different conversations. They can be more mature; they can also be funnier because that\u2019s a more uncomfortable area and more permanent. When somebody who\u2019s 50 decides not to pursue something or gets their heart broken, there\u2019s not lot of fish left in the sea, so it has more meaning.Do you ever feel the urge to just let it rip?In the early days we were actually too careful: the decision in 2001 not to do a 9/11 episode, the decision to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not the right show for that, in our little \u2018Will & Grace\u2019 New York.\u201d And now it feels disingenuous not to include either a serious episode or just really smart jokes about some of the awful [expletive] that\u2019s going on. We\u2019re older people now. We can be cranky and we can say what we\u2019re feeling and we don\u2019t have to tiptoe around.Advertisement"}

The statement also said there was a public show cause hearing in Nantucket District Court last Thursday, after which Clerk Magistrate Brian Kearney issued the criminal complaint.A representative for Mr. Spacey did not respond to a request for comment.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Effects Cannot Be Overstated\u2019: When Tech Invaded Media", "Date": "2018-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingJim Rutenberg reflects on the convergence of technology with media, and how that has changed his consumption habits and coverage. (Warning: iPhone addiction ahead.)Tech and media have long been converging. What are the biggest effects on the media industry, and how has it had to adapt? The effects cannot be overstated \u2014 and in some ways, everything is changing, which is what makes it so exciting to cover. The question is what the new power structure will look like. Will it be more reflective of America and continue to tell better stories about it? Or will it be meet the new boss, same as the old boss?At the same time, the digital transformation has introduced supercool ways of telling stories and given the industry a new dynamism from a new talent pool. At the end of the day, though, the basics still rise: penetrating, holy-smokes reporting in stories well told.How do you consume media now? Which gadgets or tech services do you use most often?I am so addicted to my iPhone that my fingers hurt. My distal interphalangeal joints \u2014 the ones toward the tips of my digits \u2014 take it particularly hard, though they are probably so strong by now they could lift a VW Bug. I\u2019m a 6s-type person, and if I didn\u2019t have the iPhone battery case I\u2019d be dead in the water by noon every day (especially when dealing with sensitive sources via battery-eating encrypted apps).Most of my iPhone time is spent on Twitter, far more than I want to admit. I use Twitter far more to consume than to tweet myself; I prefer to save my best thoughts for my column, though I am constantly reassessing that as I watch many of my colleagues make wonderful use of the platform to report without cutting into their more traditional dispatches. I\u2019m using Apple TV more and more, and am constantly toggling between my content on Apple, Amazon Prime, Netflix and the cable box. I\u2019ve yet to figure out the remotes; I just push buttons until stuff turns on. Spotify is a constant in my life, and it\u2019s what I usually use on my Sonos home speaker system as well.What could be better about the tech tools you rely on most for your beat?Also, the platforms simply have to do a better job of identifying and eradicating bots whose sole mission appears to be to inflame and harass. Yes, they target all sorts of users, but in some cases (and in the parochial terms of my beat) they\u2019re aimed at journalists \u2014 either to sway them or to just attack them, in another affront on democracy\u2019s fourth estate. Don\u2019t get me started on misinformation. I have too many columns ahead to fill on the topic.What tech product are you personally obsessed with? I\u2019m going to cheat and talk about two. And it won\u2019t be pretty. Let\u2019s start with Nest. The device \u2014 at least ours, which we got two years ago \u2014 has a mind of its own. At times, it makes me feel as if I\u2019m in the \u201cJetsons\u201d reboot episode in which the robots all turn against George. My wife and I are often away from our house for long periods, so we keep the heat low. The Nest allows us to warm it from afar hours ahead of time so we don\u2019t come home to an icebox. But then, for no apparent reason, the Nest will set the heat back to low when we\u2019re in the house so it is suddenly freezing again. This has happened in exceedingly cold weather when there are pipes to worry about. The device is running on an algorithm that we can turn off \u2014 I get that (theoretically, at least; my m.o. with tech is to figure out the minimum that will serve my needs and leave it at that). And I\u2019m sure there are other ways to fix it. The other day I hit up against a new and unforeseen problem \u2014 it went totally dead on me just as a cold snap kicked in. I forgot to pay the internet bill. I know one thing: My old thermostat was immune to my own idiocy, didn\u2019t play games with me or jeopardize my plumbing and I didn\u2019t need to pore through a manual to figure it out. We are giving it one more chance before we ditch it. Ditto Sonos. The stereo speakers are wireless and portable, so you can play music throughout your house from your iPhone, without having to hire a contractor to embed speakers in your walls or sell you some fancy and expensive system. But often \u2014 usually when we\u2019re throwing a dinner party \u2014 the speakers will stop playing as the app goes on the fritz for prolonged periods without obvious reason. (And customer support isn\u2019t all that supportive.) That never happened with my old Sony hi-fi. One more ruined playlist during a party and I\u2019m out.What\u2019s one app you can\u2019t live without?Surfline. It\u2019s not the only app to give you surf conditions and predictions, and it\u2019s not the only good one. But its easy-to-digest ratings \u2014 \u201cgood,\u2019\u2019 \u201cfair,\u2019\u2019 \u201cpoor\u201d \u2014 are great for committed surfers with the unfortunate affliction of a day job. The app offers plenty of data and has a wealth of surf cams from breaks around the world, so you can see the swell before you go \u2014 or stare longingly at your home break when you\u2019re in another meeting and your editor\u2019s all, like, blah, blah, blah.

{"Headline": "British Media Upstart May Exit", "Date": "2018-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The fiercely competitive sports media market in the United Kingdom is causing major problems for another insurgent company trying to penetrate it.Italian businessman Andrea Radrizzani\u2019s Eleven Sports, a start-up network with global aspirations, is considering shutting down its business in Britain, just four months after arriving with a blaze of publicity and courting controversy.Having spent millions to outbid the country\u2019s biggest network for popular European soccer rights, Radrizzani said he is now likely to pull out of the country if he cannot work out distribution deals with Britain\u2019s media giants for his channel, which until now has only been available online on a subscription basis.Without the agreements, his business is not viable in the United Kingdom, Radrizzani said by phone this week. His channel had been dubbed locally as the \u201cNetflix of sports,\u201d a title that other so-called over-the-top platforms like the industry\u2019s biggest spender, billionaire Len Blavatnick\u2019s DAZN, has also been cultivating.\u201cLa Liga and Serie A have been broadcast by the main players in the past,\u201d Darcey said. \u201cHe\u2019s picked a more serious challenge.\u201dEleven wouldn\u2019t be the first broadcaster with big ambitions to gain market share in sports to fail in the United Kingdom. About a decade ago, ITV Digital and Setanta collapsed, while ESPN\u2019s British television operation lasted less than five years before it pulled out.\u201cHe\u2019s the latest guy in a long line to overestimate his model,\u201d Darcey said. \u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s easy until you try to make money.\u201dRights values, largely driven by competition for live Premier League and Champions League soccer between Sky and BT, the United Kingdom\u2019s former telecoms monopoly, have spiked in recent years to such an extent that both broadcasters and consumers have become pickier over what content they need to have, after committing billions on soccer rights.Sky, which broadcast Spanish soccer for 20 years until it was snatched by Eleven, and BT, which held the last contract for Serie A, have recently entered cooperation agreements that make content from both companies available on each platform. Radrizzani said he offered Eleven\u2019s content to both at lower prices than they were previously paying but could not reach a deal.Both Sky and BT declined to comment. Without a deal in place, Radrizzani is trying to renegotiate Eleven\u2019s soccer contracts with the Italian and Spanish leagues.It\u2019s not the first time Radrizzani, frequently outspoken on issues related to sports and media, has courted controversy. As the owner of second-tier English soccer team Leeds United, he backed a deal to scrap an agreement Sky had negotiated with the three professional leagues outside of the Premier League. Though by far his most audacious move to date was to ignore a decades-old convention that forbids British broadcasters from screening live games on Saturday afternoon. Eleven, with the backing of La Liga, broadcast a couple of rounds of top-flight soccer before eventually agreeing to stop.With the rights Eleven has, Radrizzani said, it isn\u2019t sustainable as a streaming platform in the United Kingdom. The Ultimate Fighting Championship, a hugely popular mixed martial arts franchise, scrapped an agreement with Eleven that was due to start in January because it was unable to secure a domestic pay-TV distribution contract. To complicate matters, sports and entertainment conglomerate IMG, which shares an owner with U.F.C., has a small stake in Eleven\u2019s British operation and owns the overseas rights to Serie A. IMG declined to comment.Advertisement"}
