{"Headline": "Brands Blaze a Trail as They Go After China\u2019s Internet Bonanza", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareAdvertising sees tectonic shift toward online channels for the consumer mind.For advertisers and marketers, China\u2019s still-evolving digital landscape has suddenly become the holy grail. It was not so five years ago.During the period, things like online searches and microblogs have assumed such immense potential in terms of access to the consumer mind that they are now seen as more effective advertising channels than print and broadcast media, experts said.Online and digital channels are projected to attract a whopping 377.5 billion yuan ($54.3 billion) in advertising, or 64 percent of the total, this year. Traditional broadcast, print and outdoor media will be relegated to the background (208.3 billion yuan, or just 36 percent).Advertisers have never had it so good in the digital space. Avenues abound, from messaging apps and chat rooms to short video apps, Q&A destinations and e-commerce platforms.From the advertisers\u2019 perspective, that is a virtual bonanza. China is home to more than 772 million internet end-users, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. That is more than double that of the web population of the United States.Within the digital space in China, the mobile channel is something that brands simply cannot do without, experts said. Over 95 percent of the online population use mobile devices to access the internet, according to the China Statistical Report on Internet Development published in August.The rise of e-commerce has brightened the allure of the digital medium, said Iris Chin, general manager of media agency MediaCom China. The country is a hub for digital innovation, given the massive contributions by the Tech Trinity, or BAT, a term that refers to Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.Now, the scene is getting even more exciting with the advent of a string of new players that are poised to challenge BAT, Chin said.Over the past three years, the percentage of mobile ads in terms of overall internet spending jumped ten-fold to more than 60 percent, according to consultancy iResearch. It forecast the figure will eventually grow to 80 percent by the end of next year.As internet-based services hog the lion\u2019s share of people\u2019s internet use, firms that offer such services are vying for user attention, experts said.For example, people spend 76 minutes a day on Tencent\u2019s messenger WeChat, the company said last year, while time spent on fast-rising rival short video app Douyin reached about 60 minutes, according to its parent company Bytedance.\u201cGoing digital is a big part of our strategy that drives our success in China,\u201d said Filipp Cai, general manager of Innisfree China, the South Korean cosmetic house.It has opened flagship e-stores on Tencent\u2019s WeChat and QQ for a seamless online-and-offline experience.\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder companies are spending big on digital (platforms) given that marketing dollars follow consumer behavior,\u201d Chin said. \u201cThis constant connection leads to a constant demand for new information, new platforms and new ways to engage with consumers through digital.\u201dFixation with mobile means that consumers in China, who used to compare prices of products online and in shopping malls, are now using apps to make purchase decisions, said Jacky Tang, general manager of Neo Communications, a Shanghai-based agency dedicated to digital marketing solutions.\u201cTo navigate through the highly complex and segmented digital landscape, the safe bet is to start with WeChat and Weibo, which we deem as the \u2018twin pillars\u2019 of China\u2019s social media,\u201d Tang said.Probably China\u2019s most popular mobile app, WeChat has become a default way of life for the Chinese to pay bills, access news, book taxi rides or even make a doctor\u2019s appointment. The troves of data generated through this all-in-one killer app has given Tencent a leg up in the digital marketing landscape.According to Tang, three built-in features of WeChat help enhance brand awareness: mini programs, WeChat Moments and WeChat public accounts.A mini program is an app-like functionality that aims at driving sales directly. Moments is an e-space in which brands can engage with prospective and existing customers through content marketing, story-telling and other interactions.And through an official account, \u201ccompanies can broadcast messages and articles to their followers like a blog, but brands and service providers can also use these accounts to serve customers,\u201d Tang said.Foreign entrants to China\u2019s digital scene are embracing these new tools. Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer, told China Daily in an earlier interview that WeChat opens up \u201ca huge new world of opportunity\u201d in the digital space.\u201cThe exciting thing for us is the deeper and more meaningful way that we are able to tell our stories using this platform,\u201d Bailey said.Anne-Marie Verdin, brand director at Mulberry, also touted WeChat\u2019s advanced functionality and prominence in the daily lives of consumers, predicting it to be \u201cthe central tool to communicate with the Chinese audience.\u201dBut one caveat about WeChat is that brands should build up a follower base in the first place, industry experts noted.\u201cMarketers really need to set up formal accounts for their model on WeChat and persuade buyers to stick to their web page, often by providing incentives and promotions for brand new followers,\u201d said Tang.In this context, he referred to Weibo (microblog in Chinese) as a square-like online avenue where its users can easily see posts from anyone, since they really don\u2019t need to be connected to them in the first place.Domenica di Lieto, chief executive officer of Emerging Communications, a digital marketing agency with offices in London and Shanghai, recommended that companies start by building up an audience on Chinese microblogging site Weibo before pouring money into a WeChat marketing campaign.\u201cWe say that Weibo is an acquisition platform and WeChat is a retention platform,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no one plan that fits several brands.\u201dWhile many marketing practitioners regard the WeChat and Weibo duo as the \u201choly grail,\u201d they cannot be safe bets once and for all.According to MediaCom\u2019s Chin, a shift in online paradigm has occurred where video has taken the top spot, or 35 percent, of time duration of people\u2019s internet behavior, followed by social media\u2019s 29 percent, among others.That has given an edge to the likes of Douyin, a high-flying short video app that is fast rising as a staple in the digital marketing matrix of most brands. \u201cThe platform allows brands to share short videos, usually in a fun or interesting format, with users\u2026 They also leverage key opinion leaders to help share the content so it spreads quickly among their followers,\u201d Chin said.Established less than two years ago, Douyin has managed to gain 200 million daily active users in China, according to statistics it published earlier this month. Up to 70 percent of its active users are women, and 85 percent are under the age of 25, who are referred to as millennials.Douyin is a good place to start social media campaigns, given that major social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo have become saturated and yet continually increase the price of inserting advertisements on them, experts said.Especially after Douyin teamed up with e-commerce sites such as Taobao and JD, users can now find direct purchase links on their phone or device screens while scrolling up and down funny videos, according to Neo\u2019s Tang.This trend dovetails with another massive trend in China \u2013 social commerce. (Wikipedia defines social commerce as \u201ca subset of electronic commerce that involves social media, online media that supports social interaction, and user contributions to assist online buying and selling of products and services.\u201d)Avid young buyers tend to indulge in impulsive purchases as they browse the net. That spells great opportunities for companies like Alibaba, which benefits from the company\u2019s 520 million active users to deliver targeted reach to brands using its e-commerce platforms.By tracking users across those sites with what the company calls a \u201cunified ID,\u201d Alibaba is able to not only tailor product recommendations to individual users but personalize the storefronts they visit. It accomplishes this by analyzing consumers\u2019 browsing and buying habits, according to Chris Tung, the firm\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cBy combining Alibaba\u2019s massive data assets, businesses can identify, segment and build tailored content for the best results,\u201d he said.\u201cThe beauty of digital marketing is that it is trackable,\u201d Chin said. \u201cThe level of consumer engagement is often very difficult to assess. Digital marketing allows for tracking and allows brands to know how many people have seen their ad, clicked on their ad, gone to their website from the ad, engaged with the brand and even purchased.\u201dHe WeiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}
{"Headline": "Shopping Gala Built on Musings About Being Single Is Now a Marketing Phenomenon", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareNov. 11 annual splurge reflects a significant shift in consumer behavior.In the past decade, Nov. 11 has undergone a dramatic transformation from being just another date on the calendar to becoming the world\u2019s largest single-day discount shopping festival.Also known as Singles Day, it debuted in 2009 as an online antidote to the sentimentality surrounding the Western Valentine\u2019s Day. It takes its name from the way the date is written numerically as 1111, which resembles \u201cbare branches,\u201d a Chinese expression for the unattached.As this year\u2019s shopping gala progressed, milestones from previous years fell one by one.It was no surprise that Alibaba, which created the extravaganza to spur low-season online sales, broke its own record by clocking up sales worth 213.5 billion yuan ($30.8 billion) in just 24 hours, up by 27 percent year-on-year.The number of parcels generated on the day exceeded 1 billion for the first time, in line with estimates from Alibaba\u2019s chairman, Jack Ma.But beyond its huge scale, the gala reflects a paradigm shift in consumer behavior, as more shoppers look to imported goods, which they view as being of higher quality, even though they cost more \u2013 some of which are even designed exclusively for the Chinese market.For instance, it took just over six hours for cross-border online transactions to reach last year\u2019s full-day record on Tmall Global, Alibaba\u2019s dedicated portal for such purchases.While not disclosing the final sales figure, the company said more than 40 percent of items were bought from international brands. Beauty products from Japanese cosmetics specialist Kao and hairdryers from Dyson, which is headquartered in Britain, were among those that saw sales worth 10 million yuan in the first hour of trading during this year\u2019s shopping spree.Cross-border sales were also brisk on other e-commerce platforms. Those on NetEase Kaola, the cross-border portal owned by internet company NetEase, surpassed last year\u2019s total in just 78 minutes.Overseas products from the Amazon Global Store, which covers top destinations among Chinese customers for cross-border shopping and is owned by United States tech giant Amazon, achieved double-digit growth.Xu Lei, chief marketing officer of JD and CEO of JD Mall, which saw the amount of imported fresh food sold double compared with last year, said, \u201cThere has been a noticeable shift in China toward quality over price, which we see in the growing numbers of consumers who are willing to pay more for branded and imported goods.\u201dBefore Nov. 11, consultancy Oliver Wyman had projected that imported goods would be those most in demand at this year\u2019s festival. In a survey released just ahead of Singles Day, it found that 57 percent of customers surveyed said they intended to buy overseas goods, and such sales would constitute one-third of overall spending for the festival.New growth engineThe buying spree has helped to ease any concerns over a slowing economy, as consumption takes center stage in powering the nation\u2019s economic engine. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the contribution of consumption spending to GDP growth reached 78.5 percent in the first half of this year.The overall size of the nation\u2019s online retail sector reached 7.18 trillion yuan last year, a year-on-year rise of nearly 32.2 percent. This figure is projected to exceed 18 trillion yuan by 2025, with the online proportion of retail sales of consumer goods forecast to hit 25 percent, the bureau said.Meanwhile, the retail import penetration rate of China\u2019s cross-border e-commerce sector (consumers buying goods through cross-border e-commerce platforms as a proportion of online consumers) rose from just 1.6 percent in 2014 to 10.2 percent last year, according to research by consultancy Deloitte, the China Chamber of International Commerce and Alibaba\u2019s research arm.Buying imported goods online has become more commonplace, as new users\u2019 average spending per transaction and the average number of product categories bought increases, the study found.For example, the average number of product categories bought by first-time users in 2014 was 1.6, but by last year this had risen to four, while average spending per transaction last year rose to 2.5 times that in 2014.This trend is a vote of confidence for companies such as Chemist Warehouse, an Australian online pharmacy. According to Nancy Jian Fei Fei, its Greater China CEO, it was the only company with origins in Australia and New Zealand to achieve sales of 100 million yuan on Tmall Global on Nov. 11 this year. \u201cOur popularity is in part thanks to the growing disposable income of Chinese consumers and their changing mindset on healthcare,\u201d Jian said. \u201cAlso, our brand awareness has been further strengthened as more foreign manufacturers devote more resources to marketing efforts in China.\u201dWang Ying, 34, a company clerk in Shanghai, bought two bottles of vitamins from Chemist Warehouse during Singles Day this year and enjoyed a discount of 25 percent.\u201cThe maturing cross-border e-commerce setup can circumvent a lot of consumer education work,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the bonded warehouse in place, these imported goods can be delivered within just a couple of days to your doorstep.\u201dHusayn Remtulla, CEO of VIVA Naturals, a Canadian nutrients supplier, said, \u201cDouble 11 is similar to Black Friday (the shopping day held the day after Thanksgiving in the U.S.) or even Amazon Prime Day (a one-day global event exclusively for Prime members), except the scale and magnitude dwarfs anything that happens here in North America.\u201dRemtulla\u2019s company reaped gains from its first Nov. 11 event last year, securing two months\u2019 worth of sales in 24 hours.\u201cIt really sets you up for the next year,\u201d he said. \u201cA successful Double 11 allows us to reinvest in the business, and to learn from our customers in China about what they love and what they are looking for.\u201dCao Lei, director of the China E-Commerce Research Center, said the history of Nov. 11 indicates that this year\u2019s sales peak will be next year\u2019s \u201cnew norm.\u201d\u201cBrisk sales generated on Nov. 11 have reflected the dynamism and resilience of the Chinese economy. The event itself is the best demonstration of the upgrade in consumption, branding, supply chain and even manufacturing,\u201d he said.Chu Yin, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing, said that in echoing the country\u2019s opening-up policy and import strategy at a commercial level, the 2018 shopping gala was set to become a natural online extension of this month\u2019s China International Import Expo, serving as an indicator of the latest global business practices.Experience valuedAccording to the import consumption report led by Deloitte, those born after the 1990s constitute 45.2 percent of Chinese consumers who buy imported items online.Unlike those who are older, the younger generation values experience over price and is likely to pursue niche products and brands, said Zhang Tianbing, Deloitte Asia Pacific consumer products and retail industry leader.This requires brands to constantly evolve with changing customer preferences, and win over their hearts and wallets, Zhang said.Joost Vlaanderen, president of Mondelez China, the company behind Oreo cookies, said Nov. 11 has become a test bed for its \u201csupply chain system, new products and even new ideas.\u201dMondelez is among some 80 international brands that have begun to customize offerings and launch product co-creations tailored to the Chinese market.Powering these efforts are data analytics and consumer insights offered by Tmall\u2019s Innovation Center, which can help brands devise new strategies and channels.For example, confectionery maker Mars teamed up with Alibaba to create a chili-infused Snickers bar aimed at satisfying Chinese demand for a tongue-tingling treat.The decision to cash in on the growing popularity of mala, the Chinese term for numbing and spicy, was based on consumer research by both companies to find a new flavor to bring to the market.Wallace Du, head of both digital commerce at Mars and the company\u2019s China Digital Innovation Center, said, \u201cLeveraging the insights we got from the collaboration, we connected a flavor with our chocolate that is loved by 41 percent of Chinese consumers.\u201dFrom its online launch in August last year to mid-March, sales of spicy Snickers bars surpassed 9 million yuan, with 92 percent of consumers giving them positive reviews. The company said the bars had reached the yearly sales target within six months.Jacques Penhirin, partner and head of the Greater China office at Oliver Wyman, said Chinese consumers are now more selective compared with a year ago and are keeping their spending in check as they search for more unique events or offerings.\u201cThe days of breakneck growth seen by tapping new audiences in China cannot continue. Increasing per-head spending will become increasingly vital,\u201d Penhirin said.According to Wang Xiaofeng, senior analyst at U.S. market research company Forrester, gross merchandise volume generated on Nov. 11, although hitting another record high this year, will no longer be the focus as the event evolves from a purely discount one to a testing ground for new commerce initiatives and emerging technologies.Such diversification is providing plenty of opportunities for emerging brands such as Ocean King, an Australian manufacturer of nutrients, skincare and honey products, to capture the huge consumption potential in smaller Chinese cities.\u201cMajor international brands already have a strong presence in key cities like Beijing and Shanghai, making it difficult for us to penetrate,\u201d said Ocean King director William Ma.On the other hand, less established brands might be better received by consumers in smaller cities and townships who are curious to embrace new products, and where operating and marketing costs tend to be lower.Jason Yu, China general manager of shopper behavior specialist Kantar Worldpanel, said, \u201cThe vast population base and the unleashed consumption power from smaller cities, townships and rural areas are magnets for international brands.\u201dHe WeiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}
{"Headline": "The Huawei Executive\u2019s Arrest Is Igniting Fear. The U.S. Should Take Notice.", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldIn an email with the subject line \u201cTravel Restriction to China,\u201d the Silicon Valley networking giant cautioned employees against nonessential travel to China \u201cdue to recent events.\u201d Cisco has since said that the email was sent in error and that there are no China travel restrictions on its employees.Still, the fear is real.Over spicy hot pot last week after the announcement of Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, an American-educated Chinese tech entrepreneur told me that he wouldn\u2019t travel to the United States unless necessary. Another Chinese tech figure, one who is backed by American money, discussed whether he should give up his beloved iPhone for a Huawei smartphone.The founder of an artificial intelligence start-up said that when he visited the Bay Area in October, he was questioned extensively at immigration. One investor, a former Silicon Valley engineer who moved back to China a few years ago to set up a venture capital fund focused on A.I., left his laptop at home and deleted messages from the social media platform WeChat from his phone in case American security personnel decided to take a peek. They didn\u2019t.(All the tech industry figures spoke on the condition of anonymity \u2014 to protect themselves not just from the Chinese government but from the American government as well.)\u201cOut of national security consideration, we can start thinking about the possibility of ousting Apple from China,\u201d Fang Xingdong, the founder of ChinaLabs, a technology think tank in Beijing, wrote on WeChat.On Chinese social media, jingoism is running high. \u201cA guilty conscience needs no accuser!\u201d \u201cBoycott Cisco!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s detain Tim Cook of Apple!\u201dThe United States, on the other hand, risks losing important potential allies in its tug of war with China\u2019s authoritarian government. China\u2019s tech elite are comfortable with the American system and open to many Western values. It would not be in Washington\u2019s interest to push them closer to the Communist Party.\u201cThe party building in the past few years was a big present to the U.S. and Europe,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, an economist at Hong Kong University.China\u2019s pro-market elites have been trying to use the pressure of a slowing economy and the trade war to push Mr. Xi to give power back to entrepreneurs, which would be in line with some of Washington\u2019s goals.Now, they aren\u2019t sure that the Trump administration views them any differently from the Chinese government.This time is different. Huawei is among the most respected private enterprises in China. The world\u2019s biggest telecom equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone maker, Huawei is frequently exalted in China\u2019s business world for elbowing out its bigger Western rivals and developing cutting-edge technologies.There are all kinds of tales about how hard Huawei engineers and salespeople work. Many entrepreneurs told me that they respected Ren Zhengfei, Huawei\u2019s founder and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, more than high-profile Chinese internet tycoons like Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent because Huawei is the only Chinese corporation with a truly global footprint.The United States accuses Ms. Meng of being directly involved in efforts to circumvent its sanctions against Iran. The authorities there may have compelling evidence. For people not familiar with China and China\u2019s business world, it may be puzzling that some businesspeople would take Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest so badly.Still, many people in China who have grown up under an authoritarian regime see only a blunt exercise of state power. Because many Chinese view Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest as a tool to escalate the trade war, they see her as a victim of geopolitics rather than a potential lawbreaker.They also worry they could be seen as tainted simply because they are from China. Think of it as China\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d \u2014 it is hard to be a truly independent private business in China because the government controls most of the resources. The Chinese government uses bank loans, business licenses and regulations to make sure companies toe the party line. It is increasingly a major venture capitalist.If the United States isn\u2019t careful, it could alienate a group of people who may be instrumental if China is going to loosen up and give its people more freedom. Many admire the American political, judiciary and economic systems. If the United States puts more pressure on them, they may be forced to choose sides \u2014 and the Chinese government may seem like the only choice to make.\u201cThe whole world is taking sides,\u201d Ren Yi, a senior investment banker in Beijing, wrote on the social media site Weibo.

{"Headline": "Fashion Revolution Has Begun, and Artificial Intelligence Is Having a Big Say", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareHumans are still the primary source of design, but machines are learning how to foresee trends.When Thailand\u2019s King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in October 2016, a low- to mid-end Hong Kong fashion brand sold out of black shirts and white ones \uff0d the colors of respect worn during the official mourning period \uff0d almost overnight. That prompted designers and merchandisers to begin wondering whether such color-focused shopping sprees could be predicted.Traditionally, industry experts predict fashion trends based on their own experiences and sense of style. These days, however, social media\u2019s impact on consumers\u2019 behavior comes into play, and a fashion industry revolution is underway, with help from artificial intelligence technologies.\u201cWe intend to provide a real-time estimation of fashion color trends by using big data from social media,\u201d said Gloria Yao, director of project development at the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel, who is working with a team that is developing an AI-based color-prediction model.Yao said sales prediction is very important for fashion businesses, as it makes for effective inventory management, which increases profits by reducing markdowns due to overstocking.That prompted Yao and her team to focus on hundreds of influential fashion industry accounts on Facebook, including over 500 fashion brands, 100 fashion magazines, 150 designers and 500 social media celebrities. To qualify as influential, Yao said, a brand should have at least 100,000 followers, a magazine 10,000 followers, and a designer or celebrity 1,000 followers. In addition, the accounts should be updated frequently and be able to spark community conversations.\u201cThe aim is to capture the ongoing social and cultural events from social media posts and validate their impact on consumers\u2019 color preferences,\u201d Yao said.An AI technology known as natural language processing interprets the text and images in Facebook posts and helps to identify \u201cauthentic fashion posts\u201d related to color.\u201cIf a celebrity says, \u2018I\u2019m walking on a red carpet at a film festival,\u2019 the \u2018red\u2019 here has nothing to do with fashion,\u201d Yao explained. \u201cBut if she says, \u2018I like my red-colored dress today,\u2019 then this \u2018red\u2019 is the target of our data collection.\u201dThe institute works with a well-known Hong Kong fashion brand that provides its data on sales, inventories, prices, shop locations and marketing information.The project will finish in April, when a production license will be introduced and commercialized for application in the industry.At present, Yao said, the color-prediction model fits different brands, \u201cbut with some adjustments\u201d. The reason is that different brands may target consumers with varying color preferences.\u201cAI enhancements will go beyond the traditional areas of machine tasks into creative and customer-interaction processes, blurring the line between technology and creativity,\u201d U.S. management consulting firm McKinsey & Company said in a report on fashion trends this year.Fashion is about design and the customer\u2019s emotions and mood \uff0d combining physical materials with human senses. So how can it be read by a machine?The biggest challenge facing Taobao is the sheer chaos of products that have not been properly tagged, said Jia Menglei, a senior engineer at Alibaba, with customers complaining that it\u2019s hard to find what they\u2019re looking for.Li Yuan, 26, and a keen online shopper, said: \u201cThere are just tons of items on Taobao. I often have to spend hours on it selecting what I need. Sometimes it makes me feel dizzy.\u201dJia said using a data set of fashion attributes produced by Wong\u2019s team will make tagging more exact and predictable, allowing Alibaba to \u201crebuild the world map of consumer goods\u201d.Take a sweater. It can have a puritan collar, a shirt collar, a ribbed collar \uff0d the list goes on. To train a machine to understand a sweater, you need to install a data set of images of all kinds of sweaters, tagged with their design attributes. The AI network, or a single machine trained to have predictive ability, would then recognize a specific type of sweater the next time it sees one.The data set is most important. It serves as a guideline for the machine\u2019s learning process and sets the foundation for all follow-up research.\u201cIt needs to be professional enough to meet the requirements of machine training,\u201d Wong said, including complete and precise attributes for each style that may be applied to the basic image.\u201cFor a sweater with a turtleneck, you need to give it a tag both as a sweater and a turtleneck. If it\u2019s identified sometimes as a sweater and sometimes as a turtleneck, the machine will be confused.\u201dWong said the accuracy of searches for clothing images on the internet is only about 50 percent, something he attributes to the lack of sufficient professional data.The AI system adopted by Alibaba has been trained to recognize more than 500,000 outfits.The second level of AI application in fashion is to analyze current styles, evaluate their most popular elements, provide recommendations and even predict trends.Wong said that if a machine has a data set of the latest images of outfits in the fashion world, it could calculate which elements are emerging as popular and may become the trend of the foreseeable future. Then it could offer recommendations for consumers, based on predictive analysis and individual preferences.The team expects that in the near future AI will be able to collect more data from customers, providing important information about the popularity of certain styles. The data can note the amount of time a customer spends looking at a particular piece of clothing using a \u201csmart mirror\u201d and whether they decide to buy it, along with other aspects of the fashion experience.Alibaba will combine data from Taobao with that collected in offline shops, aiming to provide an all-around data service for the industry \uff0d from fashion design and material selection to storage and logistics.AI appears set to transform the fashion industry, but is there anything a machine is not likely to master in the near future?Yes, said Wong, because, in the end, designers are irreplaceable. The core of design is the inspiration, he said, and a machine can only serve as an assistant, at best.Sylvia ChangThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

Or the maddening height of venture-backed technology hubris? Now, one of China\u2019s leading bike start-ups, Ofo, is facing serious financial problems. Its founder is on a government blacklist for unpaid bills. Millions of riders who placed deposits are demanding their money back. And the business model used by many of China\u2019s tech firms \u2014 spend furiously to acquire new users, worry about profits later \u2014 is showing its limits.The run of Ofo customers seeking refunds appears to have started last week. Doubts about the company\u2019s financial health had swirled for months. People said on social media they were unable to get refunds on deposits of $15 to $30, which they put down to rent Ofo\u2019s bumblebee-yellow bikes. (The company\u2019s Chinese nickname translates as \u201cLittle Yellow Bike.\u201d)The post touched off outrage about the apparent differences in the way the company was treating Chinese people and foreigners. It also set off a rush among other Ofo users seeking refunds.\u201cOfo\u2019s user base is large, so there is a possibility that the number of applications for deposit refunds will soar,\u201d the company said late Monday in a statement posted on Weibo. \u201cPlease be patient. We promise that deposits will be refunded according to the proper procedures. To all users, please don\u2019t worry!\u201dThe statement appears only to have made people worry more.Many customers used the Ofo app to apply for refunds and joined a queue that had climbed to nearly 12 million people by Thursday. In an email to employees on Wednesday, Ofo\u2019s founder, Dai Wei, acknowledged that the company had been under financial strain all year.Hundreds of people have also shown up at Ofo\u2019s Beijing headquarters this week. On Thursday, the company\u2019s fifth-floor office was filled with police officers and shouting customers. Two women were crying. Zhang Wei, a migrant worker, had come to the office on Monday seeking a refund and had left without it, missing a day of work in the process. Mr. Zhang, 27, showed up again Thursday morning and wound up angrily kicking an Ofo employee. After being taken to the local police station and released, he returned to the Ofo office. He finally managed to convince an employee to transfer him the amount he had put down, around $30.By then, he had spent a total of around $15 to travel to and from Ofo\u2019s offices by subway and taxi. But he said it was worth it. \u201cIt was never about the money,\u201d he said. \u201cI just needed to vent.\u201dLiu Jingyi, a student from the northern city of Xi\u2019an, had forgotten about her Ofo deposit until she saw people talking about it on Weibo last month. Ms. Liu, 23, said she was not optimistic that she would get her money back. \u201cLook at how many shared bikes there are now,\u201d she said. \u201cI always felt that these cash-burning business models would have to end sooner or later.\u201d When the history of the current go-go era in China\u2019s tech industry is written, Ofo\u2019s rise and fall may serve as a useful parable. In bike rentals, ride hailing, food delivery and more, a good business idea attracts a swarm of copycats. Cutthroat competition ensues. Many companies and investors get burned. Mr. Dai founded Ofo in 2014 while studying at Peking University. Cities like New York, London and Paris had long had programs for renting bicycles for short time periods. But those programs required riders to return the bikes to docks fixed to the ground. Ofo and another Beijing start-up, Mobike, realized that by equipping bikes with GPS and digital locks, commuters could use their phones to rent bikes, freeing them from fixed docks. That would keep bikes circulating, and available wherever people needed them.Financial pressure started building as well. As long as new riders kept signing up, cash kept flowing in the form of deposits. But it has been expensive for the companies to replace damaged stock, and to hire workers to haul bikes all day from low- to high-demand locations.Ofo\u2019s bikes still have their fans in China. Bi Wenwen, a 38-year-old entrepreneur in Shanghai, applied for a deposit refund in November. She does not expect to receive it, but she said she would still use Ofo in the meantime.\u201cIt provides a lot of convenience,\u201d Ms. Bi said.Wang Jinzhi applied for a refund from Ofo two weeks ago. But he has already lost all confidence in the sharing economy. Mr. Wang, a 28-year-old financial analyst in Beijing, lost the $500 deposit he paid a high-end car-sharing company after the company folded. He also failed to get his deposit back from Bluegogo, another bike-rental start-up.\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t have much confidence right from the beginning,\u201d Mr. Wang said, about the sharing economy. \u201cSo many similar companies fighting against one another.\u201dIn the end, he bought his own bike.Elsie Chen, Albee Zhang and Zoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}

JD.com\u2019s stock has slumped since the accusations were revealed, and Mr. Liu, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, has skipped several public engagements.\u201cAs is the case in too many sexual assault incidents, it was a complicated situation,\u201d Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, said in a statement. \u201cIt is also similar to other sexual assault cases with the suspect maintaining the sex was consensual.\u201dJD.com said in a statement that it was pleased with the decision. Jill Brisbois, Mr. Liu\u2019s lawyer, reiterated in a statement her \u201cstrong belief from the very beginning that my client is innocent,\u201d adding that \u201cMr. Liu\u2019s reputation has been damaged like anyone falsely accused of a crime\u201d because of \u201cmisinformation and speculation that has been widely circulated.\u201dWil Florin, a lawyer for the woman, said he was considering bringing a civil case, adding that prosecutors had made their decision having never met or spoken with his client. Chuck Laszewski, a spokesman for the county attorney\u2019s office, declined to comment on Mr. Florin\u2019s claim.Also present that evening was a 21-year-old woman, a Chinese student who was volunteering for the doctoral program. As she later told police, she had been invited to the dinner by another Chinese executive in the program, who asked her to sit next to Mr. Liu.She told police that she got into a car with Mr. Liu after the dinner, and he began to touch her without her consent. She asked to be taken back to her apartment, where he forced himself upon her, despite her pleas, she told police.But Ms. Brisbois, in an email, said the woman was being \u201cflirtatious\u201d in the car and agreed to the contact with Mr. Liu. Ms. Brisbois said that the woman invited Mr. Liu into her apartment building and that \u201cwhat happened in the room was entirely consensual.\u201d\u201cThe woman was an active and willing participant and at no time did she indicate in any way that she did not consent,\u201d Ms. Brisbois said. The following day, the woman sent text messages to friends saying that Mr. Liu had raped her.Police were called to the apartment by a friend and fellow student, according to the county attorney\u2019s office.Ms. Brisbois said she spoke with the woman after Mr. Liu\u2019s release, at the woman\u2019s request. Over several phone calls and texts, the woman \u201cmade repeated demands for money, and threatened to make her allegations public and to sue Richard if her demands were not met,\u201d Ms. Brisbois said.Mr. Florin, the woman\u2019s lawyer, said that a lawyer for Mr. Liu initiated contact with the woman about a settlement. Mr. Florin added that many of Ms. Brisbois\u2019 descriptions of events are \u201cdirectly contradicted by eyewitness testimony.\u201dThe Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s sex crimes unit conducted a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d into the case, the county attorney\u2019s office said, followed by a \u201cmeticulous review\u201d by four sexual assault prosecutors, a group of three men and one woman. They determined that \u201cthere were profound evidentiary problems which would have made it highly unlikely that any criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201dInvestigators reviewed surveillance video, text messages and witness statements. Among the evidence was footage from a body camera worn by an officer that recorded conversations between Mr. Liu and the woman at her apartment after police arrived.The county attorney\u2019s office declined to provide more detail, saying prosecutors \u201cdo not want to re-victimize the young woman.\u201dIn his statement on social media, Mr. Liu apologized to his wife, Zhang Zetian, and said he felt \u201cdeep regret and remorse.\u201d\u201cI will continue to try in every possible way to repair the impact on my family and to fulfill my responsibility as a husband,\u201d he said.JD.com is a proud emblem of China\u2019s rising consumer class, and a major partner to global brands, like Adidas and Samsung, that use the platform. Walmart, Google and the Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent are all JD.com shareholders. And Mr. Liu is a celebrity tycoon whose rise from humble means to internet riches is the subject of many admiring books and television programs.The company\u2019s shares have lost around 60 percent of their value since early this year as it grappled with the accusations against Mr. Liu and slowing economic growth in China.The rape allegation against Mr. Liu has weighed on JD.com in part because he has never indicated who might succeed him as chief executive. Mr. Liu controls nearly 80 percent of shareholder votes at the company, thanks to a special class of stock with 20 times the voting power of regular shares.That appears to be changing, a little. In a November conference call, Mr. Liu told analysts that he would focus more on strategy and new businesses at JD.com in the future, leaving more of the management of mature businesses to subordinates.Advertisement"}

Here are two examples:This year was the strongest for initial public offerings since 2014. (That was the year Alibaba skewed the numbers with its $25 billion I.P.O.) In all, companies raised $209 billion globally through I.P.O.s, up 6 percent from a year ago, according to Dealogic.The biggest I.P.O.s of the year happened on exchanges in Asia. SoftBank raised $21.3 billion floating shares of its mobile unit in Tokyo. China Tower raised $7.5 billion in Hong Kong, and Xiaomi also sold $5.4 billion worth of stock there.The stock markets were defined in 2018 by record highs followed by steep sell-offs. Investors piled into the biggest tech companies, pushing the market values of Amazon and Apple above $1 trillion. But soon investors were dumping tech shares, sending the Nasdaq into a bear market for the first time since the financial crisis. Companies handed back more than a $1 trillion to investors through buybacks and dividends. But markets were also whipsawed by fears of slowing global economic growth, rising interest rates and trade wars.Despite it all, Wall Street analysts predict that the S&P 500 will rise next year.But there are still reasons to be pessimistic. Here\u2019s what could spook investors next year:A lot went right for banks in 2018. They were big beneficiaries of the tax overhaul enacted at the end of 2017. The Trump administration started what may become a bonanza of deregulation for them. The economy grew. Interest rates increased, bolstering profit from lending. Over all, banks\u2019 earnings are expected to surge 34 percent in 2018. In June, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, talked about \u201ca golden age of banking.\u201d\u2022 If the Fed raises interest rates by more than expected and the economy slows, banks could be hit hard. Wall Street business would suffer, demand for loans would decline and more borrowers could default, causing losses for banks.\u2022 If the Fed manages to set rates at a level that keeps the economy growing at close to current rates, and inflation is dormant, bank earnings should hold up. But as 2018 has shown, that may not be enough for investors.The short answer: probably.

{"Headline": "4 Takeaways from Xi Jinping\u2019s Speech Defending Communist Party Control", "Date": "2018-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe meeting commemorated a Communist Party leaders\u2019 conclave in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping and other veteran revolutionaries set China toward market-friendly, pro-growth policies that would eventually transform the country into the world\u2019s biggest economy after the United States.Some economists and investors had hoped that Mr. Xi would embrace and improve on Deng\u2019s historical legacy as an economic liberalizer.Here are the key points from what he said and what they mean:Mr. Xi\u2019s speech stood out for his defense of the Communist Party as the designer and guardian of China\u2019s prosperity and stability.He has often made that case, and when his predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, spoke on the 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1978 shift, they also gave plenty of space to praising the party. Even so, Mr. Xi\u2019s comments seemed strikingly prominent, especially when many investors had hoped for a more moderate message.Summarizing what he described as the lessons from China\u2019s past four decades, Mr. Xi said, \u201cFirst, the party\u2019s leadership over all tasks must be adhered to, and the party\u2019s leadership must be incessantly strengthened and improved.\u201dIf anyone watching still expected that Mr. Xi would seek to moderate his hard-line reputation and reveal himself to be a political liberalizer, he used this meeting to send an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d The party\u2019s socialist path, doctrine and policies over the past 40 years, he said, had all been \u201ctotally correct.\u201dMr. Xi referred only obliquely to the elephant in the room: the trade war with the United States and the strain that deteriorating relations has put on China\u2019s economy.\u201cNo one is in the position to dictate to the Chinese people what should and should not be done,\u201d he said in apparent reference to demands from Washington and other capitals that China undo some of its protectionist economic policies (even as Chinese negotiators have quietly offered concessions).He reiterated China\u2019s position on subjects like Taiwan\u2019s independence, which Beijing fiercely opposes, but he emphasized that China sought to promote peace, support international development and bolster the international organizations that have helped shape and sustain today\u2019s world order.\u201cChina\u2019s development will never constitute a threat to any other country,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cNo matter what level of development China reaches, it will never seek hegemony.\u201dGiven China\u2019s embrace of market economics, China\u2019s leaders have often played down the communism part of the Communist Party. Mr. Xi made clear just how deeply committed he is to the ideology itself \u2014 adapted \u201cwith Chinese characteristics,\u201d as the phrase goes.In his remarks he exalted Marxist-Leninist principles and even quoted Friedrich Engels to make the case for promoting new forms of innovation in the 21st century.Mr. Xi\u2019s message: China\u2019s headlong plunge into capitalism over the last 40 years was not a repudiation of the Communist Party\u2019s founding ideology, but something possible only because of it.The run-up to Mr. Xi\u2019s speech aroused expectations of change, because the government had become increasingly concerned that private businesses \u2014 the engine of employment growth and innovation \u2014 have been demoralized by too much taxation, bureaucracy and barriers to bank loans.Economists and investors have criticized Mr. Xi for giving what they consider too much protection to state-owned conglomerates.But on Tuesday, those critics were probably disappointed by the absence of specifics or shifts in rhetoric.Jack Ma, the multibillionaire founder of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant, was among the 100 Chinese honored by Mr. Xi as \u201cpioneers\u201d of reform. But in his speech, Mr. Xi affirmed the party\u2019s dual approach: supporting the state sector while encouraging private entrepreneurs. And support for the state sector came first.\u201cOn the road ahead, we must unswervingly consolidate and develop the publicly owned economy,\u201d Mr. Xi said, referring to the state-run sector.China, he added, would also \u201cunswervingly encourage, support and guide the development\u201d of the private sector.BAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Sees in Brazil Continent-Size Profits and Problems", "Date": "2018-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExpansion south, into the nation where Amazon\u2019s namesake river ends, may prove a little harder.\u201cAmazon is still kind of irrelevant here,\u201d said Raul Prado, a vendor in the rural town of Guaipava, Brazil, who has relied on online retail sites to build up his business. Less than 1 percent of his sales are through Amazon.Brazil, home to more than 200 million people and the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, is in many ways an obvious target for Amazon\u2019s next major expansion. Google and Facebook have done well in Brazil, but their digital services \u2014 search, social media and advertising \u2014 do not have to overcome the hurdles of selling goods and making deliveries.As a retail behemoth wading into the market, Amazon has found itself playing catch-up with local rivals that know how to navigate Brazil\u2019s distinct challenges: a complicated tax structure, high import costs and the headache of moving goods across a continent-size country.\u201cBrazil is really kind of the natural next country in terms of sheer size,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who was the director of Amazon research at Gartner L2, a business intelligence and research company, but has since left. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity, and they are laying the groundwork for that today.\u201dNext year, he said, \u201cAmazon is going to be all about Brazil.\u201d His prediction came with a caveat: \u201cBut it\u2019s no small undertaking.\u201dAmazon has been present in Brazil\u2019s online retail market since 2012, but until recently it focused on selling books and its Kindle e-reader. A little over a year ago, Amazon made a splash when it expanded to let third-party brands sell electronics directly to consumers on its marketplace.Shares in local competitors tanked following the news, but they later rebounded when it became apparent that Amazon wasn\u2019t on the cusp of rolling out the services that have helped make it a market leader in the United States: first-party sales, by which brands supply Amazon with products and Amazon is the retailer; and its fulfillment service, which packages and ships products from the company\u2019s warehouses.\u201cAmazon arrived a little late to the game,\u201d said Marcel Motta, the Brazil director of the global research company Euromonitor International. Local, established companies, he said, \u201cknow how to get around the obstacles.\u201dMercadoLibre, for instance, the e-commerce leader that first began in Argentina and modeled itself after eBay, has been in Brazil for 19 years.\u201cWe helped build e-commerce in this region,\u201d said Cristina Farjallat, the head of MercadoLibre\u2019s third-party marketplace. \u201cWe have portfolios of sellers and portfolios of consumers that no one else has.\u201dShe said the company had lured more sellers to its site than any other online retailer by working with vendors to create the tools they need. MercadoLibre has a roster of 12 million vendors and its own fulfillment service, and is rolling out a payment service to bypass banks and credit cards.The company helped Mr. Prado, the vendor, turn a modest business venture \u2014 selling satellite antennas door-to-door in his remote village, where cellphone coverage was virtually nonexistent \u2014 into a national enterprise, with 20 employees.\u201cHonestly, I had no idea what I was doing when I started, but MercadoLibre is the first site people open when they go on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the brand name, their own payment plan, the logistics infrastructure and they even offer loans to sellers.\u201dMr. Prado, who created his company, Lojas Mineiras, in 2008, now offers his satellite and telephone products through nearly a dozen online retail sites. More than half of his sales are made through MercadoLibre.That doesn\u2019t mean it will stay that way.This year, Amazon broadened its catalog of products, offering sporting goods, fashion and home accessories, and signed up some major brands \u2014 but all remain independently sold and delivered.As of November, Amazon had just under 1 percent of the market share in Brazil, and was ranked 10th behind online retailers that offer both first- and third-party sales, according to Euromonitor\u2019s research. MercadoLibre had 19 percent of the market share.Experts say the window for Amazon to establish itself as a major player in Brazil is closing, which is why they expect the company to make a significant push in the next year. The question is whether it\u2019s too late.Mr. Smith said he had heard from industry sources, including investors, that Amazon had acquired a lease on a large warehouse outside S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s biggest city; advertised more than 100 jobs, many of them high level; and started negotiations to sell American brands on its Brazilian site. Amazon declined to comment.\u201cJeff Bezos has always harped on the idea that as Amazon saturates the U.S. market, he can go to emerging markets around the globe,\u201d Mr. Smith said, referring to the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s coming. Amazon wants to have boots on the ground in Brazil.\u201dAmazon appears to be moving cautiously in Brazil: It has not had a new platform up and working in the country in time for the Christmas shopping season.\u201cAmazon wants all the pieces of its ecosystem in place first,\u201d Mr. Smith said.One of the major pieces is transportation. Brazil is larger than the continental United States, but its roads are poorly maintained and often flood during rainy season, and the state postal service is widely seen as inefficient and unreliable.Magazine Luiza, one of Brazil\u2019s top e-commerce companies, which began as a mom-and-pop store selling televisions, has said it had overcome these problems by leveraging its pre-existing and growing presence: It has 900 stores across the country.Those stores, which now sell appliances, electronics and furniture to working-class Brazilians, are being converted into mini-distribution centers for Magazine Luiza, and help educate shoppers about the ease of online retail.\u201cPhysical stores are a fundamental part of our platform. We have succeeded in cutting delivery time and price,\u201d said Eduardo Galanternick, the executive director of e-commerce at Magazine Luiza. \u201cWhen you go deep into the interior of Brazil, Magazine Luiza is often the only department store around.\u201dFor example, thousands of rural families use the Magazine Luiza store in Graja\u00fa, a city in northern Brazil\u2019s soybean country, to order appliances and pick up online orders like diapers and brand-name cosmetics.In addition to difficult competitors and terrain, Amazon will face thickets of regulation. Brazil\u2019s convoluted tax structure can make delivering goods across state borders a costly affair, while high import tariffs have priced many foreign-made goods out of reach for all but the wealthiest Brazilians.Nonetheless, the potential for growth \u2014 Brazil represents just 1.1 percent of global sales in online retail \u2014 is expected to attract major investments from Amazon and other companies.Euromonitor forecasts that the Brazilian market will nearly double over the next five years to $35 billion, and some competitors will be squeezed out as obstacles to online retail are eliminated.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of Amazon conforming to our market,\u201d Mr. Prado said. \u201cRight now, they can\u2019t compete. But you never know. I\u2019ll keep offering my products on Amazon, just in case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Is Said to File for an I.P.O. as It Races Lyft to a Public Debut", "Date": "2018-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber confidentially filed paperwork on Thursday to go public, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, officially moving toward what is expected to be one of the biggest and most anticipated tech company stock market debuts ever.Uber and Lyft are expected to presage a wave of I.P.O.s by other tech start-ups, many of which have delayed going public for years because of the plentiful availability of private capital. But as these companies mature and their early investors push to cash out their stakes, many are readying for their stock market debuts.\u201cIt is like the graduation. The adolescents have become adults,\u201d said Mamoon Hamid, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. \u201cThe longest bull run in history is now culminating with a whole slew of I.P.O.s.\u201d He added, \u201cUber is in the same ballpark as Facebook and Google.\u201dMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have submitted proposals to take Uber public. Lyft, which was last valued by private market investors at $15 billion, recently picked JPMorgan Chase to lead its I.P.O.Ride-hailing \u2014 where people hail rides through their smartphone and drivers with their own cars supply the rides \u2014 is an inherently expensive business because the company has to pay to recruit drivers, expand in new markets and beat back rivals.Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has focused on paring back the unprofitable segments of the company\u2019s business. He has sold off its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, where it faced heavy competition from local rivals, while expanding into potential new businesses like food delivery and bike and scooter rentals.\u201cRevenue growth is significantly more important than worrying about the bottom line at this point,\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who advises on I.P.O.s.Uber began as a ride-hailing service for upscale clientele in 2009, the pipe dream of Garrett Camp, an entrepreneur who eventually tapped a friend, Travis Kalanick, to run the company. They quickly pushed the service into numerous cities with little regard for local laws, causing tension with established taxi companies, lawmakers and regulators.As competitors like Lyft appeared, both rushed to compete for smaller fares. The rivals have since spent billions of dollars on fare subsidies to attract people to their platforms.Passengers loved Uber\u2019s convenience and embraced it in cities such as San Francisco, New York and London. Uber now operates in more than 600 cities across 63 countries, providing more than 15 million trips a day.Venture capitalists and other investors, seizing on Uber\u2019s rapid growth, shoveled billions of dollars into the company to help it dominate. The company\u2019s investors include the venture capital firm Benchmark, First Round Capital, TPG, SoftBank, Toyota and Fidelity Investments. Many of them are set to reap big returns from an I.P.O.\u201cUber\u2019s stock is widely distributed, and it will transform the lives of many thousands of families who have worked hard for this outcome,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a venture capitalist who invested in Uber when it was a young company. Many Uber employees will go on to start other companies, he said. \u201cThis \u2018virtuous cycle\u2019 is still a big part of what makes the Valley great,\u201d he added.Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed Uber\u2019s chief executive a few months later. He has vowed to improve the company\u2019s culture and mend broken relationships with regulators, lawmakers and others.Uber\u2019s backers are eager to put last year\u2019s troubles behind them. \u201cI know Dara has the full trust of investors and employees, and we are confident he knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Chris Sacca, an early investor in the company.\u201cWe\u2019re not done by any means, but if you look at where we were one year ago, we were dealing with fundamental issues of governance, of board alignment, of these continuing battles amongst power-brokers on our board and whether or not we were going to have SoftBank with us or against us,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. \u201cThose were very important issues to deal with and to resolve, and I think we resolved them quite effectively in a positive way.\u201dMike Isaac and Erin Griffith reported from San Francisco and Kate Conger from Vancouver, British Columbia.Advertisement"}

A day after stocks rallied after the announcement of a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, they bombed again: The S&P 500 lost more than 3 percent on Tuesday. But don\u2019t believe anyone who points to a single reason for the rout.Among the revelations in the document:\u2022 Mr. Moonves \u201cengaged in multiple acts of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct in and outside of the workplace, both before and after he came to CBS in 1995.\u201d Some of those allegations had not been previously disclosed.\u2022 Lawyers involved in the inquiry spoke with Mr. Moonves four times and found him to be \u201cevasive and untruthful at times, and to have deliberately lied about and minimized the extent of his sexual misconduct.\u201d\u2022 Investigators determined that Mr. Moonves had \u201creceived oral sex from at least 4 CBS employees under circumstances that sound transactional and improper to the extent that there was no hint of any relationship, romance or reciprocity.\u201dMany of the company\u2019s employees, including high-ranking executives and even members of its board, were aware of the former chief executive Leslie Moonves\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct and subsequent efforts to conceal it. Yet no one acted to stop him \u2014 and the repercussions for that failure are likely to reverberate at CBS for years.President Trump repeatedly accused Amazon in the spring of engaging in a \u201cscam\u201d against the United States Postal Service. On Tuesday, his administration delivered its verdict: not really.Commercial package delivery is not profitable enough to offset the revenue losses the Postal Service is suffering, however, as Americans mail fewer and fewer first-class letters.It\u2019s been two weeks since Mr. Ghosn, who led an alliance comprising Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, was arrested in Japan, and there hasn\u2019t been much clarity on how he might have sneaked $70 million of salary and benefits past the company that pays him, as he is suspected of doing.What is certain is that Nissan Motor Co.\u2019s own corporate governance rules gave unusual powers to its former chairman, a business celebrity who was given extraordinary deference for having once rescued the automaker from financial ruin. Those powers included near-total say over how much \u2014 and how \u2014 he was paid, according to Nissan\u2019s own internal rules.Several people familiar with the prosecutors\u2019 investigation now say the probe appears to hinge on a relatively arcane point of accounting \u2014 whether retirement payments were properly booked.The Bloomberg report also points to questionable governance at Nissan, with a concentration of power at the top and independent board members, including an \u201cex-race-car driver and former model,\u201d who may not have been qualified to ask searching questions of the leadership team.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Homegrown Chips Threaten Silicon Valley Giant Intel", "Date": "2018-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips.Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world.Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker.Intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends, from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence, as influence over chip designs has been shifting to Amazon, Apple and Google, which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry.The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn\u2019t had much competition in the server market in recent years. The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options.Intel acknowledges that companies like Amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier. \u201cI am not unaware of the dynamic,\u201d Lisa Spelman, an Intel vice president, said. \u201cOur goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire.\u201dAbout 35 percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about 10 companies, including large internet companies like Amazon and a handful of telecommunication firms, said Shane Rau, a chip analyst with the research firm IDC. That just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for Intel.\u201cEach one of these companies is so large, they represent a market unto themselves,\u201d Mr. Rau said.Apple beat the other tech giants to this cost-saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom-built chip for the iPhone. Google and Microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.Amazon has upped the ante. In 2015, it spent a reported $350 million to acquire a chip maker, Annapurna Labs, which helped build the new central processing unit, or C.P.U.A C.P.U. \u2014 the centerpiece of a computer\u2019s operations \u2014 is the sort of chip that Intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers. Building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. It is a big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks.\u201cThe belief was that you needed some magic to build a processor, particularly a server processor,\u201d said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the chip start-up Cerebras and a former executive at the chip maker AMD. \u201cYou had to be Intel or AMD \u2014 and that was about it.\u201dAmazon executives believe the chip, which was designed to be more energy efficient, will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers. It said it was offering a cloud-computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip. The cost of the service could be 45 percent lower than other options.And when Amazon buys chips from other companies, a homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices. \u201cThey can now say to Intel, \u2018We will just move the workloads to other chips,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feldman said.Though it is still enormously difficult, building a chip is easier than it used to be. Amazon licensed much of the technology from ARM, the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips. It made the chip through TSMC, a Taiwanese company.For Intel, Amazon\u2019s move into C.P.U.s is a strike at a longtime strength. Intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market a decade ago, a significant missed opportunity. The tech industry shifted, and Intel didn\u2019t shift with it.But Intel has a 96.6 percent share of server chip sales, according to IDC. It was 98.6 percent until its longtime competitor, AMD, which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about a decade, recently re-entered the market.Intel\u2019s profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry. But the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker\u2019s dependence on servers. Intel\u2019s data center group, which sells both server and A.I. chips, pulled in $6.1 billion, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The group now accounts for more than 30 percent of Intel\u2019s revenue.As the chip market has changed, Intel has tried to diversify. In recent years, it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones, cars and data centers.Through their fast-growing cloud computing services, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks. Going to a cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back-room computer systems \u2014 the tech experts do it for them.It is a lucrative business. Amazon Web Services brings in nearly $27 billion a year, and it accounts for 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s profits.Inside these cloud operations, the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built. They are designing much of their own hardware, from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers. Facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers.Amazon\u2019s new chip is running only a small fraction of the software across the company\u2019s online empire. But that is expected to expand.\u201cWe will look back at this as a watershed moment,\u201d said Mr. Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras.Advertisement"}

But the excitement may be cooling as the year ends, thanks to tougher regulation and a slowing economy. A shakeout could easily follow.It has been a blowout 2018. For the first half of the year, a study released this week by the data provider Preqin and Insead business school suggests that China beat the $42 billion raised in the United States by some way. That\u2019s largely thanks to a huge funding round for Alibaba\u2019s financial affiliate, Ant Financial, as well as some other chunky efforts. But it\u2019s a high-water mark regardless. As is, perhaps, SoftBank\u2019s mooted move to place a team in China to help spend its giant Vision Fund, after years of investing remotely.The coming months look less exuberant. The likes of SoftBank and Singapore\u2019s Temasek still have plenty of money to plow into splashy names like the news and video-sharing app ByteDance. Others are less enthusiastic, if figures for China-focused venture funds are anything to go by. In the 11 months to mid-November, around 70 such funds raised just over $15 billion, Preqin estimates; that compares to $40 billion or so raised by 330 funds in all of 2016.All of this suggests increased nerves. The vast majority of Chinese unicorns that listed this year, including the takeaways-to-taxis app Meituan Dianping and the smartphone-maker Xiaomi, are now underwater. Just a small fraction of those $1 billion-plus companies, including video-streaming companies Huya, Bilibili and iQiyi, have risen above their initial public offering prices. Rocky starts like that of the Alibaba-backed parenting site Babytree, which debuted last month at a valuation below its last funding round, won\u2019t help.What most of this year\u2019s debutantes have in common is that they bet on local consumers, one way or another. But those shoppers look more fretful. Changes to rules on education, fintech and gaming have only added to the strain. Weaker companies may fall by the wayside.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Race Is On to Protect Data From the Next Leap in Computers. And China Has the Lead.", "Date": "2018-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The world\u2019s leading technology companies, from Google to Alibaba in China, are racing to build the first quantum computer, a machine that would be far more powerful than today\u2019s computers.This device could break the encryption that protects digital information, putting at risk everything from the billions of dollars spent on e-commerce to national secrets stored in government databases.An answer? Encryption that relies on the same concepts from the world of physics. Just as some scientists are working on quantum computers, others are working on quantum security techniques that could thwart the code-breaking abilities of these machines of the future.\u201cChina has a very deliberate strategy to own this technology,\u201d said Duncan Earl, a former researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who is president and chief technology officer of Qubitekk, a company that is exploring quantum encryption. \u201cIf we think we can wait five or 10 years before jumping on this technology, it is going to be too late.\u201dWith traditional computers, transistors store \u201cbits\u201d of information, and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. Those are the fundamental slices of data that tell a computer what to do.When some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold, they behave differently. That difference allows a quantum bit, or qubit, to store a combination of 1 and 0. Two qubits can hold four values at once. As the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.There is no guarantee that a viable quantum encryption network could be built over long distances. But if it does happen, China\u2019s willingness to experiment and put government, academic and commercial resources behind the effort could have a big payoff.The country has invested tens of millions of dollars building networks that can transmit data using quantum encryption. Last year, a Chinese satellite named Micius, after an ancient philosopher, managed a video call between Beijing and Vienna using quantum encryption. A dedicated quantum communication network between Beijing and Shanghai was also put into operation last year, after four years of planning and construction.For now, quantum encryption works only over a limited distance. The satellite link between Beijing and Vienna stretched this limit to a record 4,630 miles. On the ground, using optical fiber lines, the ceiling is about 150 miles.Among China\u2019s investments in quantum encryption, the Micius satellite has received the most attention. The University of Science and Technology of China, the government-backed university that helped launch Micius, led the construction of the ground network, which spans about 1,200 miles \u2014 perhaps a hint of aspirations for drastic improvement.The governments of Anhui and Shandong Provinces, through which the fiber-optic network passes, together invested $80 million in the project. Like all major infrastructure projects in China, the plans have had high-level support from the Chinese government.This main line is being extended to other cities and regions. The goal by 2030 is a Chinese-built network for sharing quantum encryption keys across the globe.Some security experts question the effectiveness of quantum encryption. Because it is so new, it has not been put through anywhere close to the rigorous testing that would give it a stamp of approval from skeptical cryptographers.But Chao-Yang Lu, a professor of physics at the University of Science and Technology of China, said the Beijing-Shanghai quantum network was a significant upgrade.With communications sent by traditional means, eavesdroppers can intercept the data stream at every point along a fiber-optic line. A government could tap that line just about anywhere. Quantum encryption cut the number of vulnerable spots in the Beijing-Shanghai line to just a few dozen across 1,200 miles, Professor Lu said.\u201cWe admit that it\u2019s an intermediate solution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the final solution. But it\u2019s already a huge improvement in terms of security.\u201dIn the United States, the government and industry have viewed quantum encryption as little more than a science experiment. Instead, researchers have focused on using ordinary mathematics to build new forms of encryption that can stand up to a quantum computer. This technology would not require new infrastructure.But now, spurred by activity in China and recent advances in quantum research, some in the United States are playing catch-up.Qubitekk, a Southern California start-up, is working to secure power grids in Tennessee using the technology. A second start-up, Quantum Xchange, is building a quantum encryption network in the Northeast, hoping to serve Wall Street banks and other businesses. Researchers at Stony Brook University on Long Island are preparing a third venture.Small start-ups like Qubitekk are unlikely to match the millions of dollars in infrastructure already created in China for quantum encryption. But many experts believe the more important work will happen in research labs, and the Department of Energy is funding a test network in Chicago that could eclipse the kind of systems deployed in China.The Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories are working with Qubitekk to secure power grids with quantum technology, and Quantum Xchange is moving equipment into 60 Hudson Street, the old Western Union telegraph hub, which now serves as an internet hub for Lower Manhattan.Quantum Xchange is building a quantum encryption link between Manhattan and Newark, with plans to connect big banks operating in the two cities. Eventually, it hopes to extend this network up and down the East Coast.At places like the University of Chicago, researchers hope to go a step further, exploring what are called quantum repeaters \u2014 devices that could extend the range of quantum encryption.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d said David Awschalom, a professor at the University of Chicago who oversees much of the university\u2019s quantum research. \u201cBut I am confident this will happen in the next couple of years.\u201dQuantum communication techniques require new hardware. This includes vast networks of fiber lines \u2014 and perhaps satellites \u2014 as well as specialized devices capable of detecting individual photons of light.As Qubitekk worked on quantum encryption networks, it could not obtain the special light detectors it needed to do the work. The start-up originally bought detectors from a small manufacturer in New Jersey, Princeton Lightwave. But in April, this lone American manufacturer handed the detector business over to a company in China, RMY, and Qubitekk\u2019s supply line ran dry.RMY has promised hardware to Qubitekk but recently told it that, because of production issues, additional detectors won\u2019t be available until March.Small companies in Europe are selling somewhat similar detectors, and labs across the globe are developing a more advanced type of hardware. But for now, supplies, particularly in the United States, are slim.Cade Metz reported from San Francisco, and Raymond Zhong from Beijing.Advertisement"}
